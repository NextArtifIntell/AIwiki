  abstract     = {Continuous product individualization and customization led to the advent of lot size one in production and ultimately to product-inherent uniqueness. As complexities in individualization and processes grow, production systems need to adapt to unique, product-inherent constraints by advancing production control beyond predictive, rigid schedules. While complex processes, production systems and production constraints are not a novelty per se, modern production control approaches fall short of simultaneously regarding the flexibility of complex job shops and product unique constraints imposed on production control. To close this gap, this paper develops a novel, data driven, artificial intelligence based production control approach for complex job shops. For this purpose, product-inherent constraints are resolved by restricting the solution space of the production control according to a prediction based decision model. The approach validation is performed in a real semiconductor fab as a job shop that includes transitional time constraints as product-inherent constraints. Not violating these time constraints is essential to avoid scrap and similarly increase quality-based yield. To that end, transition times are forecasted and the adherence to these product-inherent constraints is evaluated based on one-sided prediction intervals and point estimators. The inclusion of product-inherent constraints leads to significant adherence improvements in the production system as indicated in the real-world semiconductor manufacturing case study and, hence, contributes a novel, data driven approach for production control. As a conclusion, the ability to avoid a large majority of violations of time constraints shows the approaches effectiveness and the future requirement to more accurately integrate such product-inherent constraints into production control.},

Industrial robots autonomously planning and completing upcoming production tasks can help companies address these challenges. In this publication, we focus on autonomous task planning within industrial robotics and investigate how to facilitate the use of automated planning techniques from the field of artificial intelligence for this purpose. First, we present a novel methodology to automatically adapt abstractly modeled planning domains to the characteristics of individual application cases a user intends to implement. A planning domain is a formalized representation of the robot’s working environment that builds the basis for automated planning. Second, we integrate this approach into the procedure for developing skills-based industrial robotic applications to enable them to perform autonomous task planning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the methodology within the application field kitting in two reference scenarios with a mobile robot and a stationary robot cell. Using our methodology, persons without expertise in automated planning can enable a robot for autonomous task planning without much extra effort.},

  abstract     = {The application of reinforcement learning in mobile robotics faces the challenges of real-world physical environments, in contrast to playground setups like video games. In a mobile robot motion control, it is not always possible to perform episodes of pre-training in large amounts due to time, resource limitations or other concerns. Control methods that rely on a prior explicit map may be impractical or even impossible to use for new dynamic environments. In this paper, we present a method of local navigation approach for driving a robot to a desired position without relying on an explicit map of the environment. Only the laser scan measurements were used to determine the obstacles. We focus in this work on online methods of reinforcement learning which do not require running the robot in full episodes until success or failure. However, the price for such an online capability is that some model knowledge about the environment has to be utilized. Here, we propose an algorithm called stacked Q-learning, which unifies aspects of standard reinforcement learning techniques with model-based predictive agents. We compare this algorithm to a classical model predictive controller. The comparison focuses on the accumulated cost of parking the robot avoiding obstacles. The results look promising as the stacked Q-learning beat its counterpart, model predictive control, yet being of the same computational complexity. The suggested agent design of stacked Q-learning can thus be taken as a foundation for a class of predictive reinforcement learning methods.},

The algorithm is explicitly tailored to address the challenges conventional image recognition methods face when identifying the unique wear patterns of elastic matrix abrasive tools. The proposed HPO-optimized Otsu algorithm was validated through machining experiments on silicon carbide workpieces, demonstrating superior performance in wear identification, image segmentation, and operational efficiency when compared to both the conventional 2-Dimensional (2D) Otsu algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm (GA)-optimized Otsu algorithm. Notably, the proposed algorithm reduced the average runtime by 36.99% and 28.39%, and decreased the mean squared error by 24.78% and 20.52%, compared to the 2D Otsu and GA-optimized Otsu algorithms, respectively. Additionally, this study investigates the influence of elastic tool wear on abrasive machining performance, offering valuable insights for assessing tool status and life expectancy, and predicting machining quality. The high level of automation, accuracy, and fast execution speed of the proposed algorithm makes it an attractive option for wear identification, with potential applications extending beyond the manufacturing industry to any sector that requires automated image analysis.

However, the widespread industrial adoption of metal matrix composite (MMC) fabricated by LMI is still hampered by repeatability and reliability compared to monolithic alloys. This study presents promising results that aim to bridge the knowledge gap by determining a novel method to correlate visual and infrared images with the quality of MMC. A CNN architecture-based hybrid fusion model integrating molten pool and spatter features is proposed based on process understanding for quality monitoring of MMCs fabricated by LMI. The laser energy density and powder feed rate are intentionally tuned to fabricate WC reinforced MMC with four different ceramic particle states. Five models are established based on the single-sensor data, data-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and multi-level hybrid fusion respectively and compared in quality identification performance by four quantitative metrics and two visualization models. The results show that the three multi-sensor fusion models can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared to the single sensor-based model. Compared with data-level fusion and feature-level fusion, the proposed multi-level hybrid fusion model can integrate the advantages of the two fusion models and exhibits the best classification performance by multiple feature extraction channels with complementary and redundant data. The InceptionV3-based hybrid fusion model achieves the highest overall accuracy of 97.44% among the four state-of-the-art CNN architectures.},

  abstract     = {In quest of improving the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing processes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used extensively for response prediction, model dimensionality reduction, process optimization, and monitoring. Though having superior accuracy, AI predictions are unintelligible to the end users and stakeholders due to their opaqueness. Thus, building interpretable and inclusive machine learning (ML) models is a vital part of the smart manufacturing paradigm to establish traceability and repeatability. The study addresses this fundamental limitation of AI-driven manufacturing processes by introducing a novel Explainable AI (XAI) approach to develop interpretable processes and product fingerprints. Here the explainability is implemented in two stages: by developing interpretable representations for the fingerprints, and by posthoc explanations. Also, for the first time, the concept of process fingerprints is extended to develop an interpretable probabilistic model for bottleneck events during manufacturing processes. The approach is demonstrated using two datasets: nanosecond pulsed laser ablation to produce superhydrophobic surfaces and wire EDM real-time monitoring dataset during the machining of Inconel 718. The fingerprint identification is performed using a global Lipschitz functions optimization tool (MaxLIPO) and a stacked ensemble model is used for response prediction. The proposed interpretable fingerprint approach is robust to change in processes and can responsively handle both continuous and categorical responses alike. Implementation of XAI not only provided useful insights into the process physics but also revealed the decision-making logic for local predictions.},

This work combines neural networks and physical simulation models in the understanding of laser drilling of composite materials. Neural networks are used to predict SiC/SiC composites laser drilling results by using processing parameters (average power, scanning speed, and filling spacing) as input parameters, optimal combinations of processing parameters based on the neural network are identified, and the effectiveness of the learned knowledge is validated using a physical simulation model. The results show that the neural network can identify the nonlinear effect of processing parameters on machining quality with the MAE of 0.054 and the RMSE of 0.067. The physical simulation model could explain why this nonlinear effect exists. This method can be applied to a wide range of fields.

  abstract     = {In today’s rapidly changing production landscape with increasingly complex manufacturing processes and shortening product life cycles, a company’s competitiveness depends on its ability to design flexible and resilient production processes. On the shop-floor, in particular, the production control plays a crucial role in coping with disruptions and maintaining system stability and resilience. To address challenges arising from volatile sales markets or other factors, deep learning algorithms have been increasingly applied in production to facilitate fast-paced operations. In particular deep reinforcement learning frequently surpassed conventional and intelligent approaches in terms of performance and computational efficiency and revealed high levels of control adaptability. However, existing approaches were often limited in scope and scenario-specific, which hinders a seamless transition to other control optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework that integrates a deep learning based hyper-heuristic into modular production to optimize pre-defined performance indicators. The framework deploys a module recognition and agent experience sharing, enabling a fast initiation of multi-level production systems as well as resilient control strategies. To minimize computational and re-training efforts, a stack of trained policies is utilized to facilitate an efficient reuse of previously trained agents. Benchmark results reveal that our approach outperforms conventional rules in terms of multi-objective optimization.

To achieve that it is crucial to find out the optimum recipe or processing conditions that can generate the ideal combination of these properties. Most of the time, a sufficient number of experiments are needed to generate a Pareto front. However, manufacturing experiments are usually costly and even conducting a single experiment can be a time-consuming process. So, it&#39;s critical to determine the optimal location for data collection to gain the most comprehensive understanding of the process. Sequential learning is a promising approach to actively learn from the ongoing experiments, iteratively update the underlying optimization routine, and adapt the data collection process on the go. This paper presents a novel data-driven Bayesian optimization framework that utilizes sequential learning to efficiently optimize complex systems with multiple conflicting objectives. Additionally, this paper proposes a novel metric for evaluating multi-objective data-driven optimization approaches. This metric considers both the quality of the Pareto front and the amount of data used to generate it. The proposed framework is particularly beneficial in practical applications where acquiring data can be expensive and resource intensive. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and metric, the algorithm is evaluated on a manufacturing dataset. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the actual Pareto front while processing significantly less data. Our data-driven framework can facilitate more efficient manufacturing choices, which not only minimizes resource usage but also promotes reduced energy consumption and thereby aids in pollution prevention.},

However, recently developed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques that estimate feature contributions on a model-agnostic level such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have not yet been evaluated for semi-supervised fault diagnosis and prognosis problems characterized by class imbalance and weakly labeled datasets. This paper explores the potential of utilizing Shapley values for a new clustering framework compatible with semi-supervised learning problems, loosening the strict supervision requirement of current XAI techniques. This broad methodology is validated on two case studies: a heatmap image dataset obtained from a semiconductor manufacturing process featuring class imbalance, and the benchmark N-CMAPSS dataset. Semi-supervised clustering based on Shapley values significantly improves upon clustering quality compared to the fully unsupervised case, deriving information-dense and meaningful clusters that relate to underlying fault diagnosis model predictions. These clusters can also be characterized by high-precision decision rules in terms of original feature values, as demonstrated in the second case study. The rules, limited to 2 terms utilizing original feature scales, describe 14 out of the 19 derived equipment failure clusters with average precision exceeding 0.85, showcasing the promising utility of the explainable clustering framework for intelligent manufacturing applications.},

The FDPM combines the static and dynamic features of the machines to generate simulated outputs, including average cutting force, material removal rate, and peripheral milling machine torque. These outputs are correlated with real blade wear measurements, creating a simulation model that provides insights into predicting the wear progression in the machine when associated with real machine operational parameters. The FDPM also considers data preprocessing, reducing the dimensional space to an advanced recurrent neural network prediction algorithm for forecasting blade wear levels in milling. The validation of the physics-based simulation model indicates the highest fidelity in replicating wear progression with the average cutting force variable, demonstrating an average relative error of 2.38% when compared to the measured mean of rake wear during the milling cycle. These findings illustrate the effectiveness of the FDPM approach, showcasing an impressive prediction accuracy exceeding 93% when the model is trained with only 50% of the available data. These results highlight the potential of the FDPM model as a robust and versatile method for assessing wear levels in milling operations precisely, without disrupting ongoing production.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the future of industries by introducing new paradigms. To address data privacy and other challenges of decentralization, research has focused on Federated Learning (FL), which combines distributed Machine Learning (ML) models from multiple parties without exchanging confidential information. However, conventional FL methods struggle to handle situations where data samples have diverse features and sizes. We propose a Hybrid Federated Learning solution with label synchronization to overcome this challenge. Our FedLabSync algorithm trains a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network while alerts that it can aggregate knowledge of other ML architectures compatible with the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm by conducting a penalized collaborative optimization. We conducted two industrial case studies: product inspection in Bosch factories and aircraft component Remaining Useful Life predictions. Our experiments on decentralized data scenarios demonstrate that FedLabSync can produce a global AI model that achieves results on par with those of centralized learning methods.},

In recent years, the use of machine learning techniques in the field of production planning and control has unlocked new opportunities, in both academia and industry practice. In fact, with the increased availability of data across various levels of manufacturing companies, machine learning techniques offer the opportunity to gain valuable and accurate insights about production processes. However, machine learning-based approaches for the prediction of delivery dates have not received sufficient attention. Thus, this study aims to investigate the ability of machine learning to predict delivery dates early in the ordering process, and what type of information is required to obtain accurate predictions.

  abstract     = {Manufacturing systems are undergoing systematic change facing the trade-off between the customer&#39;s needs and the economic and ecological pressure. Especially assembly systems must be more flexible due to many product generations or unpredictable material and demand fluctuations. As a solution line-less mobile assembly systems implement flexible job routes through movable multi-purpose resources and flexible transportation systems. Moreover, a completely reactive rearrangeable layout with mobile resources enables reconfigurations without interrupting production. A scheduling that can handle the complexity of dynamic events is necessary to plan job routes and control transportation in such an assembly system. Conventional approaches for this control task require exponentially rising computational capacities with increasing problem sizes. Therefore, the contribution of this work is an algorithm to dynamically solve the integrated problem of layout optimization and scheduling in line-less mobile assembly systems. The proposed multi agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm uses proximal policy optimization and consists of a decoder and encoder, allowing for various-sized system state descriptions. A simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm performs better in 78% of the scenarios compared to a random agent regarding the makespan optimization objective. This allows for adaptive optimization of line-less mobile assembly systems that can face global challenges.},

  abstract     = {Cloud manufacturing is a manufacturing paradigm that integrates wide-area distributed manufacturing resources for distributed services over the Internet. Scheduling is a critical technique that determines the overall performance of a cloud manufacturing system. Robots are an important type of manufacturing resource in cloud manufacturing. Scheduling of robot production services is therefore an important research issue in cloud manufacturing. In cloud manufacturing, services can be selected at an enterprise level or a service level, which represents two types of ways of scheduling. Which way is better and how to select the optimal robot production services are issues that have rarely been considered. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to solving various scheduling problems from different fields. Given this, this paper investigates enterprise and service-level scheduling of robot production services in cloud manufacturing and explores the optimal ways and methods of scheduling with DRL. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and its three modified algorithms, including Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and Average-DQN based on scheduling approaches are proposed. Effects of enterprise- and service-level robot production services selection methods in cloud manufacturing are studied. Comparative results indicate that overall the service-level selection method outperforms the enterprise-level method. The performance of the above-mentioned scheduling algorithms is further studied with the service-level selection method. Results indicate that the Average-DQN-based approach is able to generate scheduling solutions more efficiently and performs the best with respect to each metric.},

This paper proposes a novel method that employs deep reinforcement learning to address the dynamic scheduling of energy-efficient AGVs with battery replacement in production logistics systems. The bi-objective joint optimization problem of AGV scheduling and battery replacement management is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, which supports data-driven decision-making. Then, this paper constructs a deep reinforcement learning-based optimization architecture and develops a novel dueling deep double Q network algorithm to maximize the long-term rewards for optimizing material handling’s tardiness and energy consumption. Numerical experiments and a case study demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and cleaner than state-of-the-art methods.

However, the tender process in selecting a TPL service provider can be challenging, requiring significant effort from both the tendering company and the service provider. The latter must meticulously plan processes and calculate pricing positions while running the risk of losing the bid. This risk impedes verifying logistical feasibility and comparing different logistic concepts extensively, such as layouts, which are often work-intensive. With the ongoing progress of research toward automatic simulation model generation for material flow, it is left to answer whether such approaches can improve the planning processes of TPL service providers by using planning data to generate simulation models. Therefore, this work presents a system with an underlying ontology to generate material flow simulations by developing a model transformation methodology. The system’s functions are tested to determine whether they can support the planning process using defined case studies that cover everyday planning decisions. As a result, the system is capable of verifying the performance of planned logistic systems with minimal manual modelling efforts. This encompasses the evaluation of alternative logistical concepts for configuring the planned systems.},

Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, a discrete cuckoo search particle swarm optimization (DCSPSO) algorithm is developed. In the proposed algorithm, a particle position is updated by crossover and mutation operators in the discrete domain and discrete Levy flight is used to improve the solution quality further. Numerical experiments are conducted on the designed instances. The results indicate that the DCSPSO algorithm outperforms the exact method and the other three meta-heuristic algorithms.

  abstract     = {The world is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA). In such an environment, the viability in terms of digitalization, resilience, and sustainability capabilities has gained worldwide attention in supply chain management. Therefore, it is crucial to give special consideration to these paradigms when selecting suppliers. Moreover, the availability of data in digital supply chain systems can aid in supplier selection by using Artificial Intelligence techniques to identify viable suppliers. This approach can streamline the supplier selection process and lead to more efficient and effective manufacturing operations. Thus, it is necessary to have a big data analytics infrastructure in today’s data-driven world. In this context, this paper aims to design a multi-agent system that belongs to the theory of Distributed Artificial Intelligence based on big data analytics to give a strong tool for finding the best viable suppliers based on a thorough and data-driven evaluation. To do so, designing a multi-agent-based big data analytics system model necessitates identifying the multiple criteria needed for selecting viable suppliers in real-time decision-making. To this end, through a literature review, this paper analyzes more than 140 publications and identifies the main criteria needed for viable suppliers’ selection in the VUCA world. Therefore, the proposed system can be used as an intelligent viable supplier selection that improves the quality of the process and controls it while considering different capabilities. It presents a comprehensive model for viable supplier selection, consisting of four main layers: decision-making system, data resources, supplier selection, and big data analytics. The model incorporates six types of agents: Suppliers agent, Resource Agent, Knowledge Management Agent, Pilot Agent, Analyst Agent, and Decision-Making Agent. The integration of these layers and agents enables real-time data-driven decision-making, contributing to the selection of viable suppliers in a volatile and uncertain environment. The proposed model enhances supply chain performance in the digital era, offering a robust tool for both academics and practitioners to improve the quality of supplier selection.},

  abstract     = {The development of artificial intelligence models for data driven decision making has a lot of potential for the manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, applications in industry are currently limited to the actionable insights one can discover from the available data and knowledge of a manufacturing system. We call the process to obtain such insights “ad hoc analysis”. Ad hoc analysis at system level is very complex in an industrial setting due to the inherent heterogeneity of data and existence of data silos, the lack of information and knowledge formalization, and the inability to meaningfully and efficiently reason about the data, information and knowledge. In this paper, we provide and outline a framework for ad hoc analysis in manufacturing based on knowledge graphs and influenced by the metamodelling paradigm. We derive its requirements and key elements from an analysis of several industry application cases. We show how manufacturing data, information and knowledge can be combined and made actionable using this framework. The framework supports workflows and tools for the data consumer (i.e., data scientist), and for the knowledge engineer. Furthermore, we show how the framework is integrated with existing data sources. Then, we discuss how we applied the framework to several application cases. We discuss how the framework contributes when applied, and what challenges still remain.},

  abstract     = {Molds are assembled manually due to a shortage of skilled workers and challenges associated with automating operations, which arise from the low-volume, high-variety characteristics of mold production. This study proposed a human–robot collaborative mold assembly using two heterogeneous collaborative robots to address the ergonomic concerns. The use of two heterogeneous cobots enables the handling of different assembly requirements. The diversity of mold structure and different specifications of resources require comprehensive knowledge management to enable interaction and collaboration among resources. However, knowledge management in the domain of mold assembly is yet to be developed in a format understandable by both human and robots. Therefore, a framework of knowledge management is proposed to manage the knowledge within the human–robot collaboration (HRC) in a mold assembly domain. This framework includes an ontology-based decision making that utilizes outcomes from task assignment to decide the mold parts arrangement within the HRC workspace. A set of rules are modeled in the developed ontology for knowledge reasoning according to the use case of collaborative assembly of two-plate injection mold. In addition to part arrangement, the developed HRC ontology can be used to extract data and information based on user’s request and decisions, such as tool selection for subtask execution. The HRC mold assembly ontology serves as a stepping stone towards developing a context-based decision making for multi-resources HRC in future implementation.},

Rapid advances in the field of machine learning are opening new possibilities for automating previously manual processes. This paper proposes a concept for identifying geometric features of electrical components that starts from STEP files and transforms them into modular metrics relevant to build a digital twin and (automatic)manufacturing. The architecture is tested on a self-aggregated and processed dataset of control cabinet components and achieves an average dice score of 65.27% and an intersection over union of 51.41% across all segmentation classes. In addition to semantic part segmentation of the components, the cluster, volume and surface centroids, the normal vectors and the size of each feature are computed. The paper evaluates the suitability of cutting-edge techniques such as diffusion as well as established deep learning architectures. The result is a hybrid end-to-end inference pipeline suitable for general spatial assembly processes.},

The CPPS focuses on achieving autonomous part quality control by monitoring three critical categories: the thermal behavior of the material during printing deposition, faulty detection of contour&#39;s parts being produced, and machine integrity based on component performance. This study reveals that current temperature data on 3D printers does not accurately reflect the physical part deposition temperature by an average offset of 30%. Real-time thermal readings demonstrate potential for accurate monitoring and control of the printing process. Tests validate the CPPS’s efficacy in detecting faults in real-time, significantly enhancing overall part quality production by an accuracy detection of 99.7%. Integration of different cameras, image processing, and machine learning algorithms facilitates fault detection and self-awareness of printed parts, providing insights into the mechanical condition of the printer. The combination of machine learning and image processing reduces the need for continuous operator intervention, optimizing production processes and minimizing losses. In conclusion, the implemented CPPS offers a robust solution for achieving autonomous part quality control in large-format 3D printing, showcasing advancements in real-time monitoring, fault detection, and overall improvement in the additive manufacturing process for large scale production implementation.},

One such transformative concept, the digital thread, has emerged as an important paradigm. It orchestrates the integration of information and data along the entire product lifecycle, spanning from initial design and engineering through production, maintenance, use, and eventual end of life. While the digital thread has garnered increasing attention within both the research community and industrial enterprises, there remains a notable lack of standardization concerning its utilization and applications. This comprehensive literature review aims to explore the role of the digital thread in manufacturing within the context of the product lifecycle. As a result, this review synthesizes insights into the technologies, roles, and functions of the digital thread throughout the product lifecycle. Furthermore, it proposes a structured framework designed to impart a standardized perspective of the digital thread’s relevance within the manufacturing product lifecycle. Ultimately, this framework is poised to serve as a guiding resource for practitioners and researchers in designing and implementing digital threads.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an essential tool for manufacturers seeking to optimize their production processes, reduce costs, and improve product quality. However, the complexity of the underlying mechanisms of AI systems can render it difficult for humans to understand and trust AI-driven decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly evolving field that addresses this challenge, providing human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. Based on a systematic literature survey, We explore the latest techniques and approaches that are helping manufacturers gain transparency in the decision-making processes of their AI systems. In this survey, we focus on two of the most exciting areas of XAI: ontology-based and semantic-based XAI (O-XAI, S-XAI, respectively), which provide human-readable explanations of AI decisions by exploiting semantic information. These latter types of explanations are presented in natural language and are designed to be easily understood by non-experts. Translating the decision paths taken by AI algorithms to meaningful explanations through semantics, O-XAI, and S-XAI enables humans to identify various cross-cutting concerns that influence the decisions made by the AI system. This information can be used to improve the performance of the AI system, identify potential biases in the system, and ensure that the decisions are aligned with the goals and values of the manufacturing organization. Additionally, we highlight the benefits and challenges of using O-XAI and S-XAI in manufacturing and discuss the potential for future research, aiming to provide valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners looking to leverage the power of ontologies and general semantics for XAI.},

  abstract     = {Following sustainability in manufacturing, the machining chain can be optimized by either reducing the time and energy consumption of each operation or eliminating the unnecessary operations subjected to keeping the quality of the final product as consistent. However, the roadblock in designing an optimum machining chain is lack of prediction tool to interact between the included operations. In this paper, an integrated algorithm is developed to simulate the surface roughness generation and following modification caused by milling and burnishing, respectively. Predict the surface roughness generation by milling process and its alternation after burnishing. The algorithm works on the basis of clouds of points which were generated in the engagement region of tool and workpiece and their transformation from tool to workpiece coordinate systems. Moreover, some mechanical attributes of the process regarding effect of surface work hardening and elastic rebound were added to the algorithm to enhance the accuracy of simulation. To verify the results, a series of burnishing experiments with multi-roller rotary tool have been carried out on the surface of the finish-milled samples and the surface roughness change was taken into investigation. The obtained results showed that by applying the work hardening and springback effect to predictive algorithm the prediction accuracy of roughness at submicron level enhances up to 50%. It was also found that the most influential parameters influencing the surface roughness after milling-burnishing sequence are milled surface roughness, burnishing force and pass number. In addition, results showed that applying burnishing after rough machining consumes lots of energy to achieve nanoscale surface finish. Accordingly, the sequence of rough-milling, finish-milling and burnishing results in achieving sound surface finish within significantly shorter period of time and applied force.},

  abstract     = {Precise selective cooling control of work roll can significantly improve the cold rolled strip flatness in steel manufacturing industry. To improve the control accuracy of the coolant output of selective work roll cooling control system, a machine learning (ML) algorithm with differential evolution-gray wolf algorithm optimization support vector machine regression (DE-GWO-SVR) model has been proposed for the first time in this study. This model combines the differential evolution (DE) with grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) to improve the optimization performance of the algorithm. Then, the SVR model parameters are optimized with differential evolutionary gray wolf hybrid algorithm (DE-GWO) to improve the regression accuracy. Finally, the influences of data normalization methods and the selection of SVR kernel functions were systematically investigated. Compared with the test results of other regression models, the evaluation index R2 based on the DE-GWO-SVR model is greater and the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are smaller. The DE-GWO-SVR model performs the best, with a higher regression accuracy than the other regression models. Besides, it has been successfully applied to a 1450 mm five-stand industrial cold rolling mill. The model has higher control accuracy for the thermal crown of the work roll and better control effect for the flatness deviation of the strip steel. This study provides a novel strategy with a help of ML algorithm to effectively improve the flatness quality of cold rolled strips by optimizing the selective cooling control of work roll, which exhibits a great practical application potential in steel manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, quality inspection has become one of the most crucial research topics in additive manufacturing. Although numerous image-based deep learning methods have been successfully developed to monitor and inspect AM product quality effectively, many require substantial labels in order to achieve satisfactory training, which is often impractical in real-life AM processes. In this article, a novel image feature-based self-supervised learning (IFSSL) model is proposed for effective quality inspection in AM. Through a feature-based image fusion approach based on defect-relevant feature extraction, the IFSSL model is able to guide machine vision to focus on highlighted defect-relevant regions in the AM product image. In addition, the defect-relevant features are used to generate pseudo-labels for self-supervised learning. With self-supervision, the IFSSL model leverages the advantages of supervised learning and unsupervised learning by requiring no sample label while retaining defect-relevant information. The effectiveness of the proposed IFSSL method is demonstrated through a real case study of fused deposition modeling product image dataset. Results show that the IFSSL model can guide machine vision to pay more attention to potential defective regions, enabling it to detect and locate faults effectively and automatically for machine vision guided quality inspection.},

  abstract     = {With the advances in Internet-of-Things and data mining technologies, deep learning-based approaches have been widely used for intelligent fault diagnosis of manufacturing assets. However, uncertainty caused by the non-stationary process data such as vibration signal and noise interference in practical working environments will greatly affect the performance and reliability of predictions. The present paper develops a trustworthy and intelligent fault diagnosis framework based on a two-stage joint denoising method and evidential neural networks. The proposed denoising method integrating the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and the independent component analysis (ICA) method can effectively reduce data uncertainty caused by noise interference. The stacked gated recurrent unit (SGRU) model has been incorporated into the evidential neural networks as a deep classifier. The proposed evidential SGRU (ESGRU) method can quantify the prediction uncertainty, which estimates the prediction trustworthiness. Predictive entropy and reliability diagrams are used as calibration methods to validate the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. The proposed framework is validated by two case studies of rolling bearing fault diagnosis in variable noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a high denoising effect and provide reliable uncertainty prediction results which are significant for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Demonstration Environments (DEs) are essential tools for testing and demonstrating new technologies, products, and services, and reducing uncertainties and risks in the innovation process. However, the terminology used to describe these environments is inconsistent, leading to heterogeneity in defining and characterizing them. This makes it difficult to establish a universal understanding of DEs and to differentiate between the different types of DEs, including testbeds, pilot-plants, and living labs. Moreover, existing literature lacks a holistic view of DEs, with studies focusing on specific types of DEs and not offering an integrated perspective on their characteristics and applicability in different contexts. This study proposes an ontology for knowledge representation related to DEs to address this gap. Using an ontology learning approach analyzing 3621 peer-reviewed journal articles, we develop a standardized framework for defining and characterizing DEs, providing a holistic view of these environments. The resulting ontology allows innovation managers and practitioners to select appropriate DEs for achieving their innovation goals, based on the characteristics and capabilities of the specific type of DE. The contributions of this study are significant in advancing the understanding and application of DEs in innovation processes. The proposed ontology provides a standardized approach for defining and characterizing DEs, reducing inconsistencies in terminology and establishing a common understanding of these environments. This enables innovation managers and practitioners to select appropriate DEs for their specific innovation goals, facilitating more efficient and effective innovation processes. Overall, this study provides a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in the effective use of DEs in innovation.},

The development process of a machine learning solution for industrial use cases requires multi-layered, sophisticated decision-making processes along the pipeline that can only be accomplished by subject matter experts with knowledge of statistical mathematics, coding, and engineering process knowledge. By having humans and computers work together in a digital assistance system, the special characteristics of human and artificial intelligence can be used synergistically. This paper presents the development of a digital human-centered assistance system for employees in the production and development departments of industrial manufacturing companies. This assistance system enables users to apply production-specific data mining and machine learning techniques without programming to typical tabular production data, which is often inherently high-dimensional, nonstationary, and highly imbalanced data streams. Through tight interactive process guidance that considers the dependencies between machine learning process modules, users are empowered to build and optimize predictive models. Compared to existing commercial and academic tools with similar objectives, the digital assistance system offers the added value that both classical shallow and deep learning as well as generative and oversampling methods can be interactively applied to all feature table use cases for different user modes without programming.},

  abstract     = {Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an essential task in ensuring reliability in intelligent manufacturing. Recent advances in deep learning-based data-driven methods have shown promising results. However, one non-ignorable challenge is that distribution shift across various machine individuals often results in a performance decline. Domain adaptation approaches appear to be effective in tackling this issue, whereas they often require sufficient unlabeled target data, which is causally infeasible in prognostic tasks in practical scenarios. In this paper, we discuss the significance of prognostic generalization for RUL prediction, and a domain generalization-based scheme is proposed. A domain conditional invariance and specificity disentanglement network (DCISD) is proposed to learn domain conditional-invariant and domain-specific information simultaneously in a unified network. Domain conditional-invariant features are extracted through conditional domain adversarial learning and samples are conditioned by multiple RUL fuzzy sets. Domain-specific features correlated to individual degradation patterns are disentangled to promote sufficiency of degradation information. Moreover, a degradation dynamics-based augmentation method is proposed to mitigate domain imbalance following the degradation dynamics in the latent space. Two bearing run-to-failure datasets are utilized to evaluate the proposed method. Comparative and ablation studies validate the method effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract     = {In the era of the internet, people are increasingly interested in highly personalized customization, which has been leading the global industry to transform from “Enterprise centered Mass Manufacturing” to “User centered Mass Customization”. In recent decades, ontology-based semantic models have been used for semantic association description and syntax consistency alignment of product structures. However, the description of industrial terminology and general concepts has difficulty achieving accurate end-to-end matching of personalized user customization requirements and manufacturing capabilities. This requires detailed descriptions of process standards, component/assembly/part specifications, etc. Therefore, we propose the Abstraction-Instance-Capability (AIC) model based on a knowledge graph, which is a multigrained and multiview industrial knowledge model. By modeling industrial knowledge at a deeper level from various perspectives and by considering the expression of the relationships between knowledge, an industrial knowledge graph was constructed to support personalized customization. This graph can be used for personalized customization plan generation and other related operations, such as Design BOM (Bill of Materials) modification and verification. First, a meta-object facility (MOF)-based meta-model is defined for AIC model design. Second, the proposed model is used to define a multiview structure for modeling knowledge from various perspectives. Such a design realizes efficient industrial knowledge retrieval from various aspects, such as manufacturing resource retrieval, and production capacity analysis. Finally, in this paper we validate operability and introduce two case studies to demonstrate that the model has good performance in the recommendation of components (BOM modification) and the verification of personalized customization schemes (BOM verification).},

  abstract     = {Currently, there are demands for machine tools with higher dynamic performance as a result of their high machining accuracy and efficiency in designing complex parts in the manufacturing industry. The motion delays in each of the motion axes cause dynamic tracking errors or tool tracking errors which greatly affect the surface quality of machined parts; hence, tuning the dynamic parameters like the position gains of the motion axis causing the defect is as good as eliminating the error source rather than tuning the parameters of all the motion axes. This work proposes a decoupling method to identify the particular motion axis that greatly affects or causes the tool tracking error by using the ISO BK3 kinematic test, and this involves orientation contour error estimation and motion axis error computation based on inverse kinematics of the machine tool transformation. An experiment was carried out on an industrial machine tool with a tilting rotary table to verify the simulation results; the feed servo system model of the motion axes was constructed using MATLAB Simulink tools. The results obtained show that the tool tracking errors are greatly influenced by some dynamic parameters like the feedrate and the position gains emanating from a particular motion axis with dynamic deficiency, and the proposed decoupling method robustly identifies the individual motion axes greatly affecting the dynamic tracking error which makes it very relevant to tune only the dynamic parameters of those particular motion axes instead tuning all. Moreover, this method is simple and robust, and its implementation can help improve the dynamic performance of machine tools in the manufacturing industry.},

To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%.},

The reinforcement learning algorithm interacts with the finite element model by exploring different die velocities and receiving input measurements (the velocity, displacement and force of the die) while collecting rewards if a constant stress state in the workpiece is achieved. Synthetic stochastic material behavior was used to simulate the observed variations in deformation behavior of TNM-B1. The same reinforcement learning setup and reward function was able to adapt to two example finite element environments; the compression of a simple cylinder workpiece between flat dies and the compression of a more complex bone workpiece between flat dies. The performance of the controller for the bone compression environment was comparatively reduced and less consistent. In addition, training times and training instability were significantly increased. Furthermore, the results suggest that the framework can be used as a tool to find process optimizations or alternative process routes.

From manual visual methods to machine vision and deep learning-based techniques, a variety of methods have been studied to improve production efficiency and product quality. Although deep learning-based methods have proven to be powerful tools for segmentation, there are still many pressing issues that need to be addressed in practical applications. First, the scarcity of defective samples compared to normal samples can cause data imbalance and thus affect accuracy. Second, high real-time performance is also required in the actual detection process. To overcome these problems, we propose a high real-time convolutional neural network, named Mobile-Deeplab, to implement end-to-end defect segmentation. In addition, we proposed a loss function to consider the fabric image sample imbalance problem. We evaluated the performance of the model with two public structured datasets and three self-constructed structured datasets. The experimental results show that the segmentation method has better segmentation accuracy than other segmentation models, which verifies the segmentation effect of the method. In addition, 87.11 frames per second on a $$256\times 256$$ size image meet industrial real-time requirements.},

However, the existing 3D instance segmentation network is difficult to apply in workshop scenes due to the large number of 3D instance segmentation labels and 3D information acquisition devices required. In this paper, a monocular 3D instance segmentation network is proposed, which achieves satisfactory results while relying on a monocular RGB camera without 3D instance segmentation labels. The proposed method has two stages. In the first stage, the double-snake multitask network is proposed to solve the problem of a lack of 3D information acquisition devices. It simultaneously performs depth estimation and instance segmentation and uses the features obtained from depth estimation to guide the instance segmentation task. In the second stage, an adaptive point cloud filtering algorithm that performs adaptive point cloud noise filtering on multi-scale objects based on two-dimensional prior information is proposed to solve the problem of a lack of 3D labels. In addition, color information is introduced into the filtering process to further improve filtering accuracy. Experiments on the Cityscapes and SOP datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method. When the IoU threshold is set to 0.35, the mean average precision (mAP) is 50.41. Our approach is deployed in an actual production workshop to verify its feasibility.},

  abstract     = {In intelligent machining, tool condition monitoring (TCM) is crucial to improving tool efficiency and machining accuracy, which requires the real-time analysis and feature extraction of multivariate time series signals collected by multiple sensors. However, multivariate time series are ultra-high-dimensional and difficult to perform representation learning directly, requiring sampling and typical feature extraction. The existing deep feature extractors based on Sequential sampling, Random sampling, or Window sampling, are poor at capturing the critical information from the huge amount of time series data, and ignore the temporal associations, so the actual results are not satisfactory in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, we propose an appending-inspired multivariate time series association fusion method for TCM tasks: after the necessary denoising, we capture typical time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency-domain features of multivariate time series based on the proposed appending-inspired feature capturer to fully consider the temporal associations, and employ the ACNNs (Attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks) to extract and fuse the multivariate time series features for real-time TCM tasks. The experimental results on NASA and PHM2010 datasets show that our method can real-time and effectively monitor the tool condition and accurately predict the tool wear state.},

  abstract     = {Accurate milling stability prediction is necessary for selecting chatter-free machining parameters to ensure the machining quality. With the development of machine learning techniques, data-driven methods have demonstrated powerful modelling capabilities for stability prediction. However, the significant performance of data-driven modelling usually requires a large labelled training dataset consisting of stable and unstable experimental data, which is expensive and time-consuming for metal-cutting scenarios. Therefore, how to design an experimental parameter set to build the experimental labelled dataset which is small but can provide sufficient support for data-driven stability prediction has been a critical problem and has received increasing attention. Existing research samples the experimental parameters by the grid or the boundary method, which inevitably brings lots of low-value data points for model training. To address this, this paper proposes a Physics-Guided High-Value (PGHV) data sampling method to reduce the required experiments for data-driven stability prediction. A novel value function is designed based on the physics information of milling dynamic stability to quantify the potential contribution of different experimental parameters. The optimal experimental parameter set can then be determined by maximising the dataset value. After that, the experimental labelled dataset can be constructed by performing cutting experiments under the sampled experimental parameters. Finally, the stability prediction model can be obtained by the data-driven modelling method with the experimental labelled dataset. Experimental verification shows that the proposed method can reduce the number of experiments by more than 60% compared to the existing sampling methods.},

Generally, rotating machinery operates in nonstationary cases, which makes fault features complex and difficult to identify. However, existing fault diagnosis methods have the following limitations. (1) Consider only time or frequency domain features fusion. (2) Extract the fusion features representation only in the Euclidean domain. Based on that, a novel method based on multisensory time-frequency features fusion and graph attention network is proposed for rotating machinery fault diagnosis under the nonstationary case. First, the multi-sensor time series are converted into multi-sensor time-frequency maps by image-to-matrix, matrix concatenation, and matrix-to-image operations. Then, simple linear iterative clustering is applied to make the superpixels in the multi-sensor time-frequency maps into nodes and form graphs based on color and texture features. Finally, the graph attention network with residual connection is applied to distinguish the rotating machinery’s health status. The proposed method is verified using gearbox test rig data and bearing public data, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can provide more reliable and accurate fault diagnosis results for rotating machinery than other methods.},

To improve the automation degree of building deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection and further improve the detection accuracy, this paper proposes an improved neural architecture search method using exclusive-OR (XOR)-based channel feature fusion. First, an XOR-based channel fusion module is designed; it can fuse the feature mapping of different scales at the channel level in the case of multibranch access complementarily. Then, an improved cell pruning strategy is proposed to efficiently prune the connections between cells by setting the architecture parameters of the candidate operations to 0 s, which are in the alignment layers of the subsequent cells. The cell pruning strategy can directly search the multibranch CNN models and narrow the neural network architectures’ gap between the search stage and the evaluation stage. The experimental results show that the proposed method takes approximately 0.75 GPU days to search the optimal neural network on a dataset including six classes for blind inspection of industrial products, and the mean average precision (mAP) is approximately 99.1% on a test dataset, which is higher than those of state-of-the-art methods, e.g., DenseNAS and CSPDarknet53.},

Arrangement algorithms for minimizing steel-sheet wastage cannot be readily applied to nesting without pairing the two parts to reduce the nesting complexity because of the considerable computation time involved. This study proposes a pairing method to reduce nesting complexity. Ship parts were classified, and pairwise clustering was applied for pairing. A method in which a deep neural network architecture learns polygons without rasterization for classifying ship parts and a method for pairing ship parts of different shapes for pairwise clustering were proposed. Using 265 actual ship parts, the proposed method was compared with pairing methods involving shape-based matching algorithms currently employed by shipbuilding companies. Subsequently, 82 more parts were paired, and the average pairing time, arrangement time, and scrap rate decreased by 44.1%, 47.5%, and 11.0%, respectively. Pairing based on deep learning classifiers and pairwise clustering can rapidly and accurately pair ship parts, thereby improving nesting efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Laser directed energy deposition (LDED), a class of additive manufacturing (AM) processes, has immense potential to be used for various engineering applications to build components with medium to high complexity. However, dimensional deviations from intended values and inadequate surface quality of the built parts limit its wide deployment. The present work reports the development of an adaptive tool path trajectory platform to correct the dimensional inaccuracies in-situ to build high-quality components using LDED. The study deploys a laser line scanner to scan the part after the deposition of the definite number of layers followed by the detection of concave, convex, and flat surfaces using deep learning. Further, a novel adaptive trajectory planning algorithm is deployed by using three different strategies to control material deposition on concave, convex, and flat surfaces. The material deposition is controlled by using adaptive scanning speed control (ASSC), and a combination of laser on–off and scanning speed control (ASSLC). Subsequently, the built geometries are subjected to geometric, microstructure, and mechanical characterizations. It is observed that the deviation of the part was reduced by 30%, and 27.5% using ASSC and ASSLC, respectively. The structures built using the three strategies show some micropores at isolated locations. The microstructure is mainly cellular under all conditions with a similar average microhardness of ~ 210 HV. The study provides an integrated and comprehensive approach for building high-quality large-scale components using LDED with minimal dimensional deviation from the original CAD model.},

  abstract     = {Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods for intelligent fault diagnosis focus on learning domain-invariant representations under covariate shift assumption. However, the covariate shift assumption is usually unsatisfied when each fault class in different domains consists of multiple modes with skewed proportions, which is common in industrial scenarios. Imbalanced data from multiple modes cause the presence of within-domain class imbalance and between-domain label distributional shift. This paper introduces a novel subpopulation shift that further considers the domain shift from a subpopulation perspective, i.e., that covariate shift and label distributional shift across domains are caused by shifts in the multiple modes. To address this issue, a label propagation-based unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed based on a realistic expansion assumption. We apply the theoretical analysis of the proposed method with a bi-level optimization strategy adapted from meta-learning. Using joint optimization of a teacher model and a student model, the label propagation-based model-agnostic meta-learning (LPMAML) not only propagates supervision information from the source to the target but also adjusts the teacher’s strategy throughout the student’s learning process. To alleviate the noise caused by label distributional shift, we integrate a sampling-based alignment method that aligns the empirical label distributions across the two domains into LPMAML. Experimental results on three bearing datasets show that the proposed method has impressive generalization ability under covariate, label distributional, and subpopulation shifts. The proposed method offers consistent improvements to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Compared with the vanilla UDA methods, the average diagnosis accuracies of the proposed method on the label distributional shift benchmark and subpopulation shift benchmark are improved by 8.21% and 7.63%, respectively.},

However, it requires complex hyperparameter optimization, high training time, and high computational hardware resources for neural network architecture. On the other hand, classical machine learning algorithms rely heavily on domain knowledge and manual feature engineering which is not always available in the industry. Therefore, we present an alternative method that learns characteristics of multivariate raw time series data to perform failure mode classification. The method is based on the deep forest algorithm, which is composed of two main processes: multi-grained scanning and cascade forest. The multi-grained scanning process windows the data and screens the times series to generate feature vectors automatically based on class probability distribution and hence recognize patterns from data. The cascade forest uses the output of the multi-grained scanning process and creates layers of random forests to make predictions. Each layer will perform fault classification, and the number of layers will increase until the accuracy of the classification does not improve. This layer-by-layer process is similar to deep learning, where the algorithm architecture is composed of different hidden layers. The presented methodology directly works with raw data in three domains: time, frequency, and time &amp; frequency domain. Also, the method is validated using data provided by the Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) data challenge 2022 competition for hydraulic rock drill multiple failure mode classifications.

This condition leads to the presentation of an updated study regarding the application of the digital-twin virtual machining model development, to detect chatter phenomena in milling processes. Chatter is a dynamic interaction where an instability state is observed between the workpiece and the cutter during material removal. This process affects the roughness of the finish surface and tool-life and eventually reduces the machining results in quality. Consequently, a novel intelligent machining system was developed for detecting chatter based on the variational mode decomposition method, wavelet-based synchro-squeeze transform, and Transfer Learning (TL) application. This TL application was created using modified pre-trained convolution neural networks to identify unstable (chatter) or stable state conditions of the process of milling-cut. The model was also developed due to being data-driven, where the measured vibration signals for the process of milling-cut were trained and tested through several modified pre-trained networks. The results showed a good-level model with an average classification accuracy of 94.04%. Therefore, the manufacturing industry could adopt this novel method, especially in machining, to overcome the problem of emphasizing the limited process of data monitoring conditions.},

  abstract     = {Countersink inspection is crucial in various automated assembly lines, especially in the aerospace and automotive sectors. Advancements in machine vision introduced automated robotic inspection of countersinks using laser scanners and monocular cameras. Nevertheless, the aforementioned sensing pipelines require the robot to pause on each hole for inspection due to high latency and measurement uncertainties with motion, leading to prolonged execution times of the inspection task. The neuromorphic vision sensor, on the other hand, has the potential to expedite the countersink inspection process, but the unorthodox output of the neuromorphic technology prohibits utilizing traditional image processing techniques. Therefore, novel event-based perception algorithms need to be introduced. We propose a countersink detection approach on the basis of event-based motion compensation and the mean-shift clustering principle. In addition, our framework presents a robust event-based circle detection algorithm to precisely estimate the depth of the countersink specimens. The proposed approach expedites the inspection process by a factor of 10 $$\times $$ compared to conventional countersink inspection methods. The work in this paper was validated for over 50 trials on three countersink workpiece variants. The experimental results show that our method provides a standard deviation of 0.025 mm and an accuracy of 0.026 mm for countersink depth inspection despite the low resolution of commercially available neuromorphic cameras.

  abstract     = {More and more organisations are trying to install tool health analytics dashboards for CNC machines to avoid unexpected failures, maintain machining accuracy, and optimise tool change. This paper aims at developing a cyber physical production system framework for a smart tool health management system to prescribe the optimum cutting parameters to managers/operators for optimising the remaining useful life and/or material removal rate at a predefined surface finish (individually or simultaneously). This is achieved by developing (i) a machine learning algorithm to predict the remaining useful life of a cutting tool, (ii) regression models to prescribe optimum cutting parameters (iii) a machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection, and (iv) a knowledge-based system for chip conditions and tool life curves. Experiments are designed and conducted based on Taguchi L-27 orthogonal array with varying combinations of cutting parameters during the milling of a difficult to machine material (AISI H13 tool steel). The effect of cutting parameters is analysed statistically; using analysis of variance (ANOVA), response tables, and main effect plots; to prescribe optimum cutting parameters based on managerial requirements. A novel knowledge-based system is also presented that updates knowledge and information about the chip colour at different health conditions of a tool. The present work will be a significant step towards improving productivity, product quality, and reducing maintenance costs by providing practitioners with an active decision support tool that will assist them to confidently adopt optimum management and control strategies within an Industry 4.0 environment.},

This review paper utilizes a systematic methodology to establish key literature trends and themes. The state-of-the-art body of knowledge in this hot research area is analyzed in descriptive (e.g. neural network technologies studied, sustainability indicators considered, manufacturing process addressed) and thematic synthesis components. Process analysis and improvement, quality control and additive manufacturing were identified as the three focal research themes, and research lines within these themes were further studied and discussed. To guide future research, potential paths and research questions are proposed against the gaps identified. The originality of this work lies in its methodology (adoption of a systematic review approach, highly limited in the current literature), its inclusion of sustainability (as an imperative concept for manufacturing technology research) and its specific focus on neural network applications in the context of pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies (a perspective, either has been missing or addressed too widely by extant contributions).},

This paper is motivated by a case study focusing on deciphering the causal structure of a wafer manufacturing system using data from sensors and abnormality monitors deployed within the assembly line. In response to the distinctive characteristics of the wafer manufacturing data, such as multimodality, high-dimensionality, imbalanced classes, and irregular missing patterns, we propose a hierarchical ensemble approach. This method leverages the temporal and domain constraints inherent in the assembly line and provides a measure of uncertainty in causal discovery. We extensively examine its operating characteristics via simulations and validate its effectiveness through simulation experiments and a practical application involving data obtained from Seagate Technology. Domain engineers have cross-validated the learned structures and corroborated the identified causal relationships.},

  abstract     = {Defect detection is an essential way to ensure the quality of parts made by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and industrial cameras are one of the commonly used tools for defect monitoring. Different lighting environments affect the visibility of defects in the images, and the illumination condition becomes one of the most important factors affecting the defect detection effect of industrial cameras, but the modification of the equipment lighting environment will increase the complexity and cost of monitoring. In this study, only an off-axis CMOS camera monitoring system is used and the lighting facilities are not changed to improve the effect of defect detection under uneven lighting conditions. A dual-input convolutional neural network fusing defect parameter vectors and layerwise images is proposed for real-time online monitoring of defects in the LPBF process using a paraxial CMOS camera monitoring system. The model integrates the image and the parameter information related to defect generation, and can distinguish some defects that are not easily discerned by images alone. To a certain extent, it avoids the problem that the same defects are visually indistinguishable in images caused by uneven light distribution and reflections on metal surfaces. The results indicate that the method has better performance than the method with a single image input, with recognition accuracies above 80.00% for all defect categories. In addition, the method is more suitable for real-time online monitoring scenarios due to its low parameter number, short training time and fast prediction speed compared to classical deep learning algorithms.},

To address the shortage of signed directed graph (SDG)-based fault diagnosis method, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on digital twin (DT) enhanced SDG for autoclave. Firstly, the SDG model of autoclave temperature control system is constructed, and the model is improved and enhanced by pre-fault transition state identification, fuzzy confirmation of node states, and simplification of potential branch circuits by using DT. The effectiveness of the method in this paper is verified by fault diagnosis based on SDG and DT-SDG methods respectively. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can improve the speed and resolution of fault diagnosis by reducing the number of potential fault propagation paths and the number of inferences.},

  abstract     = {Digital twin, a core technology for intelligent manufacturing, has gained extensive research interest. The current research was mainly focused on digital twin based on design models representing ideal geometric features and behaviors at macroscopic scales, which is challenging to accurately represent accuracy and performance. However, a numerical representation is essential for precision microstructures whose accuracy and performance are difficult to measure. The concept of a digital twin for an accurate representation, proposed in 2015, is still in the conceptual stage without a clear construction method. Therefore, the goal of accurate representation has not been achieved. This paper defines the concept and connotation of an accuracy and performance-oriented accurate digital twin model and establishes its architecture in two levels: geometric and physical. First, a geometric digital twin model is constructed by the contact surfaces distributed error modeling and virtual assembly with nonuniform contact states. Then, based on this, a physical digital twin model is constructed by considering the linear and nonlinear response of the structural internal physical properties to the external environment and time to characterize the accuracy and performance variation. Finally, the models are evaluated. The method is validated on microtarget assembly. The estimated values of surface modeling, center offset, and stress prediction accuracy are 94.22%, 89.3%, and 83.27%. This paper provides a modeling methodology for the digital twin research to accurately represent accuracy and performance, which is critical for product quality improvements in intelligent manufacturing. Research results can be extended to larger-scale precision structures for performance prediction and optimization.},

  abstract     = {The simultaneous regulation of production efficiency and equipment maintenance in intelligent production lines poses a challenging problem. Existing approaches addressing this issue often separate the regulation of equipment maintenance and load balancing, lacking dynamic indicators to characterize the operational status and equipment workload. Inspired by the cardiac electrical activity recorded from human electrocardiogram (ECG), the electric drive signal of the equipment is proposed as an analogous measure to monitor equipment performance and workload variations. Thereby, the implementation mechanism and working characteristics of equipment ECG (EECG) are put forward for reconfigurable mixed-model assembly. Moreover, the monitoring of equipment performance based on deep learning is explored, leveraging the EECG features combined with multi-source heterogeneous data. The variations of equipment workload are tracked through the construction of a population difference hash analysis of the ECG data flow, along with the characterization of equipment power through electric signals. Additionally, an EECG-driven synchronous mapping approach is proposed to address steady disturbance, considering both workload imbalance and the degeneracy effect of the equipment. The reconfigurability of the intelligent production line enables the proposed mechanism of similarity matching of EECG features through the reconfiguration of the software manufacturing system and hardware physical equipment. Finally, the EECG-based solution is validated on a laboratory-level prototype platform, demonstrating that the robust running of the assembly process can be ensured even in the presence of internal and external disturbances.},

Second, competing refurbishments leads to a prisoner’s dilemma in which both parties suffer greater losses compared to the no refurbishment scenario. This implies that competing refurbishments, except for product cannibalization, hinder the refurbishing industry.

  abstract     = {Reducing material waste and computation time are primary objectives in cutting and packing problems (C &amp;P). A solution to the C &amp;P problem consists of many steps, including the grouping of items to be nested and the arrangement of the grouped items on a large object. Current algorithms use meta-heuristics to solve the arrangement problem directly without explicitly addressing the grouping problem. In this paper, we propose a new pipeline for the nesting problem that starts with grouping the items to be nested and then arranging them on large objects. To this end, we introduce and motivate a new concept, namely the Geometrical Compatibility Index (GCI). Items with higher GCI should be clustered together. Since no labels exist for GCIs, we propose to model GCIs as bidirectional weighted edges of a graph that we call geometrical relationship graph (GRG). We propose a novel reinforcement-learning-based framework, which consists of two graph neural networks trained in an actor-critic-like fashion to learn GCIs. Then, to group the items into clusters, we model the GRG as a capacitated vehicle routing problem graph and solve it using meta-heuristics. Experiments conducted on a private dataset with regularly and irregularly shaped items show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significant reduction in computation time (30% to 48%) compared to an open-source nesting software while attaining similar trim loss on regular items and a threefold improvement in trim loss on irregular items.},

  abstract     = {As an important indicator of the surface quality of workpieces, surface roughness has a great impact on production costs and the quality performance of the finished components. Effective surface roughness prediction can not only increase productivity but also reduce costs. However, the current methods for surface roughness prediction have some limitations. On the one hand, the prediction accuracy of classical experimental and statistical-based surface roughness prediction methods is low. On the other hand, the results of deep learning-based surface roughness prediction methods are uninterpretable due to their black-box learning mechanism. Therefore, this paper presents an ensemble learning with a differential evolution algorithm, applies it to the prediction of surface roughness of abrasive water jet polishing (AWJP), and conducts an interpretability analysis to identify key factors contributing to the prediction accuracy of surface roughness. First, we proposed automatically constructing features by an Evolution Forest algorithm to train the base regression models. The differential evolution algorithm with a simplified encoding mechanism was then used to search for the best weighted-ensemble to integrate the base regression models for obtaining highly accurate prediction results. Extensive experiments have been conducted on AWJP to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method is higher than the existing machine learning algorithms. In addition, this is the first of its time for the contributions of machining parameters (i.e., features) on surface roughness prediction by using interpretable analysis methods. The analysis results can provide a reference basis for subsequent experiments and studies.},

  abstract     = {With the development of simulation technology, more and more manufacturers have begun to use the digital twin to design workshops and factories. For these design scenarios under real-time interaction requirements with an excessive amount of model data, if the rendering is stuck, it will reduce the work efficiency. It is a key enabling technology to simplify and switch the geometry models with different resolutions, according to the distance of the viewpoint or the motion state to reduce the computational complexity. Existing model simplification methods emphasize the universality and efficiency under various scenarios, while the simplification performance in the 3D geometry models of industrial mechanisms is poor. This paper proposes a rapid simplification approach to the 3D geometry model of mechanisms in the digital twins-driven manufacturing system design context. A novel Vertex Saliency-oriented Classified Edge Collapse (VS-CEC) algorithm is proposed to simplify the shape feature of the 3D geometry model of mechanisms. It especially emphasizes solving the sharp shape preservation issues in the mechanical design scenario rather than a universal things design scenario. A vertex saliency factor is defined and integrated with the region boundary information obtained from the processing of detailed features to ensure visual fidelity as well as shape preservation such as sharp edges. Experiments show that this approach reduces the data model complexity more reasonably to speed up the rendering. It ensures that the digital twin model interacts quickly with the physical manufacturing system, and thus realizes the low-latency visual effect of cyber-physical synchronization.},

  abstract     = {Resistance spot welding is an important process in the production of body-in-white. The quality of the welded nugget affects the safety performance of the whole vehicle. Currently, the quality of the welded nugget is mainly inspected manually, which is labor-intensive and inefficient. Therefore, this paper explores a new method to automatically and efficiently detect the quality of welded nugget by analyzing the vibration excitation response signal of the welded joint. In response to the characteristics of large volume, significant noise, and small discriminability of raw signals, we constructed a deep learning model named Real Spatial–temporal Attention Denoising Network (RSTADN), which consists of a denoising module, spatial–temporal attention modules, and multiple residual modules. The denoising module uses global absolute average pooling (GAAP) to maximize the retention of the original signal characteristics while aggregating global information from each channel. It generates appropriate soft thresholds to eliminate noise and enhance the feature recognition ability of the model. The spatial–temporal attention modules delve into the spatiotemporal correlation features of the signal from different perspectives, including real spatial scale, short-term dependency, and global temporal interaction, to enhance the model&#39;s feature extraction ability. Multiple residual modules further extract signal features to achieve precise alignment between features and nugget quality states. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of RSTADN in the task of detecting the quality of welded nugget reaches as high as 94.35%, which is at least 1.31% higher than that of existing models.},

  abstract     = {Numerous efforts in the additive manufacturing literature have been made toward in-situ defect prediction for process control and optimization. However, the current work in the literature is limited by the need for multi-sensory data in appropriate resolution and scale to capture defects reliably and the need for systematic experimental and data-driven modeling validation to prove utility. For the first time in literature, we propose a data-driven neural network framework capable of in-situ micro-porosity localization for laser powder bed fusion via exclusively within hatch strip of sensory data, as opposed to a three-dimensional neighborhood of sensory data. We further propose using prior-guided neural networks to utilize the often-abundant nominal data in the form of a prior loss, enabling the machine learning structure to comply more with process physics. The proposed methods are validated via rigorous experimental data sets of high-strength aluminum A205 parts, repeated k-fold cross-validation, and prior-guided validation. Using exclusively within hatch stripe data, we detect and localize porosity with a spherical equivalent diameter (SED) smaller than $$50.00\,\upmu $$ m with a classification accuracy of $$73.13\pm 1.57\%$$ This is the first work in the literature demonstrating in-situ localization of porosities as small as $$38.12\,\upmu m$$ SED and is more than a five-fold improvement on the smallest SED porosity localization via spectral emissions sensory data in the literature. In-situ localizing micro-porosity using exclusively within hatch-stripe data is a significant step towards within-layer defect mitigation, advanced process feedback control, and compliance with the reliability certification requirements of industries such as the aerospace industry.},

  abstract     = {Digital transformation is driving the current technological trends in manufacturing. An integral constituent is a communication between machines, between machines and humans, or between machines and products. This extensive communication involves large volumes of data. Many manufacturers apply data analytics (e.g., for quality management or improvement purposes) to translate the data into a business value. However, isolated, rigid, and area-specific IT solutions often carry this out. Today’s complex manufacturing requires quality management approaches that constitute a holistic view of and understanding of process–product interactions along the process chain instead of focusing solely on single processes. A novel platform approach to support quality management in manufacturing systems is proposed in this paper to overcome this deficit. It integrates state-of-the-art concepts of IT with modeling approaches for planning and operation of quality management. A conceptual framework and the technical architecture for implementing a digitalization platform are presented in this regard. Moreover, the approach is validated and implemented within a web application based on a use case of data-driven quality management in electronics production.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various anomaly detection tasks. Learning effective representations by solving a supervised pretext task with pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data provides a promising concept for industrial downstream tasks such as process monitoring. In this paper, we present SSMSPC a novel approach for multivariate statistical in-process control (MSPC) based on self-supervised learning. Our motivation for SSMSPC is to leverage the potential of unsupervised representation learning by incorporating self-supervised learning into the general statistical process control (SPC) framework to develop a holistic approach for the detection and localization of anomalous process behavior in discrete manufacturing processes. We propose a pretext task called Location + Transformation prediction, where the objective is to classify both, the type and the location of a randomly applied augmentation on a given time series input. In the downstream task, we follow the one-class classification setting and apply the Hotelling’s $$T^2$$ statistic on the learned representations. We further propose an extension to the control chart view that combines metadata with the learned representations to visualize the anomalous time steps in the process data which supports a machine operator in the root cause analysis. We evaluate the effectiveness of SSMSPC with two real-world CNC-milling datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches, achieving $$100\%$$ and $$99.6\%$$ AUROC, respectively. Lastly, we deploy SSMSPC at a CNC-milling machine to demonstrate its practical applicability when used as a process monitoring tool in a running process.},

  abstract     = {Automatic micro-defect detection is crucial for promoting efficiency in the production lines of patterned OLED panels. Recently, deep learning algorithms have emerged as promising solutions for micro-defect detection. However, in real-world industrial scenarios, the scarcity of training data or annotations results in a drop in performance. A multi-stage few-shot micro-defect detection approach is proposed for patterned OLED panels to deal with this problem. Firstly, we introduce a converter from defective to defect-free images based on our redesigned Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), aiming to inpaint defects with normal textures. Next, we exploit a region-growing method with automatic seed points to obtain the defect’s segmentation and geometric parameters in each image block. Reliable seed points are provided by structural similarity index maps between defective sub-blocks and reconstructed reference. Finally, a multi-scale Siamese neural network is proposed to identify the category of extracted defects. With our proposed approach, detection and classification results of defects can be obtained successively. Our experimental results on samples at different array processes demonstrate the superb adaptability of VQ-VAE, with a defect detection rate ranging from 90.0% to 96.0%. Additionally, compared with existing classification models, our multi-scale Siamese neural network exhibits an impressive 98.6% classification accuracy for a long-tailed defect dataset without overfitting. In summary, the proposed approach shows great potential for practical micro-defect detection in industrial scenarios with limited training data.},

Each production system uses a specific combination of processes, with each process belonging to a main process group. The combination of the processes and groups is subject to restrictions. Since the amount of possible combinations is too large to individually check for restrictions, we propose a Neural Network using an energy measurement derived from Hopfield networks. The proposed network memorizes former correct combinations and provides a recommendation score on how likely a new planned configuration is. Since processes can be paired with processes from their own group or with themselves, the Neural Network is modified to allow loops for joining vertices with themselves. This modification is achieved by adjusting the energy function of Hopfield networks to measure the activation of the combinations of clusters, meaning the edges, and not the activation of vertices during the training phase. We implemented the network for the process planning of factories of a leading European automotive manufacturer, and the results using correct, incorrect, and random process combinations indicate a strong capability of detecting anomalous process combinations.},

The PPO scheduling agent is trained based on an integration framework of discrete event simulation and deep reinforcement learning. Copies of trained agent can be linked with each machine for distributed control. Meanwhile, state features, actions and rewards are designed for scheduling at each decision point. Reward scaling are applied to improve the convergence performance. The numerical experiments are conducted on cases with different production configurations. The results show that PPO method can realize on-line decision making and provide better solution than dispatch rules and heuristics. It can achieve a balance between time and quality.

  abstract     = {In the process of industrial production, products with different specifications (i.e., the difference in geometry, process conditions, and machine conditions, etc.) have different quality data distributions, which lead to a decrease in the accuracy of traditional data-driven quality prediction models that require the same quality data distribution. At the same time, due to economic cost factors, obtaining a large amount of accumulated data for different specifications is difficult, and the re-modeling data accumulation of multiple cross-specifications is insufficient. In order to solve the quality prediction problem of production with different data distributions and poor data accumulation, we use the deep transfer learning (DTL) method with unsupervised dynamic domain adaptation (DDA) to transfer the domain invariant features learned from labeled specification products (source domain) to other unlabeled new specification products (target domain). In order to improve the success rate of cross-domain quality prediction, the Wasserstein distance adapter is designed to match appropriate source domain samples and target domain samples to build multiple transfer tasks that are suitable for transfer. At the same time, the dynamic distribution adaptation and dynamic adversarial adaptation are combined to extract the domain invariant features to improve the adaptability of the prediction model for products with new specifications (e.g., size difference) and unlabeled and limited quality data. Finally, a comprehensive experiment is carried out using the actual production data of products with different specifications. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional non-transfer deep learning methods, the MAE, RMSE, and R2 of the proposed DTL method are improved by 18.26%, 16.66%, and 22.48% respectively. Compared with other transfer methods, the MAE, RMSE, and R2 of the DTL proposed in this paper are improved by 10.45%, 10.96%, and 9.72% respectively.},

This paper predicts the tool wear progression based on cutting force signals in milling unidirectional (UD) CFRP with the fiber orientation effect. A deep learning model based on multi-channel 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is used, with the benefit of considering the unique force variation features due to the CFRP anisotropy. Milling experiments with the fiber orientations of 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° under different feed rates and cutting speeds were performed. The multi-channel 1D CNN obtains the force signal features from individual univariate time series, and combines the time-series information from all channels as the final feature representation in the final layer of the network. The LSTM layer extracts the temporal and spatial characteristics of the dynamic force signals. Moving window and distribution analysis techniques are applied to the predicted tool wear results to reduce the effect of force signal disturbance caused by CFRP inhomogeneity. The model achieves the tool wear prediction with R2 of 95.04% and MAE of 2.94 μm. Moreover, benefiting from its high feature representation capacity, the proposed method shows higher prediction accuracy for different cutting conditions with more than 25% improvement compared to other commonly used data-driven methods, including 1DCNN, 2DCNN, LSTM, BPNN, and SVR.},

  abstract     = {The development of advanced information technologies are paving the digital transformation of manufacturing systems, of which Digital Twin-based manufacturing system (DTMS) has become a prevailing topic attracted ever-increasing concerns from both industry and academia. As a cutting-edge smart manufacturing system, DTMS can improve manufacturing accuracy and efficiency based on high fidelity simulation, near real-time monitoring and control in a cyber-physical integrated manner. However, the connotation and boundary of DTMS lack a clear definition and systematic analysis. Therefore, this paper reviews the existing Digital Twin reference models and implementation architectures on manufacturing system, and further proposes a reference model of DTMS. Based on it, the characteristics and operational mechanism of DTMS are analyzed from three perspectives: hierarchy, dimension, and scale. Specifically, the composition of DTMS is described from a multi-level perspective, the specific characteristics of the DTMS are analyzed from a multi-dimensional perspective, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of the DTMS under different application scenarios are depicted from a multi-scale perspective, respectively. At last, the potential research directions of DTMS are highlighted in terms of reusability, interpretability and adaptability. It is envisioned that this work can provide a clear understanding with insightful knowledge to attract more in-depth research of DTMS.},

However, there is few review to systematically summarize and sort out these special image deep learning methods. In order to fill this gap, this paper concentrates on reviewing comprehensively the development of special image deep learning for mechanical equipment fault diagnosis in past 5 years. In general, a typical image fault diagnosis based on fault image deep learning generally consists of data acquisition, signal processing, model construction, feature learning and decision-making. Firstly, the method of signal preprocessing is introduced, and several common methods of converting signals into images are briefly compared and analyzed. Then, the principles and variants of deep learning models are expounded. Further more, the difficulties and challenges encountered at this stage are summarized.

  abstract     = {Manufacturing systems are becoming more sophisticated and expensive, particularly with the development of the intelligent industry. The complexity of the architecture and concept of Smart Manufacturing (SM) makes it vulnerable to several faults and failures that impact the entire behavior of the manufacturing system. It is crucial to find and detect any potential anomalies and faults as soon as possible because of the low tolerance for performance deterioration, productivity decline, and safety issues. To overcome these issues, a variety of approaches exist in the literature. However, the multitude of techniques make it difficult to choose the appropriate method in relation to a given context. This paper proposes a new architecture for a conceptual model of intelligent fault diagnosis and self-healing for smart manufacturing systems. Based on this architecture, a review method for the different approaches, sub-approaches and methods used to develop a Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) and Self-Healing-Fault-Tolerant (SH-FT) strategy dedicated to smart manufacturing is defined. Moreover, this paper reviews and analyzes more than 256 scientific articles on fault diagnosis and self-healing approaches and their applications in SM in the last decade. Finally, promising research directions in the field of resilient smart manufacturing are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Due to its unique benefits over standard conventional “subtractive” manufacturing, additive manufacturing is attracting growing interest in academic and industrial sectors. Here, special emphasis is given to wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), a directed energy deposition process that employs arc welding tools and wire to build metallic components by deposition of weld material. The WAAM process has several advantages, e.g., low cost, rapid deposition rate, and suitability for large complex metallic components. However, many WAAM challenges such as large welding deformation, undesirable porosity, and components with high residual stress remain to be overcome. Multidisciplinary cross-fusion research involving manufacturing, material science, automation control, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (ML) are deployed to overcome the above-mentioned problems. ML enables improved product quality control, process optimization, and modeling of complex multiphysics systems in the WAAM process. This research utilizes a data-driven literature review process, a defined and deliberate approach to localizing, evaluating, and analyzing published studies in the literature. The most relevant studies in the literature are analyzed using keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis. Numerous aspects of WAAM, including design for WAAM, material analytics/characterization, defect detection/monitoring, as well as process modeling and optimization, have been examined to identify state-of-the-art research in ML for WAAM. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for using ML in the WAAM process are identified and summarized.},

  abstract     = {Supervised classification methods have been widely utilized for the quality assurance of the advanced manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing (AM) for anomaly (defects) detection. However, since abnormal states (with defects) occur much less frequently than normal ones (without defects) in a manufacturing process, the number of sensor data samples collected from a normal state is usually much more than that from an abnormal state. This issue causes imbalanced training data for classification analysis, thus deteriorating the performance of detecting abnormal states in the process. It is beneficial to generate effective artificial sample data for the abnormal states to make a more balanced training set. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) using additive manufacturing process image sensor data. The novelty of our approach is that a standard GAN and classifier are jointly optimized with techniques to stabilize the learning process of standard GAN. The diverse and high-quality generated samples provide balanced training data to the classifier. The iterative optimization between GAN and classifier provides the high-performance classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by both open-source data and real-world case studies in polymer and metal AM processes.},

  abstract     = {The grinding process of transmission gear with worm grinding wheel usually relies on the manual parameter setting by experienced engineers, but the reliability and validity are quite hard to control due to many grinding factors that affect the surface quality (e.g. structure, size, and materials of gear, heat treatment process, surface accuracy requirements). Therefore, it is necessary to set up a decision system for assisting engineers with designing the process plan efficiently and reasonably. A modified model of the revision method based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network and case-based reasoning (CBR) considering evaluation index was proposed in this paper. A similar case retrieval mainly relies on the soft likelihood function considering a compound evaluation index model, where the score value of each new case execution test is converted into the corresponding index to achieve effective case storage. Process solutions for similar cases that perform better will be recommended from the case database by means of CBR. These candidates can be revised systematically based on a self-learning model. A modified RBF neural network trained by the existing cases will apply the learned experience to revise solution in part or in whole, which utilizes a self-filtering attribute method based on the correlation coefficient matrix so as to gain the primary attributes. In the case of the grinding gear with worm grinding wheel, the applicability of this technology was demonstrated. A decision-making system applying this method was developed by using.Net framework4.0 and SQL Server. Consequently, the technique can quickly generate a feasible process plan for specific gear.},

The proposed method in this work has demonstrated good accuracy in cell prediction within single droplet (presence/absence of cells) and low prediction error in determining number of cells within multiple droplets by reducing the error by a factor of $$\sqrt{N}$$ for N droplets measured in a batch. The performance of five different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree regressor, random forest regression, and extra tree regression were compared to determine the best algorithm for each type of application. The random forest regressor algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy at 80% in cell prediction (presence/absence of cells) within single droplets, while the extra tree regressor demonstrated the lowest mean error of 12% in predicting the number of printed cells within multiple droplets (e.g., 20 droplets on same spot).

  abstract     = {The early identification of a defect that is developing in a bearing is crucial for avoiding failures in rotating machinery. Frequency domain analysis of the vibration signals has been shown to contribute to a better understanding of the nature of a developing defect. Early signs of degradation might be more noticeable in certain frequency bands. The advantages in identifying and monitoring these bandwidths are several: prevention of serious machinery damages, reduction of the loss of investments, and improvement of the accuracy in failure predicting models. This paper presents and compares two approaches for the diagnosis of bearing faults. The first approach was knowledge-based. It relied on principles of mechanics to interpret the measured vibration signals and utilized prior knowledge of the bearing characteristics and testing parameters. The second approach was data-driven whereby data were acquired exclusively from the vibration signal. Both approaches were successfully applied for fault diagnosis by identifying the frequencies of the vibration spectra characteristic for the bearing under study. From this, bandwidths of interest for early fault detection could be determined. The diagnostic abilities of both approaches were studied to analyze and compare their individual strengths regarding the aspects of implementation time, domain knowledge, data processing associated knowledge, data requirements, diagnostic performance, and practical applicability. The advantages, apparent limitations as well as avenues for further improvement of both approaches are discussed.},

The database consists of simulation cases with the high-fidelity thermal-fluid flow model. Molten pool melting regime, keyhole stability and keyhole type are recognized with the neural net pattern recognition. With the Gaussian process regression model, the keyhole dimensions are predicted and the keyhole contour is reconstructed.

  abstract     = {Grinding tools can be used for over 90% of their lifetime, but most practical production tools are replaced between 50 and 80%. Accurate tool condition monitoring, which can monitor the quality of grinding tools, can improve product quality and reduce costs. The transfer learning technique can solve the data distribution and data deficiency issues of deep learning methods, enabling precise tool condition prediction in a grinding system. However, selecting the optimal pre-trained model is crucial for enhancing transfer learning performance due to the relationship between the source and target domains and the negative transfer problem. To address this issue, an encoding metric-based model selection technique was developed that accurately reflects the time series similarity between the remaining useful life (RUL) of the grinding tool and the encoding value and features between the pre-trained model and target data. Encoding metrics that reflect the critical characteristics of transfer learning, such as the target label, data, and pre-trained model, were computed to assess the pre-trained models directly. The target RUL and the extracted encoding values from the target input data and pre-trained models were compared using measurements and correlation to evaluate how closely they matched. The encoding selection method demonstrated superiority over the current source selection criteria, with encoding-based root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error, and dynamic time warping showing a high association with the approach (over a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.66). Furthermore, the method was independent of the quantity and quality of the sources, making it robust for various datasets. The experimental dataset was used to validate the pre-trained model&#39;s encoding RMSE selection method, and the method was verified with a strong correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.79). In conclusion, the proposed encoding metric-based model selection technique can improve both the efficiency and intelligence of the machining process in terms of both quantity (exchange periods) and quality of grinding tools. Accurate tool condition monitoring enabled by this technique can lead to enhanced product quality and reduced costs.},

Consequently, we propose a domain adaptive framework based on subspace and second-order statistical distribution alignment (SSDA) to overcome the issue of non-independently and identically distributed data shift. We combine the second-order statistical distribution alignment and subspace alignment. SSDA diminishes the geometric and statistical distribution discrepancies between the training and test sets in hand motions recognition. SSDA enhances the average accuracy of hand motions recognition by 26.66%, 14.43%, and 25.76% in three cross-domain scenarios (cross-gender, cross-circumstance, and cross-individual), respectively, compared with the baseline method of direct classification. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective in solving the problem of distribution shift between target data (test set) and priori data (training set) in hand motions recognition. Simultaneously, it improves the recognition accuracy of classifier for different distributed data, thereby providing a new idea for achieving efficient human–robot collaboration.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the influence of fidelity on the capability of digital twins (DT) to detect two common material extrusion (MEX) failures: extrusion error and layer shift. Monitoring of the failures is first explored using an image-based DT to provide a benchmark. The fidelity-performance analysis of DTs with significantly different levels of fidelity ranging from low to high fidelity is then studied and presented. In this paper, digital twin fidelity is defined as the expression of the necessary levels of accuracy in different attributes of the twin. The basis for the DTs employed in this study is image comparison. Consequently, six attributes are selected to describe the fidelity, including image resolution, mesh number, shadow method, illumination model, light source and state threshold. The effects of varying the fidelity of the six attributes on the capability to detect printing failures are then analysed and discussed. It is shown that, for the two failure cases considered, lower-fidelity DTs can deliver comparable capability to what are considered DTs with high or ultra-high fidelity. In addition, benefits in terms of configuration cost, data storage, simulation time, and detection time are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Assembly activity recognition and prediction help to improve productivity, quality control, and safety measures in smart factories. This study aims to sense, recognize, and predict a worker&#39;s continuous fine-grained assembly activities in a manufacturing platform. We propose a two-stage network for workers&#39; fine-grained activity classification by leveraging scene-level and temporal-level activity features. The first stage is a feature awareness block that extracts scene-level features from multi-visual modalities, including red–green–blue (RGB) and hand skeleton frames. We use the transfer learning method in the first stage and compare three different pre-trained feature extraction models. Then, we transmit the feature information from the first stage to the second stage to learn the temporal-level features of activities. The second stage consists of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers and a final classifier. We compare the performance of two different RNNs in the second stage, including the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The partial video observation method is used in the prediction of fine-grained activities. In the experiments using the trimmed activity videos, our model achieves an accuracy of &gt; 99% on our dataset and &gt; 98% on the public dataset UCF 101, outperforming the state-of-the-art models. The prediction model achieves an accuracy of &gt; 97% in predicting activity labels using 50% of the onset activity video information. In the experiments using an untrimmed video with continuous assembly activities, we combine our recognition and prediction models and achieve an accuracy of &gt; 91% in real time, surpassing the state-of-the-art models for the recognition of continuous assembly activities.},

  abstract     = {In order to achieve rapid inference and generalization results, the majority of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic segmentation models strive to mine high-level features that contain rich contextual semantic information. However, at steel plate defects detection scenario, some background textures’ noises are similar to the foreground leading to hard distinguishment, which will significantly interfere with feature extraction. Texture features themselves often hold the most plentiful contextual information. Despite this, semantic segmentation tasks rarely take texture features into account when identifying surface defects on steel plates. In that case, the essential details, such as the edge texture and other intuitive low-level features, will generally cannot be included into the final feature map. To address the problems of inefficient accuracy and slow speed of existing detection, this study proposed a steel plate surface defect detection method using contextual information and attention mechanism, and utilizes a multi-layer feature extraction method and fusion framework based on low-level statistical textures. Through the identification of pixel-level spatial and correlation relationships, characteristics of low-level defects are extracted. Furthermore, to effectively incorporate statistical texture in CNN, a novel quantization technique has been developed. This quantization method allows for the conversion of continuous texture into various levels of intensity. The network parameters were iterated in a gradient direction, facilitating the defects division. Empirical results have demonstrated the feasibility of applying the proposed approach to practical steel plate testing. Additionally, ablation experiments have demonstrated that the method is capable of effectively enhancing surface defect detection for steel plates, resulting in industry-leading performance.},

  abstract     = {The joint optimisation of product design configuration (PDC) for new and remanufactured products involves specification upgrading for parts recovered from used product returns. Reversely, the specification upgrading decision for used parts/modules is also affected by the original specifications selected for parts/modules during the new product design process. Hence, the joint optimisation of PDC for both new and remanufactured products entails a hierarchical decision framework, of which scarcely any study involves the specification upgrading concerns. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a bilevel optimisation model that involves two-level decision-making. The upper level handles the configuration of new product variants to maximise the shared surplus of new product offerings. Meanwhile, the lower-level deals with the configuration and specification upgrading of remanufactured product variants to maximise the shared surplus of remanufactured product offerings. A non-linear integer bilevel programming is further presented to model the hierarchical optimisation problem, to solve which a nested bilevel genetic algorithm is also proposed. Furthermore, a case study involving configuration design for new and remanufactured mobile phone variants is conducted to validate the proposed model. Four scenarios are investigated to examine the effects of model parameters on the optimal solutions with the simulation result given at last.},

Blocking occurs when a completed item or product remains on the machine until the next machine is available. We proposed a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm: the Genetic Iterated Greedy Algorithm (GIGA). In our innovative solution approach, a genetic algorithm presents a hybrid crossover based on the Iterated Greedy metaheuristic. The hybrid crossover considers the Hamming distance as an indicator of the diversity of the current population. In the first generations, the crossover will adopt larger values for the destruction parameter, and this value is gradually reduced throughout the search process. Our proposal is compared to four competitive metaheuristics reported for earliness and tardiness flowshop. Two performance indicators are considered: the Average Relative Percentage Deviation (ARPD) and the Success Rate (SR). Based on the statistical analysis of the computational experimentation, our GIGA outperformed all the implemented algorithms of the literature with statistical significance. Concerning the performance indicators, GIGA achieved ARPD = 0.02% and SR = 83.5%, pointing to the superiority of the proposed solution approach.},

  abstract     = {In the robot finishing process of the assembly interface of large aerospace cylindrical components (short for assembly interface), to realize the high-precision and high-efficiency pose perception of the large component, an intelligent pose measurement method for the large component is proposed based on binocular vision and priori data. In this method, the global coordinate system of the robot finishing system is initially established using laser tracking measurement method and customized reference plates, giving a unified coordinate transformation datum for the interoperation of the finishing system&#39;s subsystems. Then, utilizing deep learning and digital image processing technologies, an algorithm for recognizing and locating key features of the large component is developed, which can realize the identification of key feature types and accurate localization of feature centroids. Following that, the global coordinate of the key feature centroid is determined using the proposed binocular vision three-dimensional (3D) coordinate reconstruction method. Meanwhile, by introducing the priori processing data of the large component to match the 3D reconstruction coordinates of the key feature centroids, the spatial pose of the large component can be calculated with high precision. Finally, the proposed method is experimentally validated using a case study of a large aerospace cylindrical component. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve high-precision pose measurement of the large component, which can provide pose data support for the adjustment or modification of the cutting path of the robot that is generated by the as-designed model of the large component, to ensure the correctness of the robotic machining of the assembly interface, and thus the proposed method can meet the robot finishing needs of the large component.},

Despite the fact that many studies have been done on RGB image completion and super-resolution, a key issue with depth images is that there will be evident jagged boundaries and a significant loss of geometric information. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-scale progressive fusion network for depth image completion and super-resolution in this paper, which has an asymptotic structure for integrating hierarchical features in different domains. We employ two separate branches to learn the features of a multi-scale image given a depth image and its corresponding RGB image. The extracted features are then fused into different level features of these two branches using a step-by-step strategy to recreate the final depth image. To confine distinct borders and geometric features, a multi-dimension loss is also designed. Extensive depth completion and super-resolution studies reveal that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed methods are also applied to two human–robot interaction applications, including a remote-controlled robot based on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), AR-based toolpath planning, and automatic toolpath extraction.

  abstract     = {Increasing numbers of lithium-ion batteries for new energy vehicles that have been retired pose a threat to the ecological environment, making their disassembly and recycling methods a research priority. Due to the variation in models and service procedures, numerous lithium-ion battery brands, models, and retirement states exist. This uncertainty contributes to the complexity of the disassembly procedure, which calls for a great deal of adaptability. Human–Robot Collaboration Disassembly (HRCD) mode maximizes the advantages of both humans and robots, progressively replacing single-person disassembly and single-machine disassembly to become the standard method for disassembling end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the HRCD process has more dimensions and uncertainties. In light of the obstacles above, this paper developed an HRCD environment with virtual and real interaction functions, which recommended real-time cooperation strategies in the dynamic production process and significantly enhanced the flexibility of disassembly operations. Based on the genetic algorithm (GA), the Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) is developed for waste LIBs in the source domain and imported into the knowledge base. Then, the rapid adaptive generation of HRCD task strategy for LIBs is generated, utilizing the transfer learning approach in the target domain. Two types of end-of-life automobile LIBs are analyzed as case study products. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could plan an effective action sequence, effectively reduce the design time of the target domain disassembly strategy, and enhance the flexibility of HRCD.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative robots (cobots) have the potential to augment the productivity and life quality of human operators in the context of Industry 4.0 by providing them with physical assistance. For this reason, it is necessary to define the relationship between humans and cobots and to study how the two agents adapt to each other. However, to the best of our knowledge, literature is still missing insight into how humans perceive and react to changes in the cobot behavior (e.g. changes in the learned trajectory and in the role the robot assumes). Specifically, a study of how humans adapt to changing roles and control strategies of collaborating robots is missing. To fill this gap, we propose a human study in which 16 participants executed a collaborative human–robot sawing task where the cobot altered between three different control strategies. We examined human adaptation when cobot suddenly changed the control strategy from one to another, resulting in six experimental conditions. The experiments were performed on a setup involving Kuka LBR iiwa robotic arm. The results suggest that transition influences movement performance in the early stages and at steady state, subjects prefer to abandon modes that require more effort and they adapt faster to energy-demanding modes. Finally, for the specific task we studied, subjects tend to prefer collaborative modes to ones in which the robot assumes a fixed role.},

Current online and offline robot programming methods are difficult to use and require extensive experience or skills. On the other hand, the manufacturing industries are experiencing a labor shortage. An essential question, therefore, is: how would a new robot programming method help novice users complete complex tasks effectively, efficiently, and intuitively? To answer this question, we proposed HA $$R^{2}$$ bot, a novel human-centered augmented reality programming interface with awareness of cognitive load. Using NASA’s system design theory and the cognitive load theory, a set of guidelines for designing an AR-based human-robot interaction system is obtained through a human-centered design process. Based on these guidelines, we designed and implemented a human-in-the-loop workflow with features for cognitive load management. The effectiveness and efficiency of HA $$R^{2}$$ bot are verified in two complex tasks compared with existing online programming methods. We also evaluated HA $$R^{2}$$ bot quantitatively and qualitatively through a user study with 16 participants. According to the user study, compared with existing methods, HA $$R^{2}$$ bot has higher efficiency, a lower overall cognitive load, lower cognitive loads for each type, and higher safety.},

The decreased cost of sensors and connectivity enabled increasing digitalization of manufacturing. In addition, artificial intelligence enables higher degrees of automation, reducing overall costs and time required for defect inspection. This research compares three active learning approaches, having single and multiple oracles, to visual inspection. Six new metrics are proposed to assess the quality of calibration without the need for ground truth. Furthermore, this research explores whether existing calibrators can improve performance by leveraging an approximate ground truth to enlarge the calibration set. The experiments were performed on real-world data provided by Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV. Our results show that the explored active learning settings can reduce the data labeling effort by between three and four percent without detriment to the overall quality goals, considering a threshold of p = 0.95. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed calibration metrics successfully capture relevant information otherwise available to metrics used up to date only through ground truth data. Therefore, the proposed metrics can be used to estimate the quality of models’ probability calibration without committing to a labeling effort to obtain ground truth data.},

How IAS affect work characteristics which are crucial for promoting work motivation of employees is yet unclear. Based on the cyber-physical systems transformation framework, the model of routine-biased technological change, and a comprehensive model of work design, we expected in- and decreases in motivational work characteristics (MWC) when working with IAS. Furthermore, we posited a buffering effect of the option of voluntary use on decreasing knowledge characteristics. Applying an online case study with experimental vignette methodology (EVM) allowed us to identify effects of the IAS on MWC before it is widely implemented. 203 German and British blue-collar workers evaluated an assembly workplace according to three experimental conditions (work without IAS, work with IAS, work with voluntary use of IAS). We identified enhanced feedback from the job and information processing in work with IAS in contrast to a traditional assembly workplace but found no restrictions (or elevations) in terms of other task (i.e., autonomy) or knowledge characteristics (i.e., job complexity, problem solving, specialization, skill variety). Thus, our results indicate that the IAS improves some motivational work characteristics of the assembly workplace, although it misses the primary goal of cognitive relief. Our study highlights the need for work design theories that specify the effect of IAS on motivational work characteristics and the potential benefit of IAS in assembly of the future.},

  abstract     = {Smart factories build on cyber-physical systems as one of the most promising technological concepts. Within smart factories, condition-based and predictive maintenance are key solutions to improve competitiveness by reducing downtimes and increasing the overall equipment effectiveness. Besides, the growing interest towards operation flexibility has pushed companies to introduce novel solutions on the shop floor, leading to install cobots for advanced human-machine collaboration. Despite their reliability, also cobots are subjected to degradation and functional failures may influence their operation, leading to anomalous trajectories. In this context, the literature shows gaps in what concerns a systematic adoption of condition-based and predictive maintenance to monitor and predict the health state of cobots to finally assure their expected performance. This work proposes an approach that leverages on a framework for fault detection and diagnostics of cobots inspired by the Prognostics and Health Management process as a guideline. The goal is to habilitate first-level maintenance, which aims at informing the operator about anomalous trajectories. The framework is enabled by a modular structure consisting of hybrid series modelling of unsupervised Artificial Intelligence algorithms, and it is assessed by inducing three functional failures in a 7-axis collaborative robot used for pick and place operations. The framework demonstrates the capability to accommodate and handle different trajectories while notifying the unhealthy state of cobots. Thanks to its structure, the framework is open to testing and comparing more algorithms in future research to identify the best-in-class in each of the proposed steps given the operational context on the shop floor.},

Among the enabling technologies of I4.0, collaborative robots (cobots) push factory reconfiguration and prompt for worker empowerment by exploiting the respective assets of both humans and robots. Indeed, human has superior dexterity, flexibility, problem-solving ability. Robot excels in strength, endurance, accuracy and is expendable for risky activities. Therefore, task assignment problem in a production line with coexisting humans and robots cannot limit to the workload balancing among workers but should make the most of everyone respective abilities. The outcomes should not be only an increased productivity, but also improved production quality, human safety and well-being. Task assignment strategy should rely on a comprehensive assessment of the tasks from the viewpoint of suitability to humans or robots. As there are several conflicting evaluation criteria, often qualitative, the study defines the set of criteria, their metrics and proposes a method for task classification relying on Fuzzy Inference System to map each task onto a set of collaboration classes. The outcome of the study is the formal description of a set of evaluation criteria with their metrics. Another outcome is a Fuzzy Classification procedure that support production managers to properly consider all the criteria in the assignment of the tasks. The proposed methodology was tested on a case study derived from a manual manufacturing process to demonstrate its application during the process planning.},

In the present paper, we addresse this issue and introduce a generic multi-task learning-based optimization approach. The approach enables the identification of sets of highly diverse microstructures for given desired properties and corresponding tolerances. Basically, the approach consists of an optimization algorithm that interacts with a machine learning model that combines multi-task learning with siamese neural networks. The resulting model (1) relates microstructures and properties, (2) estimates the likelihood of a microstructure of being producible, and (3) performs a distance preserving microstructure feature extraction in order to generate a lower dimensional latent feature space to enable efficient optimization. The proposed approach is applied on a crystallographic texture optimization problem for rolled steel sheets given desired properties.},

  abstract     = {Online chatter detection is crucial to ensure the quality and safety of the high-speed milling process. The rapid development of the deep learning community provides a promising tool for chatter detection. However, most previous chatter detection studies rely on complex signal processing techniques, leading to the separation of feature extraction and chatter detection and reducing detection efficiency. Additionally, these studies are developed for a limited range of machining conditions because the development of their model relies on experimental data, while performing experiments with numerous combinations of machining parameters is expensive and time-consuming. To tackle these drawbacks, this paper proposes a transfer learning chatter detection framework that doesn’t rely on any experimental data. The proposed framework is composed of the dynamic milling process model, the Double Attention-driven One-Dimension Convolutional Neural Networks (DAOCNN), and the ensemble prediction strategy. Firstly, a dynamic milling process model is established to generate simulated cutting force signals over a wide range of machining parameters, providing abundant training data and saving experimental costs. Then, without any complex signal processing method, the detection results are directly predicted by the proposed DAOCNN from the time-domain signals, eliminating the separation of feature extraction and chatter detection. Finally, a novel ensemble prediction strategy is proposed to ensure an accurate and robust prediction. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, actual milling experiments are carried out under different cutting conditions. Moreover, contrastive studies with other detection approaches and ensemble methods are also performed. The results demonstrate that the milling stability is correctly predicted by the proposed method in an accurate and efficient manner, which indicates the proposed framework can be a promising tool for online chatter detection.},

Specifically, the proposed method takes the part feature geometry, material properties, and quality information contained in a part design as inputs and trains the deep neural network model to predict the manufacturing process label as output. We present an example implementation of the proposed method using a synthesized dataset to illustrate automatic manufacturing process selection. The performance of the proposed model is compared with the performance of interpretable data-driven classification methods such as decision trees and random forests. By comparing the performance with different combinations of input information to be included during training, it is evident that part quality information is necessary for characterizing the capabilities of finishing processes while material information further improves the model’s ability to discriminate between the different process capabilities.

Geometric accuracy and spatial distribution of scaffold porosity are critical factors associated with the quality of bio-printed tissue scaffolds. Determining optimal process parameters for tissue scaffold microextrusion 3D printing by traditional trial-and-error approaches is costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. In addition, effective in-process sensing techniques are needed to observe internal multilayer scaffold structures, such as porosity. Therefore, an in-process sensing platform based on integrated light scanning and microscopy was proposed to acquire in-process layer information during the fabrication of polymeric and hydrogel scaffolds. This work implements a customized sensing platform consisting of a 3D scanner and digital microscope for in-process quality monitoring of tissue scaffold biofabrication that provides in situ characterization of each printed layer’s quality conditions (e.g., porosity). The proposed sensor-based in-process quality monitoring system can accurately capture layerwise porosity quality. Design of experiments (DoE) experimental analysis yielded a set of optimal process parameters that significantly improved the geometric accuracy and compressive modulus of thermoplastic- and hydrogel-based tissue scaffolds. The developed sensing system coupled with the DoE approach enables effective process parameter optimization to fabricate porous 3D-printed tissue scaffolds.

  abstract     = {Metal packaging is an alternative technology to guarantee the environmental resistance and the performance reliability of ICs. Surface defect inspection of IC metal packages is an indispensable process during manufacturing. Here, a statistical modeling framework is proposed based on a GAN for surface defect inspection of IC metal packages, which involves several adaptive schemes. To the best of our knowledge, we first introduce the GAN to establish a machine vision based method for surface defect inspection of IC metal packages. IC metal package images are automatically acquired by an AOI system and employed for inspection via the proposed framework. To tackle the problem of imbalanced data in real industries, the framework only utilizes qualified samples to train the GAN template generator, which can characterize the intrinsic pattern of qualified samples. Then, a weight mask scheme is proposed to suppress the interference pixels in the difference image corresponding to qualified samples. Next, an adaptive thresholding scheme is proposed to adaptively determine an appropriate threshold for each inspected sample. Finally, an image patch-based defect evaluation scheme is designed to local-to-global evaluate the surface qualities of IC metal packages. Comparison experiments indicate that the proposed framework achieves better inspection performance in terms of 3.16% error rate and 0.89% mission rate at a reasonable inspection time of 119.86 ms per sample, which is superior to some existing deep learning based inspection methods for surface defect inspection of IC metal packages.},

However, most deep learning models that have been widely applied in automated inspection cannot objectively explain the results. Their resulting outcome, known as low interpretability, creates difficulties in finding the root cause of errors and improving the accuracy of the model. This research proposes an integrative method that combines a deep learning object detection model, a clustering algorithm, and a similarity algorithm to achieve an explainable automated detection process. An electronic embroidery case study demonstrates the explainable method, which can quickly be debugged to enhance accuracy. The results show an accuracy during testing of 97.58% with inspection time reduced by 25.93%. This proposed method resolves several challenges involved with automated inspection and digital transformation. Academically, the automated detection deep learning model proposed in this study has high accuracy along with good interpretability and debugability. In practice, this process can speed up the inspection process while saving human effort.},

  abstract     = {Classifying and grading the product relied on human vision has caused the poor quality products and low productivity. Due to their complicated defects, most ceramic tile factories still have relied on human vision to deal with the problem. Developing an optimal model for automatically detecting and classifying the defects is still a challenge to the companies and the researchers. Thus, this study aims to propose a multi-subpopulation genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (MSGA-CNN) which can automatically generate an optimal convolutional neural network (CNN) including both structure and its parameters for ceramic tile defect detection and classification based on surface images. In particular, a chromosome represents a CNN model including number of convolution layers, pooling layers, dropout rate, fully connected layers and the parameters of each layer. These structures and parameters of CNN models are optimized based on evolution processes with special encoding routine, crossover and mutation, and different selection methods. To enhance the searching ability, multi-subpopulation technique is employed in the evolution progress. In addition, a local heuristics is designed to prevent the best solution being stuck in a local optimum. A database of ceramic tile surface images was constructed for validating the proposed approach. The results have shown the efficiency of MSGA-CNN compared with other existing algorithms.},

However, due to the limited measurement range, the existing 3D reconstruction methods are diffcult to measure the large workpiece. The self-similar structure of workpiece also results in the low performance of existing 3D registration methods. To address the above problems, the point cloud registration system based on super-point space guidance is proposed by combining fringe projection profilometry (FPP) and point cloud registration technology to register multi-view point clouds of large workpiece. Specifically, to reduce the impact of self-similar structure on registration, we utilize spatial compatibility to partition the point clouds into local super-point space pairs, based on which to guide the multi-scale feature extraction network (MFENet) to mine effective super-point features, then the super-point features with high confidence is selected to estimate the optimal pose matrix. Experimental results show our registration error measured by standard ball is 0.024 mm, and the point cloud of large workpiece we measured reach the accuracy level of laser tracker. In addition, the registration recall of our system at higher accuracy thresholds is 95%, which demonstrates the high reliability of the method for accuracy-critical applications.},

  abstract     = {The manufacture of large wind turbine blades requires well-controlled processing conditions to prevent defect formation and thus produce high-quality composite blades. While the physics-based models provide accurate computational capabilities for the resin infusion and curing process for the glass fiber composites, they suffer from high computational costs, making them infeasible for fast optimization computation and process control during manufacturing. In light of the limitations, we describe a machine learning (ML) approach that employs a deep convolutional and recurrent neural network model to predict the spatio-temporal temperature distribution during the vacuum assisted resin infusion molding (VARIM) process. The ML model is trained with the “big data” generated from the physics-based high-fidelity simulations. Once fully trained, it serves as a digital twin of the blade manufacturing process. Validation is made by comparing simulation results with experimental data on a unidirectional glass fiber composite laminate plate (44 plies, 2 m long and 0.5 m wide). The trained and validated ML model is then extended to evaluate the role of critical VARIM processing parameters on temperature distribution. With the predictive accuracy of 94%, at over 100 times faster computational speed than the physics-based simulations, the ML approach established herein provides a general framework for a digital twin for temperature distribution in the composite manufacturing process.},

Past research approaches utilized a plethora of machine learning models to infer the punch wear state from suitable process signals, but have been limited by the lack of industrial-grade process setups and sample sizes as well as their insufficient interpretability. This work seeks to address these limitations by proposing the sheared surface of the scrap web as a proxy for the punch wear and modeling its quality from acoustic emission signals. The experimental work was carried out in an industrial-grade fine blanking process setting. Evaluation of the model performances suggests that the utilized regression models are capable of modeling the relationship between acoustic emission signal features and sheared surface quality of the scrap webs. Subsequent model inference suggests adhesive wear on the punch as a root cause for the sheared surface impairment of the scrap webs. This work represents the most extensive modeling effort on indirect punch wear monitoring in sheet-metal stamping both from a model prediction and model inference perspective known to the authors.},

Data generation-based strategy provides a solution by expanding the number of minority samples. However, many data-generation methods cannot generate high-quality samples when the imbalanced ratio is high. To address these problems, a dual-attention feature fusion network (DAFFN) with two-stream hybrid-generated data is proposed. First, the two-stream hybrid generator including a generative model and an oversampling technique is adopted to generate minority fault data. Then, the convolutional neural network is used to extract features from hybrid-generated data. In particular, a feature fusion network with a dual-attention mechanism, i.e., a channel attention mechanism and a layer attention mechanism are designed to learn channel-level and layer-level weights of the features. Extensive results on two bearing datasets indicate that the proposed framework achieves outstanding performance in various high imbalanced-ratio cases.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of porosity is a crucial task for metal based additive manufacturing techniques such as laser powder bed fusion. Short wave infrared thermography as an in-situ monitoring tool enables the measurement of the surface radiosity during the laser exposure. Based on the thermogram data, the thermal history of the component can be reconstructed which is closely related to the resulting mechanical properties and to the formation of porosity in the part. In this study, we present a novel framework for the local prediction of porosity based on extracted features from thermogram data. The framework consists of a data pre-processing workflow and a supervised deep learning classifier architecture. The data pre-processing workflow generates samples from thermogram feature data by including feature information from multiple subsequent layers. Thereby, the prediction of the occurrence of complex process phenomena such as keyhole pores is enabled. A custom convolutional neural network model is used for classification. The model is trained and tested on a dataset from thermographic in-situ monitoring of the manufacturing of an AISI 316L stainless steel test component. The impact of the pre-processing parameters and the local void distribution on the classification performance is studied in detail. The presented model achieves an accuracy of 0.96 and an f1-Score of 0.86 for predicting keyhole porosity in small sub-volumes with a dimension of (700 × 700 × 50) µm3. Furthermore, we show that pre-processing parameters such as the porosity threshold for sample labeling and the number of included subsequent layers are influential for the model performance. Moreover, the model prediction is shown to be sensitive to local porosity changes although it is trained on binary labeled data that disregards the actual sample porosity.},

At last, a case study of DTVA-based anomaly detection, which focuses on the abnormality detection of crane operation status, is presented.

To do this, the objective function of the proposed GA algorithm is to minimize the total cost. The proposed GA constraints are the tolerance equations of functional requirements considering difficulty coefficients. The manufacturing difficulty computation is based on tools for the study and analysis of reliability of the design or the process, as the Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and Ishikawa diagram. The proposed approach, based on combining the Difficulty Coefficient Computation (DCC) and the GA optimization method produces the GADCC tool. This model is applied on mechanical assemblies taken from the literature and compared to previous methods regarding tolerance values and computed total cost. This comparative study highlights the benefits of the accomplished GADCC optimization method.

  abstract     = {Detecting defects in welds used in critical or non-critical industrial applications is of intense interest. Several non-destructive inspection methods are available, each allowing the preservation of the integrity of the sample under analysis. However, visual-based inspection methods are the most well-assessed, which usually require human experts to inspect each sample, looking for shallow defects. This process often requires time and effort by the human operator, therefore not allowing to perform real-time defect identification, which may result in unexpected (and undesired) production costs. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to automatically deal with visual-based inspection, mainly through convolutional neural networks. However, while effective, these models require a lot of data and computational power to be trained, which is also time-consuming. This paper proposes a high-throughput data gathering and processing method using laser profilometry, along with an automatic defect detection method based on lightweight machine learning algorithms. Six different machine and deep learning approaches are compared, including SVMs, decision forests, and neural networks, achieving a top-1 accuracy of $$99.79\%$$ for defect identification and $$99.71\%$$ for defect categorization. Thanks to its effectiveness and the high data throughput achievable by data gathering, the whole method can be implemented in real production lines to minimize costs and perform real-time monitoring and defects assessment.},

One of the most common defects is porosity, which is detrimental to the mechanical and fatigue properties of the product. To guarantee the product quality, it is important to detect its occurrence. In this research, a strategy was developed to detect the occurrence of porosity and to identify its root cause. To develop a porosity detection strategy, a monitoring set-up was designed in which the WAAM process is monitored by a current sensor, condenser microphone, structural Acoustic Emission sensor, spectrometer and flow meter. Seventeen experiment samples were produced and the sensor data were stored using a data acquisition system. A sensor data analysis showed that current and acoustic signals could be correlated with the occurrence of porosity. From these sensor signals, 74 features were extracted. A validation of the samples, based on milling, grinding and image processing, was developed to obtain the pore density values for the corresponding feature set. A long short-term memory neural network was trained through supervised learning to classify feature data into acceptable or non-acceptable pore densities. A test accuracy of 82.52% was achieved. Apart from the porosity detection, a strategy for porosity root cause detection was developed in order to distinguish between process related porosity and contaminant related porosity. An accuracy of 90.67% was achieved, whereby the remaining inaccuracy is interpreted as a physical phenomenon and the results from the model are interpreted actually as more accurate than the prior assumption of the training labels.},

This study proposes a novel recognition method for the general machining feature of 2.5-axis, one of the basic and commonly encountered feature types in manufacture industries. A novel ray fading algorithm is proposed to calculate the feature machining direction, and the type of 2.5-axis machining features is determined by both machining direction and topology.

The framework consists of three main parts: data acquisition and processing, an evolution triggering mechanism and an evolution algorithm. A formal description of the dynamic evolution of a black box digital twin is also given. Furthermore, by synthetically considering the computational accuracy and efficiency, we design an incremental external attention temporal convolution network (IExATCN) model to instantiate the proposed framework. Finally, the significance of digital twin dynamic evolution and the effectiveness of the IExATCN is verified by 3D equipment attitude estimation datasets.},

  abstract     = {A new generation of Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) virtualises their Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in the cloud deploying 5G-based communication infrastructures to provide ultra-fast and reliable links between the AGV and its PLC. Stopping an AGV can result in a loss of tens of thousands of euros per minute and therefore, the use of machine learning techniques to anticipate AGV behavior seems to be appropriate. This work proposes the application of advanced deep neural networks to forecast AGV trajectory errors even if disturbances appear in the 5G network by capturing the packets of the PLC-AGV connection and not using any sensor in the user equipment (AGV or PLC), which facilitates the real-time deployment of the solution. To demonstrate the proposed solution, an industrial AGV and a virtualised PLC were deployed in a real 5G network. Furthermore, a set of advanced deep learning architectures was selected, and an extensive collection of experiments was designed to analyse the forecasting performance of each architecture. Additionally, we discuss the real-time issues that appeared during the execution of the best models in a 5G open laboratory, that provided a realistic deployment in a controlled scenario.},

  abstract     = {In highly automated manufacturing systems running 24/7, preventive maintenance activities need to be executed during production times. Flexible job shops with several identical machines generally bear the potential to compensate temporary machine unavailability times caused by preventive maintenance without a considerable increase of the makespan due to machine paralleling. However, this requires sophisticated scheduling of manufacturing jobs and the assignment of maintenance activities over the scheduling horizon. This work, therefore, introduces a mixed-integer program that models both job scheduling and maintenance activity assignment. A local search algorithm is developed to solve both problems in an integrated way. Numerical studies are carried out based on data from a real flexible job shop in the automotive industry with 78 machines and four products. The results show that joint job scheduling and maintenance activity assignment is required to obtain a makespan similar to the makespan without maintenance consideration. Non-sophisticated scheduling of maintenance windows can increase the makespan by more than 20 percentage points compared to sophisticated scheduling. Besides, we show that only a limited amount of maintenance activities can be compensated and that higher unavailability times will inevitably lead to detrimental effects on the makespan unless maintenance worker capacity is increased.},

  abstract     = {3D printing and 3D printing technology are increasingly popular in today’s world. However, there have not been many studies evaluating the quality of 3D printed products in real-life applications. This manuscript proposes a parameter for monitoring deterioration conditions of 3D printed plastic structures based on a multilayer perceptron network, using power spectral density (PSD) under a moving load. To create deterioration phenomena in the 3D printed plastic beam structures, simulations with cracks that change the stiffness of the structure are conducted. The features presented in this manuscript are constructed from the alteration forms of power spectral density used to detect the deterioration of a 3D printed plastic structure, accomplished by creating damage in beams and using a multilayer perceptron network in an input training dataset. Under these circumstances, the power spectral density is established by vibration signals obtained from acceleration sensors scattered along the 3D printed plastic beams. The results in this manuscript show that differences in the shapes of the PSD attributable to damage are more noticeable than those in the value of the basic beam frequency. This means that adjustments of shape in PSD will better allow the detection of damage in different 3D printed plastic beam structures. The determination of defects on 3D printed plastic beams by the power spectral density method has been used in research. However, the application of this deep learning model presents many new and positive effects.},

Although highly optimized, process disruptions can still lead to undesired final mechanical properties. This paper demonstrates advances in pass schedule design based on reinforcement learning and analytical rolling models to guarantee sound product quality. Integrating an established physical strengthening model into an analytical rolling model allows tracking the microstructure evolution throughout the process, and furthermore the prediction of the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the rolled sheet. The trained reinforcement learning algorithm Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) automatically proposes pass schedules by drawing upon established scheduling rules combined with novel rule sets to maximize the final mechanical properties. The designed pass schedule is trialed using a laboratory rolling mill while the predicted properties are confirmed using micrographs and materials testing. Due to its fast calculation time, prospectively this technique can be extended to also account for significant process disruptions such as longer inter-pass times by adapting the pass schedule online to still reach the desired mechanical properties and avoid scrapping of the material.},

Signal characterizations in time, frequency, and time–frequency domains are first constructed to make full use of information contained in severely limited labeled data. Mahalanobis distance is proposed as a criterion for improving classification performance by considering different spreads between classes in the embedding space. The spread variance of each class is learned by constructing an additional deep learning network in the original prototypical network. Multidomain signals are used to learn the prototype representations and spread variances separately, and are finally fused for classification. With the proposed MVPN, deeper variance-learnable embedding learning from wider domain characterizations improves the ability of few-shot fault diagnosis. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of MVPN using datasets collected from a benchmark bearing and a Delta 3-D printer. Results indicate that the proposed MVPN performs competitively compared to state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning with considering data privacy-preservation and personalized models has received attentions, especially in the manufacturing field. The data often exist in the form of isolated islands and cannot be shared because of data privacy in real industrial scenarios. It is difficult to gather the data to train a personalized model without compromising data privacy. To address this issue, we proposed a Federated Transfer Learning framework based on Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks named ACGAN-FTL. In the framework, Federated Learning (FL) trains a global model on decentralized datasets of the clients with data privacy-preservation and Transfer Learning (TL) transfers the knowledge from the global model to a personalized model with a relatively small data volume. ACGAN acts as a data bridge to connect FL and TL by generating similar probability distribution data of clients since the client datasets in FL cannot be directly used in TL for data privacy-preservation. A real industrial scenario of pre-baked carbon anode quality prediction is applied to verify the performance of the proposed framework. The results show that ACGAN-FTL can not only obtain acceptable performance on 0.81 accuracy, 0.86 precision, 0.74 recall, and 0.79 F1 but also ensure data privacy-preservation in the whole learning process. Compared to the baseline method without FL and TL, the former metrics have increased by 13%, 11%, 16%, and 15% respectively. The experiments verify that the performance of the proposed ACGAN-FTL framework fulfills the requirements of industrial scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Over the past several decades, metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) has transitioned from a rapid prototyping method to a viable manufacturing tool. AM technologies can produce parts on-demand, repair damaged components, and provide an increased freedom of design not previously attainable by traditional manufacturing techniques. The increasing maturation of metal AM is attracting high-value industries to directly produce components for use in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, and energy fields. Two leading processes for metal part production are Powder Bed Fusion with laser beam (PBF-LB/M) and Directed Energy Deposition with laser beam (DED-LB/M). Despite the many advances made with these technologies, the highly dynamic nature of the process frequently results in the formation of defects. These technologies are also notoriously difficult to control, and the existing machines do not offer closed loop control. In the present work, the application of various Machine Learning (ML) approaches and in-situ monitoring technologies for the purpose of defect detection are reviewed. The potential of these methods for enabling process control implementation is discussed. We provide a critical review of trends in the usage of data structures and ML algorithms and compare the capabilities of different sensing technologies and their application to monitoring tasks in laser metal AM. The future direction of this field is then discussed, and recommendations for further research are provided.},

This approach for making lot sizing decisions considers multiple conflicting objective functions and incorporates a decision maker’s preferences to find the most preferred Pareto optimal solutions. DESMILS applies clustering, and items in one cluster are treated utilizing preferences that the decision maker has provided for a representative item of the cluster. Thus, the decision maker provides preferences to solve the single-item lot sizing problem for few items only and not for every item. The lot sizes are obtained by solving a multiobjective optimization problem with an interactive method, which iteratively incorporates preference information and supports the decision maker in learning about the trade-offs involved. As a proof of concept to demonstrate the behavior of DESMILS, we solve a multi-item lot sizing problem of a manufacturing company utilizing their real data. We describe how the supply chain manager as the decision maker found Pareto optimal lot sizes for 94 items by solving the single-item multiobjective lot sizing problem for only ten representative items.

In this work, a multi-attribute bilateral matching framework is proposed in accordance with the collaboration between recycling and remanufacturing services.

On this basis, a collaboration-oriented bilateral matching model concerning recycling and remanufacturing services is constructed with the objectives of maximizing matching satisfaction of remanufacturers and recyclers, as well as achieving service synergy effect. Afterwards, linear weighting method is used to solve the model, and thus the optimal service matching scheme is obtained.

  abstract     = {The mura defects of thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels have low contrast and random locations, which makes it impossible for us to correctly evaluate the number and type of mura defects on the image in the field inspection. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a lightweight YOLO-ADPAM detection method based on an attention mechanism. First, we designed a K-means-ciou++ clustering algorithm using the Complete-Intersection-Over-Union loss function to cluster the anchor box size of the display defect dataset, making the bounding box regression more accurate and stable and improving the recognition and positioning accuracy of the algorithm. Second, we design a parallel attention module, combining the advantages of the channel and spatial attention mechanisms to effectively extract helpful information from feature maps. The channel attention branch can compensate for the defect information lost by global average pooling to a certain extent, and selecting a larger convolution kernel in the spatial attention branch is beneficial to retain crucial spatial information. Third, using atrous spatial pyramid pooling and depthwise separable convolution in the Neck network can further improve the receptive field of the feature map and improve the detection accuracy of the network. The experimental results show that the mAP of our proposed YOLO-ADPAM algorithm in TFT-LCD defect detection reaches 98.20%, and the detection speed reaches 83.23 FPS, which meets the detection accuracy and real-time requirements of TFT-LCD defect detection tasks.},

Several machine-learning techniques were integrated with control charts to improve the sensitivity and specificity of anomaly detection. Nevertheless, some existing techniques still produce a high false alarm rate and/or missed detection. The root cause analysis is seldom performed. In this paper, we propose a new integration that combines the logical analysis of data regression technique (LADR) and the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) as a new model-based control chart. LADR is based on the traditional LAD methodology, which is a supervised data mining technique for pattern generation. LADR transforms the original independent variables into pattern variables by using cbmLAD software to develop a regression model. The LADR–EWMA increases the sensitivity of anomaly detection in the process and uses the patterns to perform root cause analysis of that anomaly. We applied LADR–EWMA to a real application: a concrete manufacturing process. We compared its performance with Linear regression, Support vector regression, Partial Least Square regression, and Multivariate adaptive regression Spline. The results demonstrate that the LADR–EWMA, which is based on pattern recognition, performs better compared to the other techniques in terms of a reduction of false alarms and missed detection. In addition, LADR–EWMA facilitates interpretation and identification of the root cause of the detected anomaly.},

  abstract     = {Resistance spot welding (RSW) is an important manufacturing process across major industries due to its high production speed and ease of automation. Though conceptually straightforward, the process combines complex electrical, thermal, fluidic, and mechanical phenomena to permanently assemble sheet metal components. These complex process dynamics make RSW prone to inconsistencies, even with modern automation techniques. This motivates online process monitoring and quality evaluation systems for quality assurance. This study investigates in-situ process sensing and neural networks-based modeling to understand key aspects of RSW process monitoring and offers three contributions: (1) a comparison of two data-driven modeling approaches, a feature-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a raw sensing-based convolutional neural network (CNN), (2) a comparison of how electrical and mechanical sensing data affect the model’s performance, and (3) an explanation of MLP behavior using Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values to interpret the contribution of sensing features to weld quality metric predictions. Both the MLP and CNN can predict weld quality metrics (e.g., nugget geometry) and detect a process defect (i.e., expulsion) using in-situ current and resistance sensing signals. Including force and displacement measurements improved performance, and the SHAP values revealed salient features underlying the RSW process (e.g., displacement contributes significantly to predicting axial nugget growth). Future work will explore additional architectural developments, explore ways to translate lab-developed models to production plants, and leverage these models to optimize RSW processes and improve quality consistency.},

  abstract     = {In binder jetting followed by sintering, the porosity characterization is critical to understand how the process affects the structure of the printed parts. Image-based porosity detection methods are widely used but the current solutions are limited to specific materials and conditions and require manual tuning that precludes real-time porosity detection. The application of machine learning for automating porosity detection has been also limited to specific materials and conditions and requires a large training dataset for successful implementation. However, large datasets are difficult to acquire experimentally in binder jetting due to prohibited material costs and experiment time. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper investigates the application of machine learning on automated porosity detection using a small dataset consisting of highly varied cross-section images of metal parts produced by binder jetting followed by sintering. Stylegan3, a type of generative adversarial network, is used to increase the number of training images by image augmentation, and YOLOv5, a convolutional neural network specialized for object detection, is used to detect porosities. The resulting model achieves an F1 score of 88% and detection time of 3–15 ms per image. Generalized porosity detection is also assessed on a set of images containing highly varied materials, resolutions, magnifications, and pore densities. Furthermore, morphological information of the classified porosities such as the distribution of their orientations are automatically extracted using image processing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fabric defect detection is an indispensable process to guarantee product quality in industrial production. With the proposal of industry 4.0, manufacturing enterprises have been endeavoring to develop automatic fabric defect detection systems to overcome the shortcomings of traditional manual defect detection, and many researchers have been devoting themselves to designing fabric defect detection methods with high effectiveness and strong anti-noise capacity. In the paper, we notice that the perception of the normal fabric textures is beneficial to detecting fabric defects, which is ignored in previous researches for classic one-stage detection network. Based on this finding, we propose a texture-aware one-stage fabric defect detection network (TADet). First, an adaptive feature fusion module is designed to merge and enhance multi-resolution features, where the attention mechanism is employed to make the feature fusion process adaptive to the input fabric images with different textures. Second, a multi-task defect detection head is proposed for forcing the network to distinguish the defect regions and texture regions while classifying and locating defects simultaneously in the training phase. With the defect-texture distinguishing tasks, the network is able to consider the fabric textures explicitly when detecting defects. The experimental results show that the proposed TADet outperforms other two-stage models by 3.7% and one-stage detection models by 9.3% on mAP. Besides, further experiments verify the high efficiency and strong noise-robustness of the proposed TADet, which shows its potential for industrial applications.},

In this article, we propose a model for online monitoring of the penetration of complex groove welding. We build an active–passive cooperative vision system based on gas metal arc welding (GMAW). A mapping relationship from multi-modal data to the backside melting width is established. The multi-modal data consists of laser line images and molten pool images. The groove angle is extracted from the laser line image based on the segmentation model with the addition of online hard example mining. The molten pool image information is extracted based on DenseNet and ASPP model. Then, the above information is reconstructed and fused to predict the backside melting width. The Mean Square Error (MSE) of the predicted backside melting width is better than 0.28 mm for complex grooves and is 57% lower than that without adding an angle, which verifies the model&#39;s accuracy. The model has a run time of fewer than 0.015 s, which meets the time requirement for online monitoring. Finally, the backside melting width is controlled based on fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The MSE of the control result does not exceed 0.11 mm.},

  abstract     = {With the prevalence of deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN), data augmentation is widely used for enriching training samples to gain model training improvement. Data augmentation is important when training samples are scarce. This work focuses on improving data augmentation for training an industrial steel surface defect classification network, where the performance is largely depending on the availability of high-quality training samples. It is very difficult to find a sufficiently large dataset for this application in real-world settings. When it comes to synthetic data augmentation, the performance is often degraded by incorrect class labels, and a large effort is required to generate high-quality samples. This paper introduces a novel off-line pre-augmentation network (PreAugNet) which acts as a class boundary classifier that can effectively screen the quality of the augmented samples and improve image augmentation. This PreAugNet can generate augmented samples and update decision boundaries via an independent support vector machine (SVM) classifier. New samples are automatically distributed and combined with the original data for training the target network. The experiments show that these new augmentation samples can improve classification without changing the target network architecture. The proposed method for steel surface defect inspection is evaluated on three real-world datasets: AOI steel defect dataset, MT, and NEU datasets. PreAugNet significantly increases the accuracy by 3.3% (AOI dataset), 6.25% (MT dataset) and 2.1% (NEU dataset), respectively.},

Recently, smart manufacturing merges the use of sensors, intelligent controls, and software to manage each stage in the manufacturing lifecycle. Additionally, the increasing use of point clouds to model real products and machining tools in a virtual space facilitates the more accurate monitoring of the end-to-end production lifecycle. Thus, the conjunction of both, intelligent methods and more accurate 3D models allows the prediction of uncertainties and anomalies in the manufacturing process as well as reduces the final production costs. However, the high complexity of the geometrical structures defined by point clouds and the high accuracy required by the Quality Assurance/Quality control parameters during the process, pave the way for continuous improvements in smart manufacturing methods. This paper addresses a comprehensive analysis of machining tool identification utilizing temporal point cloud data. Specifically, we deal with the identification of machining tools from temporal 3D point clouds. To do that, we propose a process to construct and train intelligent models utilizing such data. Moreover, in our case study, we provide the research community with two labeled temporal 3D point cloud datasets, and we experiment with the pioneering PointNet neural network and three of its variants demonstrating an accuracy of 95% in the identification of the utilized machining tools in a machining process.

Therefore, this paper puts forward an attention-based one-dimension convolution neural network (1DCNN) combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network for heat load prediction. Firstly, the two-stage data pre-processing realizes dimension reduction and key variable selection. Secondly, fine-grained features are extracted by 1DCNN, and the BiLSTM extracts the coarse-grained features for prediction output. Moreover, an attention branch is added to the 1DCNN to extract the critical fine-grained features when the heat load changes rapidly. Finally, experiments are carried out with the actual industrial data from a BF ironmaking process. The efforts show that the proposed prediction model presents better performances in the result of different metrics and has higher accuracy than the traditional prediction algorithms.},

The control barrier function (CBF) provides an effective tool to build up the constraint and ensure the safety of human–robot interaction. However, since the human and robot keep moving during human–robot interaction, the closest points between parts of them also change. Especially, the human trajectories are not known in prior, which may cause the above safety constraint to fail. In this paper, we construct the safe constraints based on discrete control barrier function (DCBF) by redefining the distance between each link of the robot and each part of the human body as the distance between two line segments in the space. In addition, the look-backward-and-forward strategy is applied to update the neural network model for predicting of human’s motion trajectory effectively. Meanwhile, the root mean square estimation error is included in the safe constraints as the metric of uncertainty to compensate the estimation error of the predicted trajectory. Combining the discrete-time control Lyapunov function, a comprehensive control method under human–robot-coexistence environment is formed. The trajectory of a human’s right arm collected by Qualisys capture system. The experiment are set up by integrating above testbed with a virtual KUKA iiwa model built by MATLAB. The results show that the robot can maintain a safe distance from the human when the DCBF-based constraints with prediction information are used, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The thermal error reduces the machining accuracy of machine tools, and should be effectively controlled. But the accurate prediction of the thermal error is challenging because of the complex and dynamic running conditions. In previous studies, the temporal feature of the thermal error is considered, and the spatial feature of the thermal error is not considered. However, the thermal error has temporal-spatial (TS) behaviors, and then it is not sufficient to consider the temporal feature only, leading to a low prediction accuracy and poor robustness. Furthermore, most studies on the TS modeling ignore the complexity of the spatial feature, resulting in the spatial feature of the thermal error not being comprehensively captured. When building a TS model, many studies simply connect the spatial model with the temporal model in series. However, the spatial feature changes with the running time, and the series model cannot truly reflect the TS features. To address these challenges, a new dynamic TS memory graph convolutional network (DTSMGCN) model is proposed to learn the dynamic TS features of the thermal error in this study. The generation mechanism of the thermal error is demonstrated by solving the heat conduction equation, and the dynamic TS behaviors are revealed by the Laplace transform. The designed DTSMGCN cell consists of the marginal unit, joint unit, and hybrid adjacency matrix, and can capture the temporal feature of each variable and the TS features among variables. Moreover, to expedite the training process and improve the executing efficiency, an industrial-oriented machine learning big data framework (IOMLBDF) is designed. The proposed DTSMGCN model is embedded into the designed IOMLBDF. The results show that the DTSMGCN model outperforms other machine learning models, and the designed IOMLBDF can improve the training efficiency when increasing the number of virtual machine nodes and achieve the real-time control of the thermal error.},

This paper presents a novel tool condition monitoring approach that packages deep learning networks for accurate condition recognition with a cocktail solver library. First, the multisource signals from the machining process are collected and sequenced as the input of the cocktail solver library. The machining signals are transformed into a series of two-dimensional images by a continuous wavelet transform. In addition, ten pretrained networks with transfer learning are rapidly transferred with a finetuning operation, which contributes to a set of monitor networks. Three major processes are integrated by the cocktail solver library, which is the choosing dataset process for multi-signals, the training option process for network training parameters, and the network package process for the basic monitoring model. A Bayesian optimization method is employed to handle a tradeoff for these three processes to improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the recognition time. In the testing experiment, the milling datasets are used to train the model, and the results show that the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper can exceed 90%.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, an increasing number of researchers apply deep-learning-based object detection methods to implement visual defect detection in industrial manufacturing. However, large-scale variation in visual defect detection impedes the improvement of detection accuracy to be further explored. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale block (HMS-Block), equipped with hierarchical representation and multi-scale embedding, to afford scale-abundant features to facilitate multi-scale defect detection. Specially, the hierarchical representation is implemented by a cascade learning stage to extract features from local to global at the channel level. Based on this representation, a cross-branch shortcut is concisely embedded to relieve the large-scale variation problem. Ultimately, the hierarchical multi-scale network (HMSNet) is published elegantly via stacking a certain amount of HMS-Blocks. The proposed methods facilitate the defect detection at all scales and outperform the ResNet50 baseline by a large margin with minor time overhead and less parameter required, indicating that the proposed HMS-Block has a high practical utility in the field of industrial applications. Moreover, the proposed HMSNet can also be applied to other detection-based tasks and greatly surpasses existing methods.

  abstract     = {As an essential scheduling problem with several practical applications, the parallel machine scheduling problem (PMSP) with family setups constraints is difficult to solve and proven to be NP-hard. To this end, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to solve a PMSP considering family setups, aiming at minimizing the total tardiness. The PMSP is first modeled as a Markov decision process, where we design a novel variable-length representation of states and actions, so that the DRL agent can calculate a comprehensive priority for each job at each decision time point and then select the next job directly according to these priorities. Meanwhile, the variable-length state matrix and action vector enable the trained agent to solve instances of any scales. To handle the variable-length sequence and simultaneously ensure the calculated priority is a global priority among all jobs, we employ a recurrent neural network, particular gated recurrent unit, to approximate the policy of the agent. The agent is trained based on Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. Moreover, we develop a two-stage training strategy to enhance the training efficiency. In the numerical experiments, we first train the agent on a given instance and then employ it to solve instances with much larger scales. The experimental results demonstrate the strong generalization capability of the trained agent and the comparison with three dispatching rules and two metaheuristics further validates the superiority of this agent.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based data-driven methods have been successfully developed in tool wear condition monitoring (TWCM), relying on the massive available labeled samples and the same probability distribution between training and testing data. However, these two prerequisites are often difficult to satisfy in actual industries, which results in significant performance deterioration of those methods. This paper proposes an intelligent cross-domain data-driven TWCM method based on feature transfer by a deep adversarial domain confusion network (DADCN) model. In this model, source and target feature extractors sharing the same network architecture are employed to obtain high-level representation from time–frequency spectrums of vibration signals in the different domains respectively. An independent adversarial learning mechanism is designed in domain obfuscator to learn domain-invariant feature knowledge, while the maximum mean discrepancy is applied to measure the distribution difference between different domains. A cross-domain classifier is utilized for tool wear condition monitoring across machining processes. The performances of the proposed DADCN model under two distribution measure criteria are experimentally demonstrated using six transfer tasks between laboratory and factory platforms. The results indicate that the DADCN model can improve the monitoring accuracy and exhibit distinct clustering of tool wear conditions, promoting a successful application of data-driven methods in actual industrial fields.},

In pursuit of this goal, the objectives of this work in the context of extrusion-based Bio-AM of bone tissue constructs are twofold: (1) detect flaw formation using data from in-situ infrared thermocouple sensors; and (2) prevent flaw formation through preemptive process control. In realizing the first objective, data signatures acquired from in-situ sensors were analyzed using several machine learning approaches to ascertain critical quality metrics, such as print regime, strand width, strand height, and strand fusion severity. These quality metrics are intended to capture the process state at the basic 1D strand-level to the 2D layer-level. For this purpose, machine learning models were trained to classify and predict flaw formation. These models predicted print quality features with accuracy nearing 90%. In connection with the second objective, the previously trained machine learning models were used to preempt flaw formation by changing the process parameters (print velocity) during deposition—a form of feedforward control. With the feedforward process control, strand width heterogeneity was statistically significantly reduced, reducing the strand width difference between strand halves to less than 50 µm. Using this integrated process monitoring, detection, and control approach, we demonstrate consistent, repeatable production of Bio-AM constructs.},

  abstract     = {Grinding has been extensively applied to meet the urgent need for tight tolerance and high productivity in manufacturing industries. However, grinding parameter settings and process control still depend on skilled workers’ engineering experience. The process stability in complicated non-uniform wear can&#39;t be guaranteed. Moreover, it is impossible to obtain energy-saved grinding strategies. Intelligent monitoring methods are well-recognized to help conquer present trial–error processing deficiencies. However, discrete manufacturing companies have to face increasing difficulties to identify the monitored big data and make credible decisions directly. A decision-making expert system driven by monitored power data (EconG©) is thus developed. EconG© provides a 4-level database structure to efficiently manage multi-source heterogeneous data. Signal conditioning, peaks-valleys feature exaction, and compression approaches are proposed for reducing the storage volume of real-time monitored data. The data size has been reduced to 6.5% of the source. A mathematical comparison model based on the power feature is embedded to diagnose burns, which has been validated by the 16th and 55th surface grinding results. Mapping relation model from inputs, signals to outputs has been built by the power feature-extended artificial neural network algorithm. Prediction accuracy is improved by introducing adaptive control and dynamic changes in material removal. EconG© breaks a single analysis based on grinding parameters. Energy-saved grinding strategies could be intelligently acquired through the presented Pareto optimization method. In the future, a broader and deeper implementation of EconG© will guild manufacturers to respond quickly to explosive demands on intellectualization, sustainability, and flexibility in the arrived 4th industrial revolution.},

This kind of testing is mandatory inter alia for all aerosol packaging as any mechanical alterations of the packaging can cause the pressurized product to unseal and stop working properly. Moreover, aerosol products are classified as dangerous goods and any leaking of the product or propellent can be a serious hazard to the storage place, environment, and final consumer. Thus, basic compatibility observations of metal aerosol packaging (i.e. general corrosion, pitting corrosion, coating blistering or detinning) and different compatibility factors (e.g. formula ingredients, water contamination, pH, package material and coatings) were discussed.

The uniformity of the deposited thin film layers’ thickness is crucial to create high-performance semiconductor devices. Tuning fabrication process parameters (e.g., for evenly distributed gas flow on the semiconductor wafer) is one of the dominant factors that affect film uniformity, as evidenced by both experimental and numerical studies. Conventional trial and error methods employed to change and test a range of fabrication conditions are time-consuming, and few studies have explored the effect of changing the geometry of hardware components, such as the showerhead. Here, we present a design optimization of the showerhead for flow uniformity based on numerical simulation data using machine learning surrogate models. Accurate machine learning models and optimization algorithms are developed and implemented to achieve 10% more flow uniformity compared to a benchmark traditional showerhead design. Moreover, the developed Bayesian optimization method saves 10-fold computational cost in reaching the optimal showerhead designs compared to conventional approaches. This machine learning enabled optimization platform shows promising results which could be implemented for other optimization problems in various manufacturing systems such as semiconductor fabrication and additive manufacturing.},

While indirect signal-based BC monitoring methods are ineffective when varying grinding parameters, existing image-based direct monitoring methods currently suffer from a lack of: (i) a unified and quantitative definition of the belt condition; (ii) in situ tool-surface image capture and relevant feature extraction; and (iii) continuous monitoring of the entire belt conditions. This paper proposes a partitioned BC monitoring method that is adaptable to ever-changing grinding conditions. Based on the belt surface analysis, a unified BC coefficient is quantitatively defined by using two critical BC-dependent features, the average area and number of worn flats of abrasive grains per unit area. The belt surface image is in-situ captured from moving belts and is preprocessed to eliminate image defects in a unified form, then the entire belt is partitioned, and finally the image features are extracted by Gabor filter and K-means clustering. The proposed robust method which has a maximum relative repeatability error of 9.33%, and less computation was validated by the experimental results. This study provides an adaptable and efficient way for continuously monitoring the conditions of the entire belt and the grinding area.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent manufacturing applications and agent-based implementations are scientifically investigated due to the enormous potential of industrial process optimization. The most widespread data-driven approach is the use of experimental history under test conditions for training, followed by execution of the trained model. Since factors, such as tool wear, affect the process, the experimental history has to be compiled extensively. In addition, individual machine noise implies that the models are not easily transferable to other (theoretically identical) machines. In contrast, a continual learning system should have the capacity to adapt (slightly) to a changing environment, e.g., another machine under different working conditions. Since this adaptation can potentially have a negative impact on process quality, especially in industry, safe optimization methods are required. In this article, we present a significant step towards self-optimizing machines in industry, by introducing a novel method for efficient safe contextual optimization and continuously trading-off between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, an appropriate data discard strategy and local approximation techniques enable continual optimization. The approach is implemented as generic software module for an industrial edge control device. We apply this module to a steel straightening machine as an example, enabling it to adapt safely to changing environments.},

  abstract     = {The capability of estimating future maintenance needs in advance and in a timely manner is a prerequisite for reliable manufacturing with high availability in a production unit. Additionally, conducting planned maintenance efforts regularly and prematurely increases the service lifetimes and utilization rates of parts, which leads to more sustainable production. The benefits of predictive maintenance are obvious, but introducing it into a facility poses various challenges. In this study, digital twins of well-functioning machines are used for predictive maintenance. The discrepancies between each physical unit and its digital twin are used to detect the maintenance needs. A thorough evaluation of the method over a period of 18 months by comparing digital twin detection results with maintenance and control system logs shows promising results. The method is successful in detecting discrepancies, and the paper describes the techniques that are used. However, not all discrepancies are related to the maintenance needs, and the evaluation identifies and discusses the most common sources of error. These are often the results of human interaction, such as parameter changes, maintenance activities and component replacement.},

  abstract     = {Minimizing the level of material consumption in textile production is a major concern. The cornerstone of this optimization task is the nesting problem, whose goal is to lay a set of irregular 2D parts out onto a rectangular surface, called the nesting zone, while respecting a set of constraints. Knowing the efficiency—ratio of usable to used up material enables the optimization of several textile production problems. Unfortunately, knowing the efficiency requires the nesting problem to be solved, which is computationally intensive and has been proven to be NP-hard. This paper introduces a regression approach to estimate efficiency without solving the nesting problem. Our approach models the 2D nesting problem as a graph where the nodes are images derived from parts and the edges hold the constraints. The method then consists of combining convolutional neural networks for addressing the image-based aspects and graph neural networks (GNNs) for the constraint aspects. We evaluate several neural message passing approaches on our dataset and obtain results that are sufficiently accurate for enabling several business use cases, where our model best solves this task with a mean absolute error of 1.65. We provide open access to our dataset, whose properties differ from those of other graph datasets found in the literature. This dataset is constructed on 100,000 real customers’ nesting data. Along the way, we compare the performance and generalization capabilities of four GNN architectures obtained from the literature on this dataset.},

The first is the similarity of different defect samples makes classification a difficult task. Second, the lack of defect samples leads to poor accuracies when using deep learning methods. In this paper, we first design a novel backbone network, ResMSNet, which draws on the idea of multi-scale feature extraction for small discriminative regions in defect samples. Then, we introduce few-shot learning for defect classification and propose a Relation-Prototypical network (RPNet), which combines the characteristics of ProtoNet and RelationNet and provides classification by linking the prototypes distances and the nonlinear relation scores. Next, we consider a more realistic scenario where the base dataset for training the model and target defect dataset for applying the model are usually obtained from domains with large differences, called cross-domain few-shot learning. Hence, we further improve RPNet to KD-RPNet inspired by knowledge distillation methods. Through extensive comparative experiments and ablation experiments, we demonstrate that either our ResMSNet or RPNet proves its effectiveness and KD-RPNet outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches for few-shot defect classification.},

  abstract     = {Introducing distributed computing paradigms to the manufacturing domain increases the difficulty of designing and planning an appropriate IT infrastructure. This paper proposes a model and solution approach addressing the conjoint application and IT resource placement problem in a factory context. Instead of aiming to create an exact model, resource requirements and capabilities are simplified, focusing on usability in the planning and design phase for industrial use cases. Three objective functions are implemented: minimizing overall cost, environmental impact, and the number of devices. The implications of edge and fog computing are considered in a multi-layer model by introducing five resource placement levels ranging from on-device, within the production system, within the production section, within the factory (on-premise), to the cloud (off-premise). The model is implemented using the open-source modeling language Pyomo. The solver SCIP is used to solve the NP-hard integer programming problem. For the evaluation of the optimization implementation a benchmark is created using a sample set of scenarios varying the number of possible placement locations, applications, and the distribution of assigned edge recommendations. The resulting execution times demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach for small (100 applications; 100 locations) and large (1000 applications, 1000 scenarios) instances. A case study for a section of a factory producing electronic components demonstrates the practical application of the proposed approach.},

To resolve the problem, a domain adaptation method for bearing fault diagnosis using multiple incomplete source data is proposed in this study. First, the cycle generative adversarial network is used to learn the mapping between multi-source domains to complement the missing category data. Then, considering the domain mismatch problem, a multi-source domain adaption model based on anchor adapters is developed to obtain general domain invariant diagnosis knowledge. Finally, the fault diagnosis model is established by an ensemble of multi-classifier results. Extensive experiments on bearing data sets demonstrate that the proposed method in fault diagnosis with multiple incomplete source data is effective and has a good diagnosis performance.},

However, due to intricate tool wear mechanisms, doing so with limited datasets confronts difficulties under varying operating conditions. This article proposes the use of transfer learning technology to detect tool wear, especially flank wear under distinct cutting environments (dry, flood, MQL and cryogenic). In this study, the state of the cutting tool was determined using the pre-trained networks like AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet, MobileNet, and Inception-V3. The best-performing network was recommended for tool condition monitoring, considering the effects of hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, solver, and train-test split ratio. In light of this, the recommended methodology may prove to be highly helpful for classifying and suggesting the suitable cutting conditions, especially under limited data situation.

This paper proposes a Micro-defect classification system based on attention enhancement (MDCS) for solving the detection and classification of micro-defects. We combine defect detection with defect classification in MDSC. Micro-defects classification can be better realized based on the auxiliary task of defect detection. In this system, the aim of attention formation in bionic vision is to guide the system to focus on the target by zooming in and out on micro-defects. To avoid noise interference, an attention module based on trilinear feature confluence has been incorporated. Last but not least, the enhancement process based on the attention map improves the classification ability of micro-defects. As part of comparative experiment, we analyzed data including 19,200 fabric images and 4,800 bamboo images. In the micro-defect classification experiment based on MDCS(ResNet-50), the accuracy of fabric data and bamboo data is 88.2% and 89.4% respectively. Compared with ResNet-50, the classification accuracy (64.8%, 67.7%) is improved by 23.4% and 21.7% respectively. In the object detection experiment of micro-defects based on MDCS (ResNet-50), the accuracy of fabric data and bamboo data is 65.1% mAPs and 63.3% mAPs respectively. Compared with HRDNet, the detection accuracy (59.6% mAPs, 52.2% mAPs) is improved by 5.5% mAPs and 11.1% mAPs respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can counteract the interference caused by noise in small object detection, localize micro-defects accurately, and improve micro-defect classification accuracy significantly.},

However, the problems of overfitting and low generalizability affect the performance of CNN-based surface defect segmentation models. Therefore, data augmentation is necessary to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. However, existing data augmentation methods are random and independent of the downstream defect detection tasks. Thus, we propose a simple plug-and-play data augmentation method based on the requirements of the CNN defect segmentation task. We first pretrain a defect segmentation model on a training set and obtain confidence maps. Then, we occlude high-confidence regions based on the data augmentation module to balance the attention paid by the model to high- and low-confidence regions. Finally, to prevent overfitting, we periodically update the confidence map. We conduct sufficient experiments on the Kolektor surface defect (KSD) metal surface dataset and an optoelectronic chip dataset. The proposed method can make full use of the information contained in the existing datasets to improve the accuracy of the segmentation model (intersection-over-union (IOU) 6.62% improvement over baseline on the KSD dataset and 3.20% on the optoelectronic chip dataset). Moreover, the proposed method is highly applicable to various mainstream defect segmentation methods.},

  abstract     = {This proof-of-concept study provides a novel method for robust-stable scheduling in dynamic flow shops based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) implemented with OpenAI frameworks. In realistic manufacturing environments, dynamic events endanger baseline schedules, which can require a cost intensive re-scheduling. Extensive research has been done on methods for generating proactive baseline schedules to absorb uncertainties in advance and in balancing the competing metrics of robustness and stability. Recent studies presented exact methods and heuristics based on Monte Carlo experiments (MCE), both of which are very computationally intensive. Furthermore, approaches based on surrogate measures were proposed, which do not explicitly consider uncertainties and robustness metrics. Surprisingly, DRL has not yet been scientifically investigated for generating robust-stable schedules in the proactive stage of production planning. The contribution of this article is a proposal on how DRL can be applied to manipulate operation slack times by stretching or compressing plan durations. The method is demonstrated using different flow shop instances with uncertain processing times, stochastic machine failures and uncertain repair times. Through a computational study, we found that DRL agents achieve about 98% result quality but only take about 2% of the time compared to traditional metaheuristics. This is a promising advantage for the use in real-time environments and supports the idea of improving proactive scheduling methods with machine learning based techniques.},

  abstract     = {The objective of few-shot learning (FSL) is to learn a model that can quickly adapt to novel classes with only few examples. Recent works have shown that a powerful representation with a base learner trained in supervised and self-supervised manners has significant advantages over the existing sophisticated FSL algorithms. In this paper, we build on this insight and propose a new framework called global and local representation collaborative learning (GLCL), which combines the complementary advantages of global equivariance and local aggregation. Global equivariance learns the internal structure of data to improve class discrimination, and the local aggregation retains important semantic information to enrich feature representations. In addition, we design a cross-view contrastive learning to promote the consistent learning and implicit exploration of useful knowledge from one another. A simultaneous optimization of these contrasting objectives allows the model to encode informative features while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for new tasks. We demonstrate consistent and substantial performance gains for FSL classification tasks on multiple datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjgans/GLCL .},

  abstract     = {In semiconductor industry, various wafer defect patterns represent different causes of manufacturing failures. Identification of specific defect patterns is important to wafer fabrication process. Recently, many studies concentrate on developing Deep Learning algorithms such as Convolution Neural Network, most of which neglect hyper-relations among dataset. Therefore, in this work, a novel Hypergraph Convolution Network is proposed for the automatic Wafer Defect Identification (HCN-WDI). The main contributions include: (1) The detailed theoretical formulation and NP-Completeness proof of normalized cut for (hyper-)edge segmentation is firstly discussed. (2) The data augmentation techniques are applied to balance the number inequality of different patterns in wafer defect dataset WM-811K. (3) The Hyper Convolution Network is implemented as an end-to-end operator to identify wafer defect patterns and three conventional image classifiers are used as feature extractors and reference baselines for the proposed HCN-WDI model. The experimental results show that the proposed HCN-WDI model outperforms other three fine-tuning conventional image classifiers and obtains the highest $$96.44\%$$ averaged classification accuracy. Besides, by comparing the results from various combinations of extracted features, it is concluded that the accuracy of the HCN-WDI model is also dependent on the quality rather than quantities of feature extraction.},

  abstract     = {The development of Industrial Internet of Things, big data, and multi-domain modeling, led to the emergence of digital twin (DT), providing a new approach to the cyber-physical production systems. In the traditional shipbuilding industry, a large number of hull parts are often tracked and transferred. During the hull parts picking and processing, the uncertainty from parts transfer tasks and logistics information often leads to low resource utilization. Therefore, a real-time resource allocation method based on DT for hull part smart picking and processing system (SPPS) is proposed. Firstly, a multi-agent model of the multi-gantry crane system is established in virtual space to achieve real-time task allocation, hence minimizing the transport time. Next, a real-time picking and processing scheduling policy is proposed to reduce the idle time of all workstations by estimating the time of parts arriving at target station and processing completion time. Finally, the services available in the DT platform can be applied to optimize the system performance, taking the number of devices and the takt time optimization as examples. Several experiments in case study are carried out to verify the proposed method. The average utilization rate of all workstations is increased by 17.39%, and the standard deviation is reduced by 83.31%. The results have shown that the proposed method can effectively improve the workstation utilization rate and load balance. The maximum average number of parts in the station buffer, which is limited to 0.33, is kept at a low level.},

This research work investigates the application of the artificial bee colony (ABC) approach, probabilistic roadmap (PRM) method, and evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm to tackle the issue of single and multi-robot path planning in partially known or unknown industrial complex environments. Conventional techniques depend on external factors such as delay of information from one bee&#39;s stage to another for selecting neighbour food points. Due to this, its efficiency is comparatively low and might result in longer runtimes. To address these challenges, a novel hybrid framework based on ABC-PRM-EP has been introduced. Firstly, a suboptimal initial feasible path is attained by a new framework (ABC-PRM) within the mobile robot sensor detection range. Then, EP performs refinement of that attained suboptimal path to provide a short and optimum path. Also, a multi-robot collaboration strategy has been introduced based on the concept of hold-up. A number of comparative studies have been conducted in three different test scenarios with different complexity to validate the proposed framework efficiency and performance. Different performance indices such as path length (m), smoothness (rad), collision safety value, success rate, processing time (s), and convergence speed have been measured to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The comparative analysis obtained from these test scenarios indicates that the proposed framework outperforms conventional ABC, ABC-EP and HPSO-GWO-EA, while performing path planning.},

Consequently, it results in poor material matching at the junctions in multimaterial printing, affecting the performance of functional components. This study investigated the surface accumulation characteristics of parts in three-dimensional (3D) inkjet printing. Moreover, an intelligent additive manufacturing system for array nozzles was developed to improve the material accumulation accuracy and printing efficiency. First, a height prediction model was established to predict the printing height information, and a P-type closed-loop iterative learning control compensation algorithm with initial value correction was formulated based on the layer thickness experimental data. This algorithm reduced the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the sample’s surface by 69.3%. Second, a set of random offset nozzle compensation algorithms was developed and combined with the laser vision scanning method to obtain the nozzle clogging information and compensate for sample defects by adjusting the parameters of the random algorithm. Finally, a microstrip antenna was fabricated. The surface roughness of the sample in this study was lower than that of the open-loop printed sample, resulting in a good antenna radio frequency (RF) layer connection. In addition, the S11 parameters were closer to the simulation results. These results validate the significance of this research in electronic printing.},

The overall manufacturing complexity is calculated as a weighted average of morphological and material criteria, which are defined either locally or globally. The local morphological criteria are calculated over the leaf nodes of an octree representation of the part using a raycasting technique. This allows to efficiently probe the local geometry of the part and compare it with manufacturing constraints emanating from the manufacturing process and its associated effector. This algorithm yields a cartography of the local complexity criteria that helps visualizing the problematic regions for the processes under consideration. The software is accompanied by a database that feeds the required material and process properties needed for the calculation of the manufacturing complexity and cost. The proposed methodology therefore permits a technical and economic comparison of manufacturing processes for a given geometry and material, as well as a comparison of various part geometries and materials for a given manufacturing process.},

  abstract     = {An assembly cell line (ACL) is one type of cell production practice, derived from the Toyota Production System in the electronics industry and rapidly spread to other fields. In this mode, the conveyor line is divided into assembly cells (ACs) where various parts and tools are placed closer to the workers, enabling them to perform multiple tasks throughout an entire product assembly from start to finish. In this way, ACL allows manufacturers to rapidly configure an appropriate heterogeneous capacity to match heterogeneous demands with diversified customer orders in the high-mix, low-volume (HMLV) environment, which is the spread of the Just-In-Time (JIT) philosophy from the material level to the organization level. However, due to the lack of real-time information sharing in the ACL workshop, especially the up-to-date individual capacity and asynchronous production processes within and between ACs, it is hard to coordinate the heterogeneous capacities of ACs to meet the HMLV demands in a complex manufacturing environment with uncertainties. In this context, this paper proposes a heterogeneous demand–capacity synchronization (HDCS) for smart ACL by using artificial intelligence-enabled IIoT (AIoT) technologies, in which computer vision (CV) is applied for up-to-date capacity analysis of ACs. Based on these, an AIoT-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System (GiMS) with feedback loops is developed to support real-time information sharing for the synchronous coordination of the ACL operation, which also provides the basis for the implementation of the HDCS mechanism through a rolling scheduling approach. Finally, a real-life industrial case is carried out by a proof-of-concept prototype to verify the proposed approach, and the results show that the measures on shipment punctuality and production efficiency are both significantly improved.},

  abstract     = {Die-casting is a popular manufacturing process that produces precise metal parts with excellent dimensional accuracy and smooth cast surfaces. Recently die-casting process condition data can be acquired to be used as input for machine learning techniques for fault detection. The rapid development of complex and accurate machine learning algorithms, such as tree ensembles and deep learning, allows the accurate detection of faulty products. However, interpreting and explaining black-box models is crucial in the die-casting industry because the predictions provided by the machine learning solution can be adopted in practice only after understanding the internal decision mechanism of the model. To solve this problem, rule extraction methods generate simple rule-based predictive models from complex tree ensembles. Nevertheless, rulesets may contain numerous complex rules with redundant conditions, and the standard structure of rulesets does not clearly show the hierarchical relationships and frequent interactions among their elements. For this reason, in this study, a visualization tool based on formal concept analysis, called RuleLat (Rule Lattice), is proposed, which generates simple visual representations of rule-based classifiers. The generated models depict the hierarchical relationships of interactions among conditions, rules, and predicted classes in a modified concept lattice that is easy to analyze and understand. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, a case study using real-world manufacturing data collected from a die-casting company in Korea is presented. RuleLat is adopted as a tool for interpretable machine learning, and the process conditions of three types of defects (porosity, material, and imprint) are analyzed and discussed.},

  abstract     = {For an increasing number of applications, the quality and the stability of manufacturing processes can be determined via image and video-image data analysis and new techniques are required to extract and synthesize the relevant information content enclosed in big sensor data to draw conclusions about the process and the final part quality. This paper focuses on video image data where the phenomena under study is captured by a point process whose spatial signature is of interest. A novel approach is proposed which combines spatial data modeling via Ripley’s K-function with Functional Analysis of Variance (FANOVA), i.e., Analysis of Variance on Functional data. The K-function allows to synthesize the spatial pattern information in a function while preserving the capability to capture changes in the process behavior. The method is applicable to quantities and phenomena that can be represented as clusters, or clouds, of spatial points evolving over time. In our case, the motivating case study regards the analysis of spatter ejections caused by the laser-material interaction in Additive Manufacturing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The spatial spread of spatters, captured in the form of point particles through in-situ high speed machine vision, can be used as a proxy to select the best conditions to avoid defects (pores) in the manufactured part. The proposed approach is shown to be not only an efficient way to translate the high-dimensional video image data into a lower dimensional format (the K-function curves), but also more effective than benchmark methods in detecting departures from a stable and in-control state.},

  abstract     = {Micron-level flaws on component surface can seriously affect the optical and mechanical properties of optics, so it is significant to accurately classify and repair surface flaws. However, the small scale, multiple categories, and complex characteristics of surface flaws make the accurate classification a great challenge in the field of precision optical engineering. In this work, a novel automated classification approach is proposed for multi-classification of flaws. Images of flaws illuminated by multi-light sources are automatically acquired by classification equipment to enrich the characteristics of flaws, and a series of automated workflows are set up to accomplish flaw detection, classification, and mitigation. SingleCNN-MergeRGB, a feature extraction structure based on a single convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-light source fusion, is constructed to extract the integrated features of flaws under different illumination. The experimental results show that SingleCNN-MergeRGB has stronger capability of feature description compared with single light source and other feature extraction networks. The integrated deep learning architecture SingleCNN-MergeRGB + SVM and prediction probability threshold adjustment strategy are proposed to improve the accuracy of flaw classification and correct failure cases. Validation results on the test set show that the proposed flaw classification method obtains an accuracy of 96.34% and a recall rate of 100%. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the automatic classification equipment and methods in this work in the classification of surface flaws in large-aperture optical components.},

  abstract     = {Thin-walled parts such as blades are widely used in aerospace field, and their machining quality directly affects the service performance of core components. Due to obvious time-varying nonlinear effect and complex machining system, it is a great challenge to realize accurate and fast prediction of machining errors of such parts. To solve the above problems, an engineering knowledge based sparse Bayesian learning approach is proposed to realize in-situ prediction of machining errors of thin-walled blades. Firstly, an engineering knowledge based strategy is proposed to improve the generalization ability of the model by integrating multi-source engineering knowledge, including machining information, physical information and online monitoring information. Then, principal component analysis method is utilized for the dimensional reduction of features. Sparse Bayesian learning approach is developed for model training, which significantly reduce the complexity of the regression model. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed approach have been proven in blade milling experiments. Experimental results show that the average deviation of the proposed in-situ prediction model is about 11 μm, and the model complexity is reduced by 66%.},

  abstract     = {Surface quality control is a crucial part of rail manufacturing. Deep neural networks have shown impressive accuracy in rail surface defect segmentation under the assumption that the test images have the same distribution as the training images. However, in practice detection, the rail images exhibit variations in appearance and scale for different rail types and production conditions. Directly deploying the deep neural network on unseen images shows a performance degradation due to the distribution discrepancies of training images. To this end, we propose a cross-scale fusion and domain adversarial network (CFDANet) to improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks on unseen datasets. To alleviate the domain shift caused by defect scale differences, we design a dual-encoder to extract multi-scale features from images of different resolutions. Then, those features are adaptively fused through a cross-scale fusion module. For the domain shift caused by inconsistent rail appearance, we introduce transferable-aware domain adversarial learning to extract domain invariant features from different datasets. Moreover, we further propose a transferable curriculum to suppress the negative impact of images with low transferability. Experimental results show that our CFDANet can accurately segment defects in unseen datasets and surpass other state-of-the-art domain generalization methods in all five target domain settings.

  abstract     = {It is beneficial to maintain the normal operation of machines by conducting remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Recently, graph data-driven machine RUL prediction methods have made a great success, since graph can model spatial and temporal dependencies of signals. However, the constructed graphs still have some limitations: (1) In the practical industrial production, the installation of multi-sensor networks is expensive and hard to achieve, so the single sensor is commonly used for data monitoring. However, most of these methods constructed graphs by establishing relationships between the different sensors, which are completely unsuitable for prediction tasks in single-sensor scenarios. (2) The quality of constructed graph is low, where the graph structure is fixed, failing in representing the machine degradation process. To overcome these limitations, a dynamic spatial–temporal (ST) graph-driven machine RUL prediction method using graph data augmentation (GDA) is proposed. The ST graph is constructed using short-time Fourier transform, capturing the frequency-domain and time-domain information hidden in the signals. Then, a GDA framework is designed to generate dynamic ST graphs, enlarging the structural differences of subgraphs. Subsequently, a GDA-based graph deep learning prediction model is constructed for dynamic ST graph-based RUL prediction, where an autoencoder-based graph embedding module is designed to replace simple Readout. Verification experiments are conducted on two case studies, and the results show that the proposed prediction method achieves a competitive performance.},

Accurate prediction of the surface roughness in the machining process can play an important role in reducing costs and increasing efficiency. However, data-based methods often require a large sample size for model training to improve prediction accuracy. Obtaining a sufficient number of training samples is challenging due to cost and efficiency constraints. To this end, an interpolation-based virtual sample generation scheme is proposed in this article, which utilizes a broad learning system (BLS) to generate virtual samples of the cutting groove surface roughness. Experimental verification was carried out in an ultra-precision machining center, where depth of cut and cutting speed were selected as inputs to the BLS. The results reveal that the proposed virtual sample generation approach can considerably improve the surface roughness prediction accuracy. Compared to other machine learning methods, BLS has the highest error reduction rate with and without virtual samples.},

This paper proposes a compensation method for the laser beam deflection to enhance the accuracy of the laser manufacturing. The deflection measurement was achieved by image and point cloud processing. The proposed method scans the point cloud model and fits the geometric feature to realize the orientation of the laser collimator relative to the equipment. The error of laser beam deflection calculates by the orientation of collimator and the spatial geometric relationship of the displacement and the laser trajectory. An error compensation model is constructed to compensate for dynamic error in the whole motion range during the calculation of equipment motion. The effectiveness of this method is verified through laser beam measurement, compensation and laser manufacturing for a complex component. The results show that the proposed method improves the processing accuracy (91.6 μm versus 316.6 μm) by data statistics.},

  abstract     = {Thin-walled parts are widely used in various industries such as aerospace and automotive, but the manufacturing processes are often harmed by chatter which is a self-excited vibration because of the poor rigidity in the direction perpendicular to the wall surface. The traditional stability lobe diagram (SLD) method can predict chatter based on the manufacturing system and workpiece parameters. However, these parameters could vary along with the manufacturing execution, compromising SLD&#39;s accuracy and even feasibility. To enable effective chatter suppression in thin-walled part milling, this study proposes a digital twin model, where two sub-models including the cutting parameters optimization and chatter detection are established. In the sub-model of cutting parameters optimization, a real-time SLD considering the time-varying modal parameters at the cutting region of the workpiece is generated as the optimization criteria. The sub-model of chatter detection can recognize chatter by a fusional analysis of the multiple sensors&#39; signals, including vibration, force, and sound. Considering the bias of real-time SLD, these two sub-models are combined to output optimized cutting parameters to avoid chatter. Besides, a monitoring window to visualize the milling scenario and a database to record the manufacturing data are implemented in the digital twin model. According to the milling experiments, the digital twin model is validated to perform more effectively in chatter suppression than the traditional stationary SLD method.},

  abstract     = {Time-of-flight diffraction (TOFD) has become a widely used nondestructive testing (NDT) technique, owing to its wide coverage, fast detection speeds, and high defect detection rates. However, compared with nondestructive radiographic testing images, TOFD image analysis requires more technicians and more difficult defect analysis. Owing to the improvements in weld manufacturing quality, there are fewer welds with defects; consequently, a large number of TOFD images have no defect information. The TOFD image analysis of normal welds occupies a lot of time in the weld evaluation process that easily leads to problems of missed and false detections and reduces the efficiency of overall weld evaluation. To solve these problems, a TOFD image reconstruction model based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) and a normal weld recognition method are proposed. First, combined with the TOFD image characteristics, an image-wave feature fusion (IWFF) module based on depth-separable convolution is designed, which integrates and analyzes the TOFD image and wave features, and an IWFF–GAN model is developed. Second, to improve the accuracy of normal weld recognition, a method for denoising the reconstructed error-feature map based on the total variation model is proposed. Finally, the proposed method is verified using the TOFD images of large-scale spherical pressure-tank welds. The results show that the method accurately distinguishes between the normal and abnormal welds, exhibiting a higher normal weld recognition accuracy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9903.},

  abstract     = {Reciprocating compressor is the core equipment of petrochemical industry and its stable running is very important for productions in the offshore drilling platform. The reason why it is difficult to extract features from vibration signals to reflect the operating state of the compressor is that its internal structure is complex and there are many excitation sources. To solve this problem, a new fault diagnosis method based on spatio-temporal features fusion based on deep belief network (STF-DBN) was proposed, which comprehensively processes multi-source signal features from dimensions of time and space. The temporal features extraction strategy is designed to reflect the data trend by reconstructing the time series according to different period characteristics of fault-related parameters. And the spatial features are extracted to reflect the non-amplitude characteristic of data by breaking down the raw data trend and considering the importance of reconstructed series to various faults. STF-DBN can overcome the deficiency of traditional unsupervised network DBN that cannot extract periodic features, no longer rely on the number of fault data samples, and construct a more comprehensive health curve representing the operation status of reciprocating compressors for fault diagnosis and early warning. The classic Tennessee Eastman (TE) data set in the control field is used for the diagnosis effect test, and the STF-DBN is applied to the operation status detection of the reciprocating compressor for offshore natural gas extraction of China National Offshore Oil Corporation. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in fault defection and early warning.},

  abstract     = {During the design phase of an aircraft manufacturing system, different industrial scenarios need to be evaluated according to key performance indicators to achieve the optimal system performance. It is a highly complex process involving multidisciplinary stakeholders, various digital tools and protocols. To address the digital discontinuity challenge during this process, this paper proposes a tradespace framework based on semantic technology and model-based systems engineering. It aims at functionality integration of requirement management, architecture definition, manufacturing system design, solution verification and visualization. An application ontology is developed to integrate assembly system domain knowledge, industrial requirements and system architecture model information. The proposed framework is implemented in a case study to support the fuselage orbital joint process design, which is part of the aircraft final assembly line. A toolchain is presented to support the implementation, which consists of a set of enabling software corresponding to the functional modules of the framework. Different manufacturing system architectures are first designed by industrial system engineers supported by the application ontology stored in a graph database. They are then analyzed through Discrete Event Simulations and 3D simulations. The simulation results are presented through a web-based portal to show the key performance values of each architecture. This study serves as a part of the proof-of-concept of the recently proposed Cognitive Digital Twin concept.},

  abstract     = {Determining grinding conditions to achieve part quality and production rate requirements is a challenging task. Due to the complexity of the process and many affecting factors, grinding conditions are chosen conservatively, mostly based on experience or handbooks to eliminate quality problems. Thus, an integrated modeling system is required to select grinding conditions in a systematic approach for high-performance grinding. The key feature required of such a system is the capability of producing results in a wide range of grinding conditions and parameters without the necessity of conducting extensive experimentation. This is feasible only by adopting geometrical-physical-based modeling for grinding which is a challenging task since most of the grinding process research is based on experimental methods involving calibration tests. In this study, by considering a grit representation of the grinding wheel and grit-workpiece interaction coupled with the material deformation model, a multi-dimensional modeling system capable of process predictions for a wide range of grinding parameters and conditions has been developed. Using this system, a digital twin-based framework is established to select grinding conditions in an efficient and proactive manner. Based on the simulation results of this new integrated system, some general guidelines are recommended with a systematic approach. This approach is demonstrated in a case study considering the process constraints showing how the material removal rate (MRR) can be maximized without sacrificing the surface integrity which is the main concern in this process. The proposed methodology offers a new outlook on grinding parameter selection, to be used in an integrated digital twin to increase part quality and productivity while respecting the constraints.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-precision machine tools are the foundation for ultra-precision manufacturing. In the era of Industry 4.0, monitoring the machine tool’s working condition is critical to control the machining quality. In a conventional setting, numerous sensors are retrofitted to the machine to monitor its condition effectively. This process could potentially increase the cost of the widespread application of Industry 4.0 technologies. In contrast to the method of retrofitting the machine tool, in this work, we propose an intelligent monitoring system that utilizes the equipment’s power consumption data to assess and determine the equipment states. The work also discusses the development of a G-code interpreter application used to develop an equipment working status matrix. The G-code interpreter application can generate the training data and extract features for the Deep Learning/Machine learning models. The feature extraction process can also be customized by providing template functions to the application. A densely connected convolutional neural network with multiple outputs was then developed to identify the machine state and predict the feedrate simultaneously. The model was able to identify the working component of the machine with an accuracy of $$\sim $$ 94% and was able to predict the feed rate with a standard deviation ( $$\sigma $$ ) of 21.900 from the energy consumption data. The overarching goal of the research work is to predict energy consumed, and augment anomaly detection for an ultra-precision CNC machine tool. The work presented here involves the identification of the equipment state and prediction of the equipment feedrate, and it will serve as a precursor.},

  abstract     = {Even though arc welding is widely utilized to join metallic parts with high reliability, the prediction and control of welding quality is challenging owing to difficulties in the prediction of weld penetration depth and the backside bead. In this study, an effective method for predicting weld penetration based on deep learning was proposed to control the welding quality in-process. The topside weld pool image was closely related to the welding quality and penetration depth and was also an accurate indicator of the state of welding over time. A prediction model for penetration depth using a topside weld pool image was constructed. Semantic segmentation based on a residual neural network was then performed on the acquired weld pool image. Consequently, an accurate weld pool shape was extracted. In addition, a penetration regression model was constructed based on a back-propagation neural network. Finally, the penetration depth (corresponding to the weld pool shape) was extracted via segmentation. The segmentation and regression models were combined to create a penetration prediction model. Considering a gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process, the predictions obtained from the proposed method were evaluated experimentally. In the validation process, the developed model quantitatively predicted the penetration depth in tungsten gas arc welding. The mean absolute error was 0.0596 mm with an R2 value of 0.9974. The model developed in this study can be utilized to predict weld depth penetration and in-processing time using surface images of the weld pool.},

One of the key challenges of CMP is to predict the material removal rate (MRR) accurately. With the development of artificial intelligence techniques, numerous data-driven models have been developed to predict the MRR in the CMP process. However, these methods are not capable of considering surface topography in MRR predictions because it is difficult to observe and measure the surface topography. To address this issue, we propose a graphical model and a conditional variational autoencoder to extract the features of surface topography in the CMP process. Moreover, process variables and the extracted features of surface topography are fed into an ensemble learning-based predictive model to predict the MRR. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can predict the MRR accurately with a root mean squared error of 6.12 nm/min, and it outperforms physics-based machine learning and data-driven methods.},

  abstract     = {In actual industrial applications, the defect detection performance of deep learning models mainly depends on the size and quality of training samples. However, defective samples are difficult to obtain, which greatly limits the application of deep learning-based surface defect detection methods to industrial manufacturing processes. Aiming at solving the problem of insufficient defective samples, a surface defect detection method based on Frequency shift-Convolutional Autoencoder (Fs-CAE) network and Statistical Process Control (SPC) thresholding was proposed. The Fs-CAE network was established by adding frequency shift operation on the basis of the CAE network. The loss of high-frequency information can be prevented through the Fs-CAE network, thereby lowering the interference to defect detection during image reconstruction. The incremental SPC thresholding was introduced to detect defects automatically. The proposed method only needs samples without defects for model training and does not require labels, thus reducing manual labeling time. The surface defect detection method was tested on the air rudder image sets from the image acquisition platform and data augmentation methods. The experimental results indicated that the detection performance of the method proposed in this paper was superior to other surface defect detection methods based on image reconstruction and object detection algorithms. The new method exhibits low false positive rate (FP rate, 0%), low false negative rate (FN rate, 10%), high accuracy (95.19%) and short detection time (0.35 s per image), which shows great potential in practical industrial applications.},

To deal with the challenges confronted by personalized manufacturing, such as high level of flexibility, agility and robustness for dynamic response, we design a centralized-learning decentralized-execution (CLDE) multi-agent reinforcement learning scheduling structure based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), namely graph-based multi-agent system (GMAS), to solve the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). Firstly, according to the product processing network and job shop environment, the probabilistic model of directed acyclic graph for FJSP is constructed. It models the FJSP as the process of topology graph structure predicting, and the scheduling strategy is adjusted by predicting the connection probability among edges. Then, the multi-agent reinforcement learning system consisting of environment module, job agent module, and machine agent module is constructed. The job agents execute scheduling actions by interacting with environment and machine agents in a decentralized way. Meanwhile, the interaction between job agents is extracted as an abstract global action based on GCN. The experimental results demonstrate that GMAS outperforms its rivals on FJSP, especially in complicated situations. Our results thus shed light on a novel direction for FJSP in dynamic and complex scenarios.},

Porosity is an important indicator for evaluating welding quality, and porosity assessment has attracted increasing attention. This paper presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework (MFDLF) that enables online porosity prediction without post-weld destructive inspection or radioactive detection. In the proposed approach, the maximum temperature on the bottom wall of the keyhole acquired by numerical simulation is used as the data of fidelity 1 (F1), and the coherent optical measurement technology is used to acquire the keyhole depth as the data of fidelity 2 (F2). After extracting the respective four fluctuation characteristics of the multi-fidelity data separately, a sparse auto-encoder (SAE) is used to fuse the four characteristics into an overall feature. Based on the obvious correspondence between porosity and multi-fidelity fusion features, the MFDLF is constructed with tandem two deep belief network (DBN) models, where the former DBN utilizes process parameters to predict the overall feature of F1 data (Feature 1) that is difficult to obtain in real time. Feature 1 is combined with the overall feature of F2 data (Feature 2) that can be obtained online to predict porosity through the latter DBN. The results show that the MFDLF can predict porosity with significantly higher accuracy than the models constructed using only single-fidelity data.},

  abstract     = {As the 3D printing polymer material extrusion process is moving beyond niche markets and into large-scale manufacturing, still commercial systems employed by this process work in an open-loop environment where no feedback or control solution is provided from batch-to-batch production. This issue causes significant differences in part quality and generates lower production efficiency. However, there are substantial innovations in terms of smart manufacturing (SM) technologies, where the use of integrated smart sensors, the internet-of-things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, that applied can let the systems evolve into a closed-loop higher rentability mass production process. This study investigates the available smart manufacturing technologies applied to evaluate the current state-of-the-art. This paper used scientometric analysis to analyze the most important contributions in this area. A systematic review aims to verify the results and understand the publications related to the polymer material extrusion process in detail. The analysis concludes that the most investigated aspect is the relation between the mechanical properties of materials and the high anisotropy presented in the process. The conclusions show that different sensors have been integrated, such as digital cameras, thermal cameras, thermocouples, and accelerometers, among others. They all obtain metrics and use data models to make supported decisions. Furthermore, AI algorithms have been applied to the process, and significant progress has been made to detect quality failures or part defects. Finally, as a substantial conclusion, it has been found that there is still no system in the market that can provide integral feedback control and process adjustment in real-time. This brings a positive opportunity to improve and achieve a fully smart manufacturing system in the 3D printing polymer material extrusion process.},
