  abstract     = {We consider coupled slow-fast stochastic processes, where the averaged slow motion is given by a two-dimensional Hamiltonian system with multiple critical points. On a proper time scale, the evolution of the first integral converges to a diffusion process on the corresponding Reeb graph, with certain gluing conditions specified at the interior vertices, as in the case of additive white noise perturbations of Hamiltonian systems considered by M. Freidlin and A. Wentzell. The current paper provides the first result where the motion on a graph and the corresponding gluing conditions appear due to the averaging of a slow-fast system, with a Hamiltonian structure, on a large time scale. The result allows one to consider, for instance, long-time diffusion approximation for an oscillator with a potential with more than one well.},

  abstract     = {Let f be a Gaussian random field on $$\mathbb {R}^d$$ and let X be the number of critical points of f contained in a compact subset. A long-standing conjecture is that, under mild regularity and non-degeneracy conditions on f, the random variable X has finite moments. So far, this has been established only for moments of order lower than three. In this paper, we prove the conjecture. Precisely, we show that X has finite moment of order p, as soon as, at any given point, the Taylor polynomial of order p of f is non-degenerate. We present a simple and general approach that is not specific to critical points and we provide various applications. In particular, we show the finiteness of moments of the nodal volumes and the number of critical points of a large class of smooth, or holomorphic, Gaussian fields, including the Bargmann-Fock ensemble.},

Our starting point is the observation that a recent result from the random matrix theory literature implies a large deviations principle for the hydrodynamic limit of radial Dunkl processes. Using this fact, we prove a variational formula for the large-N asymptotics of generalized Bessel functions, as well as a large deviations principle for the more general family of radial Heckman–Opdam processes. As an application, we prove a theorem on the asymptotic behavior of weight multiplicities of irreducible representations of compact or complex simple Lie algebras in the limit of large rank. The theorems in this paper generalize several known results describing analogous asymptotics for Dyson Brownian motion, spherical matrix integrals, and Kostka numbers.},

Like for the Ising model, a spin configuration is conveniently described as a sequence of spin domains with alternating signs (domain-wall structure). We show that for fixed centered external field and as spin-spin couplings become large, the domain-wall structure scales to a disorder dependent limit that coincides with the infinite disorder fixed point process introduced by D. S. Fisher in the context of zero temperature quantum Ising chains. In particular, our results establish a number of predictions that one can find in Fisher et al. (Phys Rev E 64:41, 2001). The infinite disorder fixed point process for centered external field is equivalently described in terms of the process of suitably selected extrema of a Brownian trajectory introduced and studied by Neveu and Pitman (in: Séminaire de probabilités XXIII. Lecture notes in mathematics, vol 1372, pp 239–247, 1989). This characterization of the infinite disorder fixed point is one of the important ingredients of our analysis.},

  abstract     = {We construct and study properties of an infinite dimensional analog of Kahane’s theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos (Kahane in Ann Sci Math Quebec 9(2):105-150, 1985). Namely, if $$H_T(\omega )$$ is a random field defined w.r.t. space-time white noise $$\dot{B}$$ and integrated w.r.t. Brownian paths in $$d\ge 3$$ , we consider the renormalized exponential $$\mu _{\gamma ,T}$$ , weighted w.r.t. the Wiener measure $$\mathbb {P}_0(\textrm{d}\omega )$$ . We construct the almost sure limit $$\mu _\gamma = \lim _{T\rightarrow \infty } \mu _{\gamma ,T}$$ in the entire weak disorder (subcritical) regime and call it subcritical GMC on the Wiener space. We show that $$\begin{aligned} \mu _\gamma \Big \{\omega : \lim _{T\rightarrow \infty } \frac{H_T(\omega )}{T(\phi \star \phi )(0)} \ne \gamma \Big \}=0 \qquad \text{ almost } \text{ surely, } \end{aligned}$$ meaning that $$\mu _\gamma $$ is supported almost surely only on $$\gamma $$ -thick paths, and consequently, the normalized version is singular w.r.t. the Wiener measure. We then characterize uniquely the limit $$\mu _\gamma $$ w.r.t. the mollification scheme $$\phi $$ in the sense of Shamov (J Funct Anal 270:3224–3261, 2016) – we show that the law of $$\dot{B}$$ under the random rooted measure $$\mathbb Q_{\mu _\gamma }(\textrm{d}\dot{B}\textrm{d}\omega )= \mu _\gamma (\textrm{d}\omega ,\dot{B})P(\textrm{d}\dot{B})$$ is the same as the law of the distribution $$f\mapsto \dot{B}(f)+ \gamma \int _0^\infty \int _{\mathbb {R}^d} f(s,y) \phi (\omega _s-y) \textrm{d}s \textrm{d}y$$ under $$P \otimes \mathbb {P}_0$$ . We then determine the fractal properties of the measure around $$\gamma $$ -thick paths: $$-C_2 \le \liminf _{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} \varepsilon ^2 \log {\widehat{\mu }}_\gamma (\Vert \omega \Vert&lt; \varepsilon ) \le \limsup _{\varepsilon \downarrow 0}\sup _\eta \varepsilon ^2 \log {\widehat{\mu }}_\gamma (\Vert \omega -\eta \Vert &lt; \varepsilon ) \le -C_1$$ w.r.t a weighted norm $$\Vert \cdot \Vert $$ . Here $$C_1&gt;0$$ and $$C_2&lt;\infty $$ are the uniform upper (resp. pointwise lower) Hölder exponents which are explicit in the entire weak disorder regime. Moreover, they converge to the scaling exponent of the Wiener measure as the disorder approaches zero. Finally, we establish negative and $$L^p$$ ( $$p&gt;1$$ ) moments for the total mass of $$\mu _\gamma $$ in the weak disorder regime.},

We prove that the variance of the maximal flow is superconcentrated, i.e. in $$O(\frac{n^{d-1}}{\log n})$$ , for $$h\ge h_0$$ (for a large enough constant $$h_0=h_0(a,b)$$ ). Equivalently, we obtain that the ground state energy of a disordered Ising ferromagnet in a cylinder $$[0,n]^ {d-1}\times [0,hn]$$ is superconcentrated when opposite boundary conditions are applied at the top and bottom faces and for a large enough constant $$h\ge h_0$$ (which depends on the law of the coupling constants). Our proof is inspired by the proof of Benjamini–Kalai–Schramm (Ann Probab 31:1970–1978, 2003). Yet, one major difficulty in this setting is to control the influence of the edges since the averaging trick used in Benjamini et al. (Ann Probab 31:1970–1978, 2003) fails for surfaces. Of independent interest, we prove that minimal surfaces (in the present discrete setting) cannot have long thin chimneys.},

The function $$\sigma $$ is assumed to be positive, bounded, globally Lipschitz, and bounded uniformly away from the origin, and the function b is assumed to be positive, locally Lipschitz and nondecreasing. We prove that the Osgood condition $$\begin{aligned} \int _1^\infty \frac{\textrm{d}y}{b(y)}&lt;\infty \end{aligned}$$ implies that the solution almost surely blows up everywhere and instantaneously, In other words, the Osgood condition ensures that $$\textrm{P}\{ u(t,x)=\infty \quad \hbox { for all } t&gt;0 \hbox { and } x\in {\mathbb {R}}\}=1.$$ The main ingredients of the proof involve a hitting-time bound for a class of differential inequalities (Remark 3.3), and the study of the spatial growth of stochastic convolutions using techniques from the Malliavin calculus and the Poincaré inequalities that were developed in Chen et al. (Electron J Probab 26:1–37, 2021, J Funct Anal 282(2):109290, 2022).},

  abstract     = {We study reflected diffusion on uniform domains where the underlying space admits a symmetric diffusion that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates. A celebrated theorem of Jones (Acta Math 147(1-2):71–88, 1981) states that uniform domains in Euclidean space are extension domains for Sobolev spaces. In this work, we obtain a similar extension property for metric spaces equipped with a Dirichlet form whose heat kernel satisfies a sub-Gaussian estimate. We introduce a scale-invariant version of this extension property and apply it to show that the reflected diffusion process on such a uniform domain inherits various properties from the ambient space, such as Harnack inequalities, cutoff energy inequality, and sub-Gaussian heat kernel bounds. In particular, our work extends Neumann heat kernel estimates of Gyrya and Saloff-Coste (Astérisque 336:145, 2011) beyond the Gaussian space-time scaling. Furthermore, our estimates on the extension operator imply that the energy measure of the boundary of a uniform domain is always zero. This property of the energy measure is a broad generalization of Hino’s result (Probab Theory Relat Fields 156:739–793, 2013) that proves the vanishing of the energy measure on the outer square boundary of the standard Sierpiński carpet equipped with the self-similar Dirichlet form.},

  abstract     = {Contraction properties of transport maps between probability measures play an important role in the theory of functional inequalities. The actual construction of such maps, however, is a non-trivial task and, so far, relies mostly on the theory of optimal transport. In this work, we take advantage of the infinite-dimensional nature of the Gaussian measure and construct a new transport map, based on the Föllmer process, which pushes forward the Wiener measure onto probability measures on Euclidean spaces. Utilizing the tools of the Malliavin and stochastic calculus in Wiener space, we show that this Brownian transport map is a contraction in various settings where the analogous questions for optimal transport maps are open. The contraction properties of the Brownian transport map enable us to prove functional inequalities in Euclidean spaces, which are either completely new or improve on current results. Further and related applications of our contraction results are the existence of Stein kernels with desirable properties (which lead to new central limit theorems), as well as new insights into the Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits conjecture. We go beyond the Euclidean setting and address the problem of contractions on the Wiener space itself. We show that optimal transport maps and causal optimal transport maps (which are related to Brownian transport maps) between the Wiener measure and other target measures on Wiener space exhibit very different behaviors.},

  abstract     = {The Poland–Scheraga model, introduced in the 1970s, is a reference model to describe the denaturation transition of DNA. More recently, it has been generalized in order to allow for asymmetry in the strands lengths and in the formation of loops: the mathematical representation is based on a bivariate renewal process, that describes the pairs of bases that bond together. Here, we consider a disordered version of the model, in which the two strands interact via a potential $$\beta V({\widehat{\omega }}_i, {\bar{\omega }}_j) +h$$ when the ith monomer of the first strand and the jth monomer of the second strand meet. Here, $$h\in {\mathbb {R}}$$ is a homogeneous pinning parameter, $$({\widehat{\omega _i}})_{i\ge 1}$$ and $$({\bar{\omega }}_j)_{j\ge 1}$$ are two sequences of i.i.d. random variables attached to each DNA strand, $$V(\cdot ,\cdot )$$ is an interaction function and $$\beta &gt;0$$ is the disorder intensity. In our main result, we find some condition on the underlying bivariate renewal so that, if one takes $$\beta ,h\downarrow 0$$ at some appropriate (explicit) rate as the length of the strands go to infinity, the partition function of the model admits a non-trivial, disordered, scaling limit. This is known as an intermediate disorder regime and is linked to the question of disorder relevance for the denaturation transition. Interestingly, and unlike any other model of our knowledge, the rate at which one has to take $$\beta \downarrow 0$$ depends on the interaction function $$V(\cdot ,\cdot )$$ and on the distribution of $$({\widehat{\omega _i}})_{i\ge 1}$$ , $$({\bar{\omega }}_j)_{j\ge 1}$$ . On the other hand, the intermediate disorder limit of the partition function, when it exists, is universal: it is expressed as a chaos expansion of iterated integrals against a Gaussian process $${\mathcal {M}}$$ , which arises as the scaling limit of the field $$(e^{\beta V({\widehat{\omega }}_i, {\bar{\omega }}_j)})_{i,j\ge 0}$$ and exhibits correlations on lines and columns.},

Under conditions on the drift vector $${\varvec{g}}= (g_0, g_1, \ldots )&#39;$$ it is known that the Markov process corresponding to the gap sequence of the associated ranked particles has a continuum of product form stationary distributions $$\{\pi _a^{{\varvec{g}}}, a \in S^{{\varvec{g}}}\}$$ where $$S^{{\varvec{g}}}$$ is a semi-infinite interval of the real line.

We also prove that any product form stationary distribution of this Markov process that satisfies a mild integrability condition must be $$\pi _a^{{\varvec{g}}}$$ for some $$a \in S^{{\varvec{g}}}$$ . These results are new even for the infinite Atlas model. The work makes progress on the open problem of characterizing all the invariant distributions of general competing Brownian particle systems interacting through their relative ranks.

Previous general CLT results in this setting have assumed that the cut locus of the Fréchet mean lies outside the support of the population distribution. In this paper we present a CLT under some mild technical conditions on the manifold plus the following assumption on the population distribution: in a neighbourhood of the cut locus of the population Fréchet mean, the population distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to the volume measure on the manifold and in this neighhbourhood the Radon–Nikodym derivative has a version that is continuous. So far as we are aware, the CLT given here is the first which allows the cut locus to have co-dimension one or two when it is included in the support of the distribution. A key part of the proof is establishing an asymptotic approximation for the parallel transport of a certain vector field. Whether or not a non-standard term arises in the CLT depends on whether the co-dimension of the cut locus is one or greater than one: in the former case a non-standard term appears but not in the latter case. This is the first paper to give a general and explicit expression for the non-standard term which arises when the co-dimension of the cut locus is one.},

  abstract     = {Answering a pair of questions of Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu, and Morrison, we prove that a triplet of dice drawn from the multiset model are intransitive with probability $$1/4+o(1)$$ and the probability a random pair of dice tie tends toward $$\alpha n^{-1}$$ for an explicitly defined constant $$\alpha $$ . This extends and sharpens the recent results of Polymath regarding the balanced sequence model. We further show the distribution of larger tournaments converges to a universal tournamenton in both models. This limit naturally arises from the discrete spectrum of a certain skew-symmetric operator (given by the kernel in the title acting on $$L^2([-1,1])$$ ). The limit exhibits a degree of symmetry and can be used to prove that, for instance, the limiting probability that $$A_i$$ beats $$A_{i+1}$$ for $$1\le i\le 4$$ and that $$A_5$$ beats $$A_1$$ is $$1/32+o(1)$$ . Furthermore, the limiting tournamenton has range contained in the discrete set $$\{0,1\}$$ . This proves that the associated tournamenton is non-quasirandom in a dramatic fashion, vastly extending work of Cornacchia and Hązła regarding the continuous analogue of the balanced sequence model. The proof is based on a reduction to conditional central limit theorems (related to work of Polymath), the use of a “Poissonization” style method to reduce to computations with independent random variables, and the systematic use of switching-based arguments to extract cancellations in Fourier estimates when establishing local limit-type estimates.},

The key element of the construction is the use of singular kernels. Moreover, we prove that adaptation to unknown smoothness is compatible with benign overfitting. Namely, we construct a continuous and interpolating local polynomial estimator attaining the minimax optimal rate in $$L_2$$ adaptively to the unknown Hölder smoothness. Our results highlight the fact that interpolation can be fundamentally decoupled from bias-variance tradeoff in the problem of nonparametric regression.},

  abstract     = {In Bayesian statistics, posterior contraction rates (PCRs) quantify the speed at which the posterior distribution concentrates on arbitrarily small neighborhoods of a true model, in a suitable way, as the sample size goes to infinity. In this paper, we develop a new approach to PCRs, with respect to strong norm distances on parameter spaces of functions. Critical to our approach is the combination of a local Lipschitz-continuity for the posterior distribution with a dynamic formulation of the Wasserstein distance, which allows to set forth an interesting connection between PCRs and some classical problems arising in mathematical analysis, probability and statistics, e.g., Laplace methods for approximating integrals, Sanov’s large deviation principles in the Wasserstein distance, rates of convergence of mean Glivenko–Cantelli theorems, and estimates of weighted Poincaré–Wirtinger constants. We first present a theorem on PCRs for a model in the regular infinite-dimensional exponential family, which exploits sufficient statistics of the model, and then extend such a theorem to a general dominated model. These results rely on the development of novel techniques to evaluate Laplace integrals and weighted Poincaré–Wirtinger constants in infinite-dimension, which are of independent interest. The proposed approach is applied to the regular parametric model, the multinomial model, the finite-dimensional and the infinite-dimensional logistic-Gaussian model and the infinite-dimensional linear regression. In general, our approach leads to optimal PCRs in finite-dimensional models, whereas for infinite-dimensional models it is shown explicitly how the prior distribution affect PCRs.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy is a mathematical concept that provides an information-theoretic security guarantee. While differential privacy has emerged as a de facto standard for guaranteeing privacy in data sharing, the known mechanisms to achieve it come with some serious limitations. Utility guarantees are usually provided only for a fixed, a priori specified set of queries. Moreover, there are no utility guarantees for more complex—but very common—machine learning tasks such as clustering or classification. In this paper we overcome some of these limitations. Working with metric privacy, a powerful generalization of differential privacy, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that creates a private measure from a data set. This private measure allows us to efficiently construct private synthetic data that are accurate for a wide range of statistical analysis tools. Moreover, we prove an asymptotically sharp min-max result for private measures and synthetic data in general compact metric spaces, for any fixed privacy budget $$\varepsilon $$ bounded away from zero. A key ingredient in our construction is a new superregular random walk, whose joint distribution of steps is as regular as that of independent random variables, yet which deviates from the origin logarithmically slowly.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) is a classical algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. Although in specific cases the loss of precision in GEPP due to roundoff errors can be very significant, empirical evidence strongly suggests that for a typical square coefficient matrix, GEPP is numerically stable. We obtain a (partial) theoretical justification of this phenomenon by showing that, given the random $$n\times n$$ standard Gaussian coefficient matrix A, the growth factor of the Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting is at most polynomially large in n with probability close to one. This implies that with probability close to one the number of bits of precision sufficient to solve $$Ax = b$$ to m bits of accuracy using GEPP is $$m+O(\log n)$$ , which improves an earlier estimate $$m+O(\log ^2 n)$$ of Sankar, and which we conjecture to be optimal by the order of magnitude. We further provide tail estimates of the growth factor which can be used to support the empirical observation that GEPP is more stable than the Gaussian Elimination with no pivoting.},

  abstract     = {Co-evolving network models, wherein dynamics such as random walks on the network influence the evolution of the network structure, which in turn influences the dynamics, are of interest in a range of domains. While much of the literature in this area is currently supported by numerics, providing evidence for fascinating conjectures and phase transitions, proving rigorous results has been quite challenging. We propose a general class of co-evolving tree network models driven by local exploration, started from a single vertex called the root. New vertices attach to the current network via randomly sampling a vertex and then exploring the graph for a random number of steps in the direction of the root, connecting to the terminal vertex. Specific choices of the exploration step distribution lead to the well-studied affine preferential attachment and uniform attachment models, as well as less well understood dynamic network models with global attachment functionals such as PageRank scores (Chebolu and Melsted, in: SODA, 2008). We obtain local weak limits for such networks and use them to derive asymptotics for the limiting empirical degree and PageRank distribution. We also quantify asymptotics for the degree and PageRank of fixed vertices, including the root, and the height of the network. Two distinct regimes are seen to emerge, based on the expected exploration distance of incoming vertices, which we call the ‘fringe’ and ‘non-fringe’ regimes. These regimes are shown to exhibit different qualitative and quantitative properties. In particular, networks in the non-fringe regime undergo ‘condensation’ where the root degree grows at the same rate as the network size. Networks in the fringe regime do not exhibit condensation. Further, non-trivial phase transition phenomena are shown to arise for: (a) height asymptotics in the non-fringe regime, driven by the subtle competition between the condensation at the root and network growth; (b) PageRank distribution in the fringe regime, connecting to the well known power-law hypothesis. In the process, we develop a general set of techniques involving local limits, infinite-dimensional urn models, related multitype branching processes and corresponding Perron–Frobenius theory, branching random walks, and in particular relating tail exponents of various functionals to the scaling exponents of quasi-stationary distributions of associated random walks. These techniques are expected to shed light on a variety of other co-evolving network models.},

Thus far, proofs for convergence, including ours, rely on discrete complex analysis techniques and are beyond reach for other values of q than the FK-Ising model ( $$q=2$$ ). Given the convergence of interfaces, the conjectural formulas for other values of q could be verified similarly with relatively minor technical work. The limit interfaces are variants of $$\text {SLE}_\kappa $$ curves (with $$\kappa = 16/3$$ for $$q=2$$ ). Their partition functions, that give the connection probabilities, also satisfy properties predicted for correlation functions in conformal field theory (CFT), expected to describe scaling limits of critical random-cluster models.

We fix the torus $${\mathbb {T}}^d_n$$ of dimension d and area n and equip it with the metric inherited from the Euclidean metric in $${\mathbb {R}}^d$$ . Then, embed consecutively n vertices in $${\mathbb {T}}^d_n$$ uniformly at random and independently, and let each vertex but the first one connect to its (already embedded) nearest neighbor. Call the resulting graph $$G_n$$ . We show multiple results concerning the degree sequence of $$G_n$$ . First, we prove that typically the number of vertices of degree at least $$k\in {\mathbb {N}}$$ in the d-NN tree decreases exponentially with k and is tightly concentrated by a new Lipschitz-type concentration inequality that may be of independent interest. Second, we obtain that the maximum degree of $$G_n$$ is of logarithmic order. Third, we give explicit bounds for the number of leaves that are independent of the dimension and also give estimates for the number of paths of length two. Moreover, we show that typically the height of a uniformly chosen vertex in $$G_n$$ is $$(1+o(1))\log n$$ and the diameter of $${\mathbb {T}}^d_n$$ is $$(2e+o(1))\log n$$ , independently of the dimension. Finally, we define a natural infinite analog $$G_{\infty }$$ of $$G_n$$ and show that it corresponds to the local limit of the sequence of finite graphs $$(G_n)_{n \ge 1}$$ . Furthermore, we prove almost surely that $$G_{\infty }$$ is locally finite, that the simple random walk on $$G_{\infty }$$ is recurrent, and that $$G_{\infty }$$ is connected.},

This can be equivalently stated in terms of the total collision time of two independent simple random walks on the plane. More precisely, if $$\textsf{L}_N^{(1,2)}=\sum _{n=1}^N \mathbb {1}_{\{S_n^{(1)}= S_n^{(2)}\}}$$ , then $$\tfrac{\pi }{\log N}\, \textsf{L}^{(1,2)}_N$$ converges in distribution to an exponential random variable of parameter one.

We investigate sufficient conditions to deduce the existence of a stationary measure for the associated Markov semigroups. Existence of such measures is straightforward if A is full rank, but otherwise, energy could potentially accumulate in $$\textrm{ker} A$$ and lead to almost-surely unbounded trajectories, making the existence of stationary measures impossible.

Their use is increasingly popular in applied fields, such as image, geometry or language processing. In these fields however, the probability measures of interest are often not accessible in their entirety and the practitioner may have to deal with statistical or computational approximations instead. In this article, we quantify the effect of such approximations on the corresponding barycenters. We show that Wasserstein barycenters depend in a Hölder-continuous way on their marginals under relatively mild assumptions. Our proof relies on recent estimates that allow to quantify the strong convexity of the barycenter functional. Consequences regarding the statistical estimation of Wasserstein barycenters and the convergence of regularized Wasserstein barycenters towards their non-regularized counterparts are explored.},

Kinetic energy of the solutions can be prescribed a priori up to a stopping time, that can be chosen arbitrarily large with high probability. We also prove that there exist infinitely many Hölder continuous initial conditions leading to non-uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem associated with the system. Our construction relies on a flow transformation reducing the SPDE under investigation to a random PDE, and convex integration techniques introduced in the deterministic setting by De Lellis and Székelyhidi, here adapted to consider the stochastic case. In particular, our novel approach allows to construct probabilistically strong solutions on $$[0,\infty )$$ directly.},

Being local means, roughly, determined by the local behavior of the sample paths of the Brownian motion, and stationary means invariant relative to the Lévy shifts of the sample paths. We answer to the affirmative Tsirelson’s question, whether or not there are any others, and develop some general theory for such sets. An extra ingredient to their structure, that of an honest indexation, leads to a splitting result that is akin to the Wiener–Hopf factorization of the Brownian motion at the minimum (or maximum) and has the latter as a special case. Sets admitting an honest indexation are moreover shown to have the property that no stopping time belongs to them with positive probability. They are also minimal: they do not have any non-empty proper local stationary subsets. Random sets, of the kind studied in this paper, honestly indexed or otherwise, give rise to nonclassical one-dimensional noises, generalizing the noise of splitting. Some properties of these noises and the inter-relations between them are investigated. In particular, subsets are connected to subnoises.},

It is well-known that the mixing time $$\tau _\textsf {RW}$$ of the lazy random walk on G is characterised by the edge conductance $$\Phi $$ of G via Cheeger’s inequality: $$\Phi ^{-1} \lesssim \tau _\textsf {RW} \lesssim \Phi ^{-2} \log |V|$$ . Analogously, we characterise the fastest mixing time $$\tau ^\star $$ via a Cheeger-type inequality but for a different geometric quantity, namely the vertex conductance $$\Psi $$ of G: $$\Psi ^{-1} \lesssim \tau ^\star \lesssim \Psi ^{-2} (\log |V|)^2$$ . This characterisation forbids fast mixing for graphs with small vertex conductance. To bypass this fundamental barrier, we consider Markov chains on G with equilibrium distribution which need not be uniform, but rather only $$\varepsilon $$ -close to uniform in total variation. We show that it is always possible to construct such a chain with mixing time $$\tau \lesssim \varepsilon ^{-1} ({\text {diam}} G)^2 \log |V|$$ . Finally, we discuss analogous questions for continuous-time and time-inhomogeneous chains.},

In particular, we are able to replace the usual weak or local monotonicity condition by a more flexible local Lipschitz condition. Moreover, the usual growth conditions on the multiplicative noise are weakened considerably. Our new setting provides general conditions under which local and global existence and uniqueness hold. In addition, we prove continuous dependence on the initial data. We show that many classical SPDEs, which could not be covered by the classical variational setting, do fit in the critical variational setting.

We prove the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the Langevin deformation on the Wasserstein space over the Euclidean space and a compact Riemannian manifold, and prove the convergence of the Langevin deformation for $$c\rightarrow 0$$ and $$c\rightarrow \infty $$ respectively. Moreover, we prove the W-entropy-information formula along the Langevin deformation on the Wasserstein space on Riemannian manifolds. The rigidity theorems are proved for the W-entropy for the geodesic flow and the Langevin deformation on the Wasserstein space over complete Riemannian manifolds with the CD(0, m)-condition. Our results are new even in the case of Euclidean spaces and complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature.},

The data are not linearly separable and hence we content ourselves to find a linear classifier with the largest possible negative margin. In other words, we want to find a unit norm vector $$\varvec{\theta }$$ that maximizes $$\min _{i\le n}y_i\langle \varvec{\theta },\varvec{x}_i\rangle $$ . This is a non-convex optimization problem (it is equivalent to finding a maximum norm vector in a polytope), and we study its typical properties under two random models for the data. We consider the proportional asymptotics in which $$n,d\rightarrow \infty $$ with $$n/d\rightarrow \delta $$ , and prove upper and lower bounds on the maximum margin $$\kappa _{{\textrm{s}}}(\delta )$$ or—equivalently—on its inverse function $$\delta _{{\textrm{s}}}(\kappa )$$ . In other words, $$\delta _{{\textrm{s}}}(\kappa )$$ is the overparametrization threshold: for $$n/d\le \delta _{{\textrm{s}}}(\kappa )-{\varepsilon }$$ a classifier achieving vanishing training error exists with high probability, while for $$n/d\ge \delta _{{\textrm{s}}}(\kappa )+{\varepsilon }$$ it does not. Our bounds on $$\delta _{{\textrm{s}}}(\kappa )$$ match to the leading order as $$\kappa \rightarrow -\infty $$ . We then analyze a linear programming algorithm to find a solution, and characterize the corresponding threshold $$\delta _{\textrm{lin}}(\kappa )$$ . We observe a gap between the interpolation threshold $$\delta _{{\textrm{s}}}(\kappa )$$ and the linear programming threshold $$\delta _{\textrm{lin}}(\kappa )$$ , raising the question of the behavior of other algorithms.},

The aim of this paper is to make progress towards a proof of this conjecture. We consider a supercritical inhomogeneous random graph model with degree exponent $$\tau \in (3, 4)$$ that is closely related to Aldous’s multiplicative coalescent, and show that the MST constructed by assigning i.i.d. continuous weights to the edges in its giant component, endowed with the tree distance scaled by $$n^{-(\tau -3)/(\tau -1)}$$ , converges in distribution with respect to the Gromov–Hausdorff topology to a random compact real tree. Further, almost surely, every point in this limiting space either has degree one (leaf), or two, or infinity (hub), both the set of leaves and the set of hubs are dense in this space, and the Minkowski dimension of this space equals $$(\tau -1)/(\tau -3)$$ . The multiplicative coalescent, in an asymptotic sense, describes the evolution of the component sizes of various near-critical random graph processes. We expect the limiting spaces in this paper to be the candidates for the scaling limit of the MST constructed for a wide array of other heavy-tailed random graph models.},

  abstract     = {The present paper is devoted to the investigation of an important family of absorbed singular diffusion processes exhibiting long transient dynamics, namely, interesting and important dynamical behaviours over long but finite time scales. We explore the multiscale dynamics by establishing the asymptotic distribution of the normalized extinction time, the asymptotic reciprocal relationship between the mean extinction time and the principal eigenvalue of the generator, and a sophisticated multiscale estimate of solutions. While information about the extinction time and mean extinction time uncovers fundamental principles quantifying in particular the lifespan of interesting dynamical behaviours combined and its natural connection with the principal eigenvalue, the multiscale estimate characterizes the dynamics over different time scales. These are achieved by examining quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) that govern the dynamics before the eventual absorption happens, and establishing the powerful sub-exponential large deviation principle (LDP) for QSDs, which determines the quasi-potential function and prefactor in the WKB expansion, and therefore, provides very fine asymptotic or concentration properties of QSDs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the sub-exponential LDP for QSDs is established for absorbed singular diffusion processes. Our approach is analytic and elementary. As byproducts or consequences, new results about QSDs near the absorbing state and infinity, the sub-exponential asymptotic of the principal eigenvalue, and the asymptotic of the principal eigenfunction are obtained. The sub-exponential LDP for QSDs is of independent interest and expected to have more far-reaching consequences. Applications to logistic diffusion processes arising from chemical reactions and population dynamics are discussed. In particular, Keizer’s paradox concerning the long-term dynamical disagreement between a deterministic model and its stochastic counterpart, and diffusion approximation of QSDs are rigorously justified.},

Surprisingly, we find that the volume growth of infinite clusters is always purely exponential (that is, the subexponential corrections to growth are bounded) in the regime $$p_c&lt;p&lt;p_{2\rightarrow 2}$$ , even when the ambient graph has unbounded corrections to exponential growth. For p slightly larger than $$p_c$$ , we establish the precise estimates $$\begin{aligned} \textbf{E}_p \left[ \# B_\textrm{int}(v,r) \right]&amp;\asymp \left( r \wedge \frac{1}{p-p_c} \right) e^{\gamma _\textrm{int}(p) r} \\ \textbf{E}_p \left[ \# B_\textrm{int}(v,r) \mid v \leftrightarrow \infty \right]&amp;\asymp \left( r \wedge \frac{1}{p-p_c} \right) ^2 e^{\gamma _\textrm{int}(p) r} \end{aligned}$$ for every $$v\in V$$ , $$r \ge 0$$ , and $$p_c &lt; p \le p_c+\delta $$ , where the growth rate $$\gamma _\textrm{int}(p) = \lim \frac{1}{r} \log \textbf{E}_p\#B(v,r)$$ satisfies $$\gamma _\textrm{int}(p) \asymp p-p_c$$ . We also prove a percolation analogue of the Kesten–Stigum theorem that holds in the entire supercritical regime and states that the quenched and annealed exponential growth rates of an infinite cluster always coincide.

  abstract     = {We prove that for recurrent, reversible graphs, the following conditions are equivalent: (a) existence and uniqueness of the potential kernel, (b) existence and uniqueness of harmonic measure from infinity, (c) a new anchored Harnack inequality, and (d) one-endedness of the wired uniform spanning tree. In particular this gives a proof of the anchored (and in fact also elliptic) Harnack inequality on the UIPT. This also complements and strengthens some results of Benjamini et al. (Ann Probab 29(1):1–65, 2001). Furthermore, we make progress towards a conjecture of Aldous and Lyons by proving that these conditions are fulfilled for strictly subdiffusive recurrent unimodular graphs. Finally, we discuss the behaviour of the random walk conditioned to never return to the origin, which is well defined as a consequence of our results.},

This concentration result will be used in Aggarwal and Huang (Edge statistics for lozenge tilings of polygons, II: Airy line ensemble, 2021. arXiv:2108.12874 ) to prove that the edge statistics of simply-connected polygonal domains, subject to a technical assumption on their limit shape, converge to the Airy line ensemble.},

  abstract     = {In the Bayes paradigm, given a loss function and an n-sample, we present the construction of a new type of posterior distribution, that extends the classical Bayes one. The loss functions we have in mind are either those derived from the total variation and Hellinger distances or some $${\mathbb {L}}_{j}$$ -ones for $$j&gt;1$$ . We prove that, with a probability close to one, this new posterior distribution concentrates its mass in a neighbourhood (for the chosen loss function) of the law of the data, provided that this law belongs to the support of the prior or, at least, lies close enough to it. We therefore establish that the new posterior distribution enjoys some robustness properties with respect to a possible misspecification of the prior, or more precisely, its support. We also show that the posterior distribution is stable with respect to the equidistribution assumption we started from. Besides, when the model is regular and well-specified and one uses the squared Hellinger loss, we show that our credible regions possess, at least for n sufficiently large, the same ellipsoidal shapes and approximately the same sizes as those we would derive from the classical Bayesian posterior distribution by using the Bernstein–von Mises theorem. Then we use our Bayesian-like approach to solve the following problems. We first consider the estimation of a location parameter or both the location and scale parameters of a density in a nonparametric framework. Then we tackle the problem of estimating a density, with the squared Hellinger loss, in a high-dimensional parametric model under some sparsity conditions on the parameter. Importantly, the results established in this paper are nonasymptotic and provide, as much as possible, bounds with explicit constants.},

  abstract     = {Toda conformal field theories (CFTs) form a family of 2d CFTs indexed by semisimple and complex Lie algebras. They are natural generalizations of the Liouville CFT in that they enjoy an enhanced level of symmetry encoded by W-algebras. These theories can be rigorously defined using a probabilistic framework that involves the consideration of correlated Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures. This document provides a first step towards the computation of a class of three-point correlation functions, that generalize the celebrated DOZZ formula and whose expressions were predicted in the physics literature by Fateev–Litvinov, within the probabilistic framework associated to the $$\mathfrak {sl}_3$$ Toda CFT. Namely this first article of a two-parts series is dedicated to the probabilistic derivation of the reflection coefficients of general Toda CFTs, which are essential building blocks in the understanding of Toda correlation functions. Along the computations of these reflection coefficients a new path decomposition for diffusion processes in Euclidean spaces, based on a suitable notion of minimum and that generalizes the celebrated one-dimensional result of Williams, will be unveiled. As a byproduct we describe the joint tail expansion of correlated Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures together with an asymptotic expansion of class one Whitakker functions.},

  abstract     = {The solid-on-solid model is a model of height functions, introduced to study the interface separating the $$+$$ and − phase in the Ising model. The planar solid-on-solid model thus corresponds to the three-dimensional Ising model. Delocalisation of this model at high temperature and at zero slope was first derived by Fröhlich and Spencer, in parallel to proving the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition. The first main result of this article consists of a simple, alternative proof of delocalisation of the solid-on-solid model. In fact, the argument is more general: it works on any planar graph—not just the square lattice—and implies that the interface delocalises at any slope rather than exclusively at the zero slope. The second main result, proved independently, is that the absolute value of the height function in this model satisfies the FKG lattice condition. This property is believed to be intimately linked to the (quantitative) understanding of delocalisation, given the recent successes in the context of the square ice and (more generally) the six-vertex model, and it has already been used elsewhere in a new proof of the BKT transition. The new FKG inequality is shown to hold true for both the solid-on-solid model as well as for the discrete Gaussian model, which in this article implies that the two notions of delocalisation, namely delocalisation in finite volume and delocalisation of shift-invariant Gibbs measures, coincide.},

For eigenvalues in the bulk, we prove that the asymptotic fluctuations of a single eigenvalue around its classical location are Gaussian with a universal variance. Our method is based on a dynamical approach to mesoscopic linear spectral statistics which reduces their behavior on short scales to that on larger scales. We prove a central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics on larger scales via resolvent techniques and show that for certain classes of test functions, the leading-order contribution to the variance agrees with the GOE/GUE cases.},
