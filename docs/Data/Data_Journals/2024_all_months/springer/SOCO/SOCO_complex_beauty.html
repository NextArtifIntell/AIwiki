  abstract     = {With the development of digital media content, users have become the controllers of various digital media terminals. The creative design of interactive advertising is an uncertain part of the overall market segment of human–computer communication. All advertisements can be easily introduced to the public. Excellent digital technology has changed the carrier of advertising content, the form and structure of advertising, and the marketing between advertising relationships. Therefore, this article processes and designs digital media based on improved genetic algorithm technology and mobile communication technology. A genetic algorithm for designing multigroup matrix structures is designed to improve the speed of synthesis. By using multi-core CPUs to build parallel KNN classifiers, the slow adaptation function caused by large data sets improves computational shortcomings, making genetic algorithm optimization a practical project for machine learning. This has played an important role in further expanding research on automated learning. Therefore, this article introduces in detail the requirements of genetic algorithm mobile technology in digital media advertising interaction design applications and system performance test results. The system further elaborates the concept of advertising interaction design, and conducts in-depth research on the expression of user experience and experience innovation strategies. At the same time, it has also found the value of user experience, so advertising interaction focused on user experience has a very large development space, which is also a broad application value and expectation.},

  abstract     = {The development of educational informatization has had a profound impact on college English education. In order to better meet the needs of students, many universities have begun to explore new English education models. This paper designs a speech recognition system for English teaching based on LSTM network and feature extraction. LSTM network is used to process speech signals, extract speech features and then classify them. Feature extraction can transform speech signal into feature vector which can be used by classifier. Using a speech data set containing multiple English pronunciation words, the data set was tested and evaluated. The experimental results show that the speech recognition system based on LSTM network can effectively recognize the differences between different words and can achieve a higher classification accuracy under different noise and interference conditions. The English teaching speech recognition system based on LSTM network and feature extraction has great application prospects. By using the speech recognition system, teachers can evaluate students&#39; English pronunciation level more efficiently and provide personalized teaching programs for students. At the same time, students can also practice English pronunciation independently through the speech recognition system to improve their language expression ability and listening comprehension.},

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. It attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new way to react in a similar way to human intelligence. Due to the natural environment, technical level, history, culture, talents and many other reasons, there are many problems in the development of China’s regional economic pattern, and the imbalance between regions is very prominent. Therefore, it is of great significance for China’s social and economic development to deeply study the current regional economic development in China. This paper proposed a neural network based on artificial intelligence and improved it to obtain an improved back propagation (BP) neural network with stronger prediction ability, which could accurately and effectively predict the impact of changes in the spatial structure of regional enterprises and regional economic pattern, so as to optimize in time and make the regional economy develop better. The experimental results in this paper showed that the prediction error of the improved neural network was between 0.01 and 0.02, and the prediction error of the improved neural network tended to zero after 40 iterations. It can be seen that the prediction ability of the improved BP neural network is stronger. Therefore, it is appropriate to select the improved BP neural network algorithm based on artificial intelligence to predict the impact of regional enterprise spatial structure change and regional economic pattern. The security intelligence service is also very helpful for the research of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle ad hoc network is used on the road where vehicles serve as mobile nodes. VANET’s primary uses include intelligent transportation and active security. The framework for intelligent transportation systems relies heavily on VANETs. Intelligent transportation networks are sometimes used to refer to VANETs. In VANETs, however, authentication and user privacy remain crucial issues. This study proposes a novel method for privacy-based authentication algorithms that improve the accuracy of data transmission for smart VANET transportation. Here, a lightweight hybrid authentication-based privacy-preserving algorithm is used to improve privacy. Then, an effective congestion-based clustering algorithm is used to send the data. Throughput, QoS, latency, computational cost, and data transmission rate are the focus of the experimental analysis. Throughput, QoS, latency, computational cost, and data transmission rate were all achieved using the proposed method. The proposed method makes use of lightweight, efficient pseudonyms that can be used for both message authentication and as a trapdoor to provide conditional anonymity. The proposed method’s ability to withstand a variety of security and privacy threats is demonstrated by the various attack scenarios and the proposed technique attained throughput 93%, QoS 55%, latency 62%, computational cost 63%, and data transmission rate 69%.},

This paper tries to break the bottleneck of film creation talents by introducing artificial neural network technology and is committed to cultivating innovative talents. By using artificial neural network technology, the optimal model can be obtained based on target training samples. The main unit of this network technology is neuron. Through the design experiment, we can know that if we want to obtain the best convolutional network reconstruction model, the probability p value must be set to 0.1. Under this environment, the accuracy and convergence speed of the model will be greatly improved, so as to effectively analyze the research on creative talent training path. Then, this paper analyzes the feasibility and necessity of film creation talent training by establishing a talent development prediction function. Through the innovation ability test of the target group and the comprehensive description of the function realization, the following characteristics are obtained: The target student group lacks innovation awareness, but has strong skills and rich imagination. Although the innovation personality is outstanding, the overall innovation ability is still low. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the innovation level of the target student group. Based on this, this paper puts forward several suggestions for talent cultivation. This paper designs several training paths by introducing artificial neural network into the training process of film creation talents.},

  abstract     = {An &quot;ElectroCardioGram (ECG)&quot; plays a significant diagnostic system in diagnosing &quot;Cardio Vascular Disorders (CVD),&quot; which are the primary factor of mortality globally. Computerized computing assessment of typical &quot;12-lead ECG&quot; became more important when ECGs were transferred from an &quot;Analog–Digital Converter (ADC).&quot; The poor levels of conventional technique&#39;s accuracy impact that they cannot be used as a primary clinical diagnosis. When it comes to pattern recognition techniques, the goal is to classify each pulse into one of two categories: &quot;Healthy&quot; or &quot;Abnormal.&quot; Recently the &quot;Stochastic Computing (SC)&quot; is increasingly being used in applications that need parallelization. In conventional parallelization systems, major drawback of the system is a big quantity of hardware is required, so computations are rather high. The number of tasks performed simultaneously is thereby limited. Since such hardware required doing each operation is much less than in typical digital solutions, the SC may provide a remedy to this issue. When employing SC components, more complicated activities may be completed simultaneously. This research proposes a low-cost approach for identifying ECG patterns and classifying arrhythmia heartbeats. In this research, &quot;SC-based Neural Networks (SCNN)&quot; was developed. Stochastic objective functions or SC weights may be used for random fluctuation in the network&#39;s neurons to build the SCNN. Due to their ability to avoid localized minima, they are important tools for solving optimization issues in classifying abnormal ECG signals. We compare the innovative SCNN method&#39;s assessment metrics to those of our earlier methods EPSO and ESVM. The EPSO, ESVM, and SCNN techniques were tested to anticipate the outcomes for the MIT-BIH database, with each approach concentrating on a unique set of metrics like &quot;Accuracy,&quot; &quot;Sensitivity,&quot; Precision,&quot; and &quot;F1-score.&quot; Despite the presence of imbalanced data, the overall results obtained using the SCNN approach were better than those obtained using the EPSO, and the ESVM methods.},

  abstract     = {Online networking sites are increasingly being used to communicate suicidal thoughts. Suicide research and policy are best served by monitoring such conversations and exchanging information of significant relevance for both individual prevention and population-wide goals. As a result, multiple studies discovered that monitoring social media postings might help identify those who are thinking about suicide. Finding and understanding patterns of suicidal thoughts, however, is a difficult undertaking. As a result, it is vital to construct a machine learning system for automatic early identification of suicide thoughts or any sudden changes in a user’s behavior by evaluating his or her postings on social media. This may be done by comparing the user’s previous behavior to his or her current conduct. In this study, a Twitter dataset containing features like age, gender, follower, following, drunk abuse, hours, and category is utilized to predict and analyze suicide behavior. The class containing the values has the attribute name category normal, low and high denoting the levels of suicide risk, and attributes comprise categorical and numerical data. The Twitter dataset is categorized using a proposed rule-based algorithm by utilizing the quicksort method to determine the best split point from a chosen attribute. The tree’s split points classify data, and a decision tree computes all node path distributions. The records with missing values are calculated as part of the missing count after all the class values have been counted. Based on class values, the accuracy of the user age level prediction analysis is performed from the node distribution. Male users had a 32% high suicide risk compared to female users’ 24% for age groups under 37. Female Twitter users who are older than 37 have an average suicide risk level of 25% compared to male users who have a prediction level of 20%. It has been observed that the proposed model, when compared to the existing model, obtained a better accuracy for values ranging from 76 to 90% for 7 distributions and more than 90% for 25 node distributions out of 33 nodes. Twitter’s benchmark for suicide detection in online social networks is successful, according to the experimental research. The suggested model yields high average accuracy of 70%, according to experimental findings.},

Assessing the social circular economy performance of European Union countries from the sustainable development perspective is critical for monitoring their progress. In this study, a model that evaluates the social circular economy performances of countries for sustainable development is proposed. The importance weights of the evaluation criteria are determined using the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy VIKOR method’s linguistic scale. Then , the countries are ranked using the grey relational analysis method. In this study, the social circular economy performance of EU member states for 2021 are investigated with the proposed model. According to the results obtained, social circular economy performances are directly proportional to the success of countries in achieving sustainable development goals. The success rating achieved in this study may vary with the improvement activities of the relevant countries. The proposed model updates the ranking, considering each improvement. The findings of this study can help scholars and policymakers better understand the social circularity capabilities of the European Union member countries in the context of sustainable development. In the limited literature, there is no other study in which the social circular economy performance of EU member countries is measured with the relevant evaluation criteria. A model that can evaluate the social circular economy performances of the European Union member countries is proposed to fill the profound gap in this field.

IoT connects all objects to the Internet through information sensing devices, enabling information exchange and intelligent identification and management of things. This has led to a wide range of applications. While blockchain technology addresses the centralization issue of traditional IoT systems, privacy leakage remains a key challenge for implementing smart supply chain management using IoT. We present privacy-preserving techniques to enable secure IoT trading. First, we propose a blockchain architecture based on post-quantum cryptography to securely store data and information. Second, we propose a post-quantum mixed currency mechanism for enhanced privacy protection. Third, we propose a blockchain-based IoT architecture designed for secure trading. By integrating blockchain, mixed currency approaches, and post-quantum techniques, we develop a blockchain-based IoT trading system. We implement this system within cryptocurrency markets.

This work focuses on job crafting, which is considered the way to improve the relationship between some organizational variables and other individual variables such as organizational identification and satisfaction with communication, both of which are crucial to achieving sustainable levels of well-being. The study examines the role of latent constructs that can promote adaptive responses as well as their relations. In particular, we focus on organizational identification in promoting adaptive responses, including the increase in structural resources, the increase in challenging demands, and the increase in social resources as adaptive strategies to improve satisfaction with communication. The analysis is carried out using robust statistical techniques that are suited to the study of causal relations between abstract constructs. Specifically, after Confirmatory Composite Analysis (CCA-PLS) to evaluate the quality of the data collected, a higher order mediation model, based on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), was performed to test the mediation role of the job crafting. In addition, we prioritize such latent constructs using importance–performance map analysis (IPMA) to evaluate the relevance and performance of each construct of this model. The results show a relationship between organizational identification, corresponding to a high sense of belonging, and communication satisfaction at all levels through the mediation of job crafting.},

  abstract     = {The diffusion of AI and big data is reshaping decision-making processes by increasing the amount of information that supports decisions, while reducing direct interaction with data and empirical evidence. This paradigm shift introduces new sources of uncertainty, as limited data observability results in ambiguity and a lack of interpretability. The need for the proper analysis of data-driven strategies motivates the search for new models that can describe this type of bounded access to knowledge.This contribution presents a novel theoretical model for uncertainty in knowledge representation and its transfer mediated by agents. We provide a dynamical description of knowledge states by endowing our model with a structure to compare and combine them. Specifically, an update is represented through combinations, and its explainability is based on its consistency in different dimensional representations. We look at inequivalent knowledge representations in terms of multiplicity of inferences, preference relations, and information measures. Furthermore, we define a formal analogy with two scenarios that illustrate non-classical uncertainty in terms of ambiguity (Ellsberg’s model) and reasoning about knowledge mediated by other agents observing data (Wigner’s Friend). Finally, we discuss some implications of the proposed model for data-driven strategies, with special attention to reasoning under uncertainty about business value dimensions and the design of measurement tools for their assessment.},

  abstract     = {We consider a set $$N = \{ 1,\ldots ,n \}$$ , $$n\ge 2$$ , of interacting agents whose individual opinions $$ x_{i}$$ , with $$i \in N $$ , take values in some domain $$\mathbb {D}\subseteq \mathbb {R}$$ . The interaction among the agents represents the degree of reciprocal influence which the agents exert upon each other and it is expressed by a general asymmetric interaction matrix with null diagonal and off-diagonal coefficients in the open unit interval. The present paper examines the asymmetric generalization of the linear consensus dynamics model discussed in previous publications by the same authors, in which symmetric interaction was assumed. We are mainly interested in determining the form of the asymptotic convergence towards the consensual opinion. In this respect, we present some general results plus the study of three particular versions of the linear consensus dynamics, depending on the relation between the interaction structure and the degrees of proneness to evaluation review of the various individual opinions. In the general asymmetric case, the analytic form of the asymptotic consensual solution $$\tilde{x}$$ is highly more complex than that under symmetric interaction, and we have obtained it only in two low-dimensional cases. Nonetheless, we are able to write those complex analytic forms arranging the numerous terms in an intelligible way which might provide useful clues to the open quest for the analytic form of the asymptotic consensual solution in higher-dimensional cases.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic is a novel, fast-spreading, deadly virus. It has spread around the world in an extremely short time. Due to its rapid spread and negative effects on all aspects of our lives (health, finances, stress, etc.), scientists are seeking to find accurate and fast solutions to this crisis. In our paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of the different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques used for the detection, classification, and segmentation of COVID-19. We depend on our review of reliable databases such as IEEE Explore, Google Scholar, MDPI, Springer, PubMed, and Science Direct. By surveying approximately 978 papers, we found that 160 were more authorized, 77 of which were selected for review and met the criteria. A taxonomy is introduced to describe the sequence of our paper. Subsequently, a deep analysis and critical review of the academic literature were conducted to highlight the challenges and significant gaps identified in the introduced subject. The results revealed a shortage of research that assessed and established standards for the methods utilized for identifying and categorizing COVID-19 chest imaging techniques. As we continue the assessment and standardization process, three main difficulties are anticipated: the existence of various evaluation criteria for each task, the conflicts between these criteria, and the importance of these criteria. Moreover, we present a review of different systems used from the beginning of this crisis based on ML and DL by using different medical image modalities, such as chest X-ray, chest computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound imaging. We also highlight the datasets used and the different results of performance measures that have been developed by different researchers in this medical field. Finally, we discuss the limitations and lessons learned that are associated with the use of ML and DL techniques for diagnosing COVID-19. To support our work, we developed a new algorithm based on using transfer learning for several deep learning models and applied it to our own dataset. The aim of our paper is to collect various authorized data to help experts and specialists understand the importance of ML and DL systems in this respect, represent a new algorithm, and benefit them in future work toward fighting COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Solving inverse kinematics (IK) is an excellent challenge for redundant manipulators due to their highly non-linear and complex coupling, which is not amenable to analytical solutions by conventional methods. In this paper, the conventional solution was replaced by the optimization process of a fitness function. The fitness function aims to obtain a set of solutions for the desired position of the end effector (EE). The function is based on forward kinematics; hence, this method can avoid singularities and be suitable for solving redundant manipulators. For solving this optimization problem, the bald eagle search (BES) optimization algorithm was chosen due to its easy principle and excellent performance. BES integrates the advantages of evolutionary and swarm techniques. On the one hand, BES maximizes the advantages offered by swarm intelligence (SI) in terms of searching within the best position in the swarm. On the other hand, BES capitalizes on the capability of evolutionary techniques to explore the search space frequently and avoid the local optimum. In this study, two 7-degree of freedom (DOF) manipulators were used to test the performance of BES. Meanwhile, several evolutionary and SI optimization algorithms were selected to compare with BES. The experimental results demonstrate that the BES optimization algorithm can efficiently and accurately solve the IK problem of 7DOF redundant manipulators.},

  abstract     = {To strengthen and improve the ideological and political education of college students in the new era, the team of counselors is the backbone and plays a crucial role. With the development of higher education in China, the number of college students is constantly increasing; The development of the Internet has, to a certain extent, made the living environment of students more complex and their ideological concepts diversified, which has brought new difficulties and challenges to the work of college counselors. Under the new situation, strengthening the research on the professional ability of college counselors is of great significance for the construction of the team of college counselors. The college counselors’ ability maturity evaluation is a multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM). Recently, the TODIM technique and VIKOR technique has been conducted to cope with MADM issues. The triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs) are conducted as a useful technique for characterizing fuzzy decision information during the college counselors’ ability maturity evaluation. In this paper, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic TODIM-VIKOR (TFN-TODIM-VIKOR) technique is put forward to solve the MADM under TFNSs. Finally, a numerical example for college counselors’ ability maturity evaluation is employed to validate the proposed TFN-TODIM-VIKOR technique. The main contribution of this paper is conducted: (1) the TODIM and VIKOR technique was extended to TFNSs; (2) Entropy technique is employed to manage the weight values under TFNSs. (3) the TFN-TODIM-VIKOR technique is founded to manage the MADM under TFNSs; (4) Algorithm analysis for college counselors’ ability maturity evaluation and comparison analysis are constructed based on one numerical example to verify the effectiveness of the TFN-TODIM-VIKOR technique.},

Since the power consumption is directly affected by the cutting forces, it is necessary to estimate the magnitude of the cutting forces and the amplitude of the cutter vibration in x, y and z directions with respect to chip geometry. The present study aimed to develop an intelligent manufacturing system to monitor the cutting forces while keeping the tool vibration in an acceptable range. Mechanistic models, finite element modeling (FEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models have been developed to predict cutting forces and amplitude of cutter vibration related to chip geometry. Experiments were carried out on AISI 1020, AISI 4340 and AISI D2 steels at different levels of spindle rotation speed, orbital speed and axial depth of cuts using mill cutters with diameters of 8, 10 and 20 mm on DMC-75V linear three axes CNC vertical machining center. Experimental results for cutting force and amplitude of cutter vibration were measured and cutting force coefficients were calculated using the cutting force data and estimated cutting forces related to the chip geometry using mechanistic models. The ANN predicted the chip geometry, cutting forces and cutter vibration have good agreement with mechanistic approach. Among the three methods, the ANN is the simplest and took less time in estimation of chip geometry, cutting forces and amplitude of cutter vibration.},

However, these methods do not perform well for data having non-spherical distribution and are also sensitive to unbalanced cluster size. Many of these methods suffer from noise sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose the FkPCM_S_UB method that utilizes a weighted sum of FCM and FkPC to segment images having non-spherical or a mixture of flat-shaped and spherical-shaped data. It includes both local spatial and gray-level information to control the effect of noise and a fuzzy exponential entropy term to tackle the problem of unbalanced cluster size. The effectiveness of the proposed FkPCM_S_UB method is evaluated on four medical image datasets using the average segmentation accuracy and dice score as performance measures. The proposed FkPCM_S_UB method outperforms all eighteen existing methods for ASA and DS for all four medical image datasets. Friedman statistical test is also utilized to establish the statistically significant better performance of the proposed FkPCM_S_UB method compared to the eighteen existing methods used for medical image segmentation.},

This problem arises when the number of samples representing one class is significantly smaller than the others, leading to weak classification performance, particularly for minority class instances. Traditional classification models assuming equal class instances can result in low prediction accuracy and decision-making precision for minority class instances, raising concerns about identifying such instances accurately. To overcome this issue, this research proposes a hybrid technique that combines the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) approach with a batch generator named the HADAB technique. ADASYN generates synthetic samples for the minority class, balancing the dataset and improving prediction accuracy. Conversely, the batch generator feeds data to the model in batches, enhancing training efficiency. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) serves as the base classifier in this study. The proposed HADAB technique significantly improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency without requiring additional parameter tuning, algorithm modification, or increasing complexity. We validate the performance of HADAB using publicly available NASA datasets encompassing diverse types. The results demonstrate the superiority of HADAB over traditional prediction accuracy methods. In conclusion, the proposed HADAB technique offers a practical and effective solution for handling class imbalance in software defect prediction, leading to improved prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new hybrid method to address the issue of redundant and irrelevant features selected by filter-based methods for text classification. The method utilizes an enhanced genetic algorithm called “Feature Correlation-based Genetic Algorithm” (FC-GA). Initially, a feature subset with the highest classification accuracy is selected by a filter-based method, which will be then used by the FC-GA to generate potential solutions by considering the correlation between features that have similar classification weights and avoiding useless random solutions. The encoding process involves assigning a value of 0 to features that provide a high degree of correlation with other features having almost the same classification information beyond a specified context, while features that are lowly correlated retain their initial code of 1. Through iterative optimization using crossover and mutation operators, the algorithm should remove redundant features that provide strong correlations and high redundancy, which could lead to improved classification performance at a lower computation cost. The aim of this study is to improve the efficiency of filter-based methods, incorporate feature correlation information into genetic algorithms, and utilize pre-optimized feature subsets to efficiently identify optimal solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, SVM and NB classifiers are employed on six public datasets and compared to five well-known and effective filter-based methods. The results indicate that a significant portion (about 50%) of the features selected by reference filter-based methods are redundant. Eliminating those redundant features leads to a significant improvement in classification performance as measured by the micro-f1 measure.},

A multi-criteria decision-making technique called the weighted sum method selects the optimal feature set from the Pareto front. To evaluate the effectiveness of the MOBR approach, a comparison is conducted with Chi-Square (CS), Information Gain (IG), Single Objective Binary Rao (BR), and Multi-objective NSGA-II over twenty-four benchmark Promise and NASA datasets with imbalanced and balanced data using Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) prediction models. Our MOBR model is evaluated using five assessment measures and statistically compared, further win-draw-loss comparison performed to compare each prediction model. The experimental and statistical analysis demonstrates that In terms of FOR, Recall, F1-Score, AUC, and G-mean, MOBR gets top ranks of 3.5, 1, 5, 2.5, and 1 over unbalanced data and 3, 1.5, 1.5, 6, 2.5 over balanced data, respectively.

  abstract     = {War trauma data, a core element of military research, have been attracting significant attention from several countries, despite limited availability. In this study, we propose a data augmentation method for war trauma that combines a trauma scoring system and deep learning to generate large-scale and effective synthetic data. First, the Abbreviated War Trauma Scale (AWTS), including the trauma scoring table and the vital signs scoring table, was developed by collecting information on battlefield environment injuries. Second, a new war trauma severity scoring (NWTSS) equation evaluating injury severity was proposed using multiple linear regression analysis on manually labelled synthetic samples. Then, based on the AWTS and NWTSS, we formulated a synthetic algorithm for generating large-scale automatically labelled cases. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the synthetic data, we trained deep-learning classifiers with these data and tested them using real data. The experimental results show that the classifiers performed best when the size of the synthetic data scale was around 50,000. Furthermore, the text classification model designed in this study for war trauma data achieved 85.59% accuracy, outperforming the current popular text classifiers, indicating that the synthetic data effectively reflected the real situation.},

  abstract     = {GARCH-EVT-Copula is proved to have some advantages in improving the accuracy of predicting returns. Investor sentiment described by four indicators (market-turnover ratio, advance-decline ratio, new-highs/lows ratio, and Arms index) attracts increasing attention from researchers. In view of these two factors, firstly, we construct the ARMA-GARCH-Sent (AGS) model with investor sentiment indicator by principal component analysis (PCA). Secondly, considering the advantages of extreme value theory (which can deal with extreme deviations in the value of the probability distribution), we present the ARMA-GARCH-Sent-EVT (AGSE) model to describe the daily logarithmic return series of stocks. In addition, the Copula model is used to construct the multivariate distribution of daily logarithmic stock return series to capture their asymmetric and nonlinear characteristics. Furthermore, we propose an ARMA-GARCH-Sent-EVT-Copula (AGSEC) portfolio model with Copula. In order to highlight the advantages of our model, we make a comparative analysis of three models: the original ARMA-GARCH-Copula (AGC) model, the ARMA-GARCH-Sent-Copula (AGSC) model and the AGSEC model. Finally, we use the data of SHSE (Shanghai Stock Exchange) and SZSE (Shenzhen Stock Exchange) for empirical analysis and compare the dynamic portfolio strategies of the three models. The results show that our model AGSEC with investor sentiment is superior to the other two models, namely, it has higher return rates under the same constraint conditions, which means investor sentiment can assist investors in better navigating market dynamics and plays an increasingly important role in shaping portfolio performance and risk management.},

Combination of Internet-of-Things-Aided Smart Transportation System is doing promising work in this area. A massive amount of video streaming data is produced at high speed by distributed mobile IoT devices and video cameras due to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) combinations in smart city scenarios. Real-time data processing application demands efficient analysis of these data. The key focus in this work is on improving cloud-based traffic video analytics systems by executing a two-step approach: first, Edge-based pre-processing of a video stream to reduce data transmission time and Cloud-based traffic Video Analytics. Second, Video Analytics and Sensor Fusion (VA/SF) are studied and examined to guarantee that the continuum of potentials are sufficiently covered by the data that algorithms are trained on and make it sufficiently efficient to provide high accuracy or low latency modes of services. We suggest a YOLO based deep learning video analytics system on the cloud to perform real-time object detection for traffic surveillance video. The proposed VA/SF model reduces detection speed of the model while improving the object detection accuracy by 1.8% when compared to no-IoT sensor fusion. The experiment proves that higher accuracy with better detection is achieved by our traffic analytical model under extreme weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {Traffic of different applications when they are encrypted or passed through virtual private networks (VPN) tunnels become similar. Finding discriminating features to distinguish such traffic is very challenging. We propose an approach called DeNeTLang, a general traffic classifier that addresses the above-mentioned cases by finding discriminating features based on the temporal relation of packets within flows and the temporal relation among flows that are initiated during the execution of applications. We utilize the automata learning technique to derive an automaton for each application that its language shows the order of packets communicated by the applications preserving the mentioned temporal relations. We increase the granularity of the automata alphabets from packets to multi-packets using machine learning techniques to consider the statistical features of packets to discriminate encrypted packet sequences. This leads to smaller models yet still precise for feature extraction and tolerable to noise and packet loss. To classify by a deep neural network, we extract features from the learned languages. The results of applying DeNeTLang on real traffic indicate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in application identification and traffic characterization tasks. Also, the proposed approach is resilient to temporal disruption noise stemming from the simultaneous execution of multiple applications in our experiments.},

  abstract     = {Modern vehicles rely on electronic control units (ECUs) communicating through the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. However, increased connectivity through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and onboard diagnostics (OBD) ports has heightened cybersecurity risks due to the CAN bus protocol’s inherent security vulnerabilities. Addressing this challenge requires an in-vehicle intrusion detection system (IDS) with high accuracy and minimal false alarms. Existing IDSs for in-vehicle networks often fall short due to inadequate extraction of network traffic features’ dependencies in a time-series context.To overcome this limitation, this study presents ACL-IDS, a hybrid intrusion detection system for in-vehicle network traffic. Leveraging deep learning techniques like CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanisms, ACL-IDS effectively captures short-term and long-term dependencies within network traffic, enhancing intrusion detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on a real benchmark dataset demonstrate ACL-IDS’s superior performance compared to individual, ensemble, and state-of-the-art methods. With detection accuracy reaching up to 99%, ACL-IDS emerges as a robust solution for analyzing and detecting intrusions in in-vehicle network traffic.},

This state dictates devising more powerful techniques that can efficiently resist the ever-growing power of cryptoanalysis tools. Although many effective encryption techniques are available, the principal problem with these techniques is their great reliance on the complexity of the computation as a means of information protection and never using the full potential of the input space (key and plaintext). This paper proposed a technique that combines powerful computations such as dual-pass bit mixing, chaotic bit manipulation, and dynamic computation patterns. The technique has a dynamic behavior that observes the variations of the current input block and a long memory to memorize the variations of the previous blocks and adjusts its computational pattern on the fly (during the processing). This input-driven and dynamic computation pattern switching highly complicate the relation of plaintext to ciphertext. Because the proposed technique can adjust its computational state based on the inputs, it can substantially increase the nonlinearity and confusion of the ciphertext since any variation imposes a different pattern of computations. Additionally, the paper proposes a novel method based on important principles inspired by the Color theory for expanding the key to any length and highly preserving the identity of the key.},

  abstract     = {Common fixed point problems (CFPs) arise in many practical engineering applications and are challenging problems since they can be non-convex, nonlinear and non-smooth. Solving nonlinear and non-smooth problems is difficult due to their intricate nature and the lack of well-established methods for addressing them. Furthermore, achieving convergence to a common fixed point can be challenging, especially when dealing with non-convex problems. The convergence rate and stability of the common fixed point can be affected by various factors, such as the choice of initialization, the optimization algorithm used, and the optimized function properties. To address the above difficulties, an efficient and robust hybrid algorithm method is proposed, merging the Jaya Algorithm (JAYA) with Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO). It is abbreviated as JAIWO. In the IWO, each weed, (i.e. a solution), reproduces new seeds (offspring) based on their own knowledge. In other words, there is no information-sharing among weeds in the reproduction process. It may cause premature convergence, trapping by local optima, and slow convergence. To get rid of the inherited drawbacks of IWO, it is hybridized with JAYA since it has good exploration and exploitation abilities in the search space. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed JAIWO, four CFPs are taken into account for experimentation and the experimental results are compared with eight well-known and state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparisons reveal that JAIWO outperforms the competitors for all considered CFPs.},

  abstract     = {In general, cloud security is capable of providing various information, applications, services, etc. using extensive policies and progressive technologies. On the other hand, loss of data, confidentiality breaches, and loss of control are the major challenges in cloud security and they need to be solved. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid dwarf-based Archimedes optimization (HDAO) algorithm for optimal key generation and to solve both data privacy and integrity issues. The HDAO is the integration of both the dwarf optimization algorithm and Archimedes optimization algorithm. The main goal of the optimization algorithm is to solve the problem and find the optimal solutions by maximizing the objective function which makes them suitable for privacy-preserving tasks. One of the main weaknesses of the AOA algorithm is getting stuck in the local optima due to the usage of gradient-based methods. This issue is overcome using the dwarf optimization algorithm via randomization and local search strategy to complement the gradient-based approach. By employing the HDAO algorithm, the data sanitization and restoration process is effectively executed using the cloud data. In addition to this, the key extraction plays a vital role in the process of data sanitization and restoration process in which the optimization is carried out by the proposed HDAO algorithm. This paper employed five different types of datasets namely the genome, protein, general text, English text, and rand128 to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Also, the comparative analysis is made for various parameters namely encryption time, decryption time, and avalanche effect, which is evaluated to determine the efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {In many countries, the accessibility of blood and blood products remains a challenge due to the complex supply chain, short product lifetime, fluctuating demand at the hospital level, and timely access. To address this challenge, some countries have implemented the use of drones to deliver blood products to remote healthcare facilities, resulting in improved availability and delivery times. To further improve the efficiency of blood supply logistics, this study proposes a drone-based logistics network for the transportation of blood groups from blood banks to hospitals. The proposed methodology employs a genetic algorithm, in combination with Greedy Search, to establish an optimal drone-based logistics network for blood supplies. The algorithm allocates blood requests to launching and refueling stations and determines the most efficient routes for the drones, with the objective of minimizing total logistics costs, including the construction costs of launching and refueling stations and the delivery costs between different locations. Moreover, the algorithm utilizes natural selection processes, such as selection, reproduction, and mutation, to converge toward a near-optimal solution. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the CPLEX solver in terms of computational time for solving the proposed integer linear programming problem. Furthermore, the proposed methodology provides a near-optimal solution with a small gap between the CPLEX optimal and algorithm solutions, demonstrating its efficacy and potential for improving the delivery of blood products in a cost-effective manner.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view subspace clustering has made important accomplishments in the domain of integrative analysis of multiple high-dimensional datasets. Emergence of high-throughput technologies facilitates the accumulation of multi-view data. Integrative analysis of multi-view data is insightful; however, complexity arises when data multiplicity results in poor agreement with the clustering structure. The paper aims to develop an efficient integrative clustering framework that captures the diversity of multi-view datasets and reveals the subgroups from the subspace representation. In the paper, a novel framework of meta-guided sparse-jNMF-method has been devised for the integrative clustering problem. The initialization of sparse-jNMF is guided by a novel meta-heuristic, Enhanced Honey Badger Algorithm (EHBA). EHBA overcomes the limitations of the traditional HBA to improve its global searching ability by incorporating two major strategies. EHBA strengthen initial points of sparse-jNMF, improving its convergence behaviour and eventually enhancing the clustering results. Further, a consensus matrix is constructed to reveal stable clusters. EHBA is compared with other-state-of-the-art meta-heuristics over 23 benchmark functions. It is observed that EHBA attain fast convergence and improved solution accuracy. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at 95% confidence level demonstrates that EHBA is more statistically significant than other counterparts. Further, the performance of the proposed EHBA-guided sparse-jNMF framework for integrative analysis is compared with other meta-guided frameworks over four real-life cancer datasets obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental results show that on average, the silhouette score and cluster purity of the proposed framework are 0.83 and 0.67, respectively, which is better than other frameworks.},

  abstract     = {The power structure significantly alters the dynamic interaction between supply chain members, which poses a great challenge to competing suppliers in selecting the optimal selling format. This paper investigates two suppliers’ strategic choice of selling format by considering two power structures, i.e., Supplier Stackelberg (SS) structure and E-tailer Stackelberg (RS) structure. We find that both suppliers adopt the reselling (agency) format if the commission rate is sufficiently large (small) under the RS structure. While the two suppliers are likely to adopt different formats (i.e., one adopts the reselling format and the other adopts the agency format) under the SS structure. The rationale hinges on the suppliers’ market power and its interactions with the double-marginalization effect. Additionally, we identify Pareto improvements such that the suppliers&#39; choices also benefit the e-tailer. Furthermore, the stronger supply chain power (i.e., possessing vertical price leadership) does not necessarily enable the supply chain member to charge a higher retail price, which depends on the selling format adopted by the two suppliers and their upstream competition intensity. Our results provide prescriptive suggestions to the suppliers for selecting the optimal selling format in competitive environments when they locate in various market positions.},

  abstract     = {There are now ever-increasing amounts of digital data stored daily. Processing such big data requires new sciences such as data mining. Data mining aims to find the information and knowledge hidden in these massive amounts of data. Data mining has various branches and applications, one of which is clustering. In clustering, data are classified into several clusters. The data of one cluster are similar to each other but different from those of other clusters. Processing time is considered a major challenge, given the use of big data in data mining applications. Metaheuristic algorithms can solve large-scale time-consuming problems in acceptable durations. The harmony search is one of such algorithms. This paper proposes a hybrid method for data clustering by integrating the harmony search algorithm (HSA) with k-medoids, which is a clustering algorithm. Based on k-medoids, the proposed method uses real data samples as cluster centroids to eliminate the effects of noise data. Furthermore, the HSA reduces the data clustering duration. In addition, trees social relations optimization algorithm (TSR) was used to increase the quality of the solutions in the proposed method. The proposed method was compared practically with the other techniques. According to the comparison results, the proposed method outperformed similar techniques in terms of the solution fitness and Dunn and Silhouette criteria. The temporal outputs of the proposed method were also acceptable. The best results obtained for the proposed method in the form of fitness of the final solution is equal to 1.02, execution time is equal to 2.9562 s, Dunn index is equal to 0.067 and Silhouette is equal to 1.},

FACTS devices offer a solution for improving power transmission and system damping. This study proposes a control scheme that combines a fuzzy controller with an optimal linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) controller to enhance power system stability under various disturbance conditions. Additionally, a Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is employed to adjust the fuzzy function limits, enabling the controller to adapt to system variations. Power system controllers, including a power system stabilizer (PSS) and a thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC), are used concurrently. The controller coefficients and weighting matrices are also optimally designed. The controller’s performance is evaluated under seven different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves a significant reduction in the performance index value compared to other methods like the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), seeker optimization algorithm (SOA), and shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA), with improvements of 27.54%, 9.05%, and 16.22%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the incorporation of sustainability has received growing attention in a supply chain network design for two reasons. First, government policies and environmental regulations have forced producers to design eco-friendly business frameworks. Second, companies have become more interested in recovery activities since they can demonstrate a green image of their operations to the community. In this study, a novel optimization model is developed for a sustainable dual-channel supply chain based on consumer buying behavior. In the proposed model, the price of new products is determined in the competition of direct and indirect sales channels. Then, the price of refurbished products is estimated based on the customer expectations. A bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is introduced to minimize the total cost and maximize the social aspects of the proposed supply chain network. The proposed model provides significant managerial insights. It suggests managers to offer suitable dynamic prices for their sales channels based on the different segmentations of their customers, which will ultimately lead to more profitability. In this model, unlike most literature models, the percentage of returned goods is calculated more accurately based on customer behaviors, and managers can predict the potential amount of returned goods more precisely for their strategic plans. Three meta-heuristic algorithms are developed since the proposed model has an NP-hard nature. The validation of proposed model and the efficiency of the developed algorithms are confirmed through the computational results.},

  abstract     = {In a competitive market, technological advancements opens many opportunities for retailing businesses to increase their profitability through innovative strategies, including discount offers, pre-order programs, and online payment services. However, this surge in competition has led to challenges in optimizing inventory decisions. This study addresses these multifaceted challenges by focusing on key decision variables such as selling price, replenishment schedules, and costs associated with advance sales strategies. The present study bifurcates the inventory replenishment cycle into two distinct sales phases: the two-phase for the advance sales period and the one-phase for the spot sale period. This segmentation enables a more refined examination of sale strategies and customer behaviours, encompassing the flexibility for customers to cancel orders and return products during the return period. We also have incorporated innovative strategies like discount offers, pre-order programs, and online payment services to enhance sales. One of the core contributions of this research lies in modelling demand in a fuzzy-stochastic environment, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in customer demand influenced by factors such as selling price and advertisement costs. Through theoretical analysis, the proposed study formulates theorems that aid in developing objective functions in a fuzzy stochastic environment. The corresponding profit maximization problem is derived in this environment and employs the weighted sum method to defuzzify the maximization problem. Beyond profit maximization, this research delves into environmental considerations, assessing the impact of carbon emissions and associated taxes on inventory decisions. Subsequently, we solve it by applying three distinct optimization methods: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-CO), and the Analytical Method (AM). Then, the proposed model is justified and validated through numerical examples involving different distributions. To assess the efficiency of the suggested meta-heuristic algorithms, various test instances were used to solve the proposed model and comparisons and sensitivity analyses were carried out with various criteria. Finally, the result of the particle swarm optimisation (PSO-CO) algorithm emphasises that it is more robust than other proposed algorithms to solve the problem in a reasonable time.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth in the smart era of Internet of Things (IoT) relies on the various applications that lead to the design wide range of routing protocols utilizing Machine learning techniques. Third party interference in the open network to perform malicious activities by using location information of the node is high. Many researchers have designed a wide range of protocols to improve security and energy efficiency but the dynamic nature of the Internet of Things suppressed the performance of those algorithms. This may lead to data drop, node death, delay, less network lifetime, and increased third party malicious activities. In this paper, a novel routing mechanism is developed to preserve source location privacy and prevent adversaries from doing backtracking attacks and traffic analysis for energy preservation. The proposed model consists of two key functions Node/Network Condition based Dynamic Phantom Node selection (NCDPNS) and Ant colony optimization Algorithm Aided Multi-Path based Routing (ACOMPR). Here, NCDPNS selects the phantom node based on the node/network conditions like node availability, link availability, node energy level, distance from other nodes in the network, and number of neighboring hops to preserve the location privacy. ACOMPR selects the path based on the ant colony optimization algorithm to choose more than one path for data transmission with very less common resources shared among multiple paths between the source and destination for energy efficient data transmission. The proposed mechanism is achieving the source location privacy at the first stage and energy efficient routing at the second stage. The proposed mechanism is implemented using a Network Simulator-2 (NS2) simulator with predefined network parameters. The results depict that it achieves high throughput, less delay, increased network lifetime, and low energy dissipation for data transmission by preserving the location of the node. The dynamic nature of the IoT is considered in the proposed work to make it more suitable for real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {In this study, grey wolf optimizer (GWO), genetic algorithm (GA), and K-Opt operation are combined to develop a metaheuristic named GWO-GA for the traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The alteration of the positions of two nodes of a potential solution (sequence of nodes or route) of a TSP is defined as a swap operation and a sequence of such swap operations is defined as a swap sequence. Using swap operations and swap sequence, the perturbation rules of the basic GWO are modified for the perturbation of any potential route (solution) of a TSP. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In the first phase, the operations of GWO are applied to a randomly generated set of potential solutions of the target problem for a predefined number of iterations. At the end of each iteration, the 3-Opt operation is applied to the solutions for which better movement is not found using GWO operations. In the second phase of the algorithm, the GA is applied for another number of iterations on the output set of the GWO phase. In the GA phase, the Roulette wheel selection process and multi-point cyclic crossover operation are used in a different approach. K-Opt operation for $$K=3$$ is used in place of mutation operation. K-Opt operation is again applied to the best-found solution after the end of the second phase for a fixed number of iterations for a possible improvement. The efficiency of the algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark test instances of different sizes from the TSPLIB. The performance of the proposed GWO-GA is compared with a set of state-of-the-art algorithms on TSPs using statistical tests and its superiority is established using comparison tables of the results as well as statistical tests. Obtained optimal routes are also presented to support the concluding remarks. It is observed that the algorithm shows a 100% success rate for problem size up to 144 and optimum route up to problem size 264.},

From that, managers can quickly and easily evaluate and select the best alternative. A previous study using DEMATEL and grey relational analysis (GRA) is presented as an example. Data from this previous study are used to present the implementation process and results of the proposed method and simultaneously show the results of the current problem solved by the fuzzy DEMATEL—TOPPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) method. The comparison of results between three methods including DEMATEL—GRA, fuzzy DEMATEL—TOPPSIS, and fuzzy DEMATEL—DBA is performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that there is a slight difference in weights between fuzzy DEMATEL and DEMATEL but the error is extremely low. In addition, the correlation of results between methods is very high. Particularly, correlation coefficients between fuzzy DEMATEL and DEMATEL, between fuzzy DEMATEL—TOPPSIS and fuzzy DEMATEL—BDA, and between DEMATEL—GRA and fuzzy DEMATEL—BDA are 0.99, 0.95, and 0.78 respectively.

  abstract     = {This paper concerns with the problem of robust event-triggered data-driven control (DDC) considering control input and rate control constraints, simultaneously for discrete-time multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear systems such that only the noisy data are measurable. Firstly, the data-dependent representation of the closed-loop system controlled by an event-triggered-based feedback control law is obtained. More precisely, to reduce the unnecessary communication resources, the control input updates and consequently, improve the system performance, event-triggered mechanism is utilized to design a stabilizing controller. Under a decreasing triggering threshold and a quadratic Lyapunov function, the ultimate boundedness stability (UBS) of the closed-loop system is ensured and the bounded region is expressed. Sufficient conditions for the UBS of the system are derived in terms of data-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LIMs). To meet the practical problems such as inherent limitations of the practical systems and to maximize the life-time of the actuators, the control input and rate control constraints are considered, simultaneously in the design procedure. In this scenario, the sufficient conditions are also obtained based on data-dependent LMIs. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, the recommended robust constrained event-triggered DDC is implemented to a numerical example and the simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed control approach. Moreover, a table is presented to compare the practical metrics such as robustness, necessities of the model plant identification, computational burden and control input constraints to verify the superiorities of the proposed method despite the existing results.},

Then by using the notion of $$\ell $$ -groups, we defined two binary operations on it and showed that they made an equality algebra and investigated that under what condition the converse holds. In addition, ordinal sum of two equality algebras are introduced and by using the notion of simple and subdirectly irreducible equality algebras we proved that a special kind of equality algebra can be ordinal sum of two special subalgebras of it.},

  abstract     = {The concept of undeniable signature scheme was proposed by Chaum and Antwerpen in 1989. In this scheme, the signature can only be verified by the verifier with the co-operation of the signer. In this paper, we propose a novel undeniable signature scheme based on the structure of group ring. We consider the well studied hard problems, that is, inverse computation problem (ICP) and discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in group ring and show that under the chosen message attack, our scheme is strongly unforgeable, invisible and secure against impersonation attack. These security notions, that is, strongly unforgeability, invisibility and impersonation are defined through three different games. In order to practically realize the scheme, we discuss a case study in which we generate the signature for a message and then verify it through the verification algorithm. Finally, we compare our scheme with several other renowned schemes available in the literature and show it is efficient in terms of the total execution time.},

  abstract     = {We will investigate the creeping flow of a Carreau incompressible fluid through a slit with uniformly porous walls. Non-dimensionalization is used to represent the controlling two-dimensional flow equations and non-homogeneous boundary conditions. The resulting equations are solved using a recursive method. Equations are developed for the stream function, velocity components, volumetric flow rate, pressure distribution, shear and normal stresses on the slit wall as well as in general, fractional absorption, and leakage flux are also considered. Moreover, maximum velocity component points are noted. It is evident from the graphs that when porosity parameter (S) grows, the axial velocity decreases and backward flow is visible in the channel’s center. This is because the higher wall permeability allows more fluid to pass through the slit walls. Axial velocity rises toward the slit walls and decreases at the center as $$\Gamma $$ grows due to the larger non-Newtonian parameter. This subject provides a mathematical basis for understanding the physical phenomena of fluid flows through slit walls, which arise in many problems, including gaseous diffusion, filtration, and biological systems.},

In this study, we leverage social network information to improve the accuracy and efficiency of recommendation systems. We propose two algorithms: Social Network Regularized Kernel Norm Minimization (SNRKNM) based on low- rank matrix factorization techniques and Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Low-Rank Matrix Factorization (FRLRMF), which can utilize social network information more effectively and efficiently. We evaluate and compare these algorithms with two traditional methods: a matrix factorization-based algorithm (the Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm Based on Collaborative Filtering (SGD)) and a social net- work algorithm (Social Network Based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm (SNCR)), tested on synthetic datasets and the real-world MovieLens dataset. On the MovieLens dataset, our algorithms achieve a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.74, significantly outperforming the base- line SGD recommendation algorithm’s 1.11, statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Compared to the baseline, our algorithms reduce RMSE by 36.28% and exhibit high scalability and robustness across different dataset sizes and rank parameters. SNRKNM utilizes kernel norm smoothing on the latent factors of users and items, capturing their social similarities and diversities. FRLRMF embeds the fuzzy memberships of users and items into the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, handling uncertainty and noise in social network data. In contrast, the SNCR algorithm relies on collaborative filtering within the social network but has limitations in handling large-scale datasets and sparsity.},

  abstract     = {Handwriting typically consists of a wide range of writing forms with substantial differences in the placements and size of those writing shapes. The arrangement, organization, and spatial association of individual letters, words, and phrases on a written page are all examples of handwritten text structure. This study proposed a novel approach in which a handwritten text structure is primarily transformed into a Cartesian XY-coordinate system while maintaining its shape characteristics. The points on the contour of handwritten text with local maximum bending values are considered hypothetical breakdown points called Key Points (KPs). From the skeletal representation of handwriting, this approach first identifies KPs and their coordinate positions. After that, KPs are transformed into a graph-based representation with vertices and edges. With the use of geometric graphs, this representation attempts to capture the spatial and temporal organization of handwriting. Previous techniques focused on statistical methods, which offer fixed-size descriptions; however, graph-based representations are flexible in size and reveal the relationship between text structure. Graph representations enable the incorporation of contextual information by integrating extra features which improve text accuracy and understanding. The proposed approach is tested for writer identification and verification tasks on four benchmark datasets (CERUG-EN, CVL, Firemaker, and IAM) and one custom-built dataset. The findings demonstrated that the proposed approach obtained state-of-the-art accuracies across all the mentioned datasets. Particularly, it achieved the highest accuracy of 99.75% for identification and 99.81% for verification on the Firemaker dataset.},

  abstract     = {Conventional power conversion systems often face challenges with harmonic distortion and electromagnetic interference (EMI), particularly when handling high power. Multi-level inverters offer a compelling solution, boasting improved harmonic performance and reduced EMI emissions. This work presents a groundbreaking approach for cascaded multilevel inverters, employing a novel intelligent algorithm for real-time optimization of switching angles. This approach leverages the combined strengths of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to dynamically determine the optimal switching angles, leading to significant reductions in Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). By implementing this real-time optimization strategy, our research achieves a THD reduction of 26.34% (from 18.42 to 13.66%) in a seven-level inverter operating online. This substantial improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent algorithm. Furthermore, the model&#39;s adaptability is showcased by adjusting DC voltage and resistance parameters, bringing THD down to an even lower value of 13.54%. These quantitative results solidify the model&#39;s capability to achieve superior harmonic suppression in real-world applications. The general applicability of this approach extends beyond the presented case study. This intelligent algorithm holds promise for various industrial applications that require high-performance multilevel inverters. By ensuring exceptional power quality through real-time optimization of switching angles, the proposed model paves the way for advancements in diverse industrial sectors.},

However, in the case of bean crops, the absence of a publicly available dataset has posed a significant challenge for applying deep learning algorithms to accurately predict diseases. Additionally, the manual annotation of images demands substantial time and resources. This paper introduces an innovative approach to tackle these issues. We introduce a solution for real-time disease detection on bean leaves, despite the lack of bean-specific image data. Initially, we generate a small dataset from real images and annotate them. Then, we utilize images from the existing dataset PlantDoc (Singh et al. in: Proceedings of the 7th ACM IKDD CoDS and 25th COMAD, Association for Computing Machinery, pp 249–253, 2020) from leaves of other plant species. Moreover, to compensate for the limitations of a small image dataset, we employ advanced data augmentation techniques, enriching the training data and enhancing the model’s ability to generalize. Our experimental study shows that data augmentation techniques can improve the accuracy of deep learning methods by up to 37%.},

Our approach introduces a fuzzy grey relational similarity metric that capitalizes on the benefits of both fuzzy logic membership functions and grey relational analysis for similarity assessment. We perform a rigorous evaluation comparing our model with eight established machine learning algorithms across 28 publicly available software datasets. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance, particularly in scenarios characterized by high sparsity levels in the DD variable. We further analyze the model&#39;s efficacy across varying data sparsity levels, categorizing datasets into four groups based on sparsity ratios. Our findings reveal the model&#39;s dominance over alternative prediction methods in datasets exhibiting high and very high sparsity. Notably, traditional techniques like multi-linear regression and multi-layer perceptron exhibit limitations in handling such challenges within this specific problem domain and data landscape. Conversely, ensemble learning techniques emerge as viable alternatives for datasets with lower sparsity levels.},

  abstract     = {Digital image security has become a major concern due to open networks and Internet data sharing. Many image encryption algorithms have been introduced recently for securely sharing data, but they have some drawbacks and efficiency issues. Cryptography uses chaotic systems because of their high randomization properties and accuracy. To overcome the constraints inherent in conventional encryption algorithms, a novel and secure image encryption algorithm based on fractional-order (FO) 4D hyperchaotic system (4D-HCS) and Arnold Cat map (ACM) is proposed in this paper to ensure secure transmission of color images. The proposed algorithm is mainly based on pixel rotation, permutation, bit-wise XOR operations, and substitution. ACM is used for pixel rotation in the color image, eliminating the high correlations between neighboring pixels without obscuring the information. Adding permutations after separating the red ( $$R_{c}$$ ), green ( $$G_{c}$$ ), and blue ( $$B_{c}$$ ) color channels can enhance the confusion. The color image pixel values are diffused by using substitution through hyperchaotic sequences of FO 4D-HCS. The algorithm offers an impressive key space of approximately $$2^{548}$$ for high cryptographic strength and showcases fast encryption. The proposed algorithm for color image encryption is examined in light of various cryptographic characteristics. These tests yield promising results, assuring that the proposed algorithm for color image encryption is secure and resistant to different standard attacks.},

In this direction, first of all, the concepts of object interaction and inverse object interaction sets for two different universe sets are defined. In addition, considering binary soft sets in which two different universe sets are taken into account, the concepts of object interaction and inverse object interaction sets have been developed for a binary soft set. In this way, it was possible to determine the interaction values between objects with the help of a parameter set. Moreover, two decision-making algorithms are proposed using the concepts of object interaction and inverse object interaction sets based on a binary soft set.

  abstract     = {The Prairie Dog optimization algorithm (PDOA) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm that takes its inspiration from foraging behavior, burrow building activities and communication alarm of Prairie Dog. PDOA has gained extensive popularity among the research community and is now utilized to tackle a variety of optimization challenges. However, the algorithm does not have a healthy equilibrium condition between its exploration and exploitation process. To overcome this problem a novel hybrid algorithm namely Nelder–Mead based Prairie Dog optimization algorithm (NMPDOA) is proposed with the help of Nelder–Mead algorithm (NMA). In this paper, NMPDOA is used for solving the multi-objective optimal power flow (MO-OPF) problems. In order to prove the applicability of the suggested technique, it has been applied to 20 different benchmark functions. The suggested technique is tested in the IEEE 30 and IEEE118 bus standard test system and applied in Indian 62 bus system. To determine the effectiveness of the algorithm, the results of PDOA and NMPDOA are compared with other previously published results discussed in the literature. In addition, PDOA and NMPDOA are also applied in two MO-OPF problems. The statistical analysis and t-test analysis confirm the effectiveness and consistency of NMPDOA for solving real world highly nonlinear and mixed integer optimization problems.},

The proposed methodology utilizes EVs for reducing high levels of electricity consumption during peak periods and modifying demand curves, and responsive loads for supplying reserves required to offset the inherent uncertainties of PV and wind generation. In addition, a two-step approach is provided for estimating the anticipated operating cost of the microgrid, which includes both energy and reserve. Minimizing generating and reserve power costs is the first step. The second step is to minimize costs connected with unit scheduling modifications caused by variations in wind and PV production. As a powerful and efficient optimization strategy, improved sunflower optimization (ISFO) algorithm is subsequently employed to solve the corresponding objective optimization problem. Results obtained for an MG on an hourly basis throughout the day show that the ISFO algorithm outperforms other conventional methods. It should be noted that three scenarios have been established to examine how the MG&#39;s day-ahead performance is affected by the combined scheduling of EVs and controlled loads. Scenarios 3 remarkably lower than the values presented in Scenarios 1 and 2, the three cost terms the generating cost, the reserve cost, and the starting cost of units are determined as $742.87, $10.16, and $6.01, correspondingly, in this scenario.},

It is characterized by the improper development of spikelet’s, which lowers grain output and quality. For optimal management and the avoidance of yield losses, this disease must be discovered early. In this study, a deep learning-based approach utilizing optimization techniques was proposed for accurate segmentation and disease detection in rice crops. The research aimed to address the vulnerability of rice crops to disease attacks from seed germination to mature spikelets. The proposed model consisted of three major phases: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and disease detection. Gaussian filtering was employed to preprocess the raw rice crop images, while a new hybrid Whale Customized Gravitational Optimization Algorithm was utilized for segmentation. Disease detection was performed using a hybrid deep learning model called HybridNet, which combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an optimized recurrent neural network (RNN) model. The dataset intended for this proposed project is sourced from the CABI PlantwisePlus Knowledge Bank. The proposed model for rice spikelet disease detection achieved high accuracy with Sensitivity (0.9269), Specificity (0.9756), and Accuracy (0.9634). This indicates that the model effectively identifies and detects diseases in rice spikelets, demonstrating its reliable performance in disease management and crop protection.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents optimized solutions for the Integrated Joint Zone Picking-Order Batching and Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (ZPOBVRPTW). The ZPOBVRPTW combines three distinct optimization problems: the Order Batching Problem (OBP), the Zone Picking Problem (ZPP), and Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The NP-hard nature of these problems and the need for enhanced customer service levels within and outside Warehouses (WAs) have created a lack of optimization methods that effectively integrate the ZPP, OBP, and VRPTW. This paper addresses practical challenges that have not been extensively explored in previous research on the ZPOBVRPTW. The main objective is to minimize delay costs and travel distance, optimizing customer reach and improving the overall efficiency of WAs. Therefore, small and medium instances are solved by developing a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). For large instances, two metaheuristics were proposed which are a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Weighted Superposition Attraction (WSA) algorithm. The proposed solution methods for the ZPOBVRPTW were evaluated using experiments in four zoning scenarios of a single-block WA. The computational results showed that the algorithms successfully solved the ZPOBVRPTW. The optimal solutions were obtained in a relatively short time by GA, WAS, and CPLEX Solver. Nonetheless, for medium and large-scale datasets (instances), GA (27% faster) outperforms WSA. This research fills gaps in the literature and by advancing the management practices of WAs provides a solution that integrates the different problems that comprise the ZPOBVRPTW.},

  abstract     = {Researchers face a formidable task in devising effective control strategies for highly nonlinear systems. Addressing these challenges, we adopt the MIT rule in our study and employ the Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) approach to optimize solutions for nonlinear processes. The adaptive controller design, based on MRAC, aims to stabilize a process in the face of large parameter variations and external disturbances affecting the closed-loop system. We apply this technique to analyze a set of closed-loop systems, including Non-Reheat Turbine, Brushless DC Motor (BLDC) and Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) related to process industries. The controller parameter tuning technique, based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), is applied to achieve optimal controller performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we compare the results with the conventional Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) and hybridized control techniques. The simulation is performed in the time domain. The time response of Non-Reheat Turbine, BLDC, and CSTR from the ABC-MRAC-MIT controller has a rise time (0.3967 s, 0.4415 s, 0.0850 s), settling time (1.8160 s,2.772 s, 0.4452 s), maximum overshoot (6.30% 3.40% and 6.9279%) respectively. Simulation results reveal the superior time-response characteristics of the proposed ABC-MRAC-MIT technique compared to other existing methods, enhancing the performance of process models and validating the novelty of this work.},

Second, a multi-strategy synergy mechanism was designed to randomly divide individuals into two categories: leader eagles and non-leader eagles using the clan topology. The grouping was based on the ordering of fitness values. In addition, a search strategy was constructed for each category to ensure a balance between exploration and exploitation capabilities. Finally, to validate the performance of SHHO, ordinary functions and CEC test set and benchmark functions of CEC test set were selected for simulation and SHHO was compared with other optimization algorithms using ANOVA, Wilcoxon and Friedman tests. Meanwhile, three classical engineering problems are selected to verify the effectiveness of SHHO in real engineering. The results show that SHHO has significant improvement in convergence accuracy and speed, and has high practical value and advantages in engineering optimization applications.},

In an attempt to increase and diversify search moves and preventing the premature convergence of such algorithms, this paper proposes a meta-heuristic technique by employing several evolutionary processes for different groups. In this strategy, different groups can be evolved using a randomly selected evolutionary process. In accordance with this purpose and to provide an ability of jumping out of local optima, which can be useful for finding global optima in complex optimization problems, four different evolutionary strategies inspired from shuffled frog leaping (SFL), shuffled complex evolution (SCE), shuffled differential evolution (SCE) and opposition-based learning (OBL) are incorporated into a new structure called the shuffled multi-evolutionary algorithm (SMEA). The SMEA is extended with linear population size reduction (LPSR) known as L-SMEA, which continually decreases the population size and number of groups according to a linear function. The SMEA is evaluated on CEC2014 and CEC2017 benchmark functions. The obtained results are compared with SFL, SCE and SDE and other state-of-the-art algorithms proposed in the literatures. Performing the statistical analysis of the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed L-SMEA is superior to other three algorithms including SFL, SCE and SDE and some other state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, the performed experiments indicate the contribution of employing multiple evolutionary strategies beside of linear population size reduction leads to achieving a more effective and robust algorithm than those used single evolutionary strategy.},

However, the individual behavior of decision-makers will directly affect the result of decision-making, and then affect the achievement of enterprise strategy. Considering the limited rationality of decision-makers and the synergy between projects, this paper constructs a project portfolio selection model based on multiple mental accounts of strategic objectives. Firstly, multiple mental accounts are constructed for different strategic objectives and utility functions are constructed to describe the achievement of each mental account. Then, the learning-forgetting curve and the approach degree theory are used to study the synergistic relationship between the projects, and the contrast model is set to analyze the influence of the synergistic effect. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the selected project portfolio can meet the different mental account needs of decision-makers to achieve the strategic objectives of enterprises; Through the cooperative relationship between projects, the utility value of each mental account is greatly improved. The method proposed in this paper is helpful for decision-makers to delimit different psychological accounts according to actual needs to make portfolio decisions when facing multiple strategic objectives.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is one of the basic preprocessing steps in data mining and is a challenging binary optimization problem. FS is the process of determining the subset that can best represent the dataset by removing features that have little impact from a given dataset without affecting performance and accuracy. In this paper, Binary Dynamic Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (binDGWO) is proposed for the solution of binary optimization problems. To binaryize the Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GWO), the original position update equation was binaryized using the logical XOR operator to achieve a balance between local search and global search. In addition, a simple and effective innovation has been introduced to the position update equation with the dynamic coefficient method. This method has been developed to make the affected solution better by determining and applying the effects of the wolves in the lead team on the position according to the solution quality. The performance of binDGWO over FS is compared to the performance of over 20 different algorithms, including binary variants of GWO and different binary metaheuristics. 41 datasets with different numbers of samples and features were used in the experiments. Various performance metrics were used to determine the superiority of the methods over each other. In addition, the Friedman test was performed to statistically evaluate the results of the methods. According to the performance metrics and the Friedman test results, it was seen that the proposed algorithm has better results than other binary variants of GWO, and when the comparison results with other metaheuristic algorithms are examined, it is generally more successful and effective. In conclusion, it can be said that binDGWO is a simple, effective, and efficient binary method and it achieves its purpose.},

  abstract     = {Automation has become a major part of assembly lines because of the rapid technological advancement by industry 4.0. Two major assembly line branches are mixed-model assembly line sequencing and robotic assembly line balancing, which deal with the continuous production of various versions of a product and the use of robots to increase assembly line production rates and efficiency. This study examines the sequencing and balancing of an integrated mixed-model robotic U-shaped assembly line in order to improve assembly line productivity. Regarding the limited energy resources and increased price of energy, minimization of robots’ energy consumption is considered as an objective function. Besides that, makespan and tardiness minimization are considered as two other objective functions. The problem is solved by a parallel multi-objective dragonfly algorithm and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, which utilizes the strengths and covers the weaknesses of the two algorithms. Computational results indicated the superiority of the proposed algorithm against multi-objective dragonfly algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and multi-objective particle swarm optimization. An experimental comparison between the parallel U-shaped layout and non-U-shaped parallel and U-shaped non-parallel layouts shows that the proposed layout increases the efficiency of assembly line and reduces robots idle time and energy consumption.},

In line with this purpose, the ant colony optimization algorithm is employed to explore the search space composed of several assembly line balancing heuristics. Namely, this paper proposes an effective ant colony optimization based hyper-heuristic to tackle the assembly line balancing problems with sequence-dependent setup times.

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a brain abnormality neurological disorder and is life-threatening, affecting the behavior and lifestyle of many people worldwide. Neurologists commonly use an electroencephalogram (EEG) to manually interpret the brain&#39;s electrical activity. Some patients respond differently to drugs as the effective doses will be ineffective in some patients or cause adverse drug reactions in others and genetic factors seem to be involved in variable responses in some cases. On the other hand, performing genetic tests to detect the genotype of patients is usually invasive, expensive, and time-consuming. Estimating the patient&#39;s genotype using data such as information obtained from EEG, can be considered a significant achievement. Genes involved in the functioning of the endocannabinoid system are known to be a critical element in the physiological function the brain and nerves perform, and the defects in the activity of this system have been confirmed in the pathobiology of diseases such as epilepsy. Levels of endocannabinoids can be influenced by gene polymorphisms such as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) gene single nucleotide polymorphism. Because the FAAH controls the endocannabinoids levels by hydrolyzing and terminating the activity of the anandamide within the central nervous system (CNS) and also the origin of seizures which is the electrical storm of brain neurons, it is thought that there can be a relation between the FAAH enzyme and the brain oscillations. Identifying genotypes that are related to EEG variation in epilepsy is crucial for clinical epilepsy monitoring and controlling brain oscillations. In this paper, we show the FAAH rs2295633 polymorphism can be detected (classified) using EEG signals (as a common diagnostic tool) following the convolutional neural network (CNN) classification method. The multichannel time series data of EEG collected through a sliding window technique was given as input into a deep CNN model to find a probable relationship between EEG and FAAH CC, CT, and TT genotype classes. The proposed method reached a precision of 94.15% (± 0.38%), accuracy of 94.09% (± 0.41%), sensitivity of 94.14% (± 0.38%), specificity 97.04% (± 0.20%), and F1 score 94.11% (± 0.40%) in detecting the rs2295633 polymorphism based on EEG patterns in epilepsy. Therefore, we can conclude that the FAAH rs2295633 polymorphism may modulate brain activity and EEG patterns. However, more extensive multifactorial studies are necessary to show the precise association between the rs2295633 polymorphism, and epileptic EEG.},

In Sri Lanka, Italy, and the United States, the well-known ARIMAX model tends to be a good match for death predictions. The findings showed that the inclusion of the meteorological variables improves the accuracy of modeling both COVID-19 cases and deaths, for all the chosen countries’ cumulative confirmed cases except Italy and Sri Lanka. However, in the case of modeling deaths, it is observed that the inclusion of meteorological variables was not able to enhance the forecasting accuracy of the model in each of the selected countries.

Using time series data, the study attempts to assess how well the ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model predicts the stock prices of Maersk, a significant participant in the global shipping industry. The research methodology is based on the Box-Jenkins approach, which includes model identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking to ensure reliable predictions. To ensure reliable time series forecasting, the analysis begins with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, which checks for stationarity. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which measures model complexity and predictive accuracy equally, serves as a guide for selecting models. The ARIMA model’s performance is assessed by comparing predicted stock prices with actual observed values. The findings show the ARIMA model’s usefulness in financial time series analysis by showing that it can accurately predict Maersk’s stock prices. The model’s suitability for stock price forecasting is confirmed by a variety of statistical metrics that validate its predictive ability. The usefulness of ARIMA models in financial forecasting is highlighted by this study, which provides insightful information to help analysts and investors make wise decisions.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important services provided by cloud service providers (CSPs), cloud storage is economically attractive and can provide on-demand data storage service to resource-constrained tenants in the manner of pay-per-use. Therefore, by embracing cloud storage service, tenants can store their large-scale data on the remote cloud host to tremendously reduce local storage burden and computational overhead. However, due to the separation of cloud data ownership and management, cloud storage inevitably suffers from a few new security challenges, such as fine-grained cloud data deletion. To achieve data deletion in cloud storage, we design a vector-commitment-based publicly verifiable data deletion scheme, which can achieve data integrity auditing and block-based fine-grained data deletion. Specifically, our proposed scheme disguises the data deletion operation as data update operation. Therefore, the tenants can achieve data deletion by updating the cloud data blocks with some unrelated data blocks. Meanwhile, the tenants can prevent cloud data from being polluted by periodically performing data integrity auditing operation, thus guaranteeing that the cloud host sincerely maintains the data. Moreover, we formally analyze the security, which shows that our proposed scheme can satisfy all of the anticipative security requirements without interaction with a centralized third party. Finally, we develop a prototype system and evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme, which can intuitively demonstrate the high-efficiency and practicality of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {Ectopic pregnancy is a complex condition that happens when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus. It is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy can be challenging, and there is a need for accurate and efficient prediction systems to aid in its detection and management. Ultrasound imaging is commonly used to diagnose ectopic pregnancy, but the current diagnostic methods using ultrasound images suffer from several drawbacks, including low accuracy and reliability, making it difficult for medical experts to initiate appropriate treatments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a clinical decision support system that integrates deep learning techniques to aid medical experts in making informed decisions for initial treatment. The proposed system leverages an improved spiking neural network with a seagull optimization algorithm (ISNN-SOA) for predicting ectopic pregnancy. To enhance the accuracy of the proposed approach, the system incorporates pre-processing techniques using a median filter and segmentation using an improved Canny algorithm. Our proposed method outperforms previous techniques with DC of 93.4%, JI of 89.6%, Sen of 94.5%, and PPV of 88.25%. Also, our proposed method achieves an impressive classification performance with a precision of 98.4%, accuracy of 98.5%, recall of 98.3%, F-measure of 98.1%, and a loss of 1.5. These results demonstrate the potential of our system to aid medical experts in making suitable initial treatments and improve the overall management of ectopic pregnancy.},

We examine the relationship between implicative N-deductive systems and N-deductive systems and identify some characterization of implicative N-deductive systems. Additionally, we establish a connection between semi-Nelson algebras and Boolean algebras by using the above concept. Furthermore, we prove that the quotient semi-Nelson algebra induced by an implicative N-deductive system becomes a Boolean algebra under certain conditions. We define the annihilator of a subset of a pre-semi-Nelson algebra and investigate related properties. We demonstrate that the annihilator of an N-deductive system is its pseudo complement, and the set of all involutive N-deductive systems forms a Boolean algebra.},

  abstract     = {Stream mining, especially with concept drift, presents significant challenges across various domains. As data streams evolve over time, initial models become less effective. We present a novel approach using fuzzy ARTMAP’s adaptability and neural networks’ robustness to address concept drift. Our method dynamically updates models based on changing data distributions, enabling real-time adap- tation. By integrating fuzzy ARTMAP with backpropagation, it facilitates agile learning and accurate predictions in evolving scenarios. Through rigorous exper- iments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in managing concept drift and achieving substantial performance improvements. The achieved accu- racy of 85.07% and F1 score of 72.47 demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in real-time classification tasks. This research extends beyond just performance metrics. By leveraging the interpretability of fuzzy ARTMAP, we gain valuable insights into the mechanisms that enable our model to adapt to concept drift.

Comprehensive evaluations unfold across diverse datasets to discern the effectiveness of the proposed models. Key contributions of this work encompass the utilization of pre-trained CNN models for feature extraction, extensive evaluation across multiple datasets, the introduction of a weighted average ensemble model, emphasis on robust data pre-processing, systematic hyperparameter tuning, and the utilization of comprehensive evaluation metrics. The results, meticulously analyzed, unveil the superior performance of the proposed method, consistently outshining alternative models across pivotal metrics, including Recall, Precision, F1 Score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Accuracy.

We evaluate the possibility of classifying meat quality based on a limited number of easily detectable quantitative and qualitative characteristics collected before slaughtering the cattle and applying machine learning methodologies on them. Namely, we develop some models which are able to determine 4 qualitative classes (output) of meat ranging from poor to excellent, plus two intermediate ones. To experiment with methodologies we trained them on data collected through a small entrepreneurial reality located in Amorosi, southern Italy, which deals with cattle breeding in stables. Using a simple artificial neural network the classification error percentage stands at 4.32% while the correlation between the predictions and the real outcomes is greater than 0.95. The extension to a further set of machine learning methodologies on a widely used, open-source machine learning platform make it possible to improve the results, allowing to achieve the perfect classification of the meat. Namely Random Forest reaches 0% error percentage. Overall, the study evidences the potential of Machine Learning methods for predicting beef quality before slaughtering the cattle, and provides a framework for incorporating a wide range of factors into such models. This implies the potential to improve the average quality of the product, being able to intervene on breeding procedures, benefiting both producers and consumers.},

  abstract     = {Temporal action localization plays a significant role in video understanding, which aims to recognize action category as well as temporal interval in untrimmed videos. Most of previous transformer-based methods employ a feature space of single-temporal granularity. However, low-level temporal features can not provide enough semantic information for action recognition while high-level temporal features lack rich details for boundary localization. To address the above issue, we propose a multi-granularity transformer fusion framework (MGTF) to localize temporal actions in videos. Specifically, the MGTF builds a multi-granularity feature fusion pipeline based on transformer, and uses a direct set prediction strategy to generate action instances. Through top-down cross-granularity attention interaction, the low-level features of boundary details and high-level semantic information can be combined to improve the feature discrimination. To reduce computation cost, we design temporal shift attention to adaptively focus on a sparse set of key segments. In addition, actionness regression head is utilized to refine the confidence score of different candidate instances. As a self-contained system, MGTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS’14 and comparable performance on ActivityNet-1.3. Ablation studies and qualitative visualization also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of medical images is a critical step in assisting doctors in making accurate diagnoses and planning appropriate treatments. Deep learning architectures often serve as the basis for computer models used for this task. However, a common challenge faced by segmentation models is class imbalance, which leads to a bias towards classes with a larger number of pixels, resulting in reduced accuracy for the minority-class regions. To address this problem, the $$\alpha $$ -balanced variant of the focal loss function introduces a $$\alpha $$ modulation factor that reduces the weight assigned to majority classes and gives greater weight to minority classes. This study proposes the use of a fuzzy inference system to automatically adjust the $$\alpha $$ factor, rather than maintaining a fixed value as commonly implemented. The adaptive fuzzy focal loss (AFFL) achieves an appropriate adjustment in $$\alpha $$ by employing fifteen fuzzy rules. To evaluate the effectiveness of AFFL, we implement an encoder-decoder segmentation model based on the UNet and Transformer architectures (AFFL-TransUNet) using the CHAOS dataset. We compare the performance of seven segmentation models implemented using the same data partition and hardware equipment. A statistical analysis, considering the DICE coefficient metric, demonstrates that AFFL-TransUNet outperforms four baseline models and performs comparably to the remaining models. Remarkably, AFFL-TransUNet achieves this high performance while significantly reducing training processing time by 66.31–72.39%. This reduction is attributed to the fuzzy system that effectively adapts the $$\alpha $$ value of the loss function, stabilizing the model within just a few epochs.},

The plant detector module achieved an impressive localization accuracy of 96.4% and an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 77.42%. Additionally, the segmentation module demonstrated strong performance with dice and Jaccard scores of 0.95 and 0.91, respectively. These results highlight the system’s capability to define plant boundaries accurately.

This paper proposes image-based detection of leaf diseases using various deep learning-based models. The experiment was conducted on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of 54,305 colour leaf images (healthy and diseased) belonging to 11 crop species categorized into 38 classes.

The Inception-ResNet-V2-based model achieved the best 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of $$0.9535 \pm 0.041$$ and was found statistically significant among other deep learning-based models. However, these deep learning models are considered a black box as their leaf disease predictions are opaque to end users. To address this issue, a local interpretable framework is proposed to mark the superpixels that contribute to identifying leaf disease.

In this context, developing smart and efficient pricing strategies has become a top priority in the industry. Faced with this challenge, traditional pricing methods are inadequate due to their slow response, insufficient adaptability to instant changes in the market, and over-reliance on historical data and human experience. In response to this urgent need, this study aims to design an intelligent pricing model rooted in deep learning to enhance the vitality and competitiveness of the retail industry. The emerging solution adopted in this article combines Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), Ensemble of Simplified RNNs (ES-RNN), and dynamic attention mechanisms, aiming to accurately capture and analyze complex time series data through these advanced technologies. TFT processes multivariate and multi-level data, ES-RNN technology integrates multiple simple versions of recurrent neural networks to enhance predictive power, and the dynamic attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically weight the importance of different points in the time series, thereby improving the effectiveness of feature extraction. Test experimental results on four different data sets show that our models all show excellent performance, and the accuracy of predicted product sales far exceeds traditional models. In addition, with its ability to dynamically adjust pricing, the model demonstrates excellent stability and adaptability amid market fluctuations. This research not only promotes the intelligent transformation of retail pricing strategies, but also provides a more strategic tool for enterprises to compete for market share.},

Knowledge-driven methods struggle to adapt to extensive datasets, while data-driven methods rely heavily on high-quality data and require precise feature selection for model construction. To address these challenges, this research aims to propose an integrated approach that combines prior knowledge with data-driven techniques for automatic G2P conversion in the Korean language. In this work, we extract attributes based on pronunciation rules and phonetic transformations between Korean words to construct a decision tree. Subsequently, the model is trained using a data-driven approach for automated phonetic transcription. The proposed integrated model achieves more accurate alignment between input and output variables, effectively capturing phonological variations in continuous Korean speech, and determining corresponding phonemes for graphemes. Rigorous cross-validation confirms its superiority, with an average accuracy of 94.63% in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, outperforming existing methodologies. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of an integrated approach combining prior knowledge and data-driven techniques for G2P conversion in Korean. The high accuracy and performance of this method are significant for Korean G2P. Our approach can also be applied to low-resource or endangered languages that already have some linguistic research foundation to improve the accuracy of the pronunciation lexicon of the language.},

  abstract     = {Digitizing ancient manuscripts and making them accessible to a broader audience is a crucial step in unlocking the wealth of information they hold. However, automatic recognition of handwritten text and the extraction of relevant information such as named entities from these manuscripts are among the most difficult research topics, due to several factors such as poor quality of manuscripts, complex background, presence of ink stains, cursive handwriting, etc. To meet these challenges, we propose two systems, the first system performs the task of handwritten text recognition (HTR) in ancient manuscripts; it starts with a preprocessing operation. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the features of each input image. Finally, a recurrent neural network (RNN) which has Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks with the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer will predict the text contained in the image. The second system focuses on recognizing named entities and deciphering the relationships among words directly from images of old manuscripts, bypassing the need for an intermediate text transcription step. Like the previous system, this second system starts with a preprocessing step. Then the data augmentation technique is used to increase the training dataset. After that, the extraction of the most relevant features is done automatically using a CNN model. Finally, the recognition of names entities and the relationship between word images is performed using a bidirectional LSTM. Extensive experiments on the ESPOSALLES dataset demonstrate that the proposed systems achieve the state-of-the-art performance exceeding existing systems.},

The set of simultaneous equations acquired in both the explicit and implicit method may be solved using the Thomas algorithm from the tridiagonal dominating matrix, and the spline offers a continuous solution. The results are implemented with very fine meshes and with relatively small-time steps. Using mesh refinement, it was possible to find better temperature distribution in the thin bar. Five numerical examples are used to support the efficiency and accuracy of the current scheme. The findings are also compared with analytical results and other results in terms of error and error norms $${L}_{2}$$ and $${L}_{\infty }$$ . The Von-Neuman technique is used to analyse stability. The truncation error of both systems is calculated and determined to have a convergence of order $$O\left( {h + \Delta t^{2} } \right).$$},

  abstract     = {To solve the problems of feature loss and color difference after image dehazing and poor dehazing effect in real hazy images, a method UVCGAN-Dehaze is proposed for unpaired image dehazing. In the proposed model, the generator learns the relationship between image features and low-frequency features at multiple scales by combining the U-Net with the transformer. We strengthen the connection between spatial and channel features by adding Convolutional Block Attention Module(CBAM) before the skip connection of each layer of U-Net of the generator and adaptively adjusting the weight allocation of the feature map, so that the image after dehazing can better retain the detailed information of the image. Simultaneously, in order to reduce the feature loss and color difference after image dehazing, we propose a loss function named Feature Laplacian Perception (FLP) loss, which jointly constrains the generator by fusing the perception loss and Laplacian loss, so that the generated image reduces the feature loss and color difference. The method not only generates dehazing images with high perceptual quality in terms of important regions and details, but also avoids content and color loss. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the method on synthetic images and real hazy images, and the proposed method achieves better dehazing results when compared with the experimental results of previous typical methods.},

  abstract     = {Image splicing is a common and informal way to generate forgery images. Two or more than two images merged into one image is called image splicing. Many researchers in the image splicing area continue to face the challenge of splice forgery image recognition. This is why it’s crucial to regularly update image forgery detection systems so that they are continuously updated and require more research in this area. The IFC-TC, DVMM, Columbia, and CASIA datasets have been used to evaluate the splicing recognition result of the proposed technique. In this technique initially, the features are extracted by using the DWT and LBP techniques for computing different parameters. Initially, images undergo three layers of DWT, and splitting the image into low- and sub-bands high-frequency occurs after the first level. In addition, by splitting a low-frequency sub-band twice, more information can be extracted, resulting in a three-level DWT. The different parameters computed using LBP and DWT are PPV, TPR, FPR, F-1 score, and accuracy for splicing forgery detection. The different parameters derived from DWT and LBP techniques are compared individually as well as combined. The SVM classifier is used to distinguish among original and spliced image identification. The PPV, TPR, FPR, F-1 Score, and accuracy parameters are 98.88%, 97.59%, 87.51%, 98.53%, and 98.31%, respectively, for the IFC-TC dataset. The PPV, TPR, FPR, F-1 Score, and accuracy parameters are 97.92%, 98.65%, 89.69%, 98.20%, and 98.59%, respectively, for the DVMM dataset.

  abstract     = {The step-down DC/DC converter is characterized by the parametric uncertainty of its model and its high sensitivity to external disturbances identified by variations in the input voltage, load and output reference voltage. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the experimental evaluation of a new adaptive synergetic control law based on the M5P model tree for efficient output voltage control of the step-down type DC/DC converter. A combination of the synergetic technique, the fuzzy logic theory and the machine learning has been used for the first time to develop this advanced control law. The synergetic strategy is exploited to overcome the chattering problem arising from the use of the sliding mode approach which has been applied in previous research. Furthermore, the novel machine learning M5P tree-based approximator was designed and applied to approximate the unknown and imprecise dynamics of the studied converter. The learning data comes from the smart approximator, which is based on fuzzy logic, with the aim of extracting its own advantages and offering them to the new tree-based approximator M5P. This action will make it possible to improve the operation of the fuzzy approximator, which has already been studied in some research. Finally, the developed control strategy was successfully evaluated in the laboratory using the dSPACE 1104 board and compared with the fuzzy adaptive synergetic approach under different conditions of load variations and imposed references. The practical results show that the proposed tree adaptive synergetic approach is competitive with the fuzzy adaptive strategy in terms of ease of practical implementation, fast control execution and better output voltage regulation quality.},

The idea of our method is to adjust the score value assigned by a given classifier using its rank. Our method aims to assign high support to highly ranked labels and low support to lowly ranked labels. In contrast with other DS-based combination methods, our method does not require a complicated process to adjust the pieces of evidence. Through a numerical example, we proved that the proposed method is efficient and generates better results than those achieved by other DS-based combination methods. Moreover, we applied our method in combining multiple classifiers using many real-world datasets. The comparison of our method with other DS-based combination methods, non-learning combination methods, and ensemble classifiers shows that our method performs better using most of the datasets.},

  abstract     = {UAVs are commonly utilized for the detection of insulator faults in transmission lines. The successful execution of such missions depends on two pivotal factors; the detection of insulator faults, which reduces losses in transmission lines, and the monitoring of the status of the UAV during the mission. Due to the vulnerability of UAV wings to defects, particularly lagging defects, it is crucial for the UAV to promptly land if it has loose wings to prevent severe damage. This article employs vibration data acquired from a wing-mounted sensor on the UAV to monitor its status. To determine the state of the UAV, a novel classifier is introduced, which aggregates votes from support vector machines (SVM), probabilistic neural networks (PNN), and deep neural networks (DNN) using Type-1 and Interval Type-2 Takagi–Sugeno–Kang Fuzzy System. Furthermore, the UAV-captured images of insulator in transmission lines are utilized for insulator fault detection. A similar approach is adopted for insulator fault detection, except that Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is used instead of PNN, and ResNet-50 (Residual Network) is employed for feature extraction from insulator images. The software&#39;s cell phone interface, designed specifically for mobile devices, presents the graphical representation of UAV status and insulator fault detection. Furthermore, the generalizability of the proposed classifier for other applications is evaluated using two test datasets sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The findings indicate that the proposed method performs better than renowned classifiers such as PNN, MLP, ANFIS, Fuzzy classifier, SVM, and ResNet-50.},

  abstract     = {We consider a discrete best approximation problem formulated in the framework of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of samples of input and output of an unknown function, the problem is to construct a generalized tropical Puiseux polynomial that best approximates the function in the sense of a tropical distance function. The construction of an approximate polynomial involves the evaluation of both unknown coefficient and exponent of each monomial in the polynomial. To solve the approximation problem, we first reduce the problem to an equation in unknown vector of coefficients, which is given by a matrix with entries parameterized by unknown exponents. We derive a best approximate solution of the equation, which yields both vector of coefficients and approximation error parameterized by the exponents. Optimal values of exponents are found by minimization of the approximation error, which is transformed into minimization of a function of exponents over all partitions of a finite set. We solve this minimization problem in terms of max-plus algebra (where addition is defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition) by using a computational procedure based on the agglomerative clustering technique. This solution is extended to the minimization problem of finding optimal exponents in the polynomial in terms of max-algebra (where addition is defined as maximum). The results obtained are applied to develop new solutions for conventional problems of discrete best Chebyshev approximation of real functions by piecewise linear functions and piecewise Puiseux polynomials. We discuss computational complexity of the proposed solution and estimate upper bounds on the computational time. We demonstrate examples of approximation problems solved in terms of max-plus and max-algebra, and give graphical illustrations.},

In the proposed system the simple daily time series is converted to an information enriched fuzzy linguistic time series with a unique approach of incorporating information about the sentiment behind the Open High Low Close (OHLC) price formation that took place at every instance of the time series. A unique approach is followed while modeling the information retrieval (IR) system which converts a simple IR system it into a forecasting system. A number of experiments were conducted using the proposed model on Nifty-50 index values (5 years) and it was found that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value came around 1.03 and RMSE% came around 1.72% which is quite small compared to number of observations and hence this gives a strong indication that the proposed system has the capability to perform good quality of forecasts.

Thus, by combining BWM and KEMIRA, the hybrid approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of attribute ranking. Furthermore, the proposed approach utilizes DEA to streamline the weight selection process in decision-making. That is, instead of fixed scales, the optimal weights of the criteria are derived by solving a multi-objective programming model defined on a continuous space.

  abstract     = {Workload migration among cloud data centers is currently an evolving task that requires substantial advancements. The incorporation of fuzzy systems holds potential for enhancing performance and efficiency within cloud computing. This study addresses a multi-objective problem wherein the goal is to maximize the interpretability and the percentage of renewable energy consumed by a fuzzy meta-scheduler system in cloud scenarios. To accomplish this objective, the present research proposes a novel approach utilizing a multi-objective Knowledge Acquisition with a Swarm Intelligence Approach algorithm. Additionally, it takes advantage of a framework built on CloudSim, which includes virtual machine migration capabilities based on an expert system. Furthermore, a hierarchical fuzzy system is employed to assess rule base interpretability, along with another multi-objective algorithm, named Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. The framework and hierarchical system are employed to perform various simulation results concerning renewable energy and interpretability, while the algorithms aim to enhance the system’s performance and interpretability. Empirical results demonstrate that it is possible to improve the performance of cloud data centers while improving the interpretability of the corresponding fuzzy rule-based system. The proposed multi-objective algorithm shows comparable or superior performance to the genetic algorithm across diverse scenarios. The simulation results indicate that improvements in cloud data center performance can be achieved while enhancing system interpretability. The average improvement in the interpretability index ranges from 0.6 to 6%, with a corresponding increase in renewable energy utilization ranging from 5 to 6%.},

Ridesharing has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the negative impacts associated with private car usage. This paper focuses on the stability of ridesharing systems and establishes a single-driver multiple-rider ridesharing matching model. To solve this model, a filtering algorithm for the pre-matching set and a fast-solving algorithm for stable matching scheme are proposed. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of subsidy distance upper limit into the ridesharing system. Remarkably, our findings indicate that with a limit of 0.1km, the distance saved generated by the subsidy amounts to 560.5% of the total subsidy. To validate our approach, we simulate ridesharing demand data using real taxi data, and design computational experiments to prove the computational efficiency of the filtering algorithm and fast-solving algorithm. The impact of various parameters on ridesharing systems is also explored.},

Generally, the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm has significant advantages such as fewer control parameters and easy implementation, is one of the commonly employed approaches aiming to solve the problem in many fields. However, the traditional GWO has the shortcomings such as poor population initialization diversity, slow convergence speed and easily fall into local optimal values, it is difficult to solve deployment of inspection nodes problem in the grain surface. In this study, an improved Latin Hypercube grey wolf optimization (LH-GWO) is presented to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional GWO algorithm in solving inspection node deployment problem. The LH-GWO algorithm contains two novel mechanisms which are the Latin Hypercube Sampling population initialization and an improved nonlinear convergence factor. Moreover, a grain surface boundary inspection nodes deployment strategy is proposed to optimize the location of nodes at the boundary. For verifying the effectiveness of the proposed LH-GWO, comparing with six commonly used algorithms based on benchmark functions experiment and coverage rate experiment. The experimental results demonstrate the merits of LH-GWO in terms of convergence speed, optimization accuracy and area coverage. Finally, the optimal inspection nodes are divided into three inspection regional areas by k-means algorithm clustering, and in each inspection regional area, the optimal inspection path of each robot is determined by solving the travel salesman problem (TSP).},

  abstract     = {The problem of project portfolio selection considering risk propagation is a new research topic, but it overlooks the fact that the risk propagation process can be hindered by resource mobilization within candidate projects, which is defined as “risk absorption” in this paper. Neglecting this process may lead to the risk propagation process being overestimated, thereby resulting in the selection of suboptimal projects. Based on this, this article examines the risk absorption process in project portfolio selection problem, aiming to investigate its impact on project portfolio decision, ultimately resulting in the selection of more stable project portfolio. To address this issue, the article first examines the process of risk absorption among projects and calculates the amount of risk absorbed based on the strength of the interactions between the projects selected. Secondly, the total risk intensity of the project is given by calculating the risk propagation intensity and self-incurred risk intensity. Finally, a dual-objective project portfolio selection model considering risk absorption is developed by combining the risk intensity and net present value of the project. The analysis of a case study demonstrates that (1) considering risk absorption can reduce the probability of project risks occurring due to being propagated, (2) considering risk absorption will prioritize projects with higher returns, albeit accompanied by relatively higher risks.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a promising domain that is gaining more attention because of its applicability and suitability in modern applications that comprise health care, disaster management, and environment monitoring purposes. Energy efficiency is considered an important issue because of the restricted energy of non-rechargeable batteries in the sensor. Cluster based routing is significant in handling the issue of energy efficiency in the WSN. In this paper, the Energy-based Multi Objective Golden Jackal Optimization (EMOGJO) is proposed for enhancing energy efficiency. The EMOGJO is used to select the optimum Cluster Heads (CHs) by using the Mean Node Energy (MNE), Individual Node Neighborhood Count (INNC), the interspace between sensors, the interspace between CH and BS, and node degree. Subsequently, the route through CHs until Base Station (BS) is discovered using the EMOGJO which is optimized by energy, and interspace between CH and BS measures. Therefore, the EMOGJO is used to enhance life expectancy while increasing the throughput. The EMOGJO method is evaluated using alive nodes, energy consumption, data packets received in BS, throughput, packet loss ratio and life expectancy. The EMOGJO is compared with the existing approaches that are, Hybrid Improved Whale Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (HIWAEO), Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA)-Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Energy Efficient Cluster Based Routing Protocol using Firefly Algorithm namely EECRAIFA. The life expectancy of EMOGJO for 350 nodes is 17,778 rounds, which is greater than the HIWAEO’s 1590 rounds, for the same number of nodes.},

  abstract     = {Techniques that exploit spectral-spatial information have proven to be very effective in hyperspectral image classification. Joint sparse representation classification (JSRC) is one such technique which has been extensively used for this purpose. However, the use of a single fixed-sized window has limited its ability to incorporate spatial information. Several techniques such as multiscale superpixels based sparse representation classification (MSSRC), multiscale adaptive sparse representation classification (MASRC) and Discriminant Subdictionary Learning (DSDL) have tried to overcome this drawback by fusing information from different scales. However, their inability to simultaneously consider the correlated information at different scales and appropriate spatial neighbourhoods limits their performance. In order to better model contextual information, in this paper, we propose a modified max-tree and modified min-tree to represent the connected components of the image. Then, by exploiting these connected components, adaptive multiscale windows are defined. The potentiality of the proposed technique is validated by performing a comparative analysis with four state-of-the-art sparse representation methods using three real hyperspectral datasets. For a fixed training and test sets of University of Pavia and Indian Pines dataset, our proposed technique provides at least 3% and 2%, respectively higher classification results than the best state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition structure learning algorithms are widely adopted to recover Bayesian network structures. In the recursive process of separation phase, the network partition is obtained through recursively two steps: constructing the undirected independence graph (UIG) and decomposing with the help of partition methods. UIG as the basis for decomposition directly affects the result of the network partition and then impacts the accuracy of output structure. Existing construction algorithms adopt a fixed type of UIG in the recursive process and researches divide into two directions: constructing moral graph and moral graph with extra edges. The former suffer from the problem that computational complexity of recovering all conditional independences (CIs) is too high to divide network well due to relatively complex networks at the beginning of the recursive process, while the latter suffer from the problem that the network partition is hard to find by insufficient expression degree of CIs due to relatively simple networks at the end of the recursive process. The reason is that the fixed type of UIG can not cope with variation of network size. Therefore, this paper proposes a stage-driven construction algorithm considering variation of network size in the recursive process. Different from other construction algorithms, the proposed algorithm designs the network scale factor to achieve the stage division of the recursive process, and selects different algorithms at different stages to build appropriate UIGs through demand analysis. Experiments on different benchmark networks verify that the proposed algorithm can obtain better performances compared with other representative algorithms.},

Specifically, we categorize SVM-based models into re-sampling, algorithmic, and fusion methods, and discuss the principles of the representative models in each category. In addition, we conduct a series of empirical evaluations to compare the performances of various representative SVM-based models in each category using benchmark imbalanced data sets, ranging from low to high imbalanced ratios. Our findings reveal that while algorithmic methods are less time-consuming owing to no data pre-processing requirements, fusion methods, which combine both re-sampling and algorithmic approaches, generally perform the best, but with a higher computational load.

Specifically, during the audio pre-processing stage, we converge mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients features and residual phase features with weighting, enabling the extraction of more comprehensive music emotion characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the accuracy of predicting musical emotion while reducing computational complexity during training phase, we consolidate Long short term memory network with Broad learning system network. We employ long short term memory structure as the feature mapping node of broad learning system structure, leveraging the advantages of both network models. This novel Neural Network architecture, called BLNN (Broad-Long Neural Network), achieves higher prediction accuracy. i.e., 66.78%, than single network models and other benchmark with/without consolidation methods. Moreover, it achieves lower time complexity than other excellent models, i.e., 169.32 s of training time and 507.69 ms of inference time, and achieves the optimal balance between efficiency and performance. In short, the extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BLNN architecture effectively predicts music emotion, surpassing other models in terms of accuracy while reducing computational demands.

  abstract     = {Twin Support Vector Machine (TSVM) transforms a single large quadratic programming problem (QPP) in support vector machine (SVM) into two smaller QPPs by finding two non-parallel classification hyperplanes, so that its computational time is reduced to a quarter of what the traditional SVM takes. However, TSVM ignores the data distribution of class, which makes TSVM sensitive to noise. In this paper, a fuzzy twin support vector machine based on centered kernel alignment (FTSVM-CKA) is proposed to solve the problem that TSVM is sensitive to noise. Firstly, a feature-weighted kernel function is constructed by using the information gain, and it is applied to the calculation of the centered kernel alignment (CKA). This assigns greater weight to strongly correlated features, emphasizing their classification importance over weakly correlated features. Secondly, the CKA method is utilized to derive a heuristic function for calculating the dependency between samples and their corresponding labels, which assigns fuzzy membership to different samples. Based on this, a fuzzy membership assignment strategy is proposed that can effectively address the sensitivity of TSVM to noise. Thirdly, this strategy is combined with TSVM to propose the FTSVM-CKA model. Moreover, this study employs a coordinate descent strategy with shrinking by active set to tackle the computational complexity arising from high-dimensional inputs. This can effectively accelerate the training speed of the model while ensuring classification performance. In order to evaluate the performance of FTSVM-CKA, this study conducts experiments designed on artificial and UCI datasets. The results demonstrate that FTSVM-CKA can efficiently and quickly solve binary classification problems with noise.},

  abstract     = {Enterprise portraits are reliant on the meticulous process of tag extraction, with the accuracy and efficiency of this foundational task being pivotal for the construction of high-quality portraits and their subsequent applicability in varied real-world scenarios. However, current methodologies, chiefly semantic clustering and deep neural networks, are constrained by significant shortcomings: the former struggles with intricate text feature discernment, while the latter, although high-performing, are marked by their extensive computational requirements. In response to these challenges, we present EPCEKD, a novel approach leveraging context embedding and knowledge distillation, designed to refine the tag extraction process. EPCEKD utilizes structured enterprise context data to facilitate feature expansion and impose tag constraints, enabling the efficient vectorization and integration of enterprise context data and text. Further, EPCEKD amalgamates a large-scale BERT network and a streamlined GRU network, embedding the branch network into the backbone network to forge a unified tag extraction model. To validate the efficacy of EPCEKD, comprehensive experiments were conducted on the Ente-pku dataset and benchmarked against eight prevailing models, with EPCEKD demonstrating superior performance, achieving 95.17% in precision, recall, and F1-score, significantly surpassing models like BiLSTM-CNN (94.25%) and Transformer (91.46%). Importantly, EPCEKD not only excels in precision and F1-score but also enhances the computing speed of large-scale neural networks by 4 $$-$$ 11.4 times, showcasing its substantial potential for practical enterprise portrait applications.},

  abstract     = {Most of the current attribute reduction methods use the measure to define the reduct, such as the positive region of rough set theory (RS), information entropy, and distance. However, the size of the reduct based on the measures is still limited. To cope with this problem, we propose a new approach of attribute reduction based on using the intuitionistic fuzzy topology (IFT). Firstly, a new IFT structure based on the pre-order relation and the intuitionistic fuzzy base (IF-base) structure is introduced. Secondly, a new measure is proposed to evaluate the significance of the attribute based on the IF subbase. Finally, the new reduction algorithms based on the IF-base filter and filter-wrapper methods are presented. The theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient in terms of size and accuracy of the reduct. Specifically, the reduct of the F_IFT algorithm has an average size of 50% smaller, and the FW_IFT algorithm has an average accuracy of 10% greater than those of the related algorithms. Significantly, the algorithm FW_IFT can very remove noisy attributes. The classification accuracy of the reduct is 15% higher than that of the original set of attributes.},

The major issue is to pose these procedures as a learning problem and generate suitable synthetic data set which suffice learning it with small neural networks. In this work, we pose an arc-length based essentially non-oscillatory (ENOL) reconstruction algorithm as machine learning problem. A novel way to construct the synthetic data using ENOL algorithm along with basic smooth and piece-wise continuous functions is given. Small vanilla regression and classification neural networks are trained to learn third order (ENOL) polynomial approximation procedure. The metric of trained ENO classification and regression networks is presented and commented. These trained models are implemented in numerical solver to compute the solution of test problems of hyperbolic conservation laws. The presented numerical results show that ENO classification network gives results comparable to the exact ENOL reconstruction whereas ENO regression network performs poorly both in terms of convergence and resolving the discontinuities.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a tool in approximation theory widely used to solve interpolation problems. In fact, ANNs can be assimilated to functions since they take an input and return an output. The structure of the specifically adopted network determines the underlying approximation space, while the form of the function is selected by fixing the parameters of the network. In the present paper, we consider one-hidden layer ANNs with a feedforward architecture, also referred to as shallow or two-layer networks, so that the structure is determined by the number and types of neurons. The determination of the parameters that define the function, called training, is done via the resolution of the approximation problem, so by imposing the interpolation through a set of specific nodes. We present the case where the parameters are trained using a procedure that is referred to as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) that leads to a linear interpolation problem. In such hypotheses, the existence of an ANN interpolating function is guaranteed. Given that the ANN is interpolating, the error incurred occurs outside the sampling interpolation nodes provided by the user. In this study, various choices of nodes are analyzed: equispaced, Chebychev, and randomly selected ones. Then, the focus is on regular target functions, for which it is known that interpolation can lead to spurious oscillations, a phenomenon that in the ANN literature is referred to as overfitting. We obtain good accuracy of the ANN interpolating function in all tested cases using these different types of interpolating nodes and different types of neurons. The following study is conducted starting from the well-known bell-shaped Runge example, which makes it clear that the construction of a global interpolating polynomial is accurate only if trained on suitably chosen nodes, ad example the Chebychev ones. In order to evaluate the behavior when the number of interpolation nodes increases, we increase the number of neurons in our network and compare it with the interpolating polynomial. We test using Runge’s function and other well-known examples with different regularities. As expected, the accuracy of the approximation with a global polynomial increases only if the Chebychev nodes are considered. Instead, the error for the ANN interpolating function always decays, and in most cases we observe that the convergence follows what is observed in the polynomial case on Chebychev nodes, despite the set of nodes used for training. Then we can conclude that the use of such an ANN defeats the Runge phenomenon. Our results show the power of ANNs to achieve excellent approximations when interpolating regular functions also starting from uniform and random nodes, particularly for Runge’s function.},

  abstract     = {The kNN classifier is the most popular, supervised machine-learning technique, but the main disadvantage of this algorithm is that it has restricted access to the class distributions in a training point set and treats all the instances equally. In kNN classification, fuzzy sets are used to obtain the membership degrees of each point to the classes known as fuzzy kNN (FkNN) classification. Although the FkNN classifier enhances the performance of the kNN, it does not consider the effect of noisy and redundant instances, which makes it ineffective. Moreover, the performance of kNN is dependent on the value of k (number of nearest neighbours). Considering these issues, we present a novel algorithm that simultaneously tunes the class-dependent feature weights and k value using an effective meta-heuristic algorithm, the Enhanced Equilibrium Optimization technique. Several experiments have been conducted on different biomedical datasets, and the proposed approach has outperformed the other standard classifiers in terms of accuracy.},

The RGB noises are removed in noise filtering and given to Canopy Algorithm-based Minibatch K-Means Clustering clustering of static and dynamic gesture images. After that, by utilizing the YCbCr Palm point and Finger speed-based Threshold in the Region seed Grow Segmentation algorithm, the clustered images are segmented that segments both palm and fingers. Then, the features are extracted, and these features are given to the Kohnen Feature Mapping-based CNN classifier. From the Classifier, HG-recognized character outcomes are obtained.

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis (OP) is an osteometabolic disorder characterized by a lesser bone mineral density (BMD) and the disruption of bone tissue micro—architecture, resulting in a greater bone fragility and higher likelihoods of fractures. OP emerges once the bone mass declines faster than the body&#39;s capacity to replenish it, leading to a significant reduction in the strength of bone. OP impacts each and every bone throughout the body and provides no clinical signs until a fracture happens. Aging leads to the reduction in BMD, and the rate of percentage of fractures rises over time, usually causing mortality and morbidity. Numerous BMD evaluation methods are available, and they are used in a variety of settings by considering the location of the fracture. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA/DXA) is recognized as the gold standard for predicting the fracture, since it is the most advanced, technologically affirmed, and also has excellent performance. According to the findings, most researchers do not endeavour the identification and the segmentation of low bone masses from DEXA images. Medical image segmentation supports in analyzing and visualizing the bone&#39;s low bone mass. The envisaged hybrid approach, that integrates GLCM for feature extraction and AlexNet for a low bone mass variation classification, provides segmented images that assist in categorizing bone health as normal, osteopenia, or osteoporosis. The developed algorithm&#39;s performance metrics, including Dice Co-efficient, Sensitivity, and Specificity, were 92.35, 90.26, and 92.42%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The intelligent customer service conversations between customer and customer service agent exhibit characteristics such as serious colloquialism, a high diversity of words, and short text length, making traditional sentiment analysis algorithms less effective. Besides, relying solely on coarse-grained sentiment analysis could not fully display the text information of users in the dialogue, resulting in poor performance of sentiment classification prediction. To address these issues, this paper introduces a hybrid word embedding method (HWE) based on Gaussian distribution to leverage the emotional syntactic and semantic richness of the two distributed word representations (Word2Vec, and GloVe). Additionally, a stacked ensemble method is employed, combining outputs from three deep learning models—Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This ensemble approach enables simultaneous prediction of both coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment analysis for intelligent customer service conversation text. The results show that HWE method enhances the comprehension of word representations in the context of conversations, leading to more effective sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the proposed stacked ensemble model outperforms current state-of-the-art single-task models, showcasing a significant improvement in sentiment classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The coronavirus occurred in Wuhan (China) first and it was declared a global pandemic. To detect coronavirus X-ray images can be used. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used commonly to detect illness from images. There can be lots of different alternative deep CNN models or architectures. To find the best architecture, hyper-parameter optimization can be used. In this study, the problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Objective functions are multi-class cross entropy, error ratio, and complexity of the CNN network. For the best solutions to the objective functions, multi-objective hyper-parameter optimization is made by NSGA-III, NSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, SMS-EMOA, MOEA/D, and proposed Swarm Genetic Algorithms (SGA). SGA is a swarm-based algorithm with a cross-over process. All six algorithms are run and give Pareto optimal solution sets. When the figures obtained from the algorithms are analyzed and algorithm hypervolume values are compared, SGA outperforms the NSGA-III, NSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, SMS-EMOA, and MOEA/D algorithms. It can be concluded that SGA is better than others for multi-objective hyper-parameter optimization algorithms for COVID-19 detection from X-ray images. Also, a sensitivity analysis has been made to understand the effect of the number of the parameters of CNN on model success.},

  abstract     = {Biomedical image segmentation is considered an important and challenging task. Automated biomedical image analysis plays a major role in the early and quick diagnosis of diseases. Accurate and precise segmentation can lead to early treatment planning and it demands sophisticated approaches. Inspired by this, a novel approach is proposed. This approach will be known as the Fuzzy modified cuckoo search with spatial exploration (FMCSSE). High correlation among pixels is an important property of image data and pixels surrounding a particular pixel possess similar feature information. Therefore, it is extremely essential to consider the spatial information to generate a meaningful segmented image. The traditional fuzzy clustering approach is not suitable for exploiting spatial information. Therefore, this work is designed to explore spatial information and find the optimal clusters from biomedical images with the help of the fuzzy-modified cuckoo search approach. This approach is applied to different biomedical images and compared with various state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches like FEMO, FMCS, MCS, and CS. The proposed approach does not suffer from the choice of the initial assignment of the cluster centers. The proposed approach uses the type-2 fuzzy system blended with the modified cuckoo search (McCulloch approach) and spatial exploration procedure. Both qualitative and quantitative results show the superiority of the FMCSSE approach in terms of performance.},

To solve the problem that the parameters considered are not comprehensive enough and the accuracy needs to be improved, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and wavelet neural network (WNN) methods are proposed to estimate the bond strength of concrete confined by FRP. A total of 749 specimens and ten input variables collected from the literature were used to develop the MARS and WNN models. To verify the prediction performance of the proposed models, an improved particle swarm optimization method based on the shrinkage factor method was used to calibrate ten empirical models. The recalibrated empirical models were then compared with MARS and WNN models. The root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), root relative squared error (RRSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and integral absolute error (IAE) values of MARS and WNN models were 3.454, 2.635, 0.917, 0.289, 0.153 and 0.127; 3.277, 2.516, 0.925, 0.274, 0.164 and 0.122, respectively, for the training datasets and 3.454, 2.701, 0.94, 0.245, 0.153 and 0.121; 3.652, 2.751, 0.933, 0.259, 0.184 and 0.123, respectively, for the testing datasets.

  abstract     = {Chest X-ray imaging is a critical diagnostic tool for identifying pulmonary diseases. However, manual interpretation of these images is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated systems utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of chest X-ray image classification. While previous work has mainly focused on using feature maps from the final convolution layer, there is a need to explore the benefits of leveraging additional layers for improved disease classification. Extracting robust features from limited medical image datasets remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based multilayer multimodal fusion model that emphasizes extracting features from different layers and fusing them. Our disease detection model considers the discriminatory information captured by each layer. Furthermore, we propose the fusion of different-sized feature maps (FDSFM) module to effectively merge feature maps from diverse layers. The proposed model achieves a significantly higher accuracy of 97.21% and 99.60% for both three-class and two-class classifications, respectively. The proposed multilayer multimodal fusion model, along with the FDSFM module, holds promise for accurate disease classification and can also be extended to other disease classifications in chest X-ray images.},

  abstract     = {Generating uniform design tables (UDTs) is the first step to experimenting efficiently and effectively, and is also one of the most critical steps. Thus, the construction of uniform design tables has received much attention over the past decades. This paper presents a new algorithm for constructing uniform design tables: restart discrete dynamical evolutionary algorithm (RDDE). This algorithm is based on a well-designed dynamical evolutionary algorithm and utilizes discrete rounding technology to convert continuous variables into discrete variables. Considering the optimization of UDT is a multi-objective optimization problem, RDDE uses Friedman rank to select the optimal solution with better comprehensive comparison ranking. RDDE also utilizes a simulated annealing-based restart technology to select control parameters, thereby increasing the algorithm&#39;s ability to jump out of local optima. Comparisons with state-of-the-art UDTs and two practical engineering examples are presented to verify the uniformity of the design table constructed by RDDE. Numerical results indicate that RDDE can indeed construct UDTs with excellent uniformity at different levels, factors, and runs. Especially, RDDE can flexibly construct UDTs with unequal intervals of factors that cannot be directly processed by other designs of experiment.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new design method of energy management strategy (EMS) with adaptive super-twisting sliding mode control (ASTSMC) for fuel cell/battery/supercapacitor hybrid vehicle (FCHEV). The main objective of the proposed EMS is to improve power performance, fuel cell lifetime, and fuel consumption while considering the regulation of the DC-bus voltage. The proposed EMS is designed based on a frequency-decoupling technique using an adaptive low-pass filter, Harr wavelet transform (HWT), and FLC to decouple the required power into low, medium, and high-frequency components for fuel cell, battery, and supercapacitor, respectively. The presented frequency-decoupling-based strategy can improve the power performance of the vehicle as well as reduce load stress and power fluctuation in the fuel cell. Nevertheless, the neural network optimization algorithm (NNOA) is employed to optimize the membership functions of FLCs while considering the hydrogen consumption and constraints on the state of charge (SOC) of the battery and supercapacitor. To achieve robustness and high precision control, the ASTSMC is developed based on a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) to stabilize the DC-bus voltage and currents of the energy sources, ensuring that the fuel cell, battery, and supercapacitor track their obtained reference values. The FCHEV system with the proposed EMS is modeled on MATLAB/Simulink, and three typical driving cycles such as HWFET, UDDS, and WLTP driving schedules are used for evaluation. The findings exhibit that the proposed EMS can effectively improve the fuel economy, reduce power fluctuation in the fuel cell, and prolong its lifetime compared to other existing methods such as the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), state machine (SM), and FLC-based EMSs.},

However, getting a sufficient data for these machine learning models is difficult, and usually collected data is unbalanced i.e. less number of instances with disease class and a large number of classes without the disease. These imbalanced data cause poor performance of the classifier in the detection of minority or disease classes. To address this class imbalance problem for medical data we have applied 17 different class imbalance handling techniques on four publically available datasets with Random forest as a base classifier. The comprehensive review covering the time frame of 1990 to 2023 is also done on “Class imbalance handling techniques” to gather insights using VOSviewer software. Performances of different class imbalance handling techniques are statistically evaluated and impact of different disease datasets on the prediction performance is also statistically assessed. Two novel techniques Genetic Algorithm-Cost sensitive-Deep neural network(GA-CS-DNN) and Class imbalance handling technique-Genetic Algorithm-Deep neural Network(CIH-GA-DNN)are proposed for handling class imbalance problems. Performances of proposed techniques are compared with other state of art class imbalance handling techniques and obtained results showed that OnesidedSelection outperformed all other techniques. A statistical test further demonstrated that OnesidedSelection performs differently than SMOTENN. Significant statistical differences in illness prediction can be seen between the kidney and diabetes, prostate and kidney, and kidney and heart datasets when compared pair-wise.},

However, most methods for topic detection only address the problem of clustering and do not focus on the problem of topic detection accuracy reduction due to the cohesiveness of topics. Also, the sequence of biterm during topic detection can cause substantial deviations in the detected topic content. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a topic detection method based on KM-LSH fusion algorithm and improved BTM model. KM-LSH fusion algorithm is a fusion algorithm that combines K-means clustering and LSH refinement clustering. The proposed method can solve the problem of cohesiveness of topic detection, and the improved BTM model can solve the influence of the sequence of biterm on topic detection. First, the text vector is constructed by processing the collected set of microblog texts using text preprocessing methods. Secondly, the KM-LSH fusion algorithm is used to calculate text similarity and perform topic clustering and refinement. Finally, the improved BTM model is used to model the texts, which is combined with the word position and the improved TF-IDF weight calculation algorithm to adjust the microblogging texts in clustering. The experiment results indicate that the proposed KM-LSH-IBTM method improves the evaluation indexes compared with the other three topic detection methods. In conclusion, the proposed KM-LSH-IBTM method promotes the processing capability of topic detection in terms of cohesiveness and the sequence of biterm.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases affecting patients of different ages. Diabetes can be controlled if diagnosed as early as possible. One of the serious complications of diabetes affecting the retina is diabetic retinopathy. If not diagnosed early, it can lead to blindness. Our purpose is to propose a novel framework, named $$D_MD_RDF$$ , for early and accurate diagnosis of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. The framework consists of two phases, one for diabetes mellitus detection (DMD) and the other for diabetic retinopathy detection (DRD). The novelty of DMD phase is concerned in two contributions. Firstly, a novel feature selection approach called Advanced Aquila Optimizer Feature Selection ( $$A^2OFS$$ ) is introduced to choose the most promising features for diagnosing diabetes. This approach extracts the required features from the results of laboratory tests while ignoring the useless features. Secondly, a novel classification approach (CA) using five modified machine learning (ML) algorithms is used. This modification of the ML algorithms is proposed to automatically select the parameters of these algorithms using Grid Search (GS) algorithm. The novelty of DRD phase lies in the modification of 7 CNNs using Aquila Optimizer for the classification of diabetic retinopathy. The reported results concerning the DMD datasets shows that AO reports best performance metrics in the feature selection process with the help of modified ML classifiers. The best achieved accuracy is 98.65% with the GS-ERTC model and max-absolute scaling on the “Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset” dataset. Also, from the reported results concerning the DRD datasets, the AOMobileNet is considered a suitable model for this problem as it outperforms the other modified CNN models with accuracy of 95.80% on the “The SUSTech-SYSU dataset” dataset.},

The SC model contains two-level; Each level consists of a firm and each firm has a manufacturing factory and a recycling. Also, items are broken down according to Weibull distribution and returned to the firm for recycling. The SC is modelled as a dynamic system and then is reformulated as an OCP. The OCP is changed to a system of equations so that an artificial neural network (ANN) is provided to solve it. For demonstrating the proposed scheme’s effectiveness, performance, and efficiency of the model a real-world problem and an example are given.

  abstract     = {Several constrained optimization problems have been adequately solved over the years thanks to the advances in the area of metaheuristics. Nevertheless, the question as to which search logic performs better on constrained optimization often arises. In this paper, we present Dual Search Optimization (DSO), a co-evolutionary algorithm that includes an adaptive penalty function to handle constrained problems. Compared to other self-adaptive metaheuristics, one of the main advantages of DSO is that it is able auto-construct its own perturbation logics, i.e., the ways solutions are modified to create new ones during the optimization process. This is accomplished by co-evolving the solutions (encoded as vectors of integer/real values) and perturbation strategies (encoded as Genetic Programming trees), in order to adapt the search to the problem. In addition to that, the adaptive penalty function allows the algorithm to handle constraints very effectively, yet with a minor additional algorithmic overhead. We compare DSO with several algorithms from the state-of-the-art on two sets of problems, namely: (1) seven well-known constrained engineering design problems and (2) the CEC 2017 benchmark for constrained optimization. Our results show that DSO can achieve state-of-the-art performances, being capable to automatically adjust its behavior to the problem at hand.},

By incorporating the Dirichlet distribution to control network dynamics, we formulate dynamic community detection as a non-negative matrix factorization problem.

An interval multi-objective honey badger algorithm (IMOHBA) is proposed to address the IMOPs in this paper. Firstly, the $$\mu$$ metric is employed to assess the Pareto dominance relationship among interval individuals, which reflects the quality of the optimal solutions. Secondly, the crowding distance suitable for the interval objective is utilized to reflect the distribution of the optimal solution. Finally, the candidate solutions are ranked and selected by the non-dominated sorting method. To validate the performance of IMOHBA, it is tested on 19 benchmark IMOPs as well as an interval multi-objective scheduling problem for underwater wireless sensor networks and compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority and strong competitiveness of IMOHBA in addressing IMOPs, exhibiting improved convergence and broader exploration capabilities of the solution space. These findings further validate the effectiveness and feasibility of IMOHBA, highlighting its unique advantage in solving IMOPs.},

However, existing solar cell models lack precise parameters, and the manufacturer&#39;s datasheet does not provide the required information for reliable modeling. Consequently, accurate parameter estimation becomes necessary. This paper presents a simple multi-objective optimization algorithm (Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and Rat Search Algorithm (PSORSA)) designed to estimate cell parameters based on this observation. Unlike other optimization algorithms addressing this issue, the proposed algorithm aims to overcome challenges related to local minima and premature convergence, which often lead to suboptimal results. The paper focuses on assessing the reliability of the proposed algorithm by comparing its performance with other well-known optimization algorithms. The proposed optimizing algorithm is tested on the CEC 2019 benchmark function. Experimental results (RMSE), including statistical analysis, validate the algorithm&#39;s effectiveness by comparing them with other algorithms. At the end, non-parametric test is performed to justify the outcomes, vouching for the better performance of the proposed algorithm. The findings demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are particularly well-suited for estimating solar PV models. With its simple structure and high accuracy, the proposed algorithm exhibits great potential for various applications in the field of solar energy.

In this paper, we propose an improved variant of GWO called Decision-Enhanced Grey Wolf optimizer (DEGWO), which introduces a weight assignment to the decisions made by three head wolves (α, β, δ) and establishes a decision value evaluation mechanism. Additionally, in order to prevent excessive reliance on α, β and δ that may lead to reduced population diversity and premature convergence issues, we incorporate dimension learning-based hunting and adaptive frequency perturbation mechanisms into DEGWO. A rigorous multiple analysis of comparisons on 24 well-known standard test functions with six state-of-the-art heuristics and five novel GWO variants, demonstrates that DEGWO exhibits superior capabilities in global exploration. Furthermore, to validate its applicability in other application domains, the proposed DEGWO algorithm was employed to optimize four simulation design problems.},

To solve complicated and constrained optimization problems with fast convergence and accurate computations, a new quantum artificial bee colony algorithm using Sin chaos and Cauchy factor (SCQABC) is proposed. The algorithm introduces a quantum bit to initialize the population, which is then updated by the quantum rotation gate to enhance the convergence of the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC). Sin chaos is introduced to process the individual positions, which improves the randomness and ergodicity of initializing individuals and results in a more diverse initial population. To overcome the upper limits of visiting target individual positions, Cauchy factor is used to mutate individuals for solving falling into local optimum problems. To evaluate the performance of the SCQABC, 20 classical benchmark functions and CEC-2017 are used. The practical engineering problems are also used to verify the practicability of SCQABC algorithm. Moreover, the experimental results will be compared with other well-known and progressive algorithms. According to the results, the SCQABC improves by 64.93% compared with the ABC and also has corresponding improvement compared with other algorithms.

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets, which employs the most informative features to obtain the maximum classification accuracy. The swarm intelligent (SI) algorithm based FS method meets great challenges in initial population quality and search capability. On this account, this paper introduces a modified salp swarm algorithm based on competition mechanism and variable shifted windows called CVSSA. First of all, a competition mechanism is proposed to take full advantage of the characteristics of the random method and maximal information coefficient (MIC) based method to generate a high-quality initial population. Furthermore, the variable shifted windows strategy is introduced to control the numbers of features that enter into the position update to improve the exploitation capability of the algorithm. To comprehensively enhance the search performance of the algorithm, an improved movement mathematical model is designed. Last but not least, an adaptive generalized opposition-based learning (AGOBL) is introduced to further improve the exploitation capability and accelerate the convergence rate. A series of typical and state-of-the-art algorithms are used to make comparisons with the proposed CVSSA on some typical datasets. The experimental results reveal that the CVSSA provides better results than the other algorithms in key indexes. Meanwhile, Wilcoxon’s statistical test results establish that the advantage of the proposed algorithm is significant. It is established that the CVSSA is an efficient algorithm for the FS problems.},

  abstract     = {Field-road trajectory segmentation, which aims to automatically divide a trajectory into a sequence of field-road segments, is one of the important tasks of the agricultural machinery trajectory process. This study aims to enhance the performance of the field-road segmentation problem by introducing a novel parameter optimization strategy that relies on metaheuristic algorithms. The utilization of the metaheuristic algorithm offers precise and efficient techniques for determining parameter combinations in the field-road segmentation model. A novel enhanced optimization algorithm called the chaos sensing slime mould algorithm (CSSMA), aimed at determining out the optimal parameter combination from a large constrained solution space is proposed to further improve the segmentation performance of the model. First, to strengthen the exploration capability of the algorithm, a chaotic strategy is used to initialize the search agents. Furthermore, the CSSMA incorporates the beetle antennae search algorithm and the genetic algorithm to improve its exploitation potential. Ultimately, a proposed technique for updating control parameters in a nonlinear and dynamic manner aims to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. This strategy involves adaptively adjusting computing operations based on feedback from the optimization process. In order to assess the effectiveness of the CSSMA, the algorithm is compared to other metaheuristic algorithms using 23 standard benchmark functions. Furthermore, the CSSMA is utilized to address the practical implementation of the parameter optimization approach for field-road segmentation. The goal is to achieve the utmost accuracy in segmentation and compare it with the current method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior convergence and speed of CSSMA, along with its benefits in extracting optimal parameter structures. It surpasses prior techniques in handling the complexities of field-road trajectory processing problems including several models and nonlinearity features. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive solution for optimizing parameters in various field-road segmentation models.},

This factor can have many effects on economic and environmental issues as well as on the service level. In this paper, two models are proposed. In the first model, the location and allocation of stores are discussed using the maximum coverage method, and in the second model, the optimal number of products is calculated and the network costs and pollution are minimized. GAMS software with CPLEX solver was used to solve mixed linear integer programming under the uncertainty of demand parameters, maximum coverage distance, and carbon trade price in different scenarios. Due to the lack of law to minimize the amount of pollution caused by transportation in Iran, the cap-and-trade policy was used in the supply chain of the Bistoon sugar factory in Kermanshah. The results showed that increasing the coverage distance, in addition to reducing the level of customer service, will also increase the overall costs of the manufacturer and network pollution. Also, despite the costly implementation of environmental policies, by replacement of green vehicles, the overall costs of the network have not increased.},

The government is urging everyone, including scientists and the general public, to help address the severe challenges caused by climate change. Addressing the pivotal issue of carbon emissions stemming from transportation, this manuscript delves into the development of an efficient and coordinated management system. The proposed solution involves a green solid transportation system employing a two-stage network to implement a carbon cap and trade policy. A mathematical model is introduced to underscore the significance of this approach. Because of market fluctuations, supply and demand constraints are not always the same. Therefore, a two-folded uncertainty is included in this article for a better realistic outcome. A ranking defuzzification approach is employed to convert this uncertainty into a deterministic measure. Two illustrative numerical case studies are presented to underscore the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approaches. Then, three multi-objective techniques are employed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions for the addressed problem. After that, a comparative study among these techniques is introduced and a sensitivity analysis is added to explore how the objective functions are influenced by potential changes in supply and demand. In conclusion, the paper offers important insights and identifies areas for future research in this field.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the method of using graph neural networks (GNN) to learn users’ social influence has been widely applied to social recommendation and has shown effectiveness, but several important challenges have not been well addressed: (i) Most work fails to consider the user interests (historical user-item interactions) when first building user-user social relationships, which can make it difficult to capture accurate user embedding and thus prevent the model from better exploring the users’ social influence; (ii) Most of the current methods do not build social neighbors (with the same item-user interaction) that belong to the item and do not aggregate information from the perspective of social neighbors, which makes it possible for the item to lose a lot of details when expressing the user’s interest factors. Therefore, to address the above challenges, we propose Exploring Implicit Influence for Social Recommendation Based on GNN (EIIGNN). First, we construct the initial user embedding with user-item interaction information and use the implicit modeling module in user modeling to explore the implicit influence of interest factors on users. In addition, EIIGNN models the social graph structure of item (an item-item graph) so that item can aggregate information from the perspective of their social neighbors, which helps the model learn a more accurate representation of the item. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of EIIGNN.},

Although fake news sentiment analysis is not entirely new, sentiment score-based artificial news analysis is rarely used. Our method incorporates machine learning techniques and deep learning techniques, such as LSTM-BiLSTM, with SentiWordNet parser-obtained sentiment scores. This integration improves feature sets and enables a more detailed analysis of emotional context. This research pioneers using machine learning along with deep learning techniques based on sentiment scores, an innovative approach within the field. Our research substantially improves the detection of false news. Recall and F-measure are significantly enhanced using machine learning techniques with the COVID-19 dataset. Moreover, sentiment-based deep learning techniques used for both the LIAR and COVID-19 datasets surpass previous benchmarks, obtaining a remarkable accuracy improvement of over 15% on the LIAR dataset compared to existing literature.

  abstract     = {In order to accurately predict the development of the servo industry in China, this study proposes a Hausdorff fractional reverse accumulated grey power model. Accumulation operation and differential equation modeling are the essential modeling steps of grey models different from other algorithms. Given the importance of information prioritization and the nonlinear characteristics in the data, the proposed model introduces enhancements from two key aspects: data feature extraction and structural representation. Firstly, an improved reverse accumulation operation is introduced into Hausdorff fractional accumulation, which can avoid the defect that Hausdorff fractional accumulation does not have the priority of new information. Secondly, an improved structure-adaptative discrete grey power model is proposed to simulate the nonlinear relationship between temporal factors and system states. Unlike traditional grey power models that only consider nonlinear relationships between historical values or temporal factors, the proposed improved grey model can comprehensively consider the complex characteristics of uncertain systems, providing valuable insights for the further expansion of nonlinear grey models. Furthermore, a cost function is established to adaptively adjust the model&#39;s information prioritization and nonlinear features. And the whale optimization algorithm is used to optimize the two hyperparameters of the proposed model. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the suitability of the proposed model, which predicts the trajectory of the servo industry and its downstream sectors in China. The forecasting results indicate that by 2025, the market size of China&#39;s servo industry is expected to reach 61 billion yuan. The production of computer numerical control cutting machine tools in China is projected to reach 880,000 sets by 2025. Additionally, the production of industrial robots in China is anticipated to reach 557,004 units, with an average annual growth rate of approximately 26%, meeting the government&#39;s development target of 20%.},

As the IoT expands, guaranteeing the dependability and accuracy of communication systems becomes increasingly important. One of the key challenges faced in the process of system development is the need to detection the errors in the early phases of system development. Formal techniques are the gold standard for ensuring a system’s correctness. In the context of the IoT, this paper presents an Event-B formal model for the verification of the correctness of Content-Based Publish/Subscribe Systems (CBPS). We developed our model using Event-B, which is an incrementally formal technique with a plugin-supported platform. Furthermore, it supports both theorem proving and model checking. The incremental method uses a series of refining processes to help manage complexity. The paper offers a thorough exposition of the CBPS architecture, with an emphasis on decentralised design, reliable message delivery, and message ordering. This formalised method ensures that the CBPS system satisfies its criteria and free of errors. As a case study for our concept, we employ a smart home system. Finally, we validate and verify the formal model using proof obligations and the Rodin platform.},

These three types of information can effectively portray the publisher&#39;s possible attitude. Most recent studies on the multimodal sentiment analysis challenge have focused on two angles. The first is to examine each mode in isolation, but doing so will ignore the interaction between them. The alternative is to integrate information from several modes and treat it all equally, but doing so will add a lot of noise input and disregard critical modes&#39; dominant positions (such as text). The main fusion module based on the mask attention mechanism and the dynamic aggregation attention mechanism, together with the auxiliary fusion module based on the directed cross-modal transformer, can solve these challenges. At the same time, the issue of data misalignment caused by the various sampling rates of each modal sequence is also taken into account in this paper. Our model can deal with the ``unaligned’’ data, pay greater attention to the crucial modes and features of sentiment information, and reduce the noise input by using the main and auxiliary fusion mechanisms. The model has undergone thorough testing in two publicly accessible multimodal datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI), and the findings show that our model performs significantly better than state-of-the-art models.},

Therefore, how to simplify the concept lattice structure and how to construct granular reduction methods with granularity have become urgent issues that need to be investigated. To this end, firstly, the concept of an object granule with granularity is defined. Secondly, two reduction algorithms, one based on Boolean reasoning and the other on a graph-theoretic heuristic, are formulated while keeping the structure of this object granule unchanged. Further, to simplify the structure of the fuzzy concept lattice, a partial order relation with parameters is proposed.

Here, we (1) propose a new CVI named DzI (Dzung Index) or fRisk2 using analysis of fuzzy-set-based accumulated risk degree (FARD), and (2) present a new algorithm named fRisk2-bA for determining the optimal number of data clusters. It is a method of evaluation of the centroid-based fuzzy clustering validity. In essence, the fRisk2 still focuses on enhancing the data compression in each cluster and expanding the separation between cluster centroids. However, these features are exploited indirectly through FARD. As a result, the proposed method not only can avoid the difficulties of the traditional ones relying on the compression and separation properties directly but also can distill better local and global attributes in the data distribution to estimate the CDS more fully. Along with the proved theory basis, surveys, including the ones based on noisy datasets from measurements, showed the compared advantages of fRisk2 as follows. (1) The accuracy, stability, and convergence of the fRisk2 are outstanding. (2) Its total calculating cost is lower than the other surveyed CVIs.},

  abstract     = {The Bézier curves submitted by Pierre Bézier in the mid-1950s are splendid differential geometric structures. The paper compares a mechanical–theoretical curve (classical-conventional) with a computer-based artificial neural network (modern). While the reader witnesses hourly TEC (TECU) modeling by the class C0 Bézier structure for the first time, (s)he has the opportunity to evaluate the reliable results of segmented-continuous curves with network. The Bézier structure is established by operating the differential geometrical invariants. The yielding and accuracy of the models are evaluated with the R correlation coefficient and the mean squared error. The discussion demonstrates the harmony of the two different approaches by modeling the 365-day TEC map of 2017. Then, in particular, the outputs of the intense geomagnetic storms of 28 May (Dst = − 125 nT) and 8 September (Dst = − 122 nT) are modeled and compared. Bézier curves are read segmental-continuous every 12-h TEC map in all discussions. The network, on the other hand, employs solar wind parameters to model the TEC atlas. The models obey rigorously the causality principle. The results of the discussion display that the R score reaches around 93% and 98.8% for Bézier curves and the neural network, respectively. Again, it is noticed that the mean squared error of the network model decreases to 1.1308 TECU. The curve model emerges to the reader as an alternative to neural networks in projections of space climate conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a model called  LFSPN,  which serves as an extension of stochastic Petri nets dedicated to the multi-agent systems paradigm. The main objective is to specify, verify, validate, and evaluate the flow of materials within an automated production chain. We illustrate the practicality of our model by engaging in a systematic process of modeling and simulation of a production chain involving material flow. To evaluate the performance, we employ a mobile learning agent, which has distinct characteristics, namely mobility and learning. So, the distinctive characteristics of the learning agent are manifested in two key behaviors: mobility and learning. Notably, the learning agent is equipped with a flexible learning algorithm that integrates stochastic elements based on transitions. We suggest using a MATLAB simulation to determine the firing time of each transition within a sequence, guided by three different probability laws (exponential, normal, and log-normal). This sequence is designed to optimize the production process objective while facilitating learning cycles through agent rewards, specified by a production and consumption of tokens in our evolving model. We validate the effectiveness of our model by performing a comparative analysis with similar existing works. The advantages of our  LFSPN  model are twofold. Firstly, it offers a representation with two levels of abstraction: a graph representing the classic components of an SPN, and an additional layer encompassing the learning and migration aspects inherent to a mobile learning agent. Secondly, our model stands out for its flexibility and simulation simplicity.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty in robot dynamic systems is caused by model errors in the dynamic parameters, and accurate identification of the dynamic parameters is essential to improve the control accuracy of the robot. In this paper, a hybrid optimization strategy for modular robot manipulator dynamic model parameter identification is proposed to accurately identify the dynamic parameters of the robot manipulator. Firstly, the robot dynamics model with Coulomb viscous friction is established. Secondly, the cosine adaptive learning and reversal strategies are introduced to improve the genetic algorithm, and the improved genetic optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the excitation trajectories, and all the robot arm joints are commanded to follow the optimized excitation trajectories. In addition, considering that the Coulomb viscous friction model is not sufficient to accurately express the friction terms, a two-step identification method is proposed by analyzing the sensitivity of the parameters of the Stribeck friction model, combining the significantly identified friction coefficients with the quadratically optimized coefficients of the adaptive inverse genetic algorithm, which solves the problem of lower accuracy caused by the inaccuracy of the friction parameter identification. Then, the dynamic parameters are calculated using the least squares method to determine the system dynamics model information. Finally, the parameter identification and load identification are verified using a 6-degree-of-freedom modular robot manipulator, and the proposed hybrid optimization strategy effectively solves the defect of the low accuracy of the robot manipulator dynamics model compared to the dynamics model moment with Coulomb viscous friction, which in turn improves the control accuracy. Meanwhile, the load identification accuracy can reach 97% depending on the identified dynamics information.},

The seller&#39;s credibility is also among the influential factors in selecting a service that is reinforced by advertising. The emergence of the Internet has led to increasing attention by sellers to advertising through online group buying (OGB) platforms. Sellers aim to attract new customers by offering discounts on OGB platforms. In this paper, the seller can sell its service through offline and online channels during two current and future courses. The aim is to determine the optimal strategy for the seller when deciding to join the OGB platform. All parameters of the problem are determined as fuzzy variables. Accordingly, this paper develops a fuzzy mathematical model to simultaneously determine price, service quality, and advertising level in a dual channel supply chain. A cooperative game between the seller and the OGB platform is developed under different refunding and revenue sharing scenarios for the centralized model. The optimal solutions of the problem are then defined using the game and fuzzy sets theories for each scenario. A numerical example is presented to indicate the effectiveness of the theoretical results of the models and developing management insights. In addition, sensitivity analyses also provide the effect of changes in essential parameters on the seller’s decisions.},

It offers characteristics such as fast convergence time, simple and understood algorithm, few parameters, and good stability. To improve its presentation, we propose a differential evolution algorithm based on subpopulation adaptive scale and multi-adjustment strategy (ASMSDE). The algorithm separates the population into three sub-populations based on fitness scores, and different operating tactics are used depending on their characteristics. The superior population uses Gaussian disturbance, while the inferior population uses Levy flights. The intermediate population is responsible for maintaining the population&#39;s overall variety. The sizes of the three sub-populations are adaptively changed in response to evolutionary results to account for changes in individual differences over time. With the number of iterations increases and the disparities between individuals reduce, adopt a single population model instead of multi-population model in the later stage of evolution. The ASMSDE algorithm&#39;s performance is evaluated by comparing it to other sophisticated algorithms that use benchmark function optimizations. Experimental results show that the ASMSDE algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms in the majority of circumstances, demonstrating its effectiveness and capacity to manage local optimum situations.},

  abstract     = {The performance of a deep neural network is affected by its configuration as well as its training process. Determining the configuration of a DNN and training its parameters are challenging tasks due to high-dimensional problems. Therefore, there is a need for methods that can optimize the configuration and parameters of a DNN. Most of the existing DNN optimization research concerns the optimization of DNN parameters, and there are only a few studies discussing the optimization of DNN configuration. In this paper, enhanced harmony search is proposed to optimize the configuration of a fully connected neural network. The proposed harmony search enhancement is conducted by introducing various types of harmony memory consideration rate and various types of harmony memory selection. Four types of harmony memory consideration rate are proposed in this research: constant rate, linear increase rate, linear decrease rate, and sigmoid rate. Two types of harmony memory selection are proposed in this research: rank-based selection and random selection. The combination of types of harmony memory consideration rate and types of selection generates eight harmony search scenarios. The performance of the proposed method is compared to random search and genetic algorithm using 12 datasets of classification problems. The experiment results show that the proposed harmony search outperforms random search in 8 out of 12 problems and approximately has the same performance in 4 problems. Harmony search also outperforms genetic algorithm in five problems, approximately has the same performance in six problems, and has worse performance in one problem. In addition, combining various types of harmony memory consideration rate and rank-based selection increases the performance of the ordinary harmony search. The combination of harmony memory consideration with linear increase rate and rank-based selection performs the best among all combinations. It is better than the ordinary harmony search in seven problems, approximately equal in three problems, and worse in two problems. The results show that the proposed method has some advantages in solving classification problems using a DNN. First, the configuration of the DNN is represented as an optimization problem so that it can be used to find a specific FCNN configuration that is suitable for a specific problem. Second, the approach is a global optimization approach as it tunes the DNN hyperparameter (configuration) as well as the DNN parameter (connection weight). Therefore, it is able to find the best combination of DNN configuration as well as its connection weight. However, there is a need to develop a strategy to balance the hyperparameter tuning and the parameter tuning. Inappropriate balance could lead to a high computational cost. Future research can be directed to balance the hyperparameter and parameter tuning during the solution search.},

  abstract     = {The Chinese postman problem (CPP) is a widely recognized combinatorial optimization problem with numerous real-world applications. Modeling such real-world applications often involves considering uncertain variables. Robust optimization is one of the prominent approaches for solving optimization problems when uncertainties are present in the parameters of the optimization problem. In this paper, we delve into the realm of the uncertain multi-objective Chinese postman problem, incorporating budget constraints while simultaneously optimizing profit maximization and time minimization, all within the framework of robust optimization methodology. We formulate the deterministic form of uncertain multi-objective CPP for three different types of uncertainty sets: ellipsoidal, polyhedral, and budgeted. To tackle these formulations, we employ four established multi-objective solution strategies: the global criteria approach, the fuzzy programming method, $$\epsilon $$ -constraint, and the Genetic algorithm. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to verify the proposed models.},

Measures to effectively intervene in rumors play a crucial role in curbing the spread of rumors. However, government departments have limited resources, and optimizing the intervention of rumors under the premise of conserving resources is valuable research. Therefore, from the government’s perspective, this paper takes the maximization of the effect of rumor intervention and the depreciation of the intervention cost as the decision-making goals. Then, based on the uncertainty of government influence, cost, environmental purification benefit, and other factors, the degree of intervention was used as the decision-making variable to establish an uncertain multi-objective rumor intervention model. In addition, the model is mathematically derived, and its equivalent form is given. Finally, the model’s effectiveness is verified by experimental comparison of different rumor categories and comparison with the classical model. This study provides solid theoretical support for the government to save resources and effectively intervene in spreading of rumors.},

However, the local search phase of the fundamental BWO algorithm has been observed to suffer from low rate of convergence, stemming from its inadequate exploitation capabilities. The aim of this study is to present a hybrid algorithm, called Chaotic Beluga Whale Optimization (CBWO), to bolster the potential of this technique. CBWO combines chaotic behavior to reach a balance between exploration and exploitation, aiming for improved performance. To assess the effectiveness of CBWO, comprehensive evaluation is conducted on 23 common benchmark functions, and a comparative comparison is performed with several existing algorithms to showcase the advantages of the proposed approach. Furthermore, to ascertain its practical utility, CBWO is applied to 11 traditional engineering challenges and the results are compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The findings of these studies show that CBWO demonstrates greater efficiency in optimization, demonstrating quicker and more accurate convergence rates. Specifically, CBWO achieves an average convergence rate improvement of 23% over BWO and outperforms other algorithms by up to 14.8% in terms of solution accuracy. Pseudocode for the CBWO algorithm, enabling easy implementation and understanding, is also presented.

However, PSO suffers from some intrinsic drawbacks, including falling into local optimal and slow convergence in the latter evolution process. To deal with these issues, a hybrid PSO with adaptive learning strategy (abbreviated as HPSO-ALS) is proposed in this paper. To start with, the chaotic opposition-learning method is employed to generate the uniformly distributed particles so as to enhance the quality of the initial swarm. Next, a self-logical mapping-based nonlinear decreasing inertia weight is formulated to trade off the global search and local search abilities. Meanwhile, different adaptive position updating strategies are leveraged to achieve better convergence according to different evolution status. In addition, inspired by the cask effect, the global worst particle (gworst) is introduced into the velocity updating to make full use of the potential information of the particles. Finally, extensive experiments on sixteen benchmark functions and CEC’13 test suite have verified the promising performance of HPSO-ALS proposed in this paper. Alternatively, HPSO-ALS is also applied to the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the experimental results have further validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a classical computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to find the optimal solution. It still suffers somes defects such as poor local search ability, low search accuracy and premature convergence, especially in high-dimensional complex problems. In order to address these issues, this paper has proposed a novel PSO algorithm with distributed delays of adaptive weights and evolved acceleration coefficients (PSO-DWC). The main idea of the proposed improved PSO algorithm is three-fold: (1) a mechanism is introduced to evaluate the current evolutionary state by evolutionary factors of the swarm and to predict the next state by a probability transition matrix; (2) distributed time-varying time-delays are added into the velocity updated model; (3) adaptive inertia weight varies according to evolutionary factors, which describes the population distribution information; and newly-introduced evolved acceleration coefficients are determined by the predict next evolutionary state of the swarm. Owing to the promising issues mentioned above, the PSO-DWC algorithm has the advantages of keeping the diversity of particles, balancing the local and global search abilities and reaching to an acceptable solution. Experiments on twenty well-known benchmark functions have demonstrated that the proposed PSO-DWC algorithm has a superior performance over other five well-known PSO algorithms in high dimensional search space. Statistical significance tests verify the superiority of the new algorithm. Therefore it can be concluded that the novel PSO-DWC algorithm is able to solve the optimization problems with powerful global search and efficient convergence.},

Fermatean fuzzy sets offer a relatively novel and wider alternative by providing the decision-makers with more versatile means of managing the uncertain information throughout the decision-making process. As per our literature survey, no algorithm exists in the literature for fuzzy solid transportation problems with parameters as triangular Fermatean fuzzy numbers. Therefore, in this study, the existing Vogel’s approximation method for the initial basic feasible solution (IBFS) of the traditional transportation problems is extended for the Fermatean fuzzy solid transportation problems. Further, a new method for getting the optimal solution from the obtained IBFS is proposed. The computational complexity and operational efficacy of the proposed algorithm are also discussed. Two application examples have been solved to illustrate the practicality of the proposed algorithm. For the comparative study, the problems are also solved with LINGO 20.0 software. The obtained results of IBFS are found to be significantly lower than those obtained by certain existing methods and the optimal values are comparable with those generated by the LINGO 20.0 optimization solver. Through a comparative analysis, it has been found that the proposed algorithm consistently produces optimal transportation costs for both application examples, adding to the novelty of the proposed work.

  abstract     = {In today&#39;s context, due to the extensive construction projects, there is a surging demand for building stones. Within quarry-based processing facilities, a pivotal aspect influencing the production of these building stones pertains to evaluating the performance of band saw machines, particularly concerning the cutting of these stones. In this context, Maximum Electric Current (MEC) emerges as a critical variable. To identify this crucial factor, it necessitates a comprehensive grasp of the inherent properties of the stone since it profoundly influences costs, equipment depreciation, and production rates. Estimating the MEC poses numerous challenges and complications due to the uncertainty inherent in geological and geotechnical parameters at each point. Conventional and traditional methods, such as numerical, experimental, analytical, and regression methods, have limitations as they often overlook the uncertainty in rock parameters, leading to the construction of simplistic and non-linear models with simplified assumptions in analytical methods that may lack high accuracy. Consequently, this article employs intelligent methods to overcome these challenges and achieve an optimal solution with high accuracy. Using intelligent methods, it becomes possible to create complex and non-linear models efficiently, minimizing both time and cost. Consequently, this study addresses these challenges by employing two optimization algorithms: Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Sine Cosine (SC) Algorithms to estimate MEC specifically in quarry operations. In pursuit of this objective, 120 test samples drawn from 12 distinct types of carbonate rocks obtained from a marble factory in the Mahalat region of Iran were utilized. The considered input parameters encompassed Young&#39;s modulus, Mohs hardness, uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), production rate and F-Schimazek abrasion factors. The dataset was partitioned, allocating 80% (70 data points) for model development and reserving 20% (18 data points) for model validation. The analysis of modeling outcomes involved three statistical criteria: squared correlation coefficient, mean square error, and root mean square error. The results revealed that the developed model demonstrates a high level of accuracy and minimal error, closely approximating real values. Hence, it can serve as a valuable tool for engineers engaged in the field of rock engineering. In a final step, to assess sensitivity and evaluate the model&#39;s output, the @RISK software was employed. The analyses unveiled that among the input parameters within the quarry context, UCS exerts the most substantial influence on the model&#39;s output. Even slight variations in UCS can lead to significant alterations in MEC within quarry operations.},

In a promotion or smear campaign, we see multiple rumors about the target. Many existing works have explored rumor propagation and mitigation in social networks for a single rumor. However, users become biased towards the topic due to multiple rumors about it. A user influenced by the previous rumors about a topic is more likely to believe a rumor with similar content. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the spread of multiple rumors about a topic and formulate an optimization problem to identify the top k rumor spreaders. A Bayesian Inference has been applied to model the user bias caused by multiple rumors based on rumor content and user opinion about the topic. An Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization algorithm has been proposed to determine the top k rumor spreaders, who may be isolated from the network to reduce the impact of the rumors in the OSN.

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are crucial in collecting environmental information through sensor nodes. However, limited energy resources pose a challenge, necessitating efficient routing algorithms to minimize energy consumption. Failure to address issues can consume energy and reduce network lifespan and overall efficiency. This research paper presents a cutting-edge approach for minimizing the consumption of energy within WSN through the implementation of an optimal routing method. The approach involves two steps: first, clustering sensor nodes using the pond skater algorithm (PSA) to select cluster head (CHs) for routing; second, by leveraging the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, this study introduces an innovative technique that empowers a mobile sink to gather packets from given CHs and transmit effectively, send them back to the base station (BS). Notably, the authors make a significant contribution by introducing a different variant of the PSA algorithm to select CH. This novel approach aims to curtail the consumption of energy within WSN significantly. The authors also present an ACO-based head traversal for cluster method, resembling the traveling salesman problem coding, for minimized energy consumption. The study’s primary objectives include reducing energy consumption, minimizing packet delivery ratio, and prolonging the lifetime of the WSN. The assessment efficacy of the proposed method was achieved by regressive simulations using MATLAB on diverse scenarios. Through meticulous comparative analyses with several efficient algorithms, the method proposed here has shown significant performance in network lifetime comparison of PSACO in terms of Alive nodes with number of rounds PSO: 17.65%, GWO: 25%, CS: 33.33%, CBR-ICWSN: 66.66%, CCP-IC: 17.65%.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an innovative multi-objective optimization methodology aiming to address the complex problem of optimal network reconfiguration simultaneously with the allocation of capacitor banks (CBs) and distributed generations (DGs) in a radial distribution system (ONRSACD). Integrating CBs, DGs, and network reconfiguration (NR) in distribution systems enhances power quality and reduces energy costs at distribution substations. Nevertheless, their incorporation poses challenges due to the significant associated investment costs. The proposed approach leverages the hybrid multi-population algorithm (HMPA) to maximize techno-economic benefits and satisfy critical operational constraints to achieve a robust solution. The primary objective is to achieve a good compromise between mutually conflicting costs: substation energy costs and device investment costs. In pursuit of a realistic network behavior model, the method considers the hourly variations of diverse load types and DGs output. To address the inherent multi-objective nature of the problem, the proposed approach seamlessly integrates the fuzzy logic tool. Each objective function is converted into the fuzzy domain using its respective membership function, and upper and lower bounds are determined through a carefully devised strategy. Validation and performance assessment of the proposed methodology are conducted on the 33-bus and 69-bus radial distribution test systems. Additionally, the efficacy of the hybrid multi-population algorithm (HMPA) is benchmarked against several well-established algorithms, including artificial ecosystem-based optimization (AEO), Harris Hawks optimization (HHO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and moth flame optimization (MFO).},

  abstract     = {This study analyzes the conditional gradient method for constrained multiobjective optimization problems, also known as the Frank–Wolfe method. We assume that the objectives are continuously differentiable, and the constraint set is convex and compact. We employ an average-type nonmonotone line search, which takes the average of the recent objective function values. The asymptotic convergence properties without convexity assumptions on the objective functions are established. We prove that every limit point of the sequence of iterates that is obtained by the proposed method is a Pareto critical point. An iteration-complexity bound is provided regardless of the convexity assumption on the objective functions. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is demonstrated by applying it to several benchmark test problems. In addition, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in generating approximations of the entire Pareto front is compared to the existing Hager–Zhang conjugate gradient method, the steepest descent method, the monotone conditional gradient method, and a nonmonotone conditional gradient method. In finding empirical comparison, we utilize two commonly used performance matrices—inverted generational distance and hypervolume indicators.},

  abstract     = {Software testing is an effective means of ensuring software quality. The cost of software testing is the main component of the total cost of software development. The generation of test data is very important in testing, because the efficiency of testing depends on the test data used. A significant part of software testing automation is the test data generation. How to automatically generate test datasets is still an open problem. Search-based software testing (SBST) is a process of generating test data that employs meta-heuristic methods to resolve tough NP-hard problems. The test data generation problem belongs to NP-hard problems. This paper focuses on the automatic generation of test data for path coverage based on control flow criteria in structural testing. Some meta-heuristic algorithms have been used to search for software test data. To advance the efficiency and effectiveness of path test data generation, an adaptive simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (ASAPSO) algorithm is proposed. The probabilistic jumping property of simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is introduced into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to make the particle accept bad solution at a certain probability during the searching process, and therefore boost the capacity of the proposed algorithm to bounce from the local optimum. The fitness function is constructed by the branch function superposition to properly guide the search process. In addition, to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm, an adaptive adjustment scheme based on inertial weight and an adjustment scheme based on learning factor are proposed as well. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectually avoid premature convergence and effectively upgrades the efficiency of generating test data automatically. It is also competitive in solving other complicated optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Marine predators algorithm (MPA) is one of the recently proposed metaheuristic algorithms. In the MPA, position update mechanisms are implemented, emphasizing global search in the first part of the search process, balanced search in the middle, and local search in the last part. This may adversely affect the local search capability of the algorithm in the first part of the search process and the global search capability in the last part of the search process. To overcome these issues, an algorithm called MultiPopMPA with a multi-population and multi-search strategy is proposed in this study. Thanks to the proposed algorithm, local, balanced, and global search strategies of the original MPA were utilized from the beginning to the end of the search process. Thus, it is aimed to contribute to a more detailed search of the parameter space. In this study, the proposed algorithm has been applied in training artificial neural networks for 21 different classification datasets. The success of the algorithm has been scored on precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score metrics and compared with eight different metaheuristic algorithms, including the original MPA. In terms of the mean rank of success, the proposed MultiPopMPA has been ranked first in precision, sensitivity, and F1-score metrics and ranked second in the specificity metric. In addition, it has been observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms its competitors in most cases in terms of convergence and stability. Finally, Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test results calculated through the MSE metric showed that the proposed algorithm produced statistically significant results in most cases.},

However, in the traditional workshop scheduling considering workers, these behaviours are ignored, resulting in inaccurate scheduling schemes. Therefore, this paper investigates a multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem considering worker behaviours (WBFJSP) with makespan, total energy consumption and total cost. First, a multi-objective optimization model is established according to the characteristics of WBFJSP. In this model, the learning–forgetting–fatigue–recovery model about processing time is established. Then, an enhanced teaching–learning-based optimization (ETLBO) is proposed. In order to enhance the search ability of the algorithm, each component of ETLBO is designed separately. In the initialization phase, four heuristics are proposed to enhance the diversity of the initial population. In teaching stage, a dynamically adjusted teaching method is proposed to achieve exploration and exploitation. In teacher self-study stage, three local search strategies are proposed to improve the quality of the solution. Finally, the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed ETLBO are verified by extensive experiments.},

In PSO-RPE, we present memory enhancement technology to direct the evolution of particles and accelerate the search process for the solution. Next, our PSO-RPE strategy employs a customized linear dynamic equation to balance the global and local search capabilities. Moreover, the elite strategy is applied to produce better feasible parameters with high probability. Moreover, the analysis of the convergence on 12 benchmarks is given to verify the superiority of PSO-RPE.

  abstract     = {The traveling salesperson problem (TSP) is one of the most iconic hard optimization tasks. With frequency fitness assignment (FFA), a new approach to optimization has recently been proposed: instead of directing the search towards better solutions, the optimization process prefers those with rarely encountered objective values. FFA can be plugged into existing algorithms and can improve their performance on some problems that are hard for them. However, problems like the TSP, where the number of possible objective values (here: tour lengths) is high, cause the performance of FFA-based algorithms to deteriorate. We choose 56 symmetric instances from TSPLib as a testbed for our experiments. We plug FFA both into the (1+1) EA and simulated annealing (SA) and obtain the FEA and FSA, respectively. We find that the resulting FEA substantially outperforms the (1+1) EA and that FSA can reach the global optima more often than SA within our computational budget. We propose two ways to hybridize FFA and traditional optimization in a round-robin scheme where objective function evaluations are alternatingly assigned to both components. The FFA-based parts of the algorithms sometimes send a solution over to the traditional-optimization-based ones. This can lead to further performance improvements. In particular, the hybrids combining simulated annealing with the FEA solve most problems and find close-to-optimal solutions on other instances. Even for several instances with many possible different objective values, which are therefore not suited to FFA, hybrids combining FFA and traditional objective-guided optimization algorithms can offer substantial performance improvements.},

The performance optimization of these queueing networks has been the subject of several studies. The present study extends the minimization of the total buffer area and overall service rates in the network simultaneously with the maximization of throughput. It is well known that these three objectives are conflicting. This fact leads to a multi-objective approach that the literature in the area has already addressed. Nevertheless, this study aims to demonstrate that there are algorithms with low computational costs that can produce solutions more efficiently than those obtained previously. Furthermore, the provided solutions can enhance throughput by solving a stochastic knapsack problem. The greedy procedure utilizes a technique of redistributing buffers between the queues, ensuring that the overall capacity is less than or equal to the previous overall capacity; thus, one objective is improved (the throughput) without compromising the other objective (total buffer allocation). Several computational experiments attest to the quality of this proposition. In addition, we provide a comparison with previously proposed solutions.},

The performance of the proposed FDBAEO_OBL algorithm is tested in two different experimental studies. In the first experimental study, the proposed approach is tested in the CEC2020 benchmark test functions and the FDBAEO algorithm, which included the best OBL approach, is determined using non-parametric Wilcoxon and Friedman statistical analysis methods. Second, the parameters of proportional integral derivative (PID), tilt integral derivative (TID), proportional integral derivative with filter (PIDF), tilt integral derivative with filter (TIDF), fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FOPID), fractional-order proportional integral derivative with filter (FOPIDF), proportional integral derivative with fractional-order filter (PIDFF) and fractional-order proportional integral derivative with fractional-order filter (FOPIDFF) controller structures to be used in DC motor closed loop speed control are determined with FDBAEO_OBL, and the performances of the controllers are investigated. Integral absolute error (IAE), integral time absolute error (ITAE), integral time squared error (ITSE) and integral squared error (ISE) performance indices are used as the objective function of the operation process in which the control parameters are determined. According to the comparative step response results of the controller structures, the four best controller structures for DC motor speed regulation are determined. The performances of these controllers are examined under different simulation conditions and according to the results obtained, it is seen that the best controller structure is FOPIDFF. The FDBAEO_OBL algorithm, which is used in both benchmark test functions and DC motor speed regulation, shows an effective, durable and superior performance in finding the optimal solution values during the optimization.},

Remanufacturing laptops to extend their useful life is viewed as the best End-Of-Life (EOL) alternative considering environmental and social factors. This paper develops a model to decide the best EOL option, namely reuse, conditional repair, and disposal of quality-graded laptop parts, with economic and environmental objectives. The first objective is to maximize the profit of remanufactured laptops over a multi-period planning horizon. The second objective is to minimize the emissions associated with remanufacturing. A Multi-Objective Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (MODPSO) algorithm and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are embedded as a decision support tool in Microsoft Excel with a user interface to yield Pareto optimal solutions, and the results are compared. The Taguchi approach is applied to find the optimum value of the control parameters of the proposed algorithms. The approach is tested with inputs from an authorized remanufacturer in Bangalore, India. The performance of the algorithms is further investigated using randomly generated test problems. The MODPSO algorithm provided better solutions for all problem instances based on the convergence and diversity metrics. The inclusion of conditional repair options and parts with low and medium-quality grades in remanufacturing leads to higher profit, albeit with more emissions. A variation in the quality grade assigned to the conditional repair option for the parts needed for higher profit margin laptops is observed. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to observe the impact of supply, demand, repair cost, shortage cost, and emissions on the two extreme Pareto solutions. The decision-making tool offers a continuum of trade-offs to help a remanufacturer choose the EOL options, depending on economic and environmental performance preferences.},

The identity of a teenager is a different combination of thoughts, beliefs, and abilities that are obtained by him. He communicates with other people in society and tries to use the positive or negative feedback from these social interactions to shape his identity and become an independent person. Mathematical simulation of how adolescents’ personality is formed during the mentioned process causes the emergence of this algorithm. The purpose of this research is to improve the performance of the AISA algorithm in the balance between exploration and exploitation. This algorithm isn’t trapped in the optimal local points due to the appropriate convergence rate and reaches the universal optimal answer quickly. One of the features of this algorithm that we can mention is its simplicity and having few setting parameters. To show the effectiveness of this algorithm, results of solving two types of problems of mathematical functions and practical examples such as large-scale truss 120, 244, 942, and 72-bar truss, are measured by other similar algorithms. The results show that this algorithm has a good performance in the optimal solution of such problems, compared to other similar algorithms.},

This innovative method blends the flexible mechanics of the boosting techniques from the SAMME algorithm, which is a multi-class classifier, and the Ada.C2 algorithm, which is a cost-sensitive binary classifier that is designed to address highly imbalanced classes.

  abstract     = {Computational intelligence (CI) has become one of the most useful and successful tools for dealing with uncertainties and complex problems in many fields, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and swarm intelligence, artificial intelligence, risk management, financial monitoring, etc. With the development of CI, abundant publications have arisen related to many research directions and hotspots. Based on the technical support from bibliometrics and the corresponding approach as well as the content analysis, this study conducts a science mapping analysis and a coherent knowledge picture of the research field in CI. The research contributes to clear future development trends and provides more ideas for scholars in this field. First, this paper focuses on the fundamental characteristics of CI publications, including annual numbers, term co-occurrence, and hot research directions, as the preliminary exploration of this field. Then, according to the widely used core database, i.e., Web of Science (WoS), and the technologies of software, VOS viewer, and CiteSpace, the productive institutions, authors, and journals are explored. Next, the corresponding internal characteristics of the CI research are analyzed, including the citation features of countries/regions, institutions, journals and authors. Furthermore, to analyze the development trend of research hotspots, the keywords of all CI publications are studied: (a) classifying them into three phases in chronological order aimed; (b) implementing the burst detection algorithm to intuitively reflect the scientific research in the field of CI. Finally, this paper provides a relatively throughout perspective for the CI articles and reviews and discloses the future development trend, which will help the scholars interested in this area conduct deep research. We conclude this bibliometric overview with the limitations and recommendations for future research in the field of CI.},

  abstract     = {The saccade is one of the eye movements that resulted in the creation of the saccadic model. This work is grounded in the basic principles of the saccadic system, which are burst neurons and a resettable integrator model. Considering the possibility of strengthening the saccadic model based on its fundamental model, we introduce a replacement function for use in the burster equation that explains the preservation of the on response’s form and also considers the off response. The new model is a two-dimensional map containing slow and fast variables with a new burster function, which solves the lack of differentiability of the primary function at the equilibrium point. By applying time series approaches and phase portraits, the mechanisms underlying the generation of spikes and spike bursts in the behavior of the new model are revealed. The present research’s other main focus is to determine the geometry of the slow manifold for the newly developed system. Specifically, we examine the dynamics around an equilibrium point and the geometry of a slow manifold by using Fenichel’s theorem. In addition, we use the center manifold theory to describe some dynamical characteristics of the center manifold that the slow manifold matches. Finally, this study aims to figure out the effects of geometric singular perturbations on this fast-slow burster equation, which finds dynamical behaviors such as being uniformly asymptotically stable and locally attractive.},

  abstract     = {Our study presents a novel method for analyzing biological sequences, utilizing Pairwise Amino Acid Composition and Amino Acid physicochemical properties to construct a feature vector. This step is pivotal, as by utilizing pairwise analysis, we consider the order of amino acids, thereby capturing subtle nuances in sequence structure. Simultaneously, by incorporating physicochemical properties, we ensure that the hidden information encoded within amino acids is not overlooked. Furthermore, by considering both the frequency and order of amino acid pairs, our method mitigates the risk of erroneously clustering different sequences as similar, a common pitfall in older methods. Our approach generates a concise 48-member vector, accommodating sequences of arbitrary lengths efficiently. This compact representation retains essential amino acid-specific features, enhancing the accuracy of sequence analysis. Unlike traditional approaches, our algorithm avoids the introduction of sparse vectors, ensuring the retention of important information. Additionally, we introduce fuzzy equivalence relationships to address uncertainty in the clustering process, enabling a more nuanced and flexible clustering approach that captures the inherent ambiguity in biological data. Despite these advancements, our algorithm is presented in a straightforward manner, ensuring accessibility to researchers with varying levels of computational expertise. This enhancement improves the robustness and interpretability of our method, providing researchers with a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for biological sequence analysis.},

Along with coverage probabilities, the asymptotic confidence and highest posterior credible (HPD) intervals are also obtained. Tierney–Kadane’s approximation and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used for Bayesian computations. To compare the performance of estimators, a Monte Carlo simulation study is performed.

The observed data may be imprecise owing to some unexpected situation. In this case, the decision-makers may treat the observed data to be fuzzy data by providing suitable membership functions. However, the determination of those membership functions is frequently subjective for the different decision-makers. To avoid this biased subjectivity raised by the decision-makers, this paper proposes a mechanical procedure to generate fuzzy data. The essence of this mechanical procedure is to propose an extended form to generate a fuzzy set from a pre-determined family. This extended form is based on two functions, such that the conventional form can be covered when these these two functions are taken to be the identity functions. One of these two functions is adopted to rearrange the pre-determined family to be a nested family. A more general form is also proposed by considering a countable subfamily.},

Two types particularly studied are Hadamard-type fractional calculus and tempered fractional calculus. This paper establishes a connection between these two types by expressing one in terms of the other, using the theory of fuzzy fractional calculus with respect to functions. By naturally extending this connection, a generalization is developed that unifies several existing fractional operators, including Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, $$\psi $$ -Caputo, classical Hadamard, Hadamard-type, tempered, and all these operators considered with respect to functions via the Hadamard $$\psi $$ -Caputo tempered fractional derivative (CTFD) using the Mittag-Leffler function. In addition, we explore the Cauchy problem for fuzzy fractional differential equations (FDEs) with this kind of derivative and demonstrate various results of existence and uniqueness using fixed-point theorems of Krasnoselskii, Schaüder’s, and Banach. Applications further serve as proof of the utility of our findings, which converge, expand, and generalize several previously reported results in research.},

We have shown that the crisp deterministic automata with fuzzy rough outputs and fuzzy rough languages, along with their morphisms, respectively, form categories CDAFRO and FRL. We have also shown the existence of a functor between the categories CDAFRO and FRL. The categorical concepts of product and coproduct of a subfamily of object-class, equalizer, and coequalizer of a pair of parallel morphisms in category CDAFRO are studied.

Therefore, this paper firstly deeply discusses the expression of neighborhood dependence in the three-layer granularity structure of neighborhood decision system, as well as its relationship in three levels and some related properties. Secondly, considering the influence of the fixed neighborhood radius(Nr) on the neighborhood model, we define the adaptive neighborhood radius by using the standard deviation and the neighborhood mean. Finally, we use the neighborhood dependence at the macro top level as the split node measurement function to construct the decision tree. Our experimental results show the reliability of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to discuss algebraic rough set and its relationships with convex space, rough set and generalized neighborhood space. Specifically, the notion of algebraic relations is introduced and a pair of lower approximation operator and upper approximation operator are presented. Then, several conditions of algebraic relations such as seriality, reflexivity, (resp., weak, primitive) symmetry and (resp., strong) transitivity are characterized by algebraic approximation operators. Based on this, relationships among algebraic rough sets, convex structures and generalized neighborhood systems are investigated. It is proved that the category of reflexive and transitive algebraic rough spaces is isomorphic to the category of convex spaces. In particular, the category of reflexive, weakly symmetric and transitive algebraic rough spaces is isomorphic to the category of convex matroids and the category of reflexive, weakly symmetric and transitive algebraic generalized neighborhood spaces.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that integrate information control devices with physical resources, which can be automatically and formalized verified by model checking according to the expected requirements in the formal specification. The counterexamples in model checking are witnesses to the violation of the specification properties of the system and can provide important diagnostic information for debugging, controlling, and synthesizing CPS. Designing a rational specification language for CPS and generating effective counterexamples allows security vulnerabilities to be detected and addressed early in the system development. However, CPS involve frequent interactions between cyber and physical systems and often operate in unreliable environments, which poses new challenges for comprehensive modeling and designing specification languages for CPSs with discrete, continuous, time, probabilistic, and concurrent behaviors. Moreover, finding the smallest counterexample of CPS with probabilistic behavior in the shortest possible time has been identified as a Non-Deterministic Polynomial-complete (NP-complete) problem. Although a number of heuristics have been devised to address this challenge, the accuracy and efficiency of the solved counterexamples need to be improved due to the difficulty in determining the heuristic functions. We first provide a comprehensive model for CPS by introducing the Hybrid Probabilistic Time Labeled Transition System (HPTLTS). Subsequently, we design a specification language HPTLTS Temporal Logic (HPTLTS-TL) that can describe the properties of CPS. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm CACO-A, which combines the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm and the A-algorithm to efficiently generate the counterexample of CPS, which is represented as the diagnostic subgraph. Finally, we discuss a typical CPS example to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

  abstract     = {The uncertain impacts of climate changes on the crop water requirements disarrange the on-farm balance of water supply and demand, thus here needs to adapt a cropping pattern to sustain the Northwestern China Agro-system. Balancing the fluctuations of on-farm available water associated with the uncertainty of crops water requirements could be considered as a complex optimization model. Since the classical optimization models exhibited many problems on the farm studies, e.g., the lack of accurate information, the applied limitations, and short-time accuracy, this study has utilized the fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS). The part of this challenge is back to estimating the sum of water use based on the crops water requirements which resulted from assuming a resilience characteristic to adapt the crops with the water resource capacity under uncertain climatic changes. This study aimed to develop a methodology for operationalizing a coequality approach to balance the crop water requirement with on-farm available water and how selection of the regional suitable crops has been defined. The results of this methodology showed that agriculture sustainability in this region is achieved by planting the irrigated crops whose crop coefficients range from 0.39 to 0.64 which adapted their water demand to the water resources capacity under uncertain conditions. The optimal range of crop coefficients achieved based on this fuzzy-probabilistic approach can be the reference point of water allocation in this irrigation district, since they also are investigated based on the economic factors that are a kind of crop-pattern for sustaining the balance of water supply and demand. This cropping pattern will be a helpful government policy for the sustainability of the Gansu Provinceis the conversion factor, the Agro-system.},

A high-precision spectral numerical method is employed for the solution of the stability problem. By inspecting the neutral curves and conducting the energy analysis, it is shown that flows corresponding to both solutions are susceptible to linear instability triggered by Tollmien–Schlichting waves, particularly at large Reynolds numbers. However, the flow corresponding to the first solution achieves instability at higher Reynolds numbers in comparison to the flow corresponding to the second solution. The study shows that suction stabilizes the flow corresponding to the first solution. However, a reverse trend is observed for the flow corresponding to the second solution. These results are further corroborated through the energy analysis. An elevation in growth rates is observed by increasing suction for the second solution. In contrast, growth rates for the first solution diminish upon elevating suction.},

  abstract     = {The enormous growth of data requires a large amount of storage space in the cloud server, which occupies mostly by the redundant data. The deduplication technique avoids redundancy to utilize cloud storage effectively. Chunking is the process to break the data into chunks, and determine duplicates. Many algorithms exist, to handle the deduplication efficiency, reducing the chunk variance, and improving the computational overhead continue to be a challenging task. To solve the above challenge, we propose a smart chunker (SC) algorithm, which operates with hybrid chunking based on file size as file-level and content-defined chunking (CDC). File-level chunking is assigned only for less than 2 KB file size, and the exceeding file size falls with CDC. We aim optimus prime chunking (OPC) in CDC to break the chunks with prime numbers and involves a minimum number of comparisons with fewer conditions and low computation overhead. This work reduces the processing time without hash and window for computation. Thus, it provides a constant average chunk size to distribute the equal chunk variance in the cloud storage with a 17% reduction in chunk time. Our OPC result attains high throughput of more than 3.3 $$\times $$ , compared to other CDC algorithms.},

In traditional medical practice, physicians have to manually test and classify areas which are suspected to be cancerous. However, the literature strongly indicates that the manual segmentation process performed by medical practitioners is neither time efficient nor accurate, as it relies on their subjective judgment. This paper introduces a model called residual attention neural network breast cancer classification (RANN-BCC) to help medical practitioners in the cancer diagnostic process. RANN-BCC utilizes residual neural network (ResNet) as an expert-supportive method to aid medical practitioners in cancer diagnosis. The implementation of RANN-BCC can support the classification of whole slide imaging (WSI) into non-IDC and IDC without prior information about the presence of a cancerous lesion. The classification results demonstrate that the RANN-BCC model has achieved 92.45% accuracy, 0.98 recall, 0.91 precision, and 0.94 F-score which has outperformed other models such as CNN, AlexNet, Residual Neural Network 34 (ResNet34), and Feed-Forward Neural Network.

However, existing encryption techniques have focused on intra-block variations to improve security and largely ignored the impact of inter-block variations. Inter-block variations are critical because they ensure that the encryption of a block is affected by its internal variation and also by the variations of all its previous blocks. This can significantly increase the confusion and the technique’s ability to resist security attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid technique that addresses the weaknesses of existing techniques by combining both intra- and inter-block variations to greatly improve security. The proposed technique uses chaotic systems to increase confusion and conceal the key. It also incorporates fuzzy encoding and distortion methods that use both inter- and intra-block variations to further strengthen security. The technique was rigorously evaluated using state-of-the-art testing tools. The evaluation showed that the technique is effective because it passed the randomness tests with a high rate that exceeds the threshold for effective techniques, and it has an execution time that is better than state-of-the-art techniques.},

A new weighted travel time function, that can handle more influence factors compared with the traditional travel time functions, is presented. In addition, a novel determination method of the weight coefficients of the presented function based on fuzzy soft set, dealing well with uncertainty and fuzziness, is proposed. Then, a user equilibrium assignment embedding the weighted travel time function is formulated. The validity and superiority of the weighted travel time function, that two typical travel time functions are used as the components, in the actual travel time estimation are validated. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), maximum absolute relative error (MARE), mean squared error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) indicate that the proposed travel time function has the superior estimating performance. The corresponding user equilibrium assignment are validated by an example related to a medium-size network. Link flow patterns and average travel time at equilibrium of the network are also investigated in the numerical example.},

However, traditional methods for data transmission through compression and decompression process usually require large input data arrays to be assigned. Therefore, a long computational time is unavoidable so that it may affect system performance efficiency significantly. Therefore, an elevator vibration and loading data collection system was developed using simple compression encoding mechanism. First, in Data Acquisition Unit, the signal-acquiring microprocessor is used for data acquisition through Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus. Second, in Data Storage Unit, the collected data from the signal-acquiring microprocessor is compressed and transmitted to the signal-processing microprocessor. Third, in Monitor Unit, the elevator analysis tool is developed to analyze the vibration data, which can be viewed directly from APP. Experimental results demonstrated that the restored data are consistent with the results measured from the standard instrument. The proposed hexadecimal compression process can make the data transmission mechanism simple, but two times faster than that using traditional way without compression. Consequently, the demanded memory capacity for signal transmission can be therefore reduced considerably.},

Increasing payload capacity leads to diminishing both stego image quality and security. Conversely, a high stego image quality and a high security cannot be obtained without compromising payload capacity. It has become essential but increasingly challenging to achieve a balance between these image steganography requirements. The direction of recent contributions in the area of image steganography can be classified into two different approaches. The first approach is the development of techniques based on embedding efficiency in which the secret message hides while minimizing the embedding distortion in the cover image. The second approach is the development of techniques based on distortion function related to statistical detectability in which the secret message conceals in certain parts of the cover image determined by the defined distortion function such as textured or noisy regions. This study aims to provide the insight for the researchers about future works and pave away for them to design efficient steganography techniques. It practically analyzes and investigates which of the two approaches can attain all the requirements of image steganography simultaneously. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale benchmark dataset which demonstrate that increasing the embedding efficiency reflects on increasing stego image quality as well as security without compromising payload capacity. The experimental findings reveal that the virtual designed steganography technique, LSB_EE_20, achieved the optimum results, with an embedding efficiency of 20, a PRNR of 62, and a message detectability of 0.11%. Consequently, this paper recommends that the researchers in this area concentrate on developing embedding techniques in which the embedding efficiency increases rather than focusing on distortion function.},

  abstract     = {Due to the severe COVID-19 pandemic, securing and processing patient’s health data for decision-making is challenging. The proposed study introduces an edge computing-assisted hybrid deep learning mechanism to mitigate this issue. Initially, the first layer in a proposed framework collects the input images and forwards them to the edge layer. Here, several edge devices are deployed, and COVID-19 disease detection is performed through a new hybrid attention capsule autoencoder (HA_CAE). Finally, the samples are securely stored in the cloud layer, in which the reliability of patient information is increased. The simulation analysis shows that the proposed model gains higher detection performance, like accuracy (99.1%), precision (97.6%), sensitivity (98.9%), specificity (96.8%), F1-score (98.2%), and MCC (97.6%).},

However, most deep learning models require computational resources that are not available in smartphones or edge devices; an issue that can be faced by means of compact models that require less resources than standard deep learning models. The problem with such models is that they are, at least usually, less accurate than bigger models. We propose to address the accuracy limitation of compact networks with the application of semi-supervised learning techniques. In particular, we perform a thorough comparison of self-training methods, consistency regularisation techniques, and quantization techniques. We present a thorough analysis for the results obtained by combining 11 compact networks and 6 semi-supervised processes when applied to 10 biomedical datasets. Namely, combining semi-supervised methods and compact networks, we can create compact models that are not only as accurate as standard size models, but also faster and lighter. In addition, we have developed a Python library to facilitate the combination of compact networks and semi-supervised learning methods to tackle image classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis and detection in electrical power systems need a development of new and robust supervision structures. In the last years, different intelligent monitoring methods have been successfully proposed to deal with the problem of fault diagnosis in power transmission lines. In this work, a new hybrid strategy called FFT-FL combining Fuzzy Logic (FL) approach with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed and applied to fault diagnosis in power line network. The elaborated fault detection structure consists of indicating whether the electrical transmission is working correctly or a fault has occurred with an effective isolation step to determine the faulty zone in the line. Whereas, an identification step consists of determining faulty phase thus fault classification in the studied line network. The novel proposed algorithm (FFT-FL) is used to improve the fault diagnosis response time and to decouple between faults and disturbances. In this paper, a comparative study is presented between the two intelligent methods for detection, isolation and identification of faults using only FL and the hybrid FFT-FL structure. The obtained simulation results verify the effectiveness and the correctness of the proposed fault method for all types of faults in the power line networks and in different zones.},

To tackle these challenges, a novel unsupervised UAV image matching network called USuperGlue is developed, which leverages local self-attention. The aim is to enhance the precision and recall of the matching process. To achieve this, a local self-attention module is designed to specialize each feature point at the end of the encoding, thereby further improving the matching precision. Subsequently, the encoded features are decoded to extract scores, keypoints, and feature descriptors. During the feature matching stage, an unsupervised matching network is constructed using SuperGlue, a graph neural network that incorporates multi-head attention, to match the feature descriptors of image pairs. The experiment conducted training of the unsupervised network using the Drone dataset and COCO dataset. The simulation results demonstrate that the trained USuperGlue model achieves superior precision and recall, making it a highly effective solution for UAV image matching.},

  abstract     = {The electric power system must supply energy with quality, security, and reliability. However, the system can operate close to its critical limits due to environmental or economic reasons. Under these circumstances, voltage instability problems, which have been the cause of several significant blackouts worldwide in the last two decades, are prone to happen due to increasing power demand. For this reason, guaranteeing an acceptable voltage security margin is crucial for a safe and reliable power system operation. Over the years, many studies have been made to identify and control voltage instability problems, where voltage stability margin is a parameter used to identify these problems, calculated through continuation power flow. Besides that, to prevent or correct these problems, preventive or corrective controls may be used, such as capacitor switching, for example. Within this context, this paper proposes a method capable of defining a list of capacitor sets that mitigate the criticality of a set of contingencies and maximize the voltage stability margin of the power system under analysis as its main contribution. A continuation power flow embedded in a binary differential evolution algorithm calculates the voltage stability margin. This margin is optimized by selecting capacitor banks to be switched on/off after the contingency. The output of the method can be presented in a suitable format to the system operator, enabling fast choices of corrective control actions after detecting a contingency in real-time operation.},

  abstract     = {Brain connectivity measures the relationship between brain regions that occur in response to a task (task-related) or in resting state (intrinsic). Although differences in resting-state connectivity are frequently attributed to task-related brain activity, there is currently no valid criterion for directly evaluating task-related connectivity from signal data. This study aims to establish a fuzzy index based on fuzzy Subsethood (FSH) measure for estimating task-related connectivity. First, two sets of simulated time series with linear and nonlinear interactions were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The results of FSH method on simulated data indicate that the fuzzy Subsethood criterion could identify and estimate task-related connectivity. Afterward, an EEG dataset with an SSVEP task in a mobile BCI system was used to test the approach using real-world data. To address the volume conduction effect and the problem of fake connectivity, the signals were first mapped into the domain of independent components using the Fourier-ICA algorithm, and brain connectivity among brain sources was investigated. The FSH approach was then used to estimate task-related connectivity, and a pattern recognition algorithm was used to determine stimulus frequency. The results demonstrated that the FSH approach is robust when modifying the user&#39;s speed. Furthermore, at a speed of 2 m/s, the FSH approach significantly outperformed the standard CCA method (79.48% vs. 55%, respectively; p value = 0.0075). Based on the findings, it is possible to conclude that the FSH index is a suitable measure for estimating task-related connectivity.},

  abstract     = {The degradation state of a bearing can be monitored effectively by using a wear indicator (WI). A WI curve having smoothness and monotonicity can lay a good foundation for predicting the remaining useful life of the bearing. Most traditional models for bearing WI construction, such as time–frequency indicators and signal decomposition, are complicated; for example, some WI construction models need several models to select from, and their fusion depends on the manual experience of engineers. For example, single and mixed traditional time–frequency indicators, such as the root mean square (RMS), Kurtosis, multiple time–frequency domain fusion. However, the mentioned-above time–frequency domain indicators are difficult to adaptively reflect the operating status of the equipment when the operating conditions of the mechanical system change. Some signal decomposition models are combined with other models and rely on manual experience to extract WI, such as the selection of effective intrinsic mode function components function, parameter setting of empirical mode decomposition and ensemble empirical mode decomposition model, etc. Deep learning models, such as stacked auto encoder (SAE) and convolution neural network, have been widely used in bearing health monitoring and WI construction, because its powerful learning and feature extraction capabilities of multiple hidden layer structures. But these deep learning models are designed to use output labels. Particularly when the data volume is large, it requires manpower, material resources, and experienced engineers to label the data, or it is difficult to label and distinguish the categories of data samples. Therefore, to solve these problems and eliminate the need for manual labor, such as labeling data and selecting models for fusion, we propose using SAE without an output label layer to extract WI from original signals directly. However, an extracted WI curve without good monotonicity (Mon) will result in a poor remaining useful life prediction accuracy. To improve the monotonicity of the extracted WI and reduce the complexity of the WI construction model, we propose an unsupervised enhanced SAE without an output layer, named SINSAE, by adding a sine function of an average value which is calculated form start time to current at each hidden layer to eliminate concussion. Moreover, to demonstrate that our proposed model is better than other models, such as the RMS, Kurtosis, multiple time–frequency domain fusion, SAE, SAE without an output layer, and signal decomposition models, the Mon indicator in this study is used to compare the monotonicity of the extracted WI. Lastly, the results of our experiments using different bearing datasets and various working conditions show that the smoothness and monotonicity of the WI curve extracted by the SINSAE is better than that of other models. Moreover, compared to the traditional commonly used single and multiple time–frequency domain indicators, supervised deep learning and basic unsupervised deep models, the unsupervised SINSAE model can increase the Mon indicators from [0.1, 0.8], [0.02, 0.1], [0.1, 0.8] to above 0.9, respectively.},

In MOBO, weight vectors are used for scalarizing MO functions, typically employed to convert MO optimization into single-objective optimization. The weight vectors at each round of MOBO are generally obtained using either stochastic (random sampling) or deterministic methods based on searched results. To clarify the effect of both the scalarizing methods on MOBO, we examine the effectiveness of random sampling methods versus two deterministic methods: reference-vector-based and self-organizing map-based decomposition methods. Experimental results from four test functions and a hydrogen storage material database as a concrete application show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the random sampling method.

  abstract     = {Data recorded from monitoring the health condition of industrial equipment are often high-dimensional, nonlinear, nonstationary and characterised by high levels of uncertainty. These factors limit the efficiency of machine learning techniques to produce desirable results when developing effective fault classification frameworks. This paper sought to propose a hybrid artificial intelligent predictive maintenance model based on Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) optimised by the combination of Coupled Simulated Annealing and Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation algorithms (ICEEMDAN-PCA-LSSVM). Here, ICEEMDAN was first employed as a denoising technique to decompose signals into a series of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) of which only relevant IMFs containing the relevant fault features were retained for signal reconstruction. PCA was then employed as a dimension reduction technique through which the resulting set of uncorrelated features extracted served as input for LSSVM for classifying various fault types. The proposed technique is compared with three established methods [Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)] with multiclass classification capabilities. The various techniques were tested on an experimental UCI machine learning benchmark data obtained from multi-sensors of a hydraulic test rig. The results from the analysis revealed that the proposed ICEEMDAN-PCA-LSSVM technique is versatile and outperformed all the compared classifiers in terms of accuracy, error rate and other evaluation metrics considered. The proposed hybrid technique drastically reduced the redundancies and the dimension of features, allowing for the efficient consideration of relevant features for the enhancement of classification accuracy and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {The precise estimation of the shear strength of reinforced concrete walls is critical for structural engineers. This projection, nevertheless, is exceedingly complicated because of the varied structural geometries, plethora of load cases, and highly nonlinear relationships between the design requirements and the shear strength. Recent related design code regulations mostly depend on experimental formulations, which have a variety of constraints and establish low prediction accuracy. Hence, different soft computing techniques are used in this study to evaluate the shear capacity of reinforced concrete walls. In particular, developed models for estimating the shear capacity of concrete walls have been investigated, based on experimental test data accessible in the relevant literature. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, the integrated genetic algorithms, and the integrated particle swarm optimization methods were used to optimize the fuzzy model’s membership function range and the results were compared to the outcomes of random forests (RF) model. To determine the accuracy of the models, the results were assessed using several indices. Outliers in the anticipated data were identified and replaced with appropriate values to ensure prediction accuracy. The comparison of the resulting findings with the relevant experimental data demonstrates the potential of hybrid models to determine the shear capacity of reinforced concrete walls reliably and effectively. The findings revealed that the RF model with RMSE = 151.89, MAE = 111.52, and $${R}^2$$ = 0.9351 has the best prediction accuracy. Integrated GAFIS and PSOFIS performed virtually identically and had fewer errors than ANFIS. The sensitivity analysis shows that the thickness of the wall $$({b_\mathrm{{w}}})$$ and concrete compressive strength $$({f_\mathrm{{c}}})$$ have the most and the least effects on shear strength, respectively.},

Because CNN tends to understand local information and ignores the overall characteristics. This paper proposes a Capsule Network with Two-Way Attention MechanismTWACapsNet for short) for the SER problem. TWACapsNet accepts the spatial and spectral features as inputs, and the convolutional layer and the capsule layer are deployed to process these two types of features in two ways separately. After that, two attention mechanisms are designed to enhance the information obtained from the spatial and spectral features. Finally, the results of these two ways are combined to form the final decision. The advantage of TWACapsNet is verified by experiments on multiple SER data sets, and experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the widely-deployed neural network models on three typical SER data sets. Furthermore, the combination of the two ways contributes to the higher and more stable performance of TWACapsNet.},

  abstract     = {Relay node placement with a hop count bound is a crucial problem in enhancing connectivity, lifetime, and reliability in multi-hop wireless sensor networks. However, existing approaches focus solely on minimizing the number of used relay nodes without considering the energy consumption among nodes. This work investigates a relay node placement problem in multi-hop wireless sensor networks with two objectives: minimize the number of used relay nodes, and minimize the maximum node energy consumption to prolong the network’s lifetime while still ensuring the network’s connectivity. In particular, we consider a hop count bound as a delay constraint to elevate the network’s reliability. We propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called GPrim to solve our problem. The algorithm is a combination of edge-set encoding and NSGA-II framework. Leveraging problem-specific properties, we introduce objective-oriented heuristics incorporated into initialization, crossover, and mutation operators to improve the algorithm’s convergence. Simulation results on 3D datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than existing algorithms on all measured metrics.},

The proposed method is based on application-specific convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. DiagCovidPNA is a four-class (i.e., COVID-19, normal lung, bacterial PNA, and viral PNA) diagnostic method that is offered in two different systems: (1) DiagCovidPNA and (2) Hybrid DiagCovidPNA. In the first system, a single CNN is used to classify the input images into four classes. In the second system, to further differentiate bacterial and viral PNAs more, the input images are classified into four classes using a combination of a three-class (i.e., COVID-19, normal lung, PNA) CNN-based classifier and a two-class (i.e., bacterial PNA and viral PNA) CNN-based classifier. A comprehensive labeled database of CXR images for training and testing purposes has been compiled using two sources of available images. In addition, the transfer learning method is applied to reduce the issue of insufficient training data. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare both systems to existing methods. According to the results, the diagnostic accuracy of DiagCovidPNA and Hybrid DiagCovidPNA is 95% and 97.50%, respectively. Consequently, Hybrid DiagCovidPNA improves accuracy by approximately 8% compared to other deep learning-based methods with a same structure and approximately 3% compared to the parallel transfer deep learning-based method. All DiagCovidPNA implementation source codes and the compiled CXR database are publicly available to the research community.},

  abstract     = {Estimation of compressive strength (CS) of concrete is an active area of research in the domain of manufacturing engineering. The concrete ingredients are disseminated arbitrarily over the whole concrete matrix and the relationships among them are a complex nonlinear system, thus challenging to model. Soft computing techniques are found better to statistical methods applied for prediction of CS. However, sophisticated prediction models are still missing and need to be explored. Random vector functional link network (RVFLN) is an efficient algorithm with low time complexity and is able to handle complex domain problems without compromising on accuracy. It assigns input-hidden layer weights and bias randomly without further modification and computes output layer weights iteratively by gradient methods or non-iteratively by least square methods. Though it is applied on solving various engineering problems, its application on CS prediction of concrete is scarce. The learning ability, structural simplicity, and computational efficiency of RVFLN motivated us to investigate its efficiency on compressive strength prediction. In this article, we develop a RVFLN-based forecast for estimation of CS concrete. A publicly available dataset from UCI repository is used to develop and access the performance of the model. For comparative analysis, few other models such as FLANN, MLP, RBFNN, MLR, and ARIMA are also developed and used for the forecasting considering samples with curing ages at 14, 28, 56, and 91 days. All the models are evaluated in terms of MAPE, ARV, U of Theil’s statistics (UT), NMSE, and execution time. Considering the four-sample series, RVFLN attained an average MAPE of 0.5341, ARV of 0.0982, UT of 0.3239, and NMSE of 0.1188 which are smaller than other models. The study revealed that RVFLN is quite capable in modeling and predicting the CS data. Outcomes of comparative studies and statistical significance tests are in favor of RVFLN-based forecasting.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis (SA) is the study of human perception in any subject of practice. It retrieves data from datasets using natural language processing (NLP) methodologies and algorithms that are either regulation-based, blended, or rely on machine learning approaches. SA is garnering fame for its capacity to fit in a large chunk of data with user evaluations, uncover a trend, and come to a consensus derived from real facts rather than hypotheses established on a limited number of observations. The flexible nature of sentiment gathering has helped in playing a critical role in both commercial and research applications in the last few years. This study presents new sentiment analysis models based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for both labeled and unlabeled datasets. The labeled datasets using supervised learning are modeled in a hybrid architecture of fine-tuned BERT and interval Type—2 fuzzy sets. The inclusion of interval Type-2 fuzzy logic for handling reluctance or inaccuracy in data shows commendable results for the labeled datasets. For the prediction of sentiments in unlabeled datasets, they are embedded through a BERT tokenizer with the help of a threshold and activation functions. The coupling of a multi-layer perceptron with the BERT parser substantially decreases the time and complexity compared to supervised learning. Both the models have been implemented on multiple datasets and have outperformed existing state-of-the-art techniques in this field.},

Even under the specified time and memory constraints, PBCOA improves the network accuracy and F1 Score from around 0.80 and less to more than 0.99.

In addition, to solve the disadvantage of expensive solution set analysis in the wrapper technique, this study offers an efficient evaluation methodology that significantly decreases the evaluation cost and enhances the efficacy of the feature selection method.

  abstract     = {Image segmentation through fuzzy clustering has been widely used in diverse areas. However, most of those clustering algorithms require that some of their parameter values be determined manually. The number of clusters, C, is one of the most important parameters because it impacts the number of regions to segment and directly affects the performance of the clustering algorithms. Some state-of-the-art general clustering algorithms methods automatically determine C. However, not all of them can be employed for image segmentation. Therefore, this paper describes the method automatic estimation of number of clusters by image complexity (AENCIC). AENCIC is a method that automatically estimates the best C needed by state-of-the-art clustering algorithms to segment an image, considering the image complexity perceived by humans. AENCIC was designed to work with fuzzy clustering algorithms employed to segment real-world images because this kind of segmentation is an ill-defined problem causing a high variation of C per image to attain a good segmentation. Results using the database BSDS500 demonstrate that using AENCIC to estimate C improves the performance of state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering image segmentation algorithms up to 94% of their ideal maximum performance, allowing those algorithms to work without human intervention.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer has emerged as one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting women today, underscoring the critical need for advanced diagnostic tools. Mammography has been the conventional method for early breast cancer detection, yet recent years have witnessed the emergence of thermal infrared scans, or thermographies, as a potential contender for diagnosing breast cancer, particularly in cases of dense breast tissue. Thermographic images reveal higher temperatures in regions containing tumors compared to healthy breast tissue, providing a promising avenue for early diagnosis. In parallel, the field of radiography has seen the advent of deep learning (DL) techniques, offering a computational approach to breast cancer identification. This study presents a novel approach, the Enhanced Deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (EDCNN), aimed at generating heatmaps from two-dimensional thermal breast images. These heatmaps are employed to quantitatively assess breast vascularity, yielding interpretable parameters for further analysis. In addition, the study proposes a classifier that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer purely based on these extracted parameters. To enhance the accuracy of this process, the algorithm combines Fuzzy C-means clustering with the Region of Interest (ROI) technique to effectively isolate the breast from surrounding body parts. The segmentation results are evaluated using temperature profiles, revealing substantial peaks in the patterns as indicators of ROIs. This identification of hot areas hints at the potential presence of a tumor. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, the study constructs DL models using convolutional neural networks, training them with thermal breast images from the Graphical DMR datasets. The results are compelling, with the EDCNN models outperforming alternative methods, achieving an impressive accuracy of 96.8% and a specificity rate of 93.7%. This research thus offers a robust, efficient, and reliable means of early breast cancer diagnosis, marking a significant advancement in the field.},

Therefore, how to empower a host machine to intelligently distinguish intelligent machines from humans is a challenging work. In this paper, the Mirror Turing Test (MTT) is conceived and implemented. Unlike the standard Turing Test, the tester in the MTT is replaced by a machine instead of a human. Current advancements on deep learning enable machines to recognize subtle differences between genuine and counterfeit works. Sometimes, the ability of machines is even superior to that of humans. Will machines transcend humans in an irreversible trend? Not completely right. The detection of soul in an artwork remains far beyond the capacity of machines. The two sets of MTT based on poetry generated by a machine and a novel imitated by a human were conducted in this paper and neither of them passed the MTT. Poetry is one of the art forms in which authors reveal their souls. Thus, we chose poetry in the MTT experiments on the basis of our soul computing model, thus clearly discriminating machine from human.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of different modalities have different reference values for pathological diagnosis. The difficulty of obtaining multimodal MRIs makes it effective to synthesize medical images of missing modalities from existing one. To train a one-for-all synthesizer with limited number of unpaired MRIs, a novel cross-dimensional knowledge-guided generative adversarial network (CKG–GAN) is proposed. In CKG–GAN, a cross-dimensional knowledge transfer network is utilized to measure the perceptual similarity of 2D images (slices of MRIs) from source and synthesized modalities, the knowledge of which is transferred from a pre-trained 3D network without accessing its private training data set. We evaluate the proposed model for three tasks on BraTs2018 and BraTs2021 data sets, using one modality of T1, T2 or Flair to synthesize the other two modalities without changing the content. The results show that compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the performance by 2–7%.},

This study aimed to develop and apply a quantitative and practical method to help safety practitioners manage unsafe behavior in industrial systems. This study is a descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional research conducted in an Iranian manufacturing company. A questionnaire containing six primary scales of unsafe behavior was used to evaluate the participants&#39; scores for unsafe behavior. Since the impact of each of the six scales on the occurrence of unsafe behavior varied, the scales were weighted using the best–worst method (BWM). Finally, to quantify the workers&#39; unsafe behavior, the total unsafe behavior index (USBITotal) score was calculated. The mean scores for routine violations (RVs) and exceptional violations (EVs) were 10.68 and 5.09, respectively, indicating the highest and lowest values. The present study introduces an innovative proactive tool to provide safety practitioners with a practical method for predicting cognitive unsafe behavior of shop floor workers. This tool is cost-effective, accessible, and utilizes quantitative measures. The developed method seems to be a suitable tool for measuring the frequency of slips, lapses, and mistakes, as well as various types of violations.},

However, it was difficult to determine the failure modes and evaluate the load-bearing capacity of concrete columns under seismic loads with the application of high-strength concrete. In this paper, two ANNs, including a genetic algorithm optimization-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) and an ANFIS, were developed to determine the failure modes of concrete columns under seismic loads. The main investigated parameters, including specimens&#39; shear span ratio, the compressive strength of concrete, the yield strength and volumetric ratio of stirrups, and the yield strength and ratio of longitudinal reinforcement, were applied as input variables to the models. The proposed models were trained and tested using 247 data sets from previous studies. The proposed models had high reliability and predictability to determine the failure modes of concrete columns under seismic loads. Furthermore, an ANFIS network was developed to evaluate the load-bearing capacity of concrete columns, which had high reliability and predictability.},

We have developed a time-windowed rebalancing request generator, which, in conjunction with a route planning algorithm based on variable neighborhood search (VNS), provides a robust solution to this issue. This iterative evolutionary algorithm not only refines solutions progressively but also incorporates a shaking process to enhance the possibility of achieving global optimization. Our methodology further includes an algorithm for generating initial solutions, alongside two shaking processes designed to improve efficiency. We validate our approach using real-world data from Taipei’s Youbike system, demonstrating superior performance in rebalancing efficiency compared to existing algorithms.

  abstract     = {Video-based crowd counting is an essential surveillance tool that plays a crucial role in mitigating crowd catastrophes by facilitating the development and implementation of efficient crowd management methods. The deep learning approaches using density map-based regression consider local crowd distribution but are erroneous for point-level annotation of human heads. The weakly supervised approach overcomes such an issue by mapping global crowd attributes onto ground-truth counts. Also, video-based density map regression approaches don’t handle human shape variation and background effects. Hence, this research suggests a unique cascade of two deep structures: a local density map regressor and a global crowd count regressor with weakly supervised learning. The former model can effectively deal with human shape variation, minimise background effects, consider local crowd distribution, and provide crowd density maps. In contrast, the latter adopts a weakly supervised learning mechanism and provides scene-level crowd counting by considering global attributes of density maps. The trials were conducted using three datasets, namely Venice, Mall, and UCSD, yielding promising and improved outcomes.

  abstract     = {Path testing is one of the most efficient approaches for covering a program during the test. However, executing a path with a single or limited number of test data does not guarantee that the path is fault-free, specifically in the fault-prone paths. A common solution in these cases is to extract the corresponding domain of the path constraint that covers the path and select the arbitrary numbers of test data from the extracted domain. Many approaches have been proposed to extract and partition the program input domain statically without executing the program under test. However, extracting domain based on the path constraints is inaccurate and time-consuming, specifically in high dimensional inputs. This paper presents a dynamic approach for extracting the input domain of a given path based on the modified Markov chain Monte Carlo method, multi-agent Metropolis algorithm. The algorithm uses sampling and randomly walks around symmetric proposal distribution to find a finite number of points that approximate the target domain. Our approach chooses the highest fault-prone path from the minimum-cost test paths for domain extraction to maximize the fault detection capabilities. Our experiments with ten Python programs reveal a 14% improvement in the accuracy of the extracted domains compared to the state-of-the-art domain extraction approaches. In addition, the mutation score of automatically generated test cases has improved by an average of 17.95% compared to branch and prime-path testing approaches.},

  abstract     = {To make up for the shortcomings of traditional music teaching strategies and improve the intelligence of music teaching, this study uses a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to conduct an intelligent exploration of Erhu teaching methods in music. Firstly, a rule-based Erhu fingering evaluation method is proposed, which summarizes the fingering habits and general rules of modern Erhu performance and constructs a quantitative evaluation system (QES) of Erhu fingering. This system provides the evaluation basis for effectively verifying the intelligent generation model of Erhu fingering proposed here. Secondly, on the one hand, an intelligent generation model of Erhu music is proposed based on neural network technology. On the other hand, an intelligent automatic generation (AG) algorithm for Erhu fingering is put forward. In this algorithm, the temporal-difference RL (TDRL) model and off-policy are integrated, and the influence of the fingers before and after actual playing is considered comprehensively. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the proposed Erhu music generation model and the Erhu fingering-intelligence generation model are verified by simulation experiments. The results reveal that: (1) The QES of Erhu fingering proposed here can objectively describe the advantages and disadvantages of Erhu fingering and play a role of feedback and improvement to the generation model of fingering; (2) In the proposed Erhu music generation model, the musical note index value of the generated music is high, which avoids the situation of excessive note repetition and note jump amplitude in the generated music. (3) The designed Erhu fingering-intelligence generation model is employed to compare and analyze three kinds of music segments. It is found that the total score and scoring rates of fingering evaluation generated by the three pieces of music are relatively high and very close to the professional fingering, scoring rate difference is less than 3%; (4) The scoring rate of all kinds of fingering generated by machines is about 90%, and the difference with professional fingering is no more than 3%. The data show that the proposed method can realize the AG of Erhu fingering well. This study aims to assist in music and fingering teaching for Erhu course education and offer some references for other courses in music teaching.},

Resource allocation for multiple service function chain requests (SFC) in NFV-enabled networks is a fundamental challenge for network providers. Several research studies have focused on this problem in detail. Specifically, SFC routing attempts to satisfy each request by assigning a path across data centers that places the ordered set of required VNFs. This paper formulates this problem as an SFC provisioning problem (SFCRP) with the two objectives of maximizing the number of accepted requests and balancing the utilization of network resources. To address this problem, a two-stage routing algorithm (2PRT) that integrates Yen’s algorithm and a genetic algorithm is proposed. The simulation results based on 12 scenarios that use three real-world networks and randomly generated requests indicate that the batch mode significantly enhances the acceptance rate compared to the existing methods.},

Second, one lemma about the compound property of Caputo fractional derivative and integral is given. According to the compound property of Caputo fractional derivative and appropriate variable substitution, the original inertial memristive system translates a routine inertial memristive system. And, using the Filippov discontinuous theory, Lyapunov stability theory, and Mittag-Leffler convergence, several sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization of Caputo fractional-order inertial memristive neural networks. An effective feedback controller is proposed for fractional-order inertial memristive neural networks with time-varying delays, such that the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization between the slave system and the master system can be achieved.

  abstract     = {The economy of a country is directly impacted by agricultural productivity. If proper precautions are not taken in this area, plants suffer serious consequences, which have an impact on the quality, quantity, or productivity of the corresponding products. In this context, the farmers need an agriculture expert for the examination of the plant diseases, which takes a lot of time as well as continuous monitoring of plants. Hence, multilevel thresholding is a possible solution, which is useful for identifying the diseases in the crops by changing the color variation of a segmented image. However, it has a large range of applications in various domains such as remote sensing, the medical domain, the biometric domain. In this paper, an improved technique using horizontal and vertical crossover shuffled frog leaping algorithm (HVSFLA) is proposed for multilevel thresholding for the crop image based on a 2D histogram. The 2D histogram uses the grayscale value and non-local mean (NLM), whereas the one-dimension (1D) histogram uses only grayscale value. Therefore, in the proposed method, 2D Kapur’s entropy integrating with non-local mean 2D histogram is exploited for multilevel thresholding of the crop images. To investigate the efficacy, the proposed method is compared with well-known optimization techniques like beta differential evolution, artificial bee colony, bacterial foraging optimization, and particle swarm optimization. It is evident from the experimental results that the proposed technique yields better results than the 1D histogram technique in terms of root-mean-square error, structural similarity index, peak signal-to-noise ratio, feature similarity index, coefficient of variation, and fitness function.},

To address this issue, we propose a collaborative filtering recommendation method that combines evaluation relationships and emotional relationships. The emotional relationship is derived from implicit feedback data, and we can exploit the neural network to learn the emotional relationship between users and items. The evaluation relationship is derived from explicit feedback data; similarly, we can exploit the neural network to learn the evaluation relationship between users and items. To obtain emotional and evaluation relationships, we design vector representation and interaction functions based on explicit and implicit feedback data. Moreover, we propose that deep neural networks can be used to integrate evaluation and emotional relationships. To effectively integrate emotional and evaluation relationships, we design multiple data fusion strategies, loss functions, and training strategies. Experimental studies were conducted on five benchmark datasets, and the results show that the collaborative filtering recommendation method based on emotional evaluation relationships can further improve the accuracy of recommendation systems.},

  abstract     = {The body mass index (BMI) is used by farmers to determine the body condition of animals, either to determine the best moment for slaughter or to classify animals for minimizing production costs. The objective of the present work was to establish the efficiency of a software based on fuzzy artificial intelligence systems capable of evaluating several herds of different breeds, comparing them and providing rural producers and researchers with additional parameters for decision making on body mass index. For this, systems based on fuzzy rules were created, with “mass” and “height” as input variables, and a new BMI called the Fuzzy BMI as the output variable. The output variable was classified into five groups: “Very Low”, “Low”, “Medium”, “High,” and “Very High”, allowing farmers to compare animals. A software program was developed in the Delphi language, and the user interface was tailored for cattle breeders, enabling them to evaluate their herds. For model validation, a database of three farms was used, which totaled 287 animals of different ages and breeds. The developed models presented a Pearson correlation greater than 0.92, a value much higher than the traditional models. According to the Fuzzy BMI determined for each animal and the combinations between all animal masses and heights, the developed software allows farmers to enter data and obtain answers that can be used to improve management, i.e., optimize resources and increase profit.},

  abstract     = {Facial data under non-rigid deformation are often assumed lying on a highly non-linear manifold. The conventional subspace clustering methods, such as Block Diagonal Representation (BDR), can only handle the high-dimensionality of facial data, ignoring the useful non-linear property embedded in data. Yet, discovering the local invariance in facial data remains a critical issue for face clustering. To this end, we propose a novel Block Diagonal Representation via Manifold learning (BDRM) in this paper. To be concrete, the manifold information within facial data can be learned by Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). Then manifold structure and block diagonal representation are considered jointly to uncover the intrinsic structure of facial data, which leads to a better representation for subsequent clustering task. Furthermore, the diffusion process is adopted to derive the final affinity matrix with context-sensitive, by which the learned affinity matrix can be spread and re-evaluated to enhance the connectivity of data belonging to the same intra-subspace. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves a superior clustering performance against the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real-world facial data.},

However, the GCN-based methods only focus on the alignment between ground-truth labels and predicted labels, overlooking the geometric structure implicitly encoded by the graph. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GCN-based method that is entitled Topic-aware Cosine GCN (ToCo-GCN) for the STC. The ToCo-GCN defines and captures underlying geometric structures of short texts from different categories in the cosine space. Specifically, the ToCo-GCN regards the within-class and between-class geometric structures as constraint, aiming to learn both representative and discriminative short text representations. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent sparsity problem of short texts, the ToCo-GCN augment the text graph with latent topics. Experimental results on 8 STC datasets demonstrate that the ToCo-GCN is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of Accuracy and Macro-F1 score.},

There have been many qualitative studies on the product forms and development models of forest health tourism, but there is still a gap in the evaluation indicators and development systems for the development potential of forest health tourism. Using the research results of forest health tourism at home and abroad for reference, we will build an evaluation system for the development potential of forest health tourism, providing new research perspectives and operational practical support for the development of forest health tourism. The development potential evaluation of forest health tourism is a classical MAGDM problems. Recently, the TODIM and VIKOR technique has been employed to cope with MAGDM issues. The single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) are employed as a tool for characterizing uncertain information during the development potential evaluation of forest health tourism.

  abstract     = {Though there are several studies on uncertain single-period portfolio selection, the uncertain multiperiod portfolio selection literature is still in an exploration phase. Besides, the effects and influences of investors’ attitudes have not been extensively investigated in a multiperiod framework. Further, the possible application of the contingent and borrowing and lending constraints in an uncertain multiperiod portfolio selection framework has not been explored. In this paper, we propose an uncertain multiobjective multiperiod portfolio selection model that handles the uncertainty using the Me operator. The Me operator integrates the investor’s attitude (conservative, neutral, or aggressive) into the portfolio selection model. The proposed model maximizes the terminal wealth and minimizes the cumulative risk of the portfolio subject to several realistic constraints, such as minimum return threshold, borrowing, and lending of the capital, value-at-risk, liquidity, cardinality, minimal and maximal fraction, no short selling, and contingent constraints, for each period. These realistic constraints adequately address the practical concerns of the investors and aptly mimic the investment market conditions concerning multiperiod investment over a long investment horizon. The weighted goal programming then solves the proposed model. Finally, a detailed empirical illustration is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model. The proposed approach is also substantiated through comparison with the existing research works. The proposed approach effectively integrates the investor’s attitude and aptly simulates the real-world investment market conditions to incorporate the investor’s preferences into the portfolio selection.},

  abstract     = {Bat Algorithm (BA) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic search algorithm designed to efficiently explore complex problem spaces and find near-optimal solutions. The algorithm is inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats, which acts as a signal system to estimate the distance and hunt prey. Although the BA has proven effective for various optimization problems, it exhibits limited exploration ability and susceptibility to local optima. The algorithm updates velocities and positions based on the current global best solution, causing all agents to converge toward a specific location, potentially leading to local optima issues in optimization problems. On this premise, this paper proposes the Modified Bat Algorithm (MBA) as an enhancement to address the local optima limitation observed in the original BA. MBA incorporates the frequency and velocity of the current best solution, enhancing convergence speed to the optimal solution and preventing local optima entrapment. While the original BA faces diversity issues, both the original BA and MBA are introduced. To assess MBA’s performance, three sets of test functions (classical benchmark functions, CEC2005, and CEC2019) are employed, with results compared to those of the original BA, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). The outcomes demonstrate the MBA’s significant superiority over other algorithms.

  abstract     = {The concept of computational intelligence (CI)-based optimization algorithms emerged in the early 1960s as a more practical approach to the contemporary derivate-based approaches. This paved the way for many modern algorithms to arise with an unprecedented growth rate in recent years, each claiming to have a novel and present a profound breakthrough in the field. That said, many have raised concerns about the performance of these algorithms and even identified fundamental flaws that could potentially undermine the integrity of their results. On that note, the premise of this study was to replicate some of the more prevalent, fundamental components of these algorithms in an abstract format as a measure to observe their behavior in an isolated environment. Six pseudo algorithms were designed to create a spectrum of intelligence behavior ranging from absolute randomness to local search-oriented computational architecture. These were then used to solve a set of centered and non-centered benchmark suites to see if statistically different patterns would emerge. The obtained result clearly highlighted that the algorithm’s performance would suffer significantly as these benchmarks got more intricate. This is not just in terms of the number of dimensions in the search space but also the mathematical structure of the benchmark. The implication is that, in some cases, sheer processing resources can mask the algorithm’s lack of sufficient intelligence. But as importantly, this study attempted to identify some mechanics and concepts that could potentially cause or amplify this problem. For instance, the excessive use of greedy strategy, a prevalent measure embedded in many modern CI-based algorithms, has been identified as potentially one of these reasons. The result, however, highlights a more fundamental problem in the CI-based optimization field. That is, these algorithms are often treated as a black box. This perception cultivated the culture of not exploring the underlying structure of these algorithms as long as they were deemed capable of generating acceptable results, which permits similar biases to go undetected.},

  abstract     = {This research addresses the Inventory-Routing Problem (IRP) with priority customers under conditions of uncertainty. The problem involves devising a plan to supply a set of customers from a facility, establishing precedence rules, and making transportation and inventory management decisions while considering uncertainty in customer demand. Priority in deliveries is assigned to customers in the health sector in accordance with government regulations. Companies must uphold product quality for health sector customers while simultaneously aiming to minimize total costs. We propose a fuzzy mixed-integer linear programming model to solve the IRP with priority customers and uncertainty in demand rates, modeled using triangular fuzzy numbers. To convert the fuzzy linear programming model into a deterministic one, an ordering method for fuzzy numbers is applied. The model is implemented using CPLEX, and a set of benchmark instances is solved. The primary results indicate that prioritizing customers leads to an increase in total costs due to visiting these customers first on each route created. Additionally, routes without priority customers exhibit higher average vehicle capacity utilization. In most cases, the solutions obtained maintain quality within the specified time limits.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, the path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in 3D complex flight environments has become a hot topic in the field of UAV technology. Path planning is a crucial process that involves determining the trajectory of the UAV from the point of origin to its destination. However, a number of algorithms proposed for this task have been proven inefficient in this 3D space. In response, this paper proposes the use of an adaptive Q-Learning based particle swarm optimization to tackle the problem. This algorithm introduces the Q-Learning algorithm and designs four states and actions for each particle. Based on the accumulated experience from reinforcement learning, the particles can choose the appropriate action in different states. To evaluate the performance of the AQLPSO algorithm, extensive simulation experiments were conducted. These experiments involved comparing the AQLPSO algorithm with existing algorithms such as PSO, PSO-SA, and RMPSO. The results of the simulations demonstrated that the AQLPSO algorithm outperformed these algorithms in terms of multiple performance metrics. It effectively solved the UAV path planning problem in 3D complex flight environments by reducing the likelihood of falling into local optima, improving efficiency, and achieving faster convergence towards the global optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important challenges in the fifth generation (5 G) of telecommunication systems is the efficiency of energy and spectrum. Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have been proposed by researchers to resolve existing challenges. In the proposed system model of this paper, there is a base station (BS) around which several users and an eavesdropper (EVA) are evenly distributed. The information transmitted between BS and users is disrupted by an EVA, which highlights the importance of secure transfer. This paper analyzes secure energy efficiency (EE) of a massive MIMO system, and its purpose is to maximize the secure EE of the system. Several scenarios are considered to evaluate achieving the desired goal. To maximize the secure EE, selecting optimal number of antennas and cell division methods are employed. Each of these two methods is applied in a system with the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and the zero forcing (ZF) precodings, and then the problem is solved. Maximum transmission power and minimum secure rate for users insert limitations to the optimization problem. Channel state information (CSI) is generally imperfect for users in any method, while CSI of the EVA is considered perfect as the worst case. Four iterative algorithms are designed to provide numerical assessments. The first algorithm calculates the optimal power of users without utilizing existing methods, the second one is related to the cell division method, the third one is based on the strategy of selecting optimal number of antennas, and forth one is based on a hybrid strategy.},

Two of these are single-vector strategies that conduct searches based on random individuals, respectively, heading toward historical positions and determining destinations with one perturbation vector. The remaining multi-vector strategy conducts searches around historical best positions using a relatively low crossover rate. The performance of the suggested six ABS versions was evaluated using the benchmark functions of IEEE CEC2005 and CEC2019. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ABS version significantly improves BSA and its improved version. Additionally, the proposed ABS version is the most competitive algorithm compared to the seven classical algorithms in terms of evaluations of obtained results and significant values.},

  abstract     = {One of the main issues in power systems relates to scheduling of energy resources. With the ever-increasing penetration of renewable energies with intermittent power output, this issue has turned into an even more significant problem. Renewable energy sources (RESs) have captured attention due to their low environmental emission and also low running cost. One drawback that may be brought into power systems is the surplus power generation by such generation technologies that should be carefully addressed in power system-related problems. This paper proposes the unscented transform modeling to consider the stochastic behavior of charge and discharge of EVs, random performance of photovoltaic, load demand and wind turbine systems. Due to the unpredictable nature of solar and wind power outputs, as well as plug-in electric vehicle owners&#39; behavior when supplying or receiving power from the grid, a stochastic programming-based approach is proposed to operate microgrids in grid-connected configuration mode. The integration of vehicle to grid (V2G) has a good ability to minimize the operating cost of the MG. An integrated optimization model is presented in this study for optimal operation of the MG with high penetration of PEVs and RESs. Modified sunflower optimization algorithm (MSFO) algorithm is applied in this paper to address the optimization problem. The single-objective stochastic optimization is used for minimizing the total operating cost over the day taking into consideration the uncertainties due to the RESs’ power output intermittency, including wind speed and solar irradiance and load demand forecast error. Several case studies are taken into account to show the efficiency of the optimal operation with PEVs.},

Our investigations have revealed a lack of prior work in this area. In this article, we propose a fluence map optimization for the IMRT procedure based on trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. First, the problem is formulated as a fuzzy optimization problem due to the properties of a trapezoidal fuzzy dose vector. Then, it is converted to a nonfuzzy optimization problem. After that, the optimal solution is reached based on the gradient method and using the projection operation. We utilize the computational environment for radiotherapy research (CERR) planning system to generate patient information and dose data for treatment planning. Numerical results for two typical clinical examples, prostate and head-and-neck cancers, in the format of dose–volume histograms, are also represented, interpreted, and compared with two other methods. These results show that the treatment planning we provided, based on the trapezoidal fuzzy target dose, is in better agreement with the goals prescribed by oncologists compared to the triangular fuzzy state (our previous study) and the method used in CERR.},

Subsequently, the presented local exploitation using multi-spaces reduction is carried out to alternately achieve more promising points in the original global space, Subspace1 and Subspace2. Furthermore, the estimated mean square error of Kriging will be maximized for exploring the sparsely sampled regions, once CLEGE algorithm falls into the local optimum.

However, infrastructures, such as local base stations, are destroyed and D2D-CDN cannot operate normally due to the lack of base stations as a content source in disaster scenarios. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can temporarily serve as a content source with its flexibility to deliver content to terrestrial UEs, which we call it UAV base station (UAV-BS). However, the placement of UAV-BS will be affected by many factors, such as UE distribution and communication interference. Therefore, how to place UAV-BS in a reasonable way to maximize the network throughput and the number of covered UEs while ensuring the communication quality of service (QoS) is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem, first, we propose a UAV-BS placement optimization model (U-POM) and formulate an optimization problem. Secondly, we prove that our maximization problem is NP-hard and propose an improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), called the global optimal artificial bee colony (GOABC) algorithm. Finally, we construct an analysis and testing platform to analyze the accuracy and the stability of the GOABC algorithm.

In this article, we devise a non-parametric statistical mechanism to resolve such decision problem. The mechanism utilises the notion of granular knowledge which is regarded as the product of subjective perception toward objective notions. To measure the degree of conversion, we associate the perception with three metrics, which in turn derive three norms. These norms would measure the degree of the conversion from objectivity to subjectivity. Then by taking the set of Bell partitions as our sample space, and three norms as our statistics, we could then construct their non-parametric distributions. Based on these distributions, we could then conduct the statistical testing whether the subjectivity of a given notion (or target) is significantly related to the objectivity of that notion (or target).},

  abstract     = {This paper offers an improved memory-type ratio estimator in stratified random sampling under linear and non-linear cost functions. The issue is given as all integer non-linear programming problems (AINLPPs). The sampling properties mainly the bias and the mean squared error of the introduced estimator are derived up to the first order of approximation. The optimum value of the characterizing scalar is obtained by the Lagrange method of maxima–minima. The least value of the MSE of the suggested estimator is also obtained for this optimum value of the charactering constant. The suggested estimator is compared both theoretically and empirically with the competing estimators. Under this setup, the optimum allocation with mean square error of the suggested estimator is attained, and the estimator is compared to other comparable estimators. The AINLPP is solved using the genetic programming approach, which is applied to both actual and simulated data sets from a bivariate normal distribution.},

In such circumstances, this paper suggests the pricing of vulnerable European and barrier options, when the underlying asset and asset held by the option writer follow the geometric Liu process and uncertain mean-reverting process, respectively. According to the uncertainty theory, we present closed-form analytic formulas of these option prices and use the residual method to estimate the model parameters. In order to estimate the model parameters, the genetic algorithm to solve the generalized moment estimation problem derived by the residual method is suggested. From the uncertain hypothesis test, we then evaluate whether the proposed uncertain stock models fit the observed data. Ultimately, based on the estimated parameters, we evaluate the effect of the vulnerable option parameters on its price.},

The current dynamic motion prediction models, such as the Markov model, depend only on the object motions’ history. They ignore the object’s direction and speed, which play a key role in dynamic motion prediction. This paper introduces two new probability density functions (PDFs) for elliptic and ellipsoidal regions. Then, it introduces two new motion prediction models based on the new proposed PDFs. This paper proposes new motion detection models that depend not only on the motion’s history but also on moving objects’ speed and direction (objects’ velocity). Moreover, it integrates the proposed models with the Markov model to attain a more precise prediction. Besides, it introduces several applications for the proposed models.},

The proposed method improved the existing accuracy of near-duplicate image detection and classification using Haar wavelet feature extraction and classification algorithm. Due to advancements in digital image acquisition and image editing software, near-duplicate image counterfeiting has become predictable. This expanding problem needs the creation of sophisticated detection algorithms capable of effectively preventing the spread of near-duplicate image deception. Support vector machine (SVM) and K-near neighbor (KNN) classifiers are used in the classification stage of a modified deep learning model with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The classification model finds the better result on the Imperial College London dataset, with 99.12% using CNN with KNN classifier and 98.63% for CNN with SVM classifier. The classification model also gives better results on the Nanyang Technological University dataset, with 98.36% using CNN with the KNN classifier and 97.85% for CNN with the SVM classifier. The model is tested using publicly available images to find the results. According to the comparison results, this model performed significantly better result than the previous model. As a result, digital image forensics has become more critical, particularly in identifying image duplication.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis of online car reviews is a significant process in natural language processing. Numerous car enthusiasts and influencers create video reviews of automobiles on platforms for example YouTube. In realistic settings for sentiment analysis within this context, the task includes evaluating spoken reviews, the video content, and the emotions expressed by both the content creators and the viewers as reflected in the comments section. The vulnerability to facing circumstances in real-world scenarios where critical components are necessary for performing sentiment analysis on multimedia car reviews may unexpectedly be absent. To overcome this issue, siamese capsule gorilla troops network-based multimodal sentiment analysis for car reviews is proposed in this research work. Initially, pre-processing and feature extraction are performed on the audio, video and text information. The feature fusion is performed by enhancing spiking neural networks with geometric attention fusion network. The fused feature is fed as an input to siamese capsule gorilla troops network which classifies the emotion states as valence, arousal, and trustworthiness. Also, the algorithm called gorilla troop optimization (GTO) optimizes the classification error of the proposed siamese capsule network. Finally, this research work assesses high- and low-level features across modalities, introduces a novel enhancing spiking neural networks with geometric attention fusion network, enhances classification accuracy through new audio, video, and text embeddings, and boosts system robustness by integrating incomplete multimodal data. The achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values are 99%, 98.55%, 98.75%, and 98.02%, respectively, for the active multimodal sentimental analysis in car review (MuSe-CaR) dataset.},

Adam optimization algorithm is adopted in the minimum optimization problem and the obtained optimal parameters can pass the uncertain hypothesis test. Compared with the uncertain differential equations, the fractional one holds more parameter freedom degrees and captures long-term interactions of observed data.

  abstract     = {Marimuthu and Mahapatra (Soft Comput 25:9859–9871, 2021) claimed that several methods are proposed in the literature to solve such multi-criteria decision-making problems in which the rating value of each alternative over each attribute is represented by a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number. However, the ranking methods, used in existing fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods, fail to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use existing fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods. To resolve the inappropriateness of fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods, Marimuthu and Mahapatra, first, defined some score functions to transform a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number into its equivalent real number. Then, Marimuthu and Mahapatra stated and proved some results regarding their proposed score functions. Thereafter, using the proposed results, Marimuthu and Mahapatra proposed a ranking method for comparing generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Marimuthu and Mahapatra also proved that their proposed ranking method will never fail to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Finally, Marimuthu and Mahapatra proposed a method, based on their proposed ranking method, to solve fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems. Jeevaraj (Soft Comput 26:11225–11230, 2022) considered some counterexamples to show that Marimuthu and Mahapatra’s results are not correct. Jeevaraj also considered some counterexamples to show that Marimuthu and Mahapatra’s ranking method also fails to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, Jeevaraj proposed the correct results corresponding to Marimuthu and Mahapatra’s results as well as Jeevaraj suggested the required modification in Marimuthu and Mahapatra’s ranking method. Finally, Jeevaraj proved that the modified ranking method will never fail to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In the future, researchers may use the results and the ranking method, proposed by Jeevaraj, to solve real-life fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems. However, in this paper, some counterexamples are considered to show that Jeevaraj’s modified results are also not correct. In addition, some counterexamples are considered to show that the modified ranking method, proposed by Jeevaraj, also fails to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Hence, it is inappropriate to use the results and the ranking method, proposed by Jeevaraj, for solving real-life fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems. Furthermore, the correct results, corresponding to Marimuthu and Mahapatra’s results, are stated and proved. Finally, it is proved that Marimuthu and Mahapatra’s ranking method as well as Jeevaraj’s ranking method will never fail to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers having the same heights. However, both methods may fail to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers having different heights. It is pertinent to mention that as there exist several ranking methods which will never fail to distinguish two distinct generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. So, one may use any such ranking method to compare generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.},

  abstract     = {Non-local network provides a pioneering approach for capturing long-range dependency by aggregating query-specific global context into each query location; however, non-local network applies the identical weight to each channel of feature maps and ignores the differences from the different channels of features. We design a novel tensor attention module (TAM), which integrates the context information along spatial dimension and channel dimension by introducing a bias learnable parameters tensor, so that the feature at each location of each channel can aggregate the features from all other locations. Motivated by SE-Net, we propose a novel second-order covariance attention module (SCAM) to enhance the feature correlation between different channel maps through the second-order statistics and the local cross-channel interaction strategy. We take the encoder–decoder segmentation network DeepLabv3+ as baseline, and in the encoder develop the attention modules TAM and SCAM for semantic segmentation (TCNet). Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets show that our proposed network has better performance than the other state-of-the-art segmentation networks.},

  abstract     = {The joint extraction task aims to construct an entity-relation triple comprising two entities and the relation between them. Existing joint models make it difficult to process too many overlapping relations in Chinese patent texts (CPT). This article introduces a joint entity and relation extraction model based on directed-relation graph attention network (DGAT) oriented to CPT to locate this problem. First, word-character tokens are obtained from CPT using BERT as the DGAT model input. Global tokens are expanded using the BiLSTM network to enhance contextual connection from the model input. Second, the DGAT model encodes the global tokens as a fully connected graph whose nodes represent the global tokens and edges denote the relations between global tokens. The edges with directed relation in the fully connected graph are assigned weights by the DGAT model, and other edges are pruned, resulting in a directed-relation-connected graph. Finally, the entity-relation triples are decoded using conditional random fields (CRF) from the directed relation-connected graph. Experimental results show that the proposed model was highly accurate based on the CPT dataset.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a wholesaler–retailer supply chain (SC) of a coastal biomass in an imprecise environment is developed incorporating the effect of the freshness of the units on the consumers’ demand under promotional cost sharing. Due to the imprecise nature of the rate of deterioration, the deterioration rate and the expiration time of the units are considered fuzzy numbers. As the freshness of the units depends on the expiration time, its nature is also imprecise and decreases with time. So, the seller normally decreases the unit selling price with time to boost the demand for biomass. The demand for the item is influenced by the unit selling price and freshness of the units, and hence its nature is also fuzzy. Due to the impreciseness of the rate of demand and deterioration, the model is mathematically formulated using fuzzy differential equations and fuzzy Riemann integration. The credibility measure of the fuzzy objective(average profit) with respect to a properly defined fuzzy goal is optimized for determining the marketing decision. Also, fuzzy simulation algorithms are presented for determining the said credibility measure. The models are studied in both the non-coordination scenario and the coordination scenario. In the non-coordination scenario, the retailer is the leader and the wholesaler is the follower, i.e., the retailer determines the marketing decision independently, and following the decision of the retailer the wholesaler determines his/her marketing strategy. In the coordination scenario, they make a joint decision for better performance by sharing the promotional cost incurred by the retailer by reducing the selling price to boost the demand. The model is illustrated using a set of test data and it is established that the individual profits as well as the channel profit improve if the decision is made jointly. In a particular case, the model is solved for the rough estimations of some problem parameters and an approach is proposed for the mathematical formulation and decision-making. The trust measure on a rough goal is defined for the formulation of the model and corresponding rough simulation algorithm is presented for the determination of the same. As the simulation approaches are used for the decision-making in imprecise environments, the basic particle swarm optimization algorithm is slightly modified, implemented, tested, and used for the determination of the marketing decision for the different models.},

The anisotropic diffusion function is a feature of the partial differential equation employed for the purpose of noise reduction and the preservation of image characteristics such as edges. A new tangent sigmoid diffusion coefficient and a new adaptive threshold parameter have been proposed in this work, which leads to faster convergence. In comparison to traditional anisotropic diffusion model techniques, the proposed technique performs admirably. As evidenced by the results, which demonstrate that the new anisotropic diffusion technique is not only capable of efficiently removing noise, but also of maintaining content in the denoised image. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using various metrics, including peak signal-to-noise ratio, convergence rate, structural similarity index, time complexity, and space complexity. When comparing the proposed approach to previous methods, it is evident that the proposed method outperforms in various aspects. These include a higher convergence rate (− 0.1278), a greater peak signal-to-noise ratio (37.9827 dB), a higher structural similarity index (0.97432), a lower time complexity (5.72 s), and a smaller space complexity (15.6 KB).},

  abstract     = {The modern era is witnessing a growing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly power sources. An interconnected power system capable of seamlessly integrating electric vehicles and renewable energy resources is being considered as a viable solution. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as its lower system inertia, which limits its ability to respond to load capabilities. To overcome this issue, a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) can be integrated with new techniques to enhance performance. This paper proposes a new Quasi Opposition Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (QOAOA) optimized Fractional Order Proportional Integral Derivative with Filter (FOPIDN) controller cascaded One Plus Tilted Derivative (1 + TD) controller with HESS of super-capacitor (SC) and Redox Flow Battery (RFB) to mitigate frequency and tie-line power variations in a multi-area restructured smart-grid system. The proposed controller&#39;s performance is evaluated under various conditions, such as load fluctuations, wind speed variations, solar irradiation, Governor Dead Band (GDB), and generation rate limitations. For unsystematic load the improvement in the performance of the proposed controller indicated by maximum variation in frequency ( $$\Delta f_{1}$$ , $$\Delta f_{2}$$ , $$\Delta f_{3}$$ ) and power change on the tie-lines ( $$\Delta P_{{{\text{tie}}12}}$$ , $$\Delta P_{{{\text{tie}}13}}$$ ) over FOPIDN controller is (98.65%, 48.78%, 52.52%) and (75.0%, 76.1%). The system performance is also analyzed when HESS devices are integrated into the three-area system, taking into account the varying nature of wind speed and solar irradiation. The improvement in performance indicated by maximum variation in frequency ( $$\Delta f_{1}$$ , $$\Delta f_{2}$$ , $$\Delta f_{3}$$ ) and power change on the tie-lines $$\Delta P_{{{\text{tie}}23}}$$ by incorporating HESS in the system is (45.21%, 33.33%, 29.59%) and 46.95% over without energy storage system. The proposed controller’s outcomes are validated using real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation with OPAL-RT.},

In order to assess the efficiency of the system, it is also important to make a comparison between the oscillations in load power and the amount of time it takes for the circumstances to settle.

Sometimes, the current observation is simultaneously impacted by the past observations and past disturbance terms. Uncertain autoregressive moving average (UARMA) model emerged as the times require. Due to the inevitable presence of unknown parameters in the model, it is crucial to estimate these unknown parameters robustly based on observed data. Motivated by this, a way to calculate least absolute deviation estimations for unknown parameter in UARMA model is studied by transformation this model into an uncertain autoregressive model. Forecast value and confidence interval for the future value are derived from the fitted model. Finally, two real data analyses with imprecise and precise observations of carbon dioxide emissions are given to show the effectiveness of our proposed method, and uncertain hypothesis is documented to test our model.

In the current competitive and unstable environment, in selecting the best suppliers, common approaches such as resilience and sustainability can be helpful for organizations in terms of sustainability and competitive advantage. Therefore, designing a sustainable and resilient supply chain model and considering all these parameters can effectively provide products and services. Also, to consider real-world uncertainties, interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy sets (IT2TFSs) are used because these sets are more powerful than classical fuzzy sets and better reflect uncertainties. Then, a new version of the MULTIMOORA model called MULTIMAMOORA is extended. In this model, the importance of the criteria is specified using the best–worst method. The importance of experts is defined using a new version of the MABAC approach developed by the average concept. Then, the ranking of suppliers is determined by the developed MULTIMAMOORA method. Notably, the proposed approach is developed in the IT2TF environment to consider the uncertainties of real issues and the ambiguity caused by experts’ opinions in the decision-making process. Eventually, a case study is solved utilizing the proposed approach, and the best supplier is determined under resilient and sustainable paradigms.},

Convolution neural networks (CNN) have been applied for flow field prediction in recent years.

In this paper, we propose a novel self-attention generative network referred to as SAG-FlowNet, both for original and optimization airfoil flow field prediction. We investigate the self-attention mechanism with a multi-layer convolutional generative network. We use the self-attention module to capture various information within and between flow fields, and with the help of the attention module, the CNN can utilize the information with stronger relationships regardless of their distances to achieve better flow field prediction results. Through extensive experiments, we explore the proposed SAG-FlowNet performance. The experimental results show that the method has accurate and universal performance for the reconstruction and prediction of the flow field both for original and optimized airfoils. SAG-FlowNet is promising for fast flow field prediction and has potential applications in accelerating airfoil design.},

Further, enhancement is a crucial step to increase efficiency of computer assisted hardware. This paper proposes a novel image enhancement method using neutrosophic set (NS). A variety of image enhancement algorithms are in literature, but accuracy is still a crucial problem. NS has an ability to handle indeterminant information, thus reducing the uncertainty in the images. The image is initially converted into neutrosophic domain, where an image is represented using three membership degrees—truth membership (T), indeterminacy membership (I), and false membership (F). Indeterminate degree is computed from two information, and these are combined using fuzzy Lukaseiwics t norm. Then a novel neutrosophic divergence score (NDS) is suggested, and computed from fuzzy divergence that measures the degree with respect to an ideal image. This is done to improve the brightness of the image and also highlights fine structures. Then, a modified histogram hyperbolization is used that uses a new logarithmic function to obtain a final enhanced image. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared both qualitatively and quantitatively with recent methods. Experiment has been performed on different types of mammogram images to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

However, the label noise caused by mislabeling may significantly influence the training and prediction results of traditional supervised models. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a psychological evaluation method that incorporates a noisy label correction mechanism and designs an evaluation framework that consists of a primary classification model and a noisy label correction mechanism. Firstly, the social media text data are transformed into heterogeneous text graphs, and a classification model combining a pre-trained model with a graph neural network is constructed to extract semantic features and structural features, respectively. After that, the Gaussian mixture model is used to select the samples that are likely to be mislabeled. Then, soft labels are generated for them to enable noisy label correction without prior knowledge of the noise distribution information. Finally, the corrected and clean samples are composed into a new data set and re-input into the primary model for mental state classification. Results of experiments on three real data sets indicate that the proposed method outperforms current advanced models in classification accuracy and noise robustness under different noise ratio settings, and can efficiently explore the potential sentiment tendencies and users’ psychological states in social media text data.},

The operation of data centers is evolving to meet new requirements such as reducing the operating cost. The use of data centers is recognized to have significant challenges due to high operating costs. The high operating costs arises due to the necessity of data center cooling. The cooling costs can be reduced by siting data centers in the underwater environment. In the underwater environment, data centers are cooled by freely available cold water. However, siting data centers in the underwater environment exposes them to risk from other underwater applications. The use of underwater data centers is susceptible to service loss due to the launch of missiles from submarines in defense applications. Underwater data centers are susceptible to service loss from the launch of missiles from submarines. Hence, it is necessary to design a network architecture that ensures continued service delivery when nuclear attacks occur. The presented research proposes a novel network architecture enabling service continuity in the underwater data center. The proposed architecture incorporates resiliency and comprises terrestrial and non–terrestrial data centers. The proposed network architecture incorporates redundancy and utilizes terrestrial and non-terrestrial data centers. In addition, the research presents a protocol enabling co-existence between underwater data centers and missile launching submarines used in defence applications. The research formulates and evaluates the operational duration, number of packets forwarding paths, and computing resource utilization as the metrics. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed network architecture improves the operational duration and computing resource utilization by an average of (27.7–71.5)% and (23.5–44.2)%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed network architecture enables the realization of more resilient paths. The use of more resilient paths enhances packet transmission. Evaluation shows that the proposed network architecture enhances the number of resilient packets forwarding paths by (18.2–57.4)% on average.},

  abstract     = {In the era of digital economy, the digital innovation of manufacturing enterprises has become the main trend of development. This paper constructs an effective and reliable hierarchical framework for identifying critical factors of digital innovation in manufacturing enterprises based on the three stage hybrid DEMATEL–ISM–MICMAC method. Through literature reading and expert judgment, this paper determines the 19 factors that affect the digital innovation of manufacturing enterprises. The DEMATEL technique is used to establish the causal relationship between the factors, the ISM technique is used to stratify the factors, and the MICMAC technique is used to divide the types of influencing factors according to the driving force and dependence, and analyze the correlation between each level and its influence on the digital innovation of manufacturing enterprises. The results show that social capital, learning organization, digital technology, and knowledge are the most important influencing factors in the process of digital innovation in manufacturing enterprises. In particular, the two key factors of social capital and learning organization should be paid attention to by manufacturing enterprises. This research can help the managers of manufacturing enterprises to find out the key influencing factors of the digital innovation of manufacturing enterprises, and give targeted suggestions to promote the process of enterprise digitalization.},

  abstract     = {To realize and handle power consumption details of sustainability, power consumption efficiency measurement for an electromechanical system within a long-term period is critical. Practically, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is useful to measure power consumption efficiency of an electromechanical system for yielding relative efficiencies of peer decision-making units (DMUs). Generally, traditional DEA scarcely considered undesirable outputs, and thus Hwang et al. developed DEA with linear programming to measure DMUs with undesirable outputs. Based on above, inputs, desirable outputs, and undesirable outputs of DMUs in this paper are assumed into triangular fuzzy numbers for grasping data uncertainty and obtaining more messages. Since inputs and outputs of DMUs in Hwang et al.’s were shown by crisp values, DMUs with fuzzy inputs and outputs were unable to be measured. Due to Kao and Liu’s fuzzy efficiency measures in DEA, Hwang et al.’s is modified into fuzzy DEA to measure DMUs. In fuzzy DEA, DMUs composed of triangular fuzzy numbers are easily yielded their fuzzy efficiency values and then the efficiency values of fuzzy DMUs are rationally judged by corresponding judgement rules. With fuzzy DEA, efficient DMUs are clearly discriminated from inefficient ones, and then efficient DMUs are evaluated by fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) to find the optimal DMU. According to fuzzy DEA and TOPSIS, the power consumption efficiency of an electromechanical system within a long-term period for sustainability are rationally measured and evaluated.},

In this paper, the theory of reproducing kernel spaces (RKS) is utilized to solve singularly perturbed 2D parabolic convection–diffusion problems of delayed type. To this end, a series form for the solution is first constructed in reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then, the approximate solution is given as an $$\mathcal {N}$$ -term summation. The main contribution of the present research is that, for the first time, a novel formula is found for the homogenization of 2D initial-boundary-value problems. Furthermore, a semi-analytical RKS method is employed without employing the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm. We derive theorems to reveal stability and convergence properties which are examined by numerical experiments. The technique is especially suited for problems having boundary-layer behavior. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency, stability, and superiority of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a jellyfish search algorithm (JSA)-based offline method to design a DC voltage controller of AC/DC front-end converter (FEC) in a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system (WECS). First, a multi-objective tuning problem is formulated using a full-order converter model to achieve maximum utilization of converter parameters in controller design. Next, a normalized mono-objective problem is developed using a utopia-tracking approach to reduce the computational complexity in design. Finally, the mono-objective problem is solved using JSA to enhance the controller performance by obtaining optimal gain values for the controller. A comparative study is performed with other metaheuristic optimization techniques to justify the use of JSA in this application. The results confirm that the accuracy of the JSA-based approach is higher, whereas the execution time of the method is lower than the other methods. Furthermore, to validate the performance of the proposed approach, a DFIG-based WECS is modeled and simulated using OPAL-RT real-time simulator. A grid voltage-oriented vector control is used as the overall control algorithm for the FEC. Unlike the conventional pole-zero cancellation method, the proposed approach provides no voltage overshoot during voltage development. Compared to the published literature, it also ensures 40.65% lesser voltage deviation without any overcurrent, irrespective of wind speed and load variations.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on optimizing the laser cladding process parameters of WC/Inconel 625 composite on a low-carbon steel substrate. This process aims to improve industrial parts’ wear and corrosion properties in corrosive and high-temperature environments. Laser power, laser cladding speed, powder-feeding rate, and WC content percentage were process input parameters, each at three levels. The dilution ratio and micro-hardness of samples were considered as process responses. Taguchi orthogonal arrays were employed for experimental design, and the results were analyzed using signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance. A linear regression model was developed to understand the relationship between process parameters and responses. In addition, two-objective optimization of the process parameters using the second-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and a hybrid algorithm based on the multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (MOWOAGA) were carried out to determine the optimal parameters that minimize the dilution ratio and maximize the cladding hardness. The results showed that the laser power and the powder-feeding rate have the most excellent effect on the dilution ratio. In contrast, WC content percentage and powder-feeding rate strongly affect micro-hardness. Based on the applied meta-heuristic algorithms and confirmed by experimental tests, the laser power of 370 W, laser cladding speed of 4 mm/s, powder-feeding rate of 8 g/min, and WC content percentage of 20.5% are the most optimal process parameters that lead to micro-hardness of 397 Vickers and dilution percentage of 2.5%.

  abstract     = {The realm of complex network analysis is witnessing a surge in research focus on community detection. Numerous algorithms have been put forth, each harboring distinct advantages and drawbacks. Predominantly, these algorithms rely solely on network topologies for community detection. Yet, many real-world networks harbor valuable node content that intricately mirrors the fabric of their communities. Recognizing this, leveraging node contents stands as a potential avenue to augment the quality of community detection. This study introduces an innovative evolutionary algorithm rooted in the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to propel community detection in complex networks by intertwining content and structural information. Noteworthy is its departure from the conventional multi-chromosome evolutionary algorithms, opting for a single-chromosome design that substantially curtails computational complexity. The algorithm employs a distinctive FAHP-based local operator, termed the community topological modifier, to refine community structures and elevate the quality of community detection within the current generation. A novel criterion for gauging content similarity among nodes is integrated into the algorithm. Additionally, an early fusion approach is suggested, creating a hybrid graph that amalgamates structural and content information between nodes. Rigorous evaluation in diverse real networks ensued, with comparative analyses against state-of-the-art and traditional methods. Notably, the proposed algorithm emerged as the frontrunner, securing top rankings across all evaluation criteria—such as normalized mutual information (NMI) and adjusted Rand index (ARI)—based on the results of the Friedman test.},

The hybrid system&#39;s performance was investigated using nine different traffic conditions and four different intersection geometries. The hybrid system was compared with three controller systems which are a fixed-time signal controller, a signal controller based on the FPA approach (FPA_TSC), and the optimized Type-1 fuzzy logic signal controller (Type-1 FL-TSC). The HTSC approach achieved the best performance with about 32% improvement over the fixed-time traffic controller and it showed 5% and 6% better performance than the FPA_TSC and Type-1 FL-TSC, respectively. Considering the performance of the new hybrid system, it is effective in minimizing delays and driver dissatisfaction occurring from signalization. It also contributes to the reduction of emissions and fuel consumption. The HTSC approach can be used as an alternative signal control method in the control of intersections with high traffic volume due to its fast and effective performance.},

The problem has several applications in telecommunications network design. It also has applications in reliable container transportation network design and public transportation. Even if the problem has been studied for several decades, it appears, to the best of our knowledge, that the associated polytope is not well known, even when $$L \in \{2,3\}$$ . In this paper, we are particularly interested in the polyhedral analysis of the problem as well as an exact solving of the problem for large-scale instances. We consider the case where $$L \in \{2,3\}$$ and present two integer programming formulations introduced in Diarrassouba et al. (2016). Then, we consider the polytope associated with these formulations, and present several new classes of valid inequalities, involving the so-called design variables. We also present separation algorithms for these inequalities and devise Branch-and-Cut algorithms for solving the problem. Finally, we present an extensive computational study for $$L \in \{2,3\}$$ and $$k \in \{3,4,5\}$$ , in which we test the efficiency of our Branch-and-Cut algorithms. We also compare the algorithm against a resolution using CPLEX Branch-and-Cut and CPLEX Benders Decomposition frameworks. The results show that our Branch-and-Cut algorithm can be competitive against these two frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Due to the environment&#39;s instability, to reduce inconsistent power supply it is preferable to connect two or more RES in a grid. Harmonics and other power quality issues are introduced into the distribution grid as a result of integrating these Hybrid Renewable Energy Storage (HRES) with nonlinear loads, which is a significant concern for the utility and the consumers, respectively. With the use of the Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC), power quality problems such as voltage interruptions, actual power, and reactive power can be reduced. For optimal operation of the series and shunt compensator of UPQC, the outputs of the converters are controlled by PWM signals, which are optimally tuned by controllers implemented with updated algorithms. An optimized Hybrid metaheuristic-assisted collateral controller comprising of fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FOPID) controller cum (proportional integral (PI) controller for the enhancement of the Three-Phase HRES system-based Distribution Grid integrated with UPQC is developed in this paper. The UPQC reduces the harmonics that non-linear loads feed into the power supply and power quality concerns. The DC link voltage regulation and controller optimization are achieved with the optimal tuning of gain parameters, fractional orders and weight parameters using a hybrid Metaheuristic Algorithm named Amplified Slime Mould with WildeBeest Herd Optimization (ASM-WHO) Algorithm. The proposed system is developed in MATLAB Simulink to compare the effectiveness of compensation for voltage sags and surges and total harmonic distortion (THD) to more traditional approaches, UPQC with PI controller, FOPID-PI controller, FOPID-PI with Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), SOA, SMA, and WHO optimization.

  abstract     = {Given the ever-growing electricity consumption and environmental anxiety with the predominant usage of conventional fuels in power plants, it is crucial to explore suitable alternatives to address these issues. Renewable energy sources (RESs) have emerged as the preferred choice for meeting energy requirements due to their minimal pollution. This study proposes a new idea to minimize operational costs and achieve the most cost-effective grid with minimum cost. Meanwhile, the transportation sector is gradually replacing conventional fossil-cars with electric ones, specifically plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which have gained significant consideration. These vehicles can join to the main grid and engage in energy exchange through grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies. Additionally, the concept of microgrid (MG) is proposed to optimize the potential of PEVs through smart infrastructure. Using the V2G capability, the operating costs are reduced, providing opportunities to incorporate PEVs into the network. Therefore, effective operation of MGs becomes highly significant. This paper suggests management of a MG consisting of PEVs and RESs. The approach utilizes a stochastic programming technique called unscented transformation (UT). The problem is addressed as a single-objective stochastic optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the operation cost. The proposed approach employs the hybrid whale optimization algorithm and pattern search (HWOA–PS) to solve the stochastic problem. The obtained outcomes are compared with those of other approaches to validate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In response to the challenges of global warming to sustainable development, electric vehicles (EVs) have become an important part of the supply chain. Numerous studies have focused on the electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) to design an optimal routing plan for EVs and meet customers’ demands within th e specified time windows. However, most studies have been conducted in deterministic situations and neglected the uncertain travel time in reality. Therefore, this study proposes a novel mean–standard-deviation-based EVRPTW model and describes uncertain travel time with the expected travel time, travel time variance, and reliable parameters. Besides, the proposed model considers the partial recharge policy and capacitated recharge stations in an uncertain environment, and proposes a time-discrete state-space-time-energy representation network to better simulate real-world situations. To effectively solve the proposed model, a new Lagrangian relaxation and extended alternating direction method of multipliers (LR–EADMM)-based decomposition algorithm is proposed. In the LR–EADMM, dynamic penalty parameters and subgradient method are employed to update the Lagrangian multipliers, strengthen the algorithmic convergence, and improve the quality of solutions. Furthermore, to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several comparison experiments are conducted with the Gurobi optimizer and two baseline algorithms. With reliable parameter 0, the experimental results show that the average upper bounds obtained by LR–EADMM is 0.78% greater than the best-known solutions. With reliable parameters 1 and 2, the average gap between lower and upper bounds obtained by LR–EADMM is 8.08% smaller than that obtained by baseline algorithm in solving small instances, and the average upper bounds obtained by LR–EADMM is, respectively, 3.01% and 5.71% better than those obtained by two baseline algorithms in solving large instances.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we proposed a data relay system consisting of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and acess point (AP) with the aim of maximizing the minimum receiving rate of Internet of things devices (IoTDs) as the optimization objective. To enhance the utilization of communication resources, we employed non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques at the AP side. In addition, we used the Wireless power transmission (WPT) technique on the UAV side to charge the IoTDs and prolong their operational lifetime. We formulated the problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To solve the MINLP problem, it was decomposed into four subproblems: connection scheduling between UAVs and IoTDs, time slot allocation, UAV trajectory, and AP’s power distribution. Finally, we solved all subproblems by using convex optimization techniques, such as successive convex approximations (SCA), and proposed an iterative algorithm. In the simulation, we compared our proposed algorithm with different optimization schemes. The results indicated that our scheme outperforms the others.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting for the different time-series data plays a major role in predicting future analysis that can increase economic benefits. Many research models have been attempted earlier but pose certain challenges due to the random characteristics of the original time-series data in obtaining high-precision forecasting results. To this end, we propose a hybrid convolutional-based extreme learning model named Convolutional Multi-Layer Deep Extreme Learning Machine (CMDELM) adopted with the Extended Elephant Herd Optimization Algorithm (E2HOA) that performs deeper feature extraction with faster learning of optimized features. Also, an Edge-aware Attribute-based Dynamic Graph learning (EADGL) approach is proposed to ensure that the graph-structured network incorporates edge-level information for effective future learning. The CMDELM network employs stacked multiple convolutional ELM layers that use several hidden layers with dense connections to learn high-level features for enhancing forecast accuracy. Dense connections are utilized in the proposed CMDELM task of integrating ELM with CNN to aid the network in extracting feature maps from shallow layers. Moreover, the network&#39;s performance is enhanced by adjusting the convolutional kernel sizes and integrating them into the residual unit. Following the convolutional model of a fully connected network, the deep ELM layer is linked to produce the predicted classes for the forecasts. In the forecasting stage, we adopt the E2HOA strategy to optimize the computational parameters for all learning layers and predict an accurate future forecast signal. The E2HOA algorithm improves the separation and updation phases with the consideration of a newborn calf in the elephant herd. E2HOA incorporates new clans and updates them using a threshold value to determine their inclusion, thus achieving an optimal outcome. This makes the learning network achieve the final solution with the optimal key parameters of the CMDELM network. Experimental results covering different competitive models and the evaluated results indicate that our proposed hybrid forecasting system obtains satisfactory accuracy with a Root Mean Square percentage Error (RMSPE) and Symmetric Mean absolute percentage Error (SMAPE) of below 22%, respectively, for PM2.5 concentration, electricity price, and wind speed forecasting results. Hence, the experimental outcomes show that the proposed model performs well in terms of accuracy and provides constant forecasting of time-series.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is among the best evolutionary algorithms for global optimization. However, the basic DE has several shortcomings, like the slow convergence speed, and it is more likely to be stuck at local optima. Additionally, DE&#39;s performance is sensitive to its mutation strategies and control parameters for mutation and crossover. In this scope, we present in this paper three mechanisms to overcome DE limitations. First, two novel mutations called DE/mean-current/2 and DE/best-mean-current/2 are proposed and integrated in the DE algorithm, and they have both exploration ability and exploitation trend. On the other hand, to avoid being trapped in local minima of hard functions, a new exploration operator has been proposed called Weibull flight based on the Weibull distribution. Finally, new adapted control parameters based on the Weibull distribution are integrated. These parameters contribute to the optimization process by adjusting mutation scale and alleviating the parameter setting problem often encountered in various metaheuristics. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms called meanDE, MDEW, AMDE, and AMDEW is validated through intensive experimentations using classical tests, some challenging tests, the CEC2017, CEC2020, the most recent CEC2022, four constraint engineering problems, and the data clustering problem. Moreover, comparisons with several popular, recent, and high-performance optimization algorithms show a high effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in locating the optimal or near-optimal solutions with higher efficiency. The experiments clearly indicate the effectiveness of the new mutations compared to the standard DE mutations. Moreover, the proposed Weibull flight has a great capacity to deal with the hard composition functions of CEC benchmarks. Finally, the use of adapted control parameters for the mutation scale helps overcome the parameter setting problem commonly encountered in various metaheuristics.},

  abstract     = {This paper developed a new and efficient approach, the metaheuristic optimisation approach based on the Kalman filter (KF), to accurately identify the infinite impulse response (IIR) system coefficients. A recently developed metaheuristic optimisation technique called the manta-ray foraging optimisation (MRFO) algorithm has been employed to solve the proper parameters tuning exertion of KF. The problem of achieving better unknown state estimations by the conventional KF is closely connected with decent prior information about the noise statistics (measurement and process noise). However, the statistics mentioned above depend on the types of applications and process dynamics. The use of insufficiently known priori filter statistics would reduce the precision of the estimated filter or sometimes lead to a practical divergence of the filter. To alleviate this problem, the proposed technique initially produces optimally tuned KF parameters using the MRFO algorithm, and then the conventional KF method estimates the coefficients of the IIR model using the optimised KF parameters obtained at the beginning. The simulation studies have been carried out on three distinct order benchmark IIR systems (both same and reduced-order), and two prominent IIR applications called direct current (DC) motor and fractional order digital differentiator (FODD) using the proposed method. The overall identification results demonstrate that the proposed MRFO-KF technique significantly improves performance metrics over competing techniques, such as basic KF, other employed metaheuristic-based KF schemes and recently reported state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the intricate integration and synchronization of supplier selection with the optimal scheduling of multi-mode resource-constrained projects, which is a genuine and complex challenge prevalent in the construction industry, by proposing new multi-objective mathematical modeling considering various items. Within this context, a multifaceted network of concurrent projects (multi-project) is examined with different suppliers’ resources (multi-supplier) to minimize the overall projects’ delay times and associated costs. The mathematical model formulation also incorporates diverse implementation modes (multi-mode) and the time value of money (TVM). To use and unravel the complexities of the proposed model, two distinct algorithms, including a multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (WOA) based on the Pareto archive and the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), are employed. The algorithms were subjected to a comparative analysis of several sample problems and evaluated against multi-objective criteria, including quality metric (QM), diversity metric (DM), spacing metric (SM), number of solutions (NOS), mean Ideal distance (MID), and computational time. The evaluation reveals that the tailored multi-objective WOA outperforms NSGA-II, exhibiting greater solution precision and diversity. The WOA demonstrates an enhanced ability to efficiently explore the problem’s feasible solution space, albeit at the increased computational time to pinpoint optimal solutions. Notably, the validity and practicality of the proposed model and method were field-tested within the context of construction projects in Iran, with the obtained results juxtaposed against the real-world data. The comparative analysis indicates that implementing the scheduling approach and solution methodology espoused by the multi-objective WOA led to significant improvements, with financial gains of up to 6% and time savings reaching 16%. Overall, this research substantiates the proposed model and algorithms’ benefits in reducing project costs and delays, offering valuable insights for construction industry practitioners.},

The core technical challenge lies in the application of visual question answering (VQA). However, visual question answering currently faces several challenges. Firstly, the acquisition of human annotations is costly, and secondly, existing models require expensive retraining when replacing a particular module. We propose the VLM2LLM model, which significantly improves the performance of multimodal question-answering tasks by integrating visual-language matching and large-scale language models. Specifically, it overcomes the limitations of requiring massive computational resources for training and inference in previous models. Furthermore, it allows for the upgrading of our LLM version according to the latest research advancements and needs. The results demonstrate that the VLM2LLM model achieves the highest accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art models on three datasets: QAv2, A-OKVQA, and OK-VQA.

In the presence of uncertainty, classical SMEs are not sufficient to handle such problems. Therefore, SMEs with fuzzy numbers are an effective way to model matrix equations in such situations. Previous literature has only provided solutions to fully fuzzy Sylvester matrix equations (FFSME) with positive coefficients. However, the proposed method in this paper can solve TrFFSME without any restriction on the sign of the coefficients. The TrFFSME is converted to an equivalent system of four crisp SMEs using a newly developed arithmetic fuzzy multiplication operation. The resulting system of SME is solved by fuzzy Bartels –Stewart method. The proposed method extends the scope of the TrFFSME in scientific applications and provides a direct method to the fuzzy solution. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It presents several advantages, since it is far less invasive, does not require sedation and has less potential complications compared to standard endoscopy. Hence, it might be exploited as alternative to the standard procedure. WCE is used to diagnosis a variety of gastro-intestinal diseases such as polyps, ulcers, Crohn’s disease and hemorrhages. Nevertheless, WCE videos can contain thousands of images per patient that must be screened by medical specialists, besides, the capsule free mobility and technological limits cause production of a low quality images. In this paper, a Nouvel method based on Dense-UNet deep learning segmentation model is presented. This approach aims at red lesion, ulcer and polyp detection from WCE images.

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic prediction is indispensable for relieving traffic congestion and people’s daily trips. Nevertheless, accurate traffic flow prediction is still challenging due to the traffic network’s complex and dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies. Most existing methods usually ignore the dynamicity of spatial dependencies or have limitations, as using the self-attention mechanism for capturing dynamic spatial dependencies is computation forbidden in large networks. In addition, there are both short- and long-range dynamic temporal dependencies, which are not well captured. To overcome these limitations, we propose an intelligent dynamic spatial and temporal graph convolutional system for traffic flow prediction. First, we propose a dynamic spatial block to capture the complex and dynamic spatial dependencies, which is computation-friendly. Next, we propose a dynamic temporal block to capture the complex and dynamic temporal dependencies, which well balances the short- and long-range dynamic temporal dependencies. We validate and analyze the performance of the proposed method through extensive experiments on two traffic datasets. Analysis of results demonstrates that our proposed model has better prediction performance than the state-of-art baselines. Compared with the best contrast methods, the proposed method improves by 2.28% and 8.01% in terms of the mean absolute error on PEMS04 and PEMS08 datasets.},

  abstract     = {With the rising of the concept of balanced diet, more and more people pay attention to the healthy meal plans. However, a meal plan is usually difficult to meet people’s taste preferences and health standards at the same time. Aiming at the problem, we propose a novel method to generate health meal plan for different users with meeting their taste. Specifically, we firstly calculate the recommendation score for each dish based on the ranking order of the recipe in the recommendation list, and the recommendation score is used to represent the user’s preference. The fat, carbohydrate, sodium and other nutrients in the recipe were then calculated based on the recipe’s ingredient content. The problem of meal plan generation is regarded as an optimization problem with constraints, that is, to maximize the recommended score of the meal plan under the condition that all nutrients in the meal plan meet the health standards. In this way, we approximately solve the problem of the balance between user’s taste and the recipe’s health by introducing a genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that the average recommended score of the meal plan generated by our method is 22.7, which indicates that the generated meal plan satisfy users’ preference, and a survey involved 81 volunteers also supported this conclusion. Besides, the experimental results show more than 80% of the meal plans generated by our method are healthy when comparing with the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Association rule mining (ARM) is a widely used technique in data mining for pattern discovery. However, association rule mining in numerical data poses a considerable challenge. In recent years, researchers have turned to optimization-based approaches as a potential solution. One particular area of interest in numerical association rules mining (NARM) is controlling the length of itemset intervals. In this paper, we propose a novel evolutionary algorithm based on the multi-objective firefly algorithm for efficiently mining numerical association rules (MOFNAR). MOFNAR utilizes Balance, square of cosine (SOC) and comprehensibility as objectives of evolutionary algorithm to assess rules and achieve a rule set that is both simple and accurate. We introduce the Balance measure to effectively control the intervals of numerical itemsets and eliminate misleading rules. Furthermore, we suggest a penalty approach, and the crowding-distance method is employed to maintain high diversity. Experimental results on five well-known datasets show the effectiveness of our method in discovering a simple rule set with high confidence that covers a significant percentage of the data.},

  abstract     = {Due to the speedy development of mobile communication devices, the traditional cloudlet computing networks struggle to manipulate the huge collected data from these devices. Mobile computing has been developed to overcome the access delay (AD) and the workload balance (WB) in the traditional cloudlet networks by transferring the computing process from the remote servers in the cloudlet to the edge servers (ESs) allocated closer to the mobile users. The searching for the optimal place to allocate the ESs in mobile edge computing is the main challenge and it considers an NP-hard problem. In this work, we propose a new objective function with threefold objectives, the AD between base stations and ESs, the WB among various controlled ESs, and the energy consumption (EC) of ESs. Therefore, we formulate the edge server allocation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem that requires an efficient optimizer algorithm for solving it. To minimize the proposed objective function, we present an effective fitness-dependent optimizer (EFDO) algorithm and test it on Shanghai Telecom’s BS dataset. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed EFDO algorithm, we compare it against seven algorithms taken from literature (e.g., K-means, Random, TopFirst, PSO, CSA, Jaya, and JS). The numerical results verified the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms fitness function reached up to 14.84%, 18.56%, 17.28%, and 13.48% when compared with PSO, CSA, Jaya, and JS, respectively with various number of base stations and edge servers. Although k-means has been achieved the least average AD among compared algorithms which considered only the distance between the BS and ES, the proposed algorithm has achieved the superior results in WB ranged from 12 to 72% when compared against other algorithms. In addition, it has gained the least average EC among the compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {To safeguard the content from malicious devices and users and to provide authentication and security to the transmitted content, it becomes mandatory to devise a combined watermarking and encryption algorithm. This paper addresses this concern by developing an algorithm to authenticate and encrypt the image before transmitting it safely. The algorithm was established using a watermarking technique. The watermarking was done by transforming the image into coefficients and embedding it in high-frequency components. The watermarked image was encrypted using a key generated using a combined logistical tent map and converted to DNA sequences. The sequences are stored and transmitted as such. At the receiver end, the image was recovered and de-watermarked. The label used for the watermark was compared with the obtained watermark at the receiver end. The proposed algorithm conforms to the required CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability). The algorithm was tested for images in the Standard Test images database. On average, for an encrypted image, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) was 9.1934 dB and had an entropy of 7.999 bits. The correlation coefficient of 0.0001, 0.0019, and 0.0003 for horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions was obtained. The watermark could be satisfactorily recovered from the cover, even with the addition of noise. The extracted watermark had a PSNR above 30 dB, with normalized cross-correlation (NCC) above 0.9, bit error rate (BER) below 0.1 and structural similarity index metric (SSIM) above 0.9. These results make the proposed algorithm suitable for authentication and encryption.},

Maintaining security during data transmission using invisible watermarks has become a focus and has captured the attention of numerous researchers. The three security necessities, privacy, integrity, and authenticity, call for close attention and remedial actions. In this respect, watermarking and cryptographic techniques are a probable way to handle the above-mentioned issues adequately. The paper presents a novel approach to watermarking using a combination of NSST, HD, and SVD transforms, which improves the robustness and security of the watermarked image. The method involves using a grayscale image as the watermark and embedding it in multiple cover images. The resulting images are transformed sequentially using NSST, HD, and SVD to obtain the final watermarked images. The authors also apply AES encryption to enhance security, which generates a hash subkey and authentication tag. The proposed methodology performs better than other watermarking techniques, with a maximum improvement of 47.81%. Overall, the proposed approach offers a more secure and robust solution for watermarking.},

Establishing an accurate and reliable forecasting method for prediction of stream flow is very useful. Nowadays, data-driven methods are variously applied for river flow prediction. By hybridizing, one can take advantage of the cons of different methods for the proposed purpose. In the present research, we have combined SETAR and GARCH methods with ANN and also coupled MARS and CANFIS with SPSO to predict the monthly flow of the Maroon River in south west of Iran. Thus, four hybridized data-driven models of ANN–GARCH, ANN–SETAR, MARS–SPSO, and CANFIS–SPSO are developed and compared to see which method has the best performance. Although all the models yielded good results but it was seen that the ANN–SETAR model found more accurate answers in prediction of the stream flow with an average 5% higher accuracy in the results. The IQR of ANN–SETAR model is similar to observed value that this showed the efficiency of the ANN–SETAR for dependable simulation of extreme values of river flow compared to other models. So, it was concluded that the ANN–SETAR model is better than the other methods for forecasting the monthly streamflow.},

The classification of each type of failure is tested using Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbor.

  abstract     = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by abnormalities in the brain, leading to difficulties in social interaction and communication, as well as learning and attention. Early diagnosis of ASD is challenging as it mainly relies on detecting abnormalities in brain function, which may not be evident in the early stages of the disorder. Facial expression analysis has shown promise as an alternative and efficient solution for early diagnosis of ASD, as children with ASD often exhibit distinctive patterns that differentiate them from typically developing children. Assistive technology has emerged as a crucial tool in improving the quality of life for individuals with ASD. In this study, we developed a real-time emotion identification system to detect the emotions of autistic children in case of pain or anger. The emotion recognition system consists of three stages: face identification, facial feature extraction, and feature categorization. The proposed system can detect six facial emotions: anger, fear, joy, natural, sadness, and surprise. To achieve high-performance accuracy in classifying the input image efficiently, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture for facial expression recognition. An autoencoder was used for feature extraction and feature selection, and a pre-trained model (ResNet, MobileNet, and Xception) was applied due to the size of the dataset. The Xception model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.9523%, sensitivity of 0.932, specificity of 0.9421, and AUC of 0.9134%. The proposed emotion detection framework leverages fog and IoT technologies to reduce latency for real-time detection with fast response and location awareness. Using fog computing is particularly useful when dealing with big data. Our study demonstrates the potential of using facial expression analysis and deep learning algorithms for real-time emotion recognition in autistic children, providing medical experts and families with a valuable tool for improving the quality of life for individuals with ASD.},

The compressive strength of binary and ternary blended concrete at 28 days of curing period was modeled using seven quantitative input parameters such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, superplasticizer, water, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate based on three different training and testing (Tr–Te) scenarios. The performance of the models developed was analyzed based on several statistical evaluation metrics, of error and efficiency. During the testing phase, the compressive strength estimates obtained via modeling using ANN, GTB, and MARS had Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) values of 0.8389, 0.8602, and 0.8423, respectively, for the first Tr–Te scenario; similarly, the KGE values were 0.8025/0.8830, 0.8541/0.8901, and 0.8434/0.8582, respectively, for the second/third Tr–Te scenarios. The estimation accuracy of the GTB model was relatively superior to that of the ANN and MARS models, taking into consideration both the error and efficiency indices. All three models perform relatively well for the first I/O combination compared to the other two combinations.},

As the aging society intensifies, many elderly people living alone are facing life-threatening situations brought on by sudden heart attacks or infarctions. Researchers have been investigating vision-based, economical, and effective ways to monitor health status in real time in recent years. Motivated by this, this work presents a dual-stream network framework that takes into account both facial features and general whole image features and employs the feature interaction strategies in the framework structure. Furthermore, to cope with the lack of relevant datasets, we propose a novel image dataset for the detection of chest pain and falls which are the significant vital signs of myocardial infarction. With an accuracy of 88.98 $$\%$$ , our approach validates the viability of identifying cases of myocardial infarction in practical situations. Numerous experiments demonstrate our proposed framework’s effectiveness and its extensibility to be deployed on mobile smart platforms.},

Firstly, a ship energy consumption estimation model is presented by analyzing the influence of wind, wave, and current on energy consumption. Secondly, two process evaluation indexes are designed for the quality and diversity of the paths in the optimization process. Based on these indexes, three improvements are presented to enhance the performance of the ant colony system. These improvements include (a) an adaptive state transition rule adjusted dynamically based on the information entropy, (b) the number of ants contributing to the global updating rule and the corresponding update value are controlled dynamically based on the quality of the path, and (c) an improved recombination mechanism. Besides, an improved turning point optimization method and B-spline curve are introduced for path post-processing.

  abstract     = {The education sector is a rapidly growing global infrastructure for human resources. It is an essential and sensitive data-containing sector where sensitive private information about the user is included in the data. The incorporation of digital twins (DT) into virtual representations is used in higher education to enhance data analytic performance. However, the DT-enabled industry generates enormous amounts of data, making it challenging to manage security and privacy. The management of personal data by human resources involved in critical and resource-constrained tasks has increased since the globalization of Industry 5.0 and the higher education sector. Managing the security and privacy of users’ private data through global data collection methods poses significant challenges. We present a framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in blockchain-based industry 5.0, with a use-case for higher education that integrates blockchain and deep learning (DL). The framework begins by introducing a new DT model that makes creating a virtual environment to model and replicate security-critical processes in higher education easier. Second, we propose a higher education data analysis model, so that blockchain-based data are ready for the fully functional higher education DT model. At last, the security and cost analyses of the proposed system are presented. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is used for the deep learning model. A custom Python-based blockchain with a proof-of-authentication consensus algorithm is used to implement the blockchain. Our proposed system is designed in such a way that it includes the higher education sector with the concepts of blockchain technology, digital twin, and Industry 5.0. The efficiency and throughput results of the blockchain show that the proposed system is better than the digital twin-based developed systems. The novelty of our proposed system is that educational blockchain with Industry 5.0 is conceptualized and implemented with deep learning models.},

In this study, a deep learning architecture, namely ResNet, aims to classify schizophrenia is proposed. The proposed system transforms wavelet sub-bands of the electroencephalogram into two-dimensional image space, which is considered the main unique contribution of the study. Thus, the disease indicators and features included in images could be figured out. Moreover, a discussion on the class activation maps was made to give a wide perspective on the features related to the disease. The proposed system was implemented on a large-scale electroencephalogram database containing records from unhealthy and healthy patients in various phases. The ResNet was implemented in three modes to give a thorough perspective in terms of the metrics of the diagnosis accuracy. The proposed system achieves 92.94% diagnosis accuracy rate, and the result shows that the proposed transformation-based solution is owing to the features related to schizophrenia disease.},

However, in the typical BAS algorithm, there are problems such as the insufficient optimization ability of beetle individuals and the lack of consideration of historical dynamic information in the algorithm search process, resulting in sufferings from local optimum, low diversity, and imbalanced utilization, etc. To solve these problems, an improved beetle swarm antennae search algorithm based on multiple operators, dubbed MO-BSAS, is proposed. First, the elite opposition-based learning is used to initialize the beetle population, which improves the population diversity and optimization ability of the algorithm; then, the Lévy Flight strategy is used to improve the traditional beetle moving operator. In addition, a multi-operator search strategy determined by the damped sinusoidal probability factor is designed to balance the exploitation and exploration capabilities of the algorithm and speed up its convergence. The MO-BSAS algorithm is compared with BSA and 8 popular or state-of-the-art smart algorithms under 14 different benchmark functions, and the experimental results show that the MO-BSAS algorithm has a shorter convergence time and better convergence accuracy than the algorithms compared, which verifies the effectiveness of the improved algorithm.},

To do so, we present the fractional interval Pontryagin’s minimum principle for the extraction of necessary optimality conditions. The obtained conditions are first transformed into a system of Volterra integral equations and then using the Laplace transform method, we solve these equations and obtain the optimal solutions. One of the key points of this method is to keep the continuous form of the problems, which we can change to an equivalent form without discretizing it and proving the existence of its solution.

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization approach (PSO) has illustrated promising performance on a variety of optimization problems. The critical issues that must be addressed in PSO research are how to balance conflicts around exploration, exploitation, and reasonably distribute computational resources. In this paper, a neighborhood-aware N states Markovian Switching PSO algorithm (NS-MJPSOloc) is proposed, where we have employed a local search based approach. The neighborhood of PSO algorithm is a single particle itself in the early stages of optimization. The neighborhood will eventually expand to include all particles as the amount of generations increases. The search space is segmented into N potential states according to the size of problem. The value of N is dependent on the dimension of problem space. Every iteration serves a transition probability-based Markovian switching technique to estimate the acceleration coefficients in an adaptable way. The transition probability determines the next state and adequate values for acceleration coefficients. Through adopting a local search strategy while interacting with all other particles in the group, every particle possesses a chance of improving itself. Moreover, new features have been incorporated to accomplish accuracy and stability. The primary contributions of the proposed work are to enhance the topological structure of a recently developed PSO variant by using a local search (loc) mechanism rather than a global (gbest) approach. The purpose of this idea is to develop a more adaptable and less sensitive novel version of PSO that can handle multi-modal and highly challenging problems. The proposed algorithm was then tested using a variety of uni-modal, multi-modal and rotated benchmark functions. The experimental findings show that the proposed NS-MJPSOloc outperformed most of the current versions in terms of accuracy and convergence time, notably for multi-modal problems.},

  abstract     = {Avionics systems are a crucial part of aircraft, and the heterogeneity of resources also leads to load differentials within these systems. Inefficient load balancing technology faces the dual challenge of over-utilization and under-utilization of resources, which results in the decline of service performance (in the case of over-utilization) or the waste of resources (in the case of under-utilization). However, it is necessary to control avionics systems via an efficient load balancing method under time constraints and resource states. Therefore, this paper proposes a load balancing method for avionics systems using both artificial bee colony and simulated annealing algorithms. First, the load balancing model of avionics systems is established; this model can reflect the demands of the tasks for the resources in detail. Then, the load balancing of avionics systems is realized by artificial bee colony and simulated annealing algorithms, the hybrid algorithm not only retains the advantages of simple and easy implementation of ABC algorithm, but also utilizes the probability jump of SA algorithm to jump out of the local extreme and achieve the effect of global optimization. Finally, compared with the existing algorithms, the experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper produces a good and stable load balance performance.},

However, most of the existing algorithms for large-scale multi-objective optimization require a significant number of problem evaluations to achieve satisfactory results, which makes the optimization process very inefficient. To address this issue, a fast interpolation-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this paper for solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems with high convergence speed and accuracy. In the proposed algorithm, decision variables are generated based on a small number of variables using an interpolation function. With this approach, only a small number of variables need to be optimized, so that the convergence speed can be greatly improved to make it possible to obtain satisfactory results with relatively low computation cost. The experimental results verified the superiority of our proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence speed and convergence accuracy on 108 test instances with up to 1000 decision variables.},

  abstract     = {The stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithm, among population-based metaheuristic automation algorithms, is a robust optimization algorithm for solving optimization problems in different fields of science, inspired by the diffusion feature and natural growth phenomenon seen regularly in random fractals. However, as in population-based optimization algorithms, it is a great challenge to effectively design the selection process in the SFS method. To imitate the selection process in nature effectively and accurately, the dynamic-fitness-distance-balance (dFDB) selection method has been used in the SFS algorithm in six different versions. In this way, the dFDB-SFS algorithm has been developed, which more effectively mimics nature with exploitation, exploration, and balanced search capabilities. Firstly, the performance of the proposed dFDB-SFS algorithm was investigated in CEC 2020 benchmark test functions. Wilcoxon and Friedman statistical analyses of the results obtained from the test functions were made and according to these analysis results, the best version of the proposed approach was determined. Secondly, the performance of the proposed algorithm was investigated in determining photovoltaic module parameters, which is one of the real-world engineering problems. In this article, the dFDB-SFS algorithm uses the root mean square error (RMSE) as the objective function to estimate the unknown parameters of the single diode model (SDM), double diode model (DDM), and PV module models. In terms of a quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation, it reveals that the proposed algorithm provides better results than other proposed algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness when obtaining PV parameters.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining power balance between generation and demand, as well as frequency regulation, is more difficult in a microgrid (MG) power system, especially when the MG is operating in island mode with the integration of renewable energy (RE) sources and a varying load profile. In this instance, an optimized automatic load frequency control (ALFC) is more successful in lowering frequency deviations and enhancing the stability and resilience of the MG network. Hence, this paper proposes a modified sperm swarm optimization (MSSO) technique for ALFC of a bio and renewable energy (RE) integrated MG system. A chaotic search based on a one-dimensional (1D) chaotic map is adopted to intensify the exploitation and exploration characteristics of the sperm swarm optimization algorithm. The proposed MSSO technique is used to tune the gains of the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller to regulate the frequency of the MG system through the minimization of the integral time absolute error (ITAE) of frequency deviation. The effectiveness of the technique is evaluated in terms of steady-state and transient performance indices for the response of frequency deviation. According to the evaluated results of frequency deviation obtained under different dynamic conditions, the suggested MSSO-tuned PID controller significantly improved transient indices such as settling time, control error, and peak overshoot by a maximum of 39.8%, 11.7%, and 68.9%, respectively, over PID controllers tuned with other techniques (Salp swarm algorithm (SSA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and sperm swarm optimization (SSO)). In addition, the steady-state indices such as IAE, ITAE, ISE, and ITSE were improved by a maximum of 86.6%, 93.9%, 96.2%, and 98.8%, respectively, using the suggested MSSO technique, as compared to other techniques. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed under varying load conditions, changes in system parameters, and real-time variation in RE sources to validate the resilience. The proposed MSSO technique outperforms other techniques in terms of steady-state and transient indices for the response to frequency deviations, as determined by sensitivity analysis results. The real-time implementation of the proposed controller for the MG system is validated in hardware-in-loop analysis with its stability analysis in the frequency domain.},

  abstract     = {Space weather profoundly impacts Earth and its surrounding space environment, necessitating improved prediction to safeguard critical infrastructure such as communication and satellites. Solar flares can disrupt communications and pose radiation risks to airline passengers. While traditional methods offer rough estimates of solar activity trends, the potential of artificial intelligence in this domain warrants exploration. This study addresses this research gap by evaluating the performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sunspot forecasting and assessing the suitability of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for solar event classification. Two publicly available datasets serve as the foundation for this research. To enhance algorithm performance through optimal hyperparameter selection, metaheuristic optimizers are employed. A unique contribution is the introduction of a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm, specifically tailored to the study’s needs. Two experiments were conducted: In the first, RNNs predicted sunspot occurrence up to three steps ahead. The best-performing model, optimized using the introduced modified metaheuristic, achieved an impressive $$R^2$$ value of 0.840448, surpassing competing algorithms. In the second experiment, XGBoost models assessed solar flare severity, with the top model again optimized by the modified metaheuristic, achieving an accuracy of 0.981565. This novel approach highlights the potential for enhancing solar activity forecasting techniques and offers valuable insights into feature impacts on model decisions, thereby advancing our understanding of space weather.},

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Adaptive Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Voting Regressor. In this study, the authors evaluated the performance of these models in predicting shear strength of RC deep beams by using metrics such as $$R^{2}$$ , Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Error. Furthermore, the authors optimize the ensemble learning models using customized hyperparameters. The XGBoost model exhibited the highest accuracy with an $$R^{2}$$ value of 0.92 and the least model error, with MAE of 29.65 and RMSE of 47.76 and MAPE of 9.79.The authors compared these models with mechanics-driven models from different country codes including the United States, China, Europe, British (CIRIA), Canada and found that ensemble learning models, specifically XGBoost, outperformed mechanics-driven models. The authors used an explainable machine learning (EML) technique called SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to gain additional insights into the developed XGBoost model. The outcomes of feature selection and SHAP analysis suggest that the grade of concrete and beam geometry predominantly influence the prediction of shear strength in RC deep beams, whereas steel properties exert minimal impact in this regard.},

The novel SEMPM mechanism grants a solution to the prediction of noise-free pixel in account of the noisy pixels whose surrounding window is completely packed by noisy data.

Furthermore, a Hermite broad-learning recurrent neural control (HBRNC) with HBRNN as the main controller is proposed, which requires no prior knowledge about the system dynamics and has no off-line learning phase. All the HBRNN network parameters are updated according to parameter learning laws through the gradient descent approach. To prevent network parameter overtraining of the HBRNN, a discrete-type Lyapunov function is used to determine the least upper bound for the learning rates. Additionally, an adaptive learning rate (ALR) approach is designed to dynamically fine-tune the learning rates within these specified limits, thereby achieving an optimal convergence speed between network parameters and tracking error. Finally, the HBRNC system with ALR is applied to a chaotic circuit and a reaction wheel pendulum, and its effectiveness is validated through simulation and experimentation.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new modified aquila optimizer for tuning the parameters of the FOPID controller, which has strong plant adaptability and can be applied to a large class of different controlled plants. A series of new operational mechanisms, including Tent map-based initialization, probability-based dynamic update, greedy-based Gauss mutation, a fully random search strategy with uniform distribution, and the wraparound dynamic weight update for local exploitation, are proposed to tackle the existing problems of the classical aquila optimizer, such as slow convergence, low precision, and local optimum. Standard benchmark functions are used to test the proposed modified aquila optimizer, showing superior performance in terms of convergence speed, precision, and robustness. The Wilcoxon and Friedman tests statistically proved the significant difference of the modified aquila optimizer from other competitors. Five control system cases with different plants further validate the effectiveness, feasibility, wide adaptability, and superiority of the proposed modified aquila optimizer for regulating FOPID controller parameters. It is approved that the proposed modified aquila optimizer with new mechanisms has wide plant adaptability, deeming a good prospect for the tuning of optimal FOPID controller.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an approach to create a high-quality quantum tent map by utilizing the generalized quantum dot system. Our objective is to determine if its chaos surpasses that of the traditional classic tent. To achieve this, we first introduce a quantum tent map, showcasing its chaotic behavior in relation to control parameters and initial conditions. We validate the presence of chaos by calculating the Lyapunov exponent and analyzing the time series. Next, we design a chaotic S-box based on this new map. Subsequently, we explore the possibility of obtaining strong S-boxes by employing two fractional stochastic models and three components of the proposed quantum tent map. Our primary question is whether the combination of fractional stochastic models and quantum tent maps can result in superior S-boxes. The answer to this question is a resounding “Yes.” The performance of these S-boxes exceeds that of previously proposed models. Finally, we evaluate a mixed S-box as the foundation for achieving highly secure image encryption. Among the models presented in this article, the best-performing S-box is produced through the combination of the fractional gamma distribution (FGD) with parameters $$\alpha =1.06$$ and $$\beta =2.8,$$ along with the X-quantum tent map dimension. This model achieves an SAC (Strict Avalanche Criterion) value of 0.5, surpassing even AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Its non-linearity value is 106.625, indicating excellent performance. Additionally, the model has an LP (Linear Property) value of 0.128906 and a DP (Differential Properties) score of 12. Furthermore, we obtain BIC-SAC 0.503209 and BIC-Non-linearity 103.679. Lastly, we present an image encryption algorithm to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mixed S-box, evaluating its performance against various attacks. The results affirm the suitability of this encryption method, with the generated image encryption offering a key space of $$2^{16960}$$ , ensuring high security. The example image exhibits an entropy value of 7.9311. Moreover, it demonstrates correlations in different orientations: horizontal (0.0076), vertical ( $$-0.00048659$$ ), and diagonal (0.00020717). The image also achieves NPCR (Number of Pixel Change Rate) at %99.63 and UACI (Unified Average Changing Intensity) at %33.96. Notably, the algorithm executes in an impressive time of 0.810653, particularly considering the utilization of new 64 S-boxes instead of a fixed one. Even the correlation value for some standard photos approaches 0.0000667, demonstrating smallest correlation. This article underscores the effectiveness of combining new methods to generate an S-box.},

Uncertain time series analysis is a set of statistical techniques that use uncertainty theory to predict future values based on the previously observed values. This paper presents an uncertain time series model to predict the UHWD based on annual series data. The case of Handan, a Chinese city, is then analyzed to predict the local UHWD. The results show that the prediction accuracy of uncertain time series model is higher than that of the traditional UHWD prediction models. Meanwhile, uncertain time series model is easy to use for the data like UHWD series. Therefore, this study concludes that uncertain time series analysis is suitable for describing the UHWD series of cities similar to Handan city.},

  abstract     = {Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning is the benchmark problem of multiple UAV application, which belongs to the non-deterministic polynomial problem. Its objective is to require multiple UAV to fly safely to the goal position according to their specific start position in three-dimensional space. This issue can be defined as a high-dimensional optimization problem, the solution of which requires optimization techniques with global optimization capabilities. Equilibrium optimizer (EO) is a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm. To improve the optimization ability of EO to solve high-dimensional problems, this paper proposes a modified equilibrium optimizer with generalized opposition-based learning (MGOEO), which improves the population activity by increasing the internal mutation and cross of the population. In addition, the generalized opposition-based learning is used to construct the population, which can effectively ensure that the algorithm has ability to jump out of the limitation of local optimal. First, numerical experiments show that MGOEO has better optimization precision than EO and several other swarm intelligent algorithms. Then, the paths of UAVs are simulated in three different obstacle environments. The simulation results show that MGOEO can obtain safe and smooth paths, which are better than EO and other eight state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.},

Based on these factors, we propose a many-objective 3D-DV-hop positioning model, and propose a data preprocessing strategy and outlier removal strategy. Finally, a fashionable many-objective optimization algorithm is employed to solve the model.

Utilizing ontology-based knowledge representation (KR) approaches in the field of grasping presents novel opportunities for designing effective object recognition modules. This research paper proposes the development of an ontology aimed at recognizing objects that have been grasped. The ontology, named OntOGrasp, encompasses various concepts, attributes, and relationships concerning the kinematics of the hand and the structural components of the object. To generate a dataset for grasp kinematics, a series of grasping experiments were conducted using carefully selected objects. A semantic feature selection approach was then introduced, leveraging the knowledge graph embedding technique, to identify practical features from the ontology. The grasp dataset was processed to extract relevant data pertaining to the selected features, which were subsequently employed to train classification algorithms for the task of object recognition. The integration of semantically suggested features resulted in a significant improvement in recognition accuracy for the classifiers, surpassing the performance achieved by using the complete feature set. The semantic features demonstrated an accuracy increase ranging from 1% to 9% across all classification algorithms, accompanied by a notable reduction in false positives and false negatives during object prediction. This enhanced object recognition accuracy substantiates the importance of knowledge modeling in incorporating practical aspects of a domain described through experimentation, thereby yielding plausible outcomes.},

Multicolor image (MCI) enables the diagnosis of DME by providing multiple spectral images of fundus structures.

A multi-spectral vision transformer model with an attention fusion (Atfusion) module is proposed in this paper for DME classification. The transformer extracts the global features of the image using a self-attentive mechanism. In addition, a novel fusion technique - AtFusion module is created to efficiently fuse the multi-spectral features from both branches. We examine the empirical performance of the proposed algorithm on our in-house data sets. The classifier is able to predict the DME status of MCIs with accuracy of 0.951, sensitivity of 0.931, specificity of 0.953, and AUC of 0.933.

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to recognize the sentiment polarities for opinion words with the aid of some machine learning or deep learning-based sentiment classification models. Dependency parsing has been considered as an efficient tool for identifying the opinion words in the sentiment text. However, many dependency-based methods might be susceptible to the dependency tree, which inevitably introduces noisy information due to that the rich relation information between words is neglected. In this paper, we propose a multi-feature fusion approach based on domain adaptive pretraining to reduce dependency-based noisy information for aspect-based sentiment classification (ASC). First, we utilize multi-task learning (MTL) for domain adaptive pretraining, which combines biaffine attention model (BAM) and mask language model (MLM) by jointly considering the structure, the relation semantics of edges, and the linguistic feature in the sentiment text. Second, to fully consider these different features affected with each other, a double graph fusion model is proposed, which takes as input the pretrained dependency graph into a message passing neural network (MPNN) initialized with the optimal parameters of the pretrained BAM for training. Lastly, extensive experiments were made against the state-of-the-art competitors over four benchmark datasets, and the results illustrate that our approach outperforms these competitors over most of the four datasets and achieves an accuracy of up to 92.69% and a macro-averaged F1 value of up to 85.79%. The MTL-based domain adaptive pretraining is efficient to achieve high-quality dependency parsing contributing to improving the performance of ASC, while maintaining lower computational cost.},

Subsequently, they are clustered based on features including age, type of insurance, referrer, and group of services received. Finally, the sequential rules for dental services are extracted and several scenarios are proposed to dental center managers for each cluster separately. Results indicate that the rules of dental services can lead to finding some treatment procedures for each cluster of patients to remind them of their subsequent referral.

Box–Behnken design-based response surface methodology (RSM) was used to develop 29 HPC mixes with a target compressive strength of 80 ± 10 MPa. Cement (450–500 kg/m3), aggregates (1500–1700 kg/m3), silica fume (SF) (20–45% weight of cement), and water–binder (w/b) ratio of (0.24–0.32) were provided as input factors; while, the compressive strength at 7 and 28 days were analyzed as responses. Datasets for the artificial neural network (ANN) prediction were generated from 87 experimental observations from the compressive strength test. Performance indicators such as p-value, coefficient of determination (R2), and mean square error (MSE) were used to assess the models. Results demonstrated that RSM worked relatively well in projecting compressive strength with model p-values &lt; 0.05 and R2 values of 0.913 and 0.892 for compressive strength at 7 and 28 days, respectively. In addition, RSM performed better in detecting the synergistic effects of the variables on the responses. On the other hand, ANN best generalized the relationship between independent and dependent variables considering the low MSE of 12.32 and 14.60, and high R2 values of 0.912 and 0.946 for compressive strength at 7 and 28 days, respectively. Model equations were developed to predict the compressive strength of silica-based HPC after 7 and 28 days.

  abstract     = {Identifying a target accurately in the presence of noise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images poses significant challenges considering various parameters, such as viewing angle and configuration changes. In this paper, SAR images are classified using the proposed convolutional neural network. The limitation of data concerning moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) database led us to develop a primary network (learning network) by employing the proposed N-Sigmoid function and training it using eight different satellite databases with images more than MSTAR. We saved the best weights for the main network. Next, we replace the weights of the two fully connected (FC) layers of the ResNet-50 with the saved weights of the training network and employed the main network for classification. Our proposed method’s primary contribution is twofold, based on the availability of additional information in heterogeneous SAR images and differences in intensity and clarity. First, we utilize the weights learned by the training network, and second, we keep negative neurons and neurons close to zero active instead of deactivating them to facilitate better training of the main network. Our proposed method outperformed other references in terms of sensitivity in all classes and achieved an accuracy of 98% for classification with good machine weight learning.},

  abstract     = {In the current research scenario, sincere effort has been taken worldwide to explore the use of renewable energy sources in electrical power system for the economic benefits and environmental consciousness. In this work, a relatively published new population-based optimization technique, called opposition-based whale optimization algorithm (WOA) (OWOA) having the ability to enhance the local search and speeding up the convergence speed of the solution, has been implemented to analyse the wind- and solar-based hydro–thermal scheduling with transmission losses. The main purpose of this work is to minimize the generation cost as well as emission by optimally scheduling the generation on hourly basis. This newly developed algorithm is initially tested on benchmark functions (high-dimensional complex problems) to establish the optimization capability of the algorithm as compared to the basic WOA counterpart. This optimization technique has the ability to handle the nonlinearity due to the presence of valve point loading in thermal power plant and the uncertainty of wind and solar for wind and solar-based power plant in practical situation. The proposed OWOA and the basic WOA are tested on hydro–thermal scheduling (HTS) and, finally, on HTS with wind and solar. The obtained results show that the generation cost and emission decrease with the incorporation of wind and solar in HTS system. Furthermore, the obtained results from OWOA for cost as well as emission minimization are compared with the WOA, grey wolf optimization (GWO), differential evolution (DE), quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA), small population-based particle swarm optimization (SPSO), fuzzy-based evolutionary programming (Fuzzy EP), sine cosine algorithm (SCA) and backtracking search algorithm (BSA) for various cases to verify robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

A modified hybrid hierarchical JAYA algorithm (HHJAYA) is proposed here to solve global optimization problems and ameliorate the optimization performance of JAYA. In this method, all individuals are randomly divided into several sub-swarms at the bottom layer, each individual is updated by using a combination of DE and an improved JAYA algorithm, and the best individuals are selected to the top layer. In order to exchange information between the top and bottom layers, the random individual of the sub-swarm at the bottom layer will be replaced by the best individual at the top layer in each iteration. After a certain number of iterations, individuals are reorganized to increase the diversity of different sub-swarms. Moreover, experimental results on the CEC2014 and CEC2017 test suits have validated the feasibility and optimization behavior of HHJAYA. Finally, HHJAYA is extended to fuzzy clustering based on entropy-like divergence-based kernel for image segmentation, and the segmentation results on different benchmark images indicate that HHJAYA has excellent performance in most cases.},

  abstract     = {The non-spherical 6R manipulators are widely used in many fields. However, the non-spherical structure often poses challenges in the inverse kinematics problem (IKP) for such robots. To address this challenge, transforming IKP into an optimization problem is a promising solution. Nevertheless, existing optimization methods often entail complex computations and tend to overlook the geometric characteristics of the manipulators. In this study, we introduce a novel objective function based on a disconnect-reconnect method. Initially, based on the prior geometric knowledge of the non-spherical 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulators, we employ a disconnect–reconnect strategy to decouple the kinematic equations. This process yields four nonlinear re-connection conditions equations. Subsequently, we utilize this equation to formulate a novel objective function. Then, we employ the adaptive covariance matrix evolution strategy (CMA-ES) alongside an analytical method to achieve precise solutions for the IKP. The proposed method was validated on the Comau NJ-220 manipulator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed effectively reduces computational complexity and enhances solution efficiency while maintaining accuracy in solving.},

This research investigates the impact of demand and operational constraints on production schedules, including the facility capacity, operators and machines availability, raw materials availability, inventory level and warehouse capacity. A multi-agent-based optimisation model is developed to face the complexity of considering demand and operational constraints and reflects their impact on generating a reliable production schedule. This model involves a proposed heuristic algorithm that considers demand and operations constraints in such a manufacturing environment and optimises the production schedule based on these restrictions/requirements. A real-life case study based on a connecting plates manufacturer company is used as a test bench of the proposed agent-based heuristic optimisation model. The proposed algorithm is compared with other related approaches to check its superiority based on key criteria, including inventory levels, missed/unsatisfied orders and total production time. Results show that the proposed heuristics algorithm reduced the number of missed orders by 34% compared with similar approaches.},

  abstract     = {The patient admission scheduling problem (PASP) has been studied for many years as one of the most important scheduling problems in the health sector. The primary goal of PASP is to assign patients to appropriate hospital beds while considering some hard and soft constraints. PASP is an NP-hard problem, which implies that the optimization approach is one of the best approaches that can be used to solve it. The arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) is a new optimization algorithm that can effectively solve both continuous and discrete optimization problems. However, it may suffer from poor exploration and premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions due to some problems with its exploration operators. In this paper, we propose a new method for the PASP using an improved AOA algorithm called the island-based AOA (iAOA). The new algorithm is based on a structured population model called the island model. This model distributes the population of candidate solutions among islands that periodically exchange some of the candidate solutions among each other based on a migration protocol. In iAOA, some modifications were applied to AOA’s parameters to make it capable of handling discrete space. We evaluated iAOA using a public benchmark for the PASP and compared our results with those of other baseline algorithms (DFPA, SA, HS, GD-NLGD, HTS, TS, I-BBO, and MBBO). The simulation results revealed that iAOA achieved the minimum average execution time on 5 out of 6 instances of the public benchmark. It also showed that iAOA achieved the second minimum average violation of the objective function over 10 independent runs. Finally, the statistical examination of the experimental results using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests confirms the significance of the results of iAOA compared with the other baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Human Learning Optimization (HLO) is an emergent inborn binary meta-heuristic inspired by human learning mechanisms. To solve continuous problems efficiently, continuous HLO (CHLO) variants were presented. However, the research on CHLO is at its very initial stage and we find that the underlying cooperation between the learning operators in previous CHLO variants is not ideal, which degrades the overall search ability. To tackle this drawback, this paper develops a new social learning operator (SLO) and presents a novel CHLO with Enhanced Exploration and Exploitation (CHLOEEE), in which the new SLO can efficiently explore a wider area and consequently strengthens the exploration ability. Thanks to the new SLO, the individual learning operator in CHLOEEE is totally relieved from the exploration duty and focuses on local search to further enhance the exploitation capability. By comparing and analyzing the search behaviors of CHLO variants, the advantages of CHLOEEE are clearly explained and the insight of the inherent mechanisms is revealed. Finally, the proposed CHLOEEE is evaluated on the CEC15, CEC17, and engineering benchmark problems and compared with the previous CHLO variants and other nine state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms. The results show that CHLOEEE is superior to the latest CHLO variant, named CHLOEE, on two-thirds of all the benchmark functions and significantly outperforms the other algorithms on at least 12 out of 15 CEC15 functions and 21 out of 30 CEC17 functions. Furthermore, CHLOEEE achieves the best results on all the 9 engineering optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {The strong generalized minimum label spanning tree problem (SGMLSTP) is to search the minimum label spanning tree (MLST) from an edge-labeled graph (ELG), in which each edge is associated with one or more labels. The SGMLSTP commonly exists in reality and is proven to be NP-hard. In recent years, researchers have proposed some algorithms; however, because the label coexistence relationship is not properly considered, high computing costs and lower efficiency are still severe obstacles, especially when the graphs are large. In this paper, we rewrite the SGMLSTP model and decompose the problem into two sub-problems: one is to search a connected sub-graph with minimum labels from the original graph, and the other is to search a spanning tree from the sub-graph. As the latter sub-problem is solved, we focus on the former and propose a community-based zigzag piloting algorithm. First, a label graph is derived from the original edge-labeled graph. Then, the label graph is partitioned, and some label community (or community combinations) is chosen to form an initial solution. Finally, the zigzag piloting process is applied to adjust the initial solution. Different from current algorithms that do not consider label coexistence relationships, the proposed algorithm partitions labels and finds the initial solution quickly; the zigzag piloting process improves the solution. Experimental results on typical benchmark datasets show better effectiveness and performance of our algorithm than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Covid-19 pandemic left scars on different industries, and now that we are experiencing the post-pandemic situation, it is essential to plan our next moves. When it comes to home healthcare devices (HHDs), they can be useful in many aspects such as keeping the patients safe at the home. Nowadays, the world is experiencing the post-pandemic situation, then it is needed to adapt to new circumstances as it was done during the pandemic. One of the factors that has been impacted by the new situation is the demand for HHDs which had been increased tremendously during the pandemic. The current study aims to forecast the so-called demand by utilizing machine learning techniques to design a product portfolio considering the shortage cost by benefiting from the Bayesian Best–Worst method (BBWM). A mixed-integer non-linear mathematical model is proposed to reach this goal which designs a portfolio of devices and determines the number of needed machines to produce them. An HHD manufacturing factory has been considered as a real-life case study to approve the functionality of the proposed methodology. Several businesses that have experienced post-pandemic demand fluctuations may benefit from the findings of this study.},

  abstract     = {The vulnerability analysis of networks is a central goal within the concept of graph-theoretic problems. Therefore, graph theory serves as an essential scientific tool for studying the reliability and robustness of networks. Vertex centrality has great importance in the context of network analysis. One of the metrics used in network analysis is closeness centrality, which is a structural measure that evaluates the importance of a node in a network. This measure is based on the sum of the distances between the node and all other nodes in the network. This paper analyzes the closeness of different tree structures. In addition, formulas for the closeness of k-ary trees, binomial trees, comet graphs, double comet graphs, double star graphs, and $$E_{p}^{t}$$ graphs are established. Upper and lower bounds are studied for k-ary and binary trees. Upper bounds arise from the perfect form of the tree for the k-ary tree and its special structure of the binary tree. Moreover, some numerical experiments are conducted on the considered graph structures. The results are supported the robustness of the double star graph structure in terms of closeness centrality. Furthermore, we present a relevant application problem within the context of this study.},

The goal of UA-FLP is to optimize the material flow between facilities of different sizes to enhance manufacturing efficiency. The LSA algorithm incorporates a novel solution representation, an improved penalty function and a diverse set of neighborhood operators to refine the search space. By utilizing a reinforcement learning-based controller, LSA enables a flexible and efficient exploration through state detection and fast feedback. A two-stage greedy local search is employed to further exploit the search space and enhance solution quality. Additional features include temperature sampling generation to minimize parameter settings, a greedy initial solution production to relax infeasible restrictions. Experimental results on 16 well-known instances validate LSA’s high proficiency compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, and it exceeds 7 best-known solutions within a comparable time, particularly its excellent performance in large instances within a short execution time.},

The IoV is a network of connected vehicles that sends/receives messages. However, the moving nature of the vehicles in IoV networks raises a dynamic topology issue. Therefore, establishing effective and dependable communication pathways among vehicular nodes, contingent upon traffic density conditions, presents a growing challenge. As a result, the main contribution of this paper is to propose an efficient network optimization system involving a cluster-based network routing optimizer. The proposed method is a metaheuristic algorithm adapted as a clustering algorithm. For this purpose, the JAYA Algorithm (JAYA) was utilized and integrated with two clustering concepts extracted from K-means Clustering and Automatic Clustering, resulting in proposing JAYA Clustering Algorithm for IoV (JAYACIoV). Subsequently, the performance of the proposed algorithm was investigated utilizing 176 network testing scenarios, and extensive comparative evaluations were conducted against five algorithms from the literature. The results confirmed the superiority of the proposed system with a percentage of 64.82%, where the algorithms were ranked according to the percentage achievement of best results.},

Benefiting from the significant success of deep learning, many single-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been extended to multi-agent scenarios. Overestimation in value estimation of Q-learning is a significant issue that has been studied comprehensively in the single-agent domains, but rarely in multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first demonstrate that Q-learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods generally have notably serious overestimation issues, which cannot be alleviated by current methods. To tackle this problem, we introduce the double critic networks structure and the delayed policy update to Q-learning-based multi-agent MARL methods, which reduce the overestimation and enhance the quality of policy updating. To demonstrate the versatility of our proposed method, we select several Q-learning based MARL methods and evaluate them on several multi-agent tasks on the multi-agent particle environment and SMAC. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can avoid the overestimation problem and significantly improve performance. Besides, application in the Traffic Signal Control verifies the feasibility of applying the proposed method in real-world scenarios.},

For the classification, KNN, PNN, and SVM shallow machine learning classifiers are used for crop species identification. The performance evaluation is done using LBP and HOG individually along with the new proposed LBHPG technique for classification using KNN, PNN, and SVM Classifiers. The performance evaluation is based on six metrics parameters of the confusion matrix, viz., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F-measure.

However, it took much work to determine the peak stress and peak strain of concrete confined with lateral ties under axial compression due to the complicated arching actions of lateral ties and longitudinal reinforcements, as well as the complex interaction between concrete and lateral ties. In this paper, two typical artificial neural networks (ANN), including (BP networks and Elamn networks) were applied to evaluate the peak stress and peak strain of concrete columns confined with lateral ties based on a reliable database consisting of 196 test data sets for peak stress and 166 test data sets for peak strain collected from previous studies. Both proposed ANN models had high prediction performance in the training and testing process. Furthermore, By comparing with existing analytical models, the proposed BP networks had high reliability and applicability in predicting confined concrete’s peak stress. In contrast, the Elman network had high reliability and applicability in peak strain of concrete columns confined with lateral ties. Furthermore, based on the sensitivity analysis, the concrete strength and the properties of lateral ties obviously influence the peak stress of confined concrete. In contrast, the volumetric ratio of lateral ties significantly affected the peak strain of confined concrete.},

  abstract     = {The domain adaptation (DA) transfer learning technique can accurately classify land cover in remote-sensing (RS) images, even with a small number of labeled samples. However, traditional architectures and various neural network and deep learning modifications make DA models difficult to learn quickly and computationally demanding. Extreme learning machine (ELM)-based DA models have shown potential for quick learning and improved generalization capabilities. Still, they are also known for their unstable and over-fitting characteristics and the ambiguity of the data sets. To address these difficulties, this article proposes two contributions. First, a modified fuzzy-rule-based ELM model (MFR-ELM) is created within a data-dependent platform to address the imprecision of the RS image land-cover classes and small sample size. Second, an ensemble of fuzzy rule-based ELM networks is proposed in the DA framework to address individual networks’ instability and weak learning properties. The MFR-ELM and other fuzzy rule-based ELM designs are combined in the ensemble architecture for mutual benefit. The suggested model is proven to be superior to competing approaches for categorizing multispectral RS images, as supported by various performance assessment indices.},

In this study, a new forecasting system, including point prediction and interval prediction, has been proposed to predict the stock index. For obtaining a better predictive effect, multiple influencing variables are also considered in the novel model. More specifically, in the point prediction models, this study applies gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to choose some variables related to the stock index by determining their contribution to accurate prediction. Next, an autoencoder (AE) is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of screened factors for the purpose of reducing the effect of noise and improving the efficiency of forecasting. These reconstructed features are all inputted into bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to do point prediction. The interval prediction is based on point prediction results and Gaussian process regression (GPR), intended to quantitative uncertainty of the variables. This study chooses the Chinese stock index including the Shanghai Securities Composite Index (SSEC), Shenzhen Composite Index (SZI) and China Securities Index 300 (CSI300) to demonstrate the validity of the innovative hybrid model. Furthermore, this study also selects some other models for comparison. Evaluating the performance of the novel hybrid model, it could be considered as a valid way to do stock index forecasting.},

  abstract     = {Security of digital audio files is the need of the hour. In this context, researchers have proposed several techniques for the secure communication of audio files. But unfortunately, these are vulnerable to differential attack. So, we propose a WORD-oriented technique for securing digital audio files based on rotation and XOR operations. The key concepts of the designed encryption algorithm are the RX (Rotation-XOR) operations, i.e., the plain audio samples are first left-rotated by the sum-of-digits of the previous audio samples, and then XOR-ed with the previous audio samples. The designed encryption algorithm encodes a digital audio file into a random (noise-like) audio file. Several encryption and decryption evaluation metrics, such as Adjacent Sample Correlation Coefficient (ASCC), Crest Factor (CF), Number of sample Change Rate (NSCR), Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), etc., are applied on several digital audio files of varying sizes, to empirically assess the performance and efficiency of the proposed technique. The results of these metrics show that the cipher audio files have a very high key sensitivity, ideal ASCC, ideal CF, 100% NSCR score, zero MSE, and infinite PSNR. Moreover, the technique strongly resists the brute-force attack, differential attack, and other statistical attacks.},

Feeder routing is defined as the optimal determination of the feeders’ routes by minimizing the investment cost and satisfying the network constraints. To the best knowledge of the authors, solving feeder routing problem in multi-objective framework is rarely investigated in the previous literature. This paper develops a bi-objective modeling and optimization framework to efficiently solve the feeder routing problem of distribution network considering cost and power losses. Since feeder routing is a complex, high-dimensional and combinatorial optimization problem, a multi-objective differential crow search algorithm (MO-CSAdif) is proposed to obtain a well-distributed and widely spread Pareto front. On a real large distribution network, simulation results confirm the usefulness of the proposed optimization framework. It can be drawn that MO-CSAdif can be a promising method to optimally solve the feeder routing problem.},

The extended max–min SFRE can be represented in the form of the max–min subsystems aggregated using the min operator or dual min–max subsystems aggregated using the max operator. When decomposing the SFRE, the set of solutions can be decomposed into the lower and upper subsets bounded by the same aggregating solutions. Each lower (upper) subset is defined by the unique greatest (least) or aggregating solution and the set of minimal (maximal) solutions. Following Bartl et al. (Fuzzy Sets Syst 187:103–112, 2012), to avoid excessive granularity and ensure interpretability of the interval solutions when restoring causes through observed effects, the constraints in the form of linguistic modifiers are imposed on the measures of causes significances. The interval solutions are modeled by the complete crisp solutions, that is, the maximum solutions for the vectors of binary weights of the linguistic modifiers. The search for approximate solutions of the SFRE amounts to solving the optimization problem using the genetic algorithm. Due to the properties of the solution set, the genetic search for the lower and upper subsets is parallelized for each aggregating solution. The developed method makes it possible to simplify the search for the solution set based on the constraints on accuracy (interpretability) of the applied problem.},

  abstract     = {Material selection is influential in product design, manufacturing, and marketing. Appropriate material selection maximizes the performance of a product while minimizing its cost, whereas inappropriate material selection creates devastating results such as low performance, low quality, and high cost. Therefore, it is crucial how to choose the most suitable material. Unlike other studies, this study presents an ensemble multi-attribute decision-making approach for material selection. The approach involves four weighting methods—criteria importance through intercriteria correlation, Entropy, the method based on the removal effects of criteria, and statistical variance, five ranking methods—additive ratio assessment, combined compromise solution, multi-attributive border approximation area comparison, range of value, and the technique for order performance by similarity to the ideal solution, Spearman&#39;s correlation coefficients, and the Copeland method. Three different problems are considered to show the applicability of the proposed method and to reveal a comprehensive analysis. The results of each problem show valuable implications. The results of the ranking methods are sensitive to attribute weights. No ranking method alone can assure dependable selection for a given problem. Overall, the results reveal the importance of using multiple weighting and ranking methods and the superiority of the proposed integrated approach.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses this challenge and proposes a novel approach based on the modified cuckoo search and chaos theory. This article describes a novel approach for multilevel biomedical image segmentation based on the modified cuckoo search and chaos theory which is the major contribution to the literature. The modified cuckoo search approach helps to model the Lévy flight efficiently and the incorporation of the chaos theory helps to maintain the diversity in the population. The proposed approach helps to determine the optimal threshold values for a given number of thresholds. Four different objective functions are used to get the realistic segmented output which is essential in biomedical image analysis. Moreover, detailed analysis is also helpful in understanding the suitable objective function for biomedical image segmentation. This work also helps to choose suitable chaotic maps with different optimization algorithms. Hybridization of chaos theory and modified cuckoo search helps to overcome the local optima and to find the global optima cost-effectively. The chaos theory is incorporated in this proposed work to replace some solutions with some chaotic sequences to enhance the associated randomness with various phases which is beneficial to overcome the premature convergence and its related issues. The optimum setup is determined by investigating the effect of different chaotic maps along with some standard metaheuristic optimization approaches. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches are used to evaluate and compare the proposed approach. The proposed algorithm is compared with four state-of-the-art approaches. The obtained results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both quantitative results and segmented output. On average, the proposed approach can achieve 255.8331 MSE, 24.07047 PSNR, 291.6077 mean, 0.038869 SD, 0.688655 SSIM, and 16.05358 s execution time (all for nine clusters). It can be observed that the proposed approach can determine the optimal set of clusters comparatively faster on most occasions, especially for the higher number of clusters.},

There are quantum entanglements among the opinions of decision-makers, influencing each other rather than being independent of each other. To address this issue, a multi-attribute quantum group decision-making method considering decision-maker’s risk attitude is developed. First, considering the uncertain environment of decision-making, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number is used to represent the decision information, and a new scoring function is proposed to transform the interval intuitionistic fuzzy matrix into a scoring function matrix. Second, the interference entanglement behavior of the decision-maker in the decision-making process is deduced by quantum probability, and the quantum probability is transformed into the weight of the attributes. Then, the prospect value function is determined according to the expectation reference point of different decision-makers, and the irrational risk attitude of decision-makers is reflected by comprehensive prospect value, which is used to rank the alternatives. Finally, a case of global telecommunication system security assessment is provided to verify the feasibility, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed method.},

An adaptive inertia weight and two genetic operators were employed in the Taguchi-based whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to improve the search diversity and avoid local optima. NDT was used to model the environment of differential-drive mobile robots and WOA was applied to optimize the scan matching for the robotic SLAM problem. The NDT-WOA determines the SLAM pose estimation using sensed data from the physical world. A nonholonomic mobile robot was steered to achieve the NDT-WOA SLAM task with the derived robot kinematics and actuator dynamics. The proposed method was implemented in a TurtleBot3 Burger robotic development kit, which includes a single-board computer and an OpenCR control board. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was utilized to implement the evolutionary NDT-WOA SLAM system due to its flexibility, open source, and client library. Simulation and comparisons were conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed NDT-WOA SLAM method compared to other SLAM paradigms. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary NDT-WOA SLAM for autonomous mobile robots.

  abstract     = {Earthquakes are complex phenomena that generate various forms of clusters that are highly correlated in the space and time domains. To study the dynamic properties of seismicity and estimate risk, the earthquake catalog needs to be separated into clustered and background events. Here, seismicity de-clustering is formulated as a binary many-objective optimization problem. A swarm-based many-objective chimp optimization algorithm (MaOChOA) is proposed to segregate the earthquake catalog into aftershocks and background events. The reference point-based leader selection strategy is adopted to update the solution. The proposed MaOChOA is evaluated on many objective benchmark test functions. The results are compared with existing many-objective techniques using performance metrics such as generational distance, inverse generational distance, spacing metric, hyper-volume distance, and runtime. Further, de-clustering the earthquake catalog is performed using a binary version of many-objective Chimp optimization algorithms (BMaChOA), where the sigmoid function is used in the position update mechanism. The BMaChOA is applied to 32-year historical earthquake catalogs of the Japan, California, Indonesia, and Himalayan regions. The potential of the proposed algorithm is reported by comparing it to five benchmark de-clustering techniques. The results are validated using the epicenter plot, inter-event time Vs. inter-event distance plot, cumulative plot, $$\lambda $$ -plot, and statistical parameters such as the m-Morisita index, coefficient of variance, average nearest neighbor, and nearest neighbor distance.},

  abstract     = {In modern wireless networks, mobile nodes often deal with the challenge of maintaining a sufficient number of data packets due to limited storage capacity within each cluster. It adversely impacts network performance by compromising data quality during transmissions. The ensuing delays, caused by data packets awaiting storage allocation, result in reduced throughput and increased end-to-end latency. To effectively address these issues, we present a Dynamic Link Utilization with Reinforcement Learning (DLU-RL) method, which is designed to optimize storage allocation for communication data packets, significantly enhancing network performance. Instead of static allocation, DLU-RL employs dynamic strategies guided by reinforcement learning algorithms. This innovative method not only tackles storage constraints but also proactively adapts to varying network conditions and traffic patterns. In our approach, we first perform a comprehensive analysis of storage capacities across all nodes, establishing a baseline for dynamic resource allocation. The DLU-RL framework then swiftly assigns storage space based on real-time demand and priority, optimizing storage utilization on the fly. As a result of implementing DLU-RL, substantial enhancements in throughput and concurrent minimization of end-to-end delays are achieved. This research not only contributes to efficient storage allocation techniques but also pioneers the integration of reinforcement learning for wireless communication network performance optimization. The proposed framework signifies a paradigm shift in storage management, offering adaptability, efficiency, and real-time optimization to tackle the evolving challenges of wireless communication.},

Hybridizing algorithms can be a good solution to achieve a powerful algorithm, and hybridizing algorithms and mechanisms greedily lead to an increase in computational complexity and execution time. This paper presents a new and intelligent approach by hybridizing meta-heuristic algorithms and using different mechanisms simultaneously without significantly increasing the time complexity. For this purpose, salp swarm optimization (SSO) and the African vulture optimization algorithm (AVOA) have been hybridized to improve the optimization process of the modified choice function and learning automata mechanisms. In addition, two other improving mechanisms, named opposition-based learning (OBL) and β-hill climbing (BHC) technique, have been presented and integrated with the AVOA–SSA algorithm. Fifty-two standard benchmarks were used to test and evaluate the AVOA–SSA algorithm. Finally, an improved version of the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier has been used with real stock market data for stock market prediction. The obtained results indicate the excellent and acceptable performance of the AVOA–SSA algorithm in `solving optimization problems and have been able to achieve high-quality solutions.

  abstract     = {Mobile manipulator robots that combine mobile platforms and robotic arms have been attracting considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, the motion control problem of the mobile manipulator system is considered with the following proposed control strategy. Firstly, a decoupled dynamic model is created to increase operation safety and to reduce complexity such that the independent controllers can be designed for the mobile system and the manipulator system. Subsequently, an effective reference trajectory generator is proposed to guide the mobile manipulator systems to the proper position for the manipulation being able to grip the target. Thereafter, the fuzzy controllers are designed for the mobile system to eliminate the tracking error and for the manipulator system to accomplish the gripping mission. The stability of the mobile manipulator control system can be guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. From the simulation results, it can be seen that this paper as well as other compared methods have good control response in case of small controller gain, in which the convergence time are about 4–5 s. However, by increasing the controller gain to improve the control response, the other methods will make the system unstable or the controller output will produce a large amount of chattering. The proposed controller in this paper can not only decrease the convergence time, from 5 to 3 s, but also provide a smooth control response.},

In some businesses, continuity of activities is very important and a business that fails a lot cannot be trusted by subscribers. In these businesses, it is necessary to maximize the reliability of the system along with minimizing the overall monetary costs. To this end, two new reliability and cost models are presented. All of the network equipment, communication, and elements affecting the total cost and reliability of the system are taken into consideration in the proposed models.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the observer-based security control of discrete-time Markov jump systems (MJSs) subject to hybrid cyber-attacks and unmeasured states via event-triggered scheme. The event-triggered scheme (ETS) is being developed to relieve more network burdens. A Luenburger observer is used to estimate the unmeasured states. In this work, the hybrid cyber attack is addressed, which contains deception attacks and DoS attacks. It is anticipated that input control signals sent across a network are vulnerable to hybrid cyber-attacks in which adversaries could inject fake data into the control signals. Since system state information is usually not fully known, an observer-based controller is built to stabilize the system and keep the right performance index even when hybrid cyber-attacks happen. By solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the controllers and observers are also obtained. Lastly, inverted pendulum applications are shown to show how well and realistically the theoretical results can be used to respond to and get rid of the effects of hybrid cyber-attacks.},

  abstract     = {Recently, digital images are widely used in several applications through advanced wearable devices and networks. Despite several benefits of digital images, such as easy distribution, storage, and reproduction, it is difficult to prevent the issue of identity theft, privacy leakage, and ownership conflicts. To solve the above issues, dimensionality reduction-based robust watermarking for color images, supported with suitable encryption, is presented in this article. In this method, principal component analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction is applied to the color carrier image to produce three principal components. The third component with minimum energy is then concealed with a mark image using non-sub-sampled shearlet transform (NSST)-singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking to resolve the ownership issues, if any. In addition, encryption of marked image is done to provide better security and authenticity. The final encrypted image is then stored in a cloud environment for better accessibility. Finally, an experimental and comparative evaluation of the proposed framework justifies its versatility, robustness, and imperceptibility with the best improvement of 47.49 %.},

  abstract     = {Workflow recognition relying on deep convolutional neural network has obtained promising performance. Though impressive results have been achieved on standard industrial workflow, the performance on heavily occluded workflow remains far from satisfactory. In this paper, we present an effective context-aware compositional ConvNet (CA-CompNet) for occluded workflow detection with the following contributions. First, we combine compositional model and original ConvNet together to build a unified deep architecture for occluded workflow detection, which has shown innate robustness to address the problem of object classification under occlusion. Second, in order to overcome the variable occlusion limitations, the bounding box annotations are utilized to segment the context from target workflow instance during training. Then, these segmentations are used to learn the proposed CA-CompNet, which enables the network to untangle the feature representation of workflow instance from the context. Third, a robust voting mechanism for candidate bounding box is introduced to improve the detection accuracy, which facilitates the model to precisely detect the bounding box of a specific workflow instance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed context-aware network can robustly detect workflow instance under occlusion in industrial environment, increasing the detection performance on MS COCO dataset by 4.6% (from 45.1 to 49.7%) in absolute performance compared to the advanced CenterNet.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of microscopic images is always considered a challenging task due to the inherent properties of the microscopic images. In general, microscopic images have ambiguous region overlaps, small regions of interest, and weak correlation among the pixels and make the segmentation task difficult. Segmentation is useful in the identification of different regions of the microscopic images. In this work, a novel method is proposed which is based on the cuckoo search method. The cuckoo search method is modified using McCulloch’s approach which is used in place of the Lévy flight and, the Luus–Jaakola heuristic is used to perform a local search in a balanced manner, to enhance the exploring capability. Three objective functions, namely Otsu’s interclass variance, Kapur’s entropy, and Tsallis entropy, are used to obtain the optimal threshold values. The proposed method is tested and evaluated on the microscopic images of the basal cell of prostate epithelium from the repository of the Center for Research in biological systems. The proposed method is evaluated using four well-known validation parameters peak signal-to-noise ratio, mean square error, Intersection over Union, and feature similarity index. Moreover, the execution time of the CPU is also compared for each method, and different numbers of clusters are used for the evaluation purpose. It has been found that the proposed method generates some promising results and can precisely identify the objects in the microscopic images.},

The interconnected power plant covers thermal plants, hydro plants, and nuclear power plants. The proposed controller is used as a secondary controller in the power system to perform load frequency control (LFC). Under unforeseen load conditions, the system frequency deviates from the norm. To control and stabilize this oscillation, the LFC system is used. During the investigation, a step load perturbation of one percent (SLP 1%) is applied for the analysis of the thermal power plant. The response of the suggested optimization technique-designed regulator performance is equated with the genetic algorithm (GA)-tuned, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-tuned, and ant colony optimization (ACO) technique-tuned PID regulator response. The performance response is evidence that the GWO-based PID regulator provides a regulated response with minimal time-domain specification parameters (settling time, peak shoots) over other tuning methods. The effectiveness and robustness of the improved response of the suggested technique-optimized controller are verified with various load values (1%, 2%, and 10% SLP) and nominal parameter (R, Tp, and Tij) variations (± 25% &amp; ± 50%) from its nominal value.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of ready-to-assemble furniture, driven by international giants like IKEA, assembly services were increasingly offered by the same retailers. When planning orders with assembly services, the estimation of the service time leads to additional difficulties compared to standard delivery planning. Assembling large wardrobes or kitchens can take hours or even days while assembling a chair can be done in a few minutes. Combined with the usually vast amounts of offered products, a lot of knowledge is required to plan efficient and exact delivery routes. This paper shows how an artificial neural network (ANN) can be used to accurately predict the service time of a delivery based on factors such as the goods to be delivered or the personnel providing the service. The data used include not only deliveries with assembly of furniture, but also deliveries of goods without assembly and delivery of goods requiring electrical installation. The goal is to create a solution that can predict the time needed based on criteria such the type of furniture, the weight of the goods, and the experiences of the service technicians. The findings show that ANNs can be applied to this scenario and outperform more classical approaches, such as multiple linear regression or support vector machines. Still existing problems are largely due to the provided data, e.g., a large difference between the number of short and longer duration orders, which made it harder to accurately predict orders with longer duration.},

  abstract     = {The application of digital technologies to facilitate farming activities has been on the rise in recent years. Among different tasks, the classification of weeds is a prerequisite for smart farming, and various techniques have been proposed to automatically detect weeds from images. However, many studies deal with weed images collected in the laboratory settings, and this might not be applicable to real-world scenarios. In this sense, there is still the need for robust classification systems that can be deployed in the field. In this work, we propose a practical solution to recognition of weeds exploiting two versions of EfficientNet as the recommendation engine. More importantly, to make the learning more effective, we also utilize different transfer learning strategies. The final aim is to build an expert system capable of accurately detecting weeds from lively captured images. We evaluate the approach’s performance using DeepWeeds, a real-world dataset with 17,509 images. The experimental results show that the application of EfficientNet and transfer learning on the considered dataset substantially improves the overall prediction accuracy in various settings. Through the evaluation, we also demonstrate that the conceived tool outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. We expect that the proposed framework can be installed in robots to work on rice fields in Vietnam, allowing farmers to find and eliminate weeds in an automatic manner.},

If the cells undergo shade conditions in the presence of bypass diodes, the solar array’s power is decreased, and the P–V curve of the array represents multiple local MPPs (LMPP) and a global MPP (GMPP). LMPPs might mislead the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms because their characteristics are identical to the MPP. Various studies have been conducted on partial shading conditions. This study uses parallel distributed maximum power point tracking (DMPPT) due to the advantages of this structure. A high-gain converter is presented to resolve the high conversion gain required by the DC/DC converter in this structure. This study also presents MLP and RBF networks for MPP tracking and compares their efficiencies under the same irradiation and partial shading conditions. Since determining optimal weight coefficients in MLP neural networks and variances, means, and weights in RBF networks play an essential role in their performance, this study uses four optimization algorithms of particle swarm optimization (PSO), gray wolf optimization (GWO), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), and Harris Hawks optimization (HHO). Finally, an adaptive fuzzy-PID controller controls the three-phase grid-connected inverter. A comparison of the results shows that the efficiency of MLP and RBFII is almost the same, about 98–99%. Moreover, the accuracy of MLP networks is higher than RBF, and RBF networks’ only advantage is shorter training time. In addition, RBF networks require much more activation functions for proper performance. The simulation outcomes confirm the superior efficacy of the HHO algorithm in training neural networks when compared to alternative algorithms.},

Managers must determine the optimal production volume in advance to minimize the underage cost and the overage cost. However, the traditional newsvendor problem assumes the known demand distribution, which is not the case in practice. Data-driven approaches have become the hot research topic and opened up new avenues for such issues. Recent studies have considered demand-related features but have failed to address how to optimize production and inventory using informative textual reviews, not just numerical feature data. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven newsvendor model that leverages sentiment analysis on textual reviews using a deep learning model to solve the data-driven newsvendor problem by integrating estimation and optimization. Experiments on real data show that our proposed method reduces the average cost by approximately 14.18% compared to the most advanced deep neural network method, making it the best-performing method. Furthermore, our method is more suitable for situations where unit shortage costs are greater than unit overage costs. Finally, our method is robust in terms of sample size and can still obtain good results even with insufficient historical data.},

Therefore, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is strongly preferred to constantly track the optimal point of TEG under diverse operational conditions. In this study, a new MPPT-based metaheuristic optimizer so-called Honey badger algorithm (HBA) is implemented to maximize the energy efficiency of TEG systems. The proposed technique seeks to optimize the dynamic response and eradicate oscillations near MPP. Various dynamic operating conditions are used to investigate the reliability of the optimized HBA-based MPPT method. The obtained results are compared with other energy harvesting approaches including incremental conductance (INC), hybrid gray wolf optimizer-sine cosine algorithm (HGWOSCA), and marine predators algorithm (MPA).

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle charging and discharging energy exchange among electric vehicles (EVs) achieve economical and low-loss energy transactions. However, due to the openness of the border, EV power trading faces security issues. When an EV user communicates with a local aggregator, attackers may eavesdrop on the communication links to perform traffic analysis attacks. Moreover, unregistered illegal users may parade themselves as legitimate users and submit a bill query request to the local aggregator. In this paper, we develop a decentralized EV charging service architecture to defend against traffic analysis attacks and prevent users from tampering with transaction bills. Based on the architecture, we propose a blockchain-based secure transaction mechanism for electronic vehicles with multiple temporary identities. Specifically, we first propose a power transaction encryption protocol that utilizes multiple temporary identities to publish information streams, thereby preventing eavesdropping attacks and making the assignment between suppliers and demanders. We then propose a secure query transaction scheme that adds the accumulator value of the user’s temporary identity into the Merkle tree, which identifies the query issued by legitimate users and verifies the query results. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed secure transaction mechanism promotes the user satisfaction and user utility by 5% and 10%, respectively, and promotes the security level by three times.},

  abstract     = {Soil water content (SWC) plays a key role in the management of water and soil resources. Accurate prediction of SWC is an important issue in water and soil studies. Recently, some data mining and machine learning techniques were proposed for SWC prediction and achieved encouraging results. This paper presents four data mining predictive algorithms for SWC estimation. The used algorithms are random subspace ensemble, random tree (RT), reduced error-pruning tree (REPTree), and M5P. The motivation of this research is to investigate the performance of the popular data mining algorithms for SWC prediction. A benchmark dataset containing daily SWC parameters in three soil layers of 25 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm from the Nebraska state station (central USA), Grand Island was used to evaluate the proposed techniques. Statistical indices of determination coefficient (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root relative square error (RRMSE), and relative absolute error (RAE) were utilized to measure the performance of the proposed prediction techniques. The modeling results showed that the RT algorithm with R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.38, MAE = 0.10, RRMSE = 7.32%, and RAE = 1.82% outperformed counterpart techniques. This study concluded that the developed models will help agricultural water users, developers, and decision-makers for achieving agricultural sustainability.},

  abstract     = {Smart home (SH) technology is a new IoT application that allows users to remotely control household appliances. It provides several facilities like light control, smart locks, smoke detection, temperature monitoring, etc. Smart home domain needs an anonymous and efficient authentication scheme to ensure secure multiparty communications because of the insecure communication channel. Several authentication schemes were developed but it does not require multiparty authentication and are not secure in multiparty access. Thus, we propose a secure multiparty access and authentication based on advanced fuzzy extractor (SMAA_AFE) system that allows only the valid user to access the devices in SH. The proposed method consists of four phases such as sensor node (SN) registration phase, smart user (SU) registration phase, smart user authentication phase, password, and biometric update phase. All SUs and the SNs of the SH are registered and during the authentication phase, the user will be authenticated using the SMAA_AFE protocol. Here, the biometric data of the user is needed for authentication. When the user imprints his fingerprint, a valid biometric key will be generated only if a fixed number of members authenticate the user. The generated key is robust because we use SHA-256 hashing function. We use KNN to calculate the distance between the registered biometric data and the data given during authentication because it predicts more accurately. SMAA_AFE protocol improves security from various attacks. The security features of the proposed method are analyzed and its performance is compared to other authentication protocols focusing on communication and computation costs. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other protocols in terms of communication cost, requiring only 1188 bits, and computation cost, with an execution time of 6.20 ms.},

  abstract     = {Many researchers have shown interest in profile monitoring; however, most of the applications in this field of research are developed under the assumption of normal response variable. Little attention has been given to profile monitoring with non-normal response variables, known as general linear models which consists of two main categories (i.e., logistic and Poisson profiles). This paper aims to monitor Poisson profile monitoring problem in Phase II and develops a new robust control chart using support vector regression by incorporating some novel input features and evolutionary training algorithm. The new method is quicker in detecting out-of-control signals as compared to conventional statistical methods. Moreover, the performance of the proposed scheme is further investigated for Poisson profiles with both fixed and random explanatory variables as well as non-parametric profiles. The proposed monitoring scheme is revealed to be superior to its counterparts, including the likelihood ratio test (LRT), multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA), LRT-EWMA and other machine learning-based schemes. The simulation results show superiority of the proposed method in profiles with fixed explanatory variables and non-parametric models in nearly all situations while it is not able to be the best in all the simulations when there are with random explanatory variables. A diagnostic method with machine learning approach is also used to identify the parameters of change in the profile. It is shown that the proposed profile diagnosis approach is able to reach acceptable results in comparison with other competitors. A real-life example in monitoring Poisson profiles is also provided to illustrate the implementation of the proposed charting scheme.},

  abstract     = {The index tracking problem consists of constructing a portfolio that has the closest performance of a given index as possible, with fewer assets in its composition. When considering a large number of assets, including all of them on the solution may incur high transaction fees, harming the accumulated returns in the long term. The constraint that limits the portfolio size imposes a combinatorial nature on the problem and the computation of the optimal solution becomes infeasible as the universe of assets grows. To get around this issue, pure and hybrid metaheuristics have been proposed in the literature to achieve good solutions in practical time. Different from pure metaheuristics, hybrid metaheuristics do not need any constraint handling or solution repairing approaches since they often use general-purpose solvers to adjust portfolio weights. This work presents a comparison between pure and hybrid genetic algorithms, which is one of the most popular heuristics applied in the portfolio selection field. We considered linear and nonlinear index tracking models in the experiments, where the GA that obtained the best performance in a single period optimization strategy, was selected to backtest in a dynamic index tracking approach. The results showed that hybrid GAs can compute good or even better solutions than the CPLEX solver and pure GAs, in a shorter time.},

A critical aspect of preventing dangerous situations for users, especially elderlies, is to recognize abnormal human behavior. In spite of the extensive exploration of abnormality recognition in various fields, there remain some challenges in developing effective approaches for recognizing abnormal human behaviors in AAL systems due to the limitations of data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches. In this paper, a context-aware framework combining data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches is proposed to better characterize human behaviors and recognize abnormal behaviors using commonsense reasoning while considering human behavior context. The proposed framework comprises five main modules, which leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Probabilistic Answer Set Programming (PASP)-based commonsense reasoning to recognize human activities and represent abnormal human behaviors, as well as reason about those behaviors. The proposed framework is evaluated using two datasets, namely Orange4Home and UCI HAR. The obtained results indicate the capability of the proposed framework to characterize human behaviors and recognize abnormal human behaviors with high performance.},

  abstract     = {Multi-source domain generalization for person re-identification, named Domain Generalizable Person Re-Identification (DG-ReID), refers to training on multiple source domains and testing on unseen target domains. However, the performance of the current methods is rather unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Source Adaptive Meta-Learning (MAM) framework to push the limit of DG-ReID. First, MAM is built on the novel Multi-Source Adaptive Feature Refinement (MAFR) block, which simultaneously acquires domain-generalized features and domain-unique features on different domains. MAFR consists of three key components: the fine-grained feature extraction (FGFE) branch, the refined feature supplementation (RFS) branch, and the feature fusion (FF) module. Through these blocks, the interrelationships between different domains are explored, facilitating the extraction of features that are both generalized and discriminative. To capture domain-adaptive information, MAFR incorporates a meta-weight generator to effectively capture domain-adaptive information. Second, MAM leverages the principles of meta-learning during training to acquire more powerful generalization features. A total of three novel loss functions are proposed to train the proposed MAM including the clustering loss, the unknown domain identification loss, and the non-parametric identification loss. Last, we further design a novel meta-feature sampling method to diversify features used in the meta-testing stage for better generalization capability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is extensively evaluated on multiple benchmarks, and the results provide comprehensive validation. For instance, our MAM framework presents a promising solution to the challenge of domain generalization in person re-identification. Specifically, under evaluation protocol-2, the MAM framework exhibits improvements of 1.0% and 0.9% in mAP and rank-1 metrics, respectively, compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.},

In this paper, we propose a novel noise-immune and attention-based multi-modal model (NIAMNet) for short-term traffic flow forecasting. Inspired by the success of computer vision techniques, NIAMNet transforms one-dimensional traffic flow into images and embeds residual dual-attention blocks (RDB) to extract in-deep features. Besides, we introduce a dynamic noise-immune loss to address the impact of noise and outliers on model performance. Experimental results on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of NIAMNet over existing methods, achieving the lowest MAPE (10.43, 9.79, 10.51, and 11.01) and RMSE (247.13, 192.36, 208.40, and 150.01).

The nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) plant is one of the most popular reactors in the chemical industry. The proposed structure is elegant in design, having only three neurons in the hidden layer and a single output neuron. The three weights in the neural network&#39;s output layer represent the PID controller&#39;s proportional, integral, and derivative gains. The suggested approach uses the PSO method to optimize the output layer weights, which corresponds to the PID gains. Mean square error is used as an objective function to optimize the weights. The performance of the proposed PSO-PID-NN controller is tested by comparing the time domain specifications of the output response, against the conventional Zeigler Nichols tuned PID controller and the back propagation-based NN-PID controller (BP-NN-PID). The overshoot in the proposed controller is 23.13%, while it is 26.33% in BP-NN-PID, and 44.13% in Zeigler Nichols tuned PID controller. In addition, the rise time is 0.1283 s, while it is 0.2727 s in the BP-NN-PID controller and 0.2813 s in Zeigler Nichols tuned PID controller. The proposed controller is also tested for disturbance rejection, it was found to be more efficient in rejecting disturbance signals as compared to BP-NN-PID and ZN-tuned PID controllers.},

  abstract     = {The majority of technological processes include dynamic systems, which are characterized by structural and parameter uncertainty. Conventional control procedures based on such models are unlikely to produce the desired performance since deterministic models cannot appropriately characterize these uncertainties. When dealing with complex nonlinear systems that are characterized by ill-defined and unknown elements, fuzzy-logic based system is an effective method. Fuzzy controllers—whose rule basis is built on the expertise of human experts—are frequently utilized in this context to achieve desired performance. This knowledge might not be adequate for some complex processes, thus different methods for creating IF-THEN rules have been suggested. In this paper, the design of higher-order fuzzy sets is discussed and a generalized novel algorithm is developed for implementing type-n fuzzy sets and it is applied for controlling the angle of steering for a vehicle in such a way that the vehicle tracks the desired path. In the proposed methodology, fuzzification and defuzzification are taking place n number of times, and defuzzification of higher order fuzzy values up to type-1 fuzzy set is performed using the center of gravity method. The obtained type-1 fuzzy values are used in the rule base and inference mechanism for calculating the final crisp output. The significance of the present research is that the computation cost is not as high as expected because both fuzzification and defuzzification processes are recursive and the reduced new type-1 fuzzy values have the additional ability to model the uncertainty and vagueness as compared to normal type-1 fuzzy values. A comparison of the controllers based on the type of fuzzy sets is done based on the square of error (SE). Both the disturbance signal and uncertainty scenarios were also considered. The use of higher-order fuzzy sets facilitates the controller to give the more accurate results for controlling the vehicle and the corresponding simulation results suggest the same.},

  abstract     = {The ratio of various types of ores on a conveyor belt indicates how well the ores are blended, which can play a crucial role in determining the quality of steel. However, the conventional method of artificial naked eye detection based on experience is risky, time-consuming, and inaccurate. To address this issue, this study proposes an automatic ore category percentage statistics method based on multiclass semantic segmentation. The first step involves creating a clean dataset comprising five different categories of ores collected at a mine site. Subsequently, a novel U-Net-based network is introduced to segment the ore images. Specifically, a pre-trained VGG16 is adopted to replace the original backbone to enhance the feature extraction ability. A pyramid pooling module is also simplified to effectively aggregate the multiscale information. In addition, a W-shaped architecture, which bridges feature maps between the first and second encoders through addition, is utilized to generate the final probability map in a predict-refine manner. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a pixel-wise accuracy of 92.45% and a mean intersection over union of 72.42%, outperforming ten other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to predict images of unprocessed ores from a mine site to determine their category proportions, thus providing valuable guidance for optimizing the ore blending process.},

WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPRS are just a few of the wireless technologies that have facilitated the widespread availability of the internet on mobile phones, PDAs, laptops, and other portable electronic devices, and the ease with which users may exchange and sync data between them. MANET, or mobile ad hoc network, is one of the newer ways for nodes to connect because of its decentralized structure and self-configuring nature. Many different protocols control the MANET, and because of its dynamic topology, new problems have emerged in recent years. The black hole attacks put ad hoc networks at risk of data loss. These attacks trick the source into thinking it is sending data through the shortest path possible when, in reality, it is not. It’s a cosmic black hole metaphor where everything vanishes. This research aims to investigate the implications of the Blackhole attack on the On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol in a MANET and propose solutions to counteract it.

This paper proposes a novel modulation window radial basis function neural network (MW-RBFNN) with an adjustable activation function.

Compared with the basic RC-RBF neural network, the approximating ability of MW-RBFNN is improved due to its shape-tunable activation function. Besides, the computation of MW-RBFNN is far less than that of Gaussian radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) because the MW-RBFNN is compactly supported. The training algorithm of MW-RBFNN is provided and its approximating ability is proved. Moreover, the regulation mechanism of the modulation index for the NN’s performance is proved and the regulating algorithm of the modulation index in MW-RBFNN is given. The computational complexity of MW-RBFNN is also analyzed. Five typical application cases are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this proposed MW-RBFNN.},

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease that manifests in atypical behavior, impaired social interaction, and communication difficulties. This neurological disorder is commonly diagnosed in early childhood and persists until adulthood. Individuals with autism often encounter challenges in areas such as social communication, repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing. Children diagnosed with ASD may encounter challenges in effectively expressing their discomfort, leading them to exhibit atypical or less obvious signs of pain. Consequently, it becomes imperative to identify and assess pain in these individuals, while also evaluating their medical status. This could potentially lead to suboptimal pain management and avoidable distress. Healthcare providers can enhance their ability to accurately diagnose and manage pain in children with autism by employing specialized artificial intelligence (AI) models specifically built to identify and evaluate pain-related symptoms. This research introduces a novel AI model that combines ResNeXt and Mediapipe techniques for the purpose of pain recognition in autistic children. The ResNeXt model has the capability to accurately classify facial expressions in real time. The face detection module provided by Mediapipe is utilized to detect faces within an image or video stream. The Mediapipe framework can be employed for the purpose of extracting facial landmarks, including the precise positions of the eyes, nose, and mouth, subsequent to the successful identification of the face. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for the purpose of categorizing facial characteristics. The final model integrates the results of both ResNeXt + Mediapipe and CNN to accurately identify facial expressions and then assess pain levels in the face. The combination of ResNeXt and Mediapipe holds promise for the development of a face expression detection pipeline that exhibits high levels of accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.},

This study focuses on modeling an effective FER with unrestricted videos using a hybrid SegNet and ConvNet model. SegNet is used to segment the regions of facial expression, and ConvNet is used to analyze facial features and to make predictions about emotions like surprise, sadness, and happiness, among others. The suggested hybridized approach uses a neural network model to classify face characteristics depending on their location. The proposed model aims to recognize facial emotions with a quicker convergence rate and improved prediction accuracy. This work takes into account the internet-accessible datasets from the FER2013, Kaggle, and GitHub databases to execute execution. To accomplish generalization and improve the quality of prediction, the model acts as a multi-modal application. With the available datasets throughout the testing procedure, the suggested model provides 95% prediction accuracy. Additionally, the suggested hybridized model is used to calculate the system&#39;s importance. The experimental results show that, in comparison to previous techniques, the expected model provides superior prediction results and produces better trade-offs.

Then, features are extracted from augmented image, which includes texture features, statistical features, Local Neighborhood Difference Pattern (LNDP) and also, new feature termed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Local Directional Pattern (LDP). Finally, detection of skin cancer is done utilizing FCM, which showed perfect detection output in terms of skin cancer.

  abstract     = {Soil carbon fluxes are pivotal indicators of climate impacts, yet field-level monitoring remains challenging. This study puts forth an innovative integrated framework coupling support vector machine (SVM) and XGBoost algorithms to enable automated, precise tracking of peat soil carbon dioxide emissions. The core methodology handles a multi-dimensional dataset encompassing 72-h flux measurements from 360 intact tropical peat cores under controlled moisture conditions spanning 30–85% water-filled pore space across intact, logged, and oil palm converted sites. Rigorous preprocessing via outlier elimination and missing value imputation coupled with a tenfold cross-validation approach lays the robust analytical foundation. SVM first applies nonlinear transformation through Gaussian radial basis functions to classify complex soil respiration patterns. An optimized hyperplane decision boundary discretizes the high-dimensional space to separate classes. XGBoost subsequently constructs an ensemble of weighted decision trees targeting residual errors to incrementally boost predictions over 500 iterations. The integrated framework combines SVM and XGBoost outputs using performance-based weighting. This allows efficiently mapping intricate moisture, temperature, oxygen availability, microbial activity, and land use effects on peat soil carbon dioxide production and emission dynamics. Integrated predictions leverage complementary strengths. Peaking at 94.4% accuracy, 92% precision, 91% recall and 0.3 RMSE, SVM with XGBoost decisively surpasses neural networks, LSTM, gradient boosting and regression trees, proving optimized encoding of intricate moisture, texture and land use effects on soil respiration. Clustered data representations confirm feasibility of mapping complex emission behaviors across intact and drained sites. Overall, the dual framework delivers a precise, automated system to unlock new frontiers in responsive soil carbon monitoring and modeling at scale.

  abstract     = {The combination of information technology and machine learning fuels the rapid evolution of today&#39;s educational landscape. Revolutions in both fields and a common goal of improving education drive this transformative journey. In a time when resources and information are more readily available than ever, traditional teaching strategies are changing to include digital tools that meet the various needs of students. For a teaching services support system (TSS), this paper proposed a novel machine learning-based model that utilizes the powerful backpropagation (BP) neural network, well known for its machine learning and data analysis capabilities. Increasing the effectiveness of online learning is the primary objective of the TSS, which focuses on contributing to a complete learning environment and promoting self-directed learning. This work closely examines the construction and functionality of the BP neural network within the TSS, contribution visions into input–output mechanisms, activation functions, and weight coefficients. This novel approach can bring concerning a digital age educational revolution by increasing the effectiveness and caliber of online learning, rekindling students’ enthusiasm for learning, and making the best use of teaching resources. In addition, the research explores the field of data-mining-based online teaching support services in Open Universities. It clarifies the system’s architecture, which includes virtual teaching modules, resource management, and user authentication. Machine learning methods such as adaptive genetic algorithms and BP neural networks optimize the system’s architecture. Experimental results achieved remarkable BP neural network accuracy and stability, significantly enhancing instructional quality and student engagement. The results show an impressive 83.4% accuracy, outperforming traditional methods such as SVM, KNN, DT, RF, and XGBoost. This demonstrates how learning outcomes and productivity can be enhanced by incorporating machine learning into education.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has performed a paradigm shift in the method devices and systems interact, allowing seamless connectivity and communication. But, the enhancing interconnectedness and difficulty of IoT platforms also establish novel security problems, making intrusion detection a vital feature of IoT system security. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) role a vital play in detecting and monitoring unauthorized actions or malicious behavior in IoT networks. Typical IDS frequently depends on handcrafted rules or signatures that cannot not efficiently capture the difficult and developing nature of recent cyber threats. Deep learning (DL) methods automatically study and extract high-level representations in raw data, allowing more accurate and adaptive IDs. Most problems in emerging effectual IDSs are the presence of class imbalances in the database, but the count of normal instances far outweighs the count of intrusion samples. This paper focuses on the design of class imbalance data handling with optimal deep learning-based intrusion detection (CIDH-ODLID) techniques in IoT environments. The purpose of this study is to develop a CIDH-ODLID technique for the identification of intrusions in the IoT platform. For the class imbalance data handling process, the SMOTE approach is used in this work. In addition, the CIDH-ODLID technique employs an echo state network (ESN) approach for intrusion detection and classification. Finally, the snake optimization algorithm (SOA) was carried out for an optimum hyperparameter selection of the ESN approach. The performance validation of the CIDH-ODLID approach was performed on the benchmark database. To prove that the previously provided model performed better, a thorough simulation was run. The researchers provided a thorough comparative analysis that showed the proposed approach was better than other current procedures. It had an accuracy of 99.56%, precision of 97.50%, recall of 98.42%, and an F-score of 97.95%. The experimental outcomes exhibit the promising performance of the CIDH-ODLID technique over other models.},

  abstract     = {Audience feedback measurement system is a highly researched field in the scientific and marketing community. Therefore, it is an important task to know what the customer feels about their services or goods. It is also interest to other users who want information and feedback on their services. Cloud Services are essential for up and coming entrepreneurs who want to expand their enterprises without expending too much capital on infrastructure. For this purpose, a cloud ranking or recommendation system is highly necessary to choose a cloud service provider as per their needs. Usually, available rating systems give crisp values as their output, which fails to capture the intrinsic vagueness and uncertainty naturally present while users give their feedback. The main aim of this paper is to minimize uncertainty and vagueness in fuzzy logic systems. Therefore, we propose a general type-2 fuzzy set to interval-valued responses of user ratings on cloud services. The proposed method captures the uncertainty which is present in all ratings that crisp or absolute ratings fail to capture. Specifically, we convert the type-1 fuzzy set to general type-2 fuzzy sets and extract the Z slices which represent the feedback of the users with no loss of data. In particular, we gather data from users over a period of 3 weeks and ascertain the intra- and inter-user agreement on the cloud services.},

Application of MFQL is novel in this field, as it uses reinforcement learning and model-free environment. Raw data have been collected for four Indian cities in the state of Rajasthan, i.e. Jodhpur, Ajmer, Jaipur and Kota via the data portal of National Institute of Wind Energy and Wind Resource (NIWE). Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been used as the data pre-processing technique, and relevant features are extracted from Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The results obtained from the MFQL forecaster are promising with forecasting accuracy of 92.38% for winter, 93.73% for summer, 91.54% for monsoon and 92.05% for autumn season for the city of Ajmer, and similar results have been obtained for other cities as well. MFQL lends itself as an effective tool for forecasting of seasonal solar irradiance. Proposed prediction model can be effectively utilized for solar irradiance forecasting and for optimal generation of power from incident solar radiation.},

For neural synchronization, a particular neural network structure called Tree Parity Machine (TPM) is utilized. Two TPMs take the same input but have distinct weight vectors, and update the weights using the neural learning algorithm by swapping output. It leads to perfect synchronization in certain phases, with the weights of the two TPMs becoming identical. The secret key is made up of these similar weights. However, there has not been much research on the randomness of the common input vector utilized in the synchronization process. A logistic chaotic system based on TLTPM is proposed in this paper. This proposed TLTPM model has several advantages like (1) leverages logistic chaos produced random common input vector for quicker synchronization. (2) With the same input, output, and hidden neurons, the suggested TLTPM model is quicker and more secure than TPM. (3) A binary tree framework considers each neural network as a node. (4) When the binary tree’s i-th and j-th nodes are synchronized, one of these two nodes is chosen as the leader. (5) This leader node will now coordinate with the other branch’s leader. After this procedure is completed, the coordinated weight has now become the cluster’s session key. (6) And no need to synchronize each neural network in the group; rather, by coordinating between the elected leader nodes with just logarithmic synchronization steps, the whole group may share the same secret key. A variety of parametric tests have been performed on the suggested approach. The results were compared to some more contemporary methods. The suggested technique’s findings have proven that it has both effective and resilient potential.},

Transformer is a predominant deep learning model that has been widely adopted in various fields, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Compared with CNN, transformer has the ability to capture long-range dependencies to make full use of global contextual information. For low-light enhancement tasks, this capability can promote the model to learn the correct luminance, color and texture. We try to introduce transformer into the low-light image enhancement field. In this paper, we design a pyramid transformer with cross-shaped windows (CSwin-P). CSwin-P contains an encoder and decoder. Both the encoder and decoder contain several stages. Each stage contains several enhanced CSwin transformer blocks (ECTB). ECTB uses cross-shaped window self-attention and a feed-forward layer with spatial interaction unit. Spatial interaction unit can further capture local contextual information through gating mechanism. CSwin-P uses implicit positional encoding, and the model is unrestricted by the image size in the inference phase. Numerous experiments prove that our method is superior to the current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Thus far in the available literature, capability-based distributed layout (CBDL) design approaches were only developed under certain environments. Indeed, uncertainties embedded in the machine unavailability (or random machine breakdowns), product demands, and process flow data were not considered by the previous studies to achieve a robust CBDL design. However, many real-life facility layout design applications may involve different types of uncertainties simultaneously, like fuzziness and stochasticity. Based on this motivation, for the first time in the literature, this paper introduces a novel robust capability-based distributed layout (R-CBDL) design problem under a mixed fuzzy-stochastic environment. First, a new fuzzy-stochastic optimization model of the R-CBDL design problem is developed by considering the random machine breakdowns and fuzzy demand/process flow data. Then, a hybrid solution approach based on a chance-constrained stochastic programming technique with a well-known interactive fuzzy resolution method is proposed. Thus, the random machine breakdowns and fuzzy part flow rates among different machining capabilities could be easily handled via the proposed approach. Fortunately, the proposed approach can also generate various risky and risk-free robust layout design alternatives under different probabilistic scenarios and uncertainty levels (α-cuts) according to the facility designer’s risk attitude. To show the validity and applicability of the proposed R-CBDL problem and hybrid solution approach, an extensive computational study with comparative analysis is first presented based on an illustrative numerical example under different machine capability overlap cases and probability distributions. Then, the performance of the proposed approach is also tested on a real-life cellular manufacturing system of a company. The computational experiments have shown that the proposed approach can accomplish more efficient robust layout design alternatives with on average 24.5% better total expected layout score when compared to the existing cellular layout of the manufacturing company.},

Then we index scramble the image by row using 1DL-SCS and redistribute the pixel points by column, which further breaks the correlation between image pixels and prepares for diffusion. In the diffusion stage, the plaintext is divided into four parts for processing with the improved generalized Feistel structure, and the plaintext sequence in the round function is further divided into two parts, which greatly improves the diffusion efficiency. Through two rounds of iterative operations, a good diffusion effect can be achieved efficiently. Simulation experiment and performance analysis indicates that the algorithm has outstanding advantages such as excellent ciphertext statistical characteristics, and strong resistance to chosen plaintext attacks.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the problem of motorcyclist helmet detection in single images. Although some previous works have been developed to deal with this problem, yet most of them are designed for videos and not suitable for single-image helmet detection. In view of this, in this paper, we propose a novel dual-detection framework for single-image motorcyclist helmet detection with multi-head self-attention. Particularly, two types of detectors are first trained, namely the rider detector and the head-shoulder detector, which are jointly leveraged in the dual-detection scheme. To take advantage of the contextual relevance information, the multi-head self-attention mechanism is incorporated, where multiple self-attention layers are integrated to capture the complex relationships among the input features so as to further enhance the detection accuracy. A new benchmark dataset, termed the SCAU helmet detection on motorcyclists (SCAU-HDM) dataset, is presented, which consists of 8000 training images and 2000 test images. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The code is available at https://github.com/LiChunHong2020/SCAUHDM .},

  abstract     = {The emergence of complex technologies and economic competition in recent decades has led to the increasing importance of decisions about the future of organizations. Most of the former methods require a combination with the criterion weighting methods, which increases the complexity of the calculations. On the other hand, the importance of a criterion changes over time. Therefore, the provided weights must be proportional to the changes expected in the future. In this way, making future decisions based on past knowledge may not guarantee the best choice, but it can guide decision makers in the right direction. In this study, an innovative technique for simultaneously ranking options, and weighting criteria based on historical data is presented. In this method, it is possible that the reference weight is affected by other weighting methods and more accurate weights are assigned to the criteria. In addition, all the records are considered to evaluate the alternatives in relation to the criteria. After calculating the deviation and the starting point changes, a nonlinear mathematical model determines the coefficients of the reference weight (that is, the weight with the smallest difference from the values of the coefficients) and the final score of the options. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method (PSWCA) is obtained on four real case studies, and the results are compared with other methods.},

  abstract     = {The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is a popular multi-attribute decision making method. However, the increasing uncertain information with probability and the psychological factor of regret aversion of experts in some complicated situations bring new challenges to the application of traditional TOPSIS. The probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (P-HFS) is an effective tool to depict the hesitant fuzzy information with the corresponding probability, which can remain more information. In addition, the regret theory indicates that experts may care more about the regret values than the absolute values of alternatives under the fuzzy environment. This paper investigates a new probabilistic hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS (PHFTOPSIS) method based on the regret theory. We propose the corresponding concepts of utility function, reject–rejoice function and perceived utility value of the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element (P-HFE). The maximum deviation model under the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment is presented to determine the weights of attributes. The detailed implementation process of the PHFTOPSIS method based on the regret theory is also provided. Moreover, we apply the proposed method to the investment strategy. Compared with earlier methods, the proposed method can consider both the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information and regret aversion of experts at the same time in actual applications. A comparative analysis with traditional TOPSIS and probabilistic hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (PHFWA) operator is further conducted to illustrate its advantages.},

  abstract     = {The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely used multi-criteria decision-making method to address a variety of problems in the presence of conflicting or uncertain criteria. One of the key issue associated with AHP lies in the conversion of human intuition into the numerical values. To address this problem, the integration of fuzzy set theory into classical AHP has emerged as a popular approach. Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) methods represent human preferences using fuzzy numbers to incorporate vague or imprecise information, which allows FAHP methods to capture the inherent fuzziness of human decision-making. FAHP have gained attention from both researchers and practitioners, however, the effectiveness of FAHP methods is still debated. This study conducted a thorough numerical and empirical study to evaluate the efficacy of representing preferences and judgments in the form of fuzzy numbers in the AHP framework. The findings of this study showed that, in general, classical AHP methods yield significantly better $$(P \le 0.05)$$ results compared to existing FAHP methods. However, the study also found that there may be some potential benefits to using the FAHP approach, which warrant further investigation.},

  abstract     = {In a competitive online retail market, orders for assembled products such as refrigerators, air conditioners, smart televisions, etc., attract significant attention due to their high gross merchandise value. Unlike other regular products, product delivery has a two-stage process—delivery of product components and assembly and installation of the final product—involving multiple parties that may be internal or external to the organization. Coordination of the above activities is essential to reduce customer dissatisfaction and to curb the various waiting or demurrage costs due to delayed arrivals of goods vehicles and traveling salesman. This paper attempts to model and solve such a realistic synchronized goods delivery and service problem against the online booking. In this model, one goods vehicle starts from the company’s storehouse with all the goods to be delivered and moves continually, dropping the goods at the specified locations. For service, a traveling salesman separately moves and uses the appropriate conveyances among the available ones at each node to reach the customers. This paper poses some interesting research questions to understand the requirements of separate tour paths for goods vehicles and traveling salesman along with appropriate conveyance for traveling salesman’s arrival. This is an NP-hard traveling salesman problem. For solving, a varied offspring memetic algorithm (VOMA) with modified probabilistic selection, varied offspring three-parent (i.e., surro-embryos) crossover and Fibo-generation-dependent mutation is developed and tested on some standard test functions to establish its superiority over the standard ones. VOMA implementation on the above proposed problem reveals the influence of unloading and service times, halt time and third-party outsourcing charges on the final optimum route design. Finally, the paper provides a structured decision-making framework for practitioners and showcases a case study by implementing VOMA in a similar problem context.},

Then, in the existing literature, the Dombi operations lack the periodic/multitemporal operation property, and also there are no trigonometric Dombi aggregation operators for multiple attribute decision making (MADM), which show their limitation and research gap in multiple periodic MADM applications. To address their limitation and research gap, the main objective of this paper is to propose some single-valued neutrosophic element (SvNE) trigonometric Dombi aggregation operators for MADM problems. Based on this motivation, this study mainly includes the following contexts. First, we propose the trigonometric Dombi operations and the trigonometric Dombi operation laws of SvNEs based on sine and arcsine functions. Second, we establish the SvNE arcsine and sine trigonometric Dombi weighted average (SvNEASTDWA) and SvNE arcsine and sine trigonometric Dombi weighted geometric (SvNEASTDWG) operators and discuss their features. Third, a MADM technique is developed in terms of the SvNEASTDWA and SvNEASTDWG operators to tackle periodic/multitemporal MADM problems. Finally, the proposed technique is applied to a case study on the selection of COVID-19 vaccines to validate its rationality and validity under the scenario of SvNEs. Comparative results reveal that the established MADM technique using the SvNEASTDWA and SvNEASTDWG operators can show the advantage of both periodicity and flexibility and meet the flexible and multitemporal MADM requirements in actual applications.},

Unauthorized crossing of border areas, unauthorized arms and drug trafficking can be avoided at a lower cost and easier than conventional methods by monitoring the borders with the help of a WSN. In this study, we offer a mathematical model that guarantees the detection of possible intruders by scheduling the activities of the sensors whatever the route the intruder follows throughout the border zone or whatever the time the intruder enters to the route. To achieve the highest possible WSN management efficiency, we integrate coverage, routing, data routing, and sensor scheduling WSN design issues into the mathematical model. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of scheduling the sensors by the help of the offered mathematical model by comparing it against a random activity schedule of the sensors with respect to network lifetime and intruder detection ratio performance measures. We also develop a Lagrangean heuristic strategy to solve realistic sized instances of the proposed problem. We produce several random border zone instances with varying sizes and test the proposed solution strategy to illustrate the effectiveness of the offered solution strategy by comparing its performance against the performance of a commercial mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver.},

In the subsequent stage, random forest is utilized due to their recent notable advancements in supervised learning performance. Deep learning methods like long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoencoder (AE) networks are used in the experiment. The work is optimized using Harris hawks optimization (HHO).

The evaluation model can be used to evaluate and select the optimal lean management scheme that meets the SEW preferences and lean management preferences of family SMEs. Moreover, the evaluation model can also be used to provide targeted improvement suggestions for LMI to improve innovation performance. We construct an evaluation framework based on practical criteria from both lean tools and SEW carriers. These practical criteria can correspond to the activities and goals of the LMI, ensuring the usefulness of the evaluation model.

It is shown that the existence of gH-Hadamard derivative implies the existence of gH-Fréchet derivative and vise-versa. Further, it is proved that the existence of gH-Hadamard derivative implies the existence of gH-continuity of IVFs. We found that the composition of a Hadamard differentiable real-valued function and a gH-Hadamard differentiable IVF is gH-Hadamard differentiable. Further, for finite comparable IVF, we prove that the gH-Hadamard derivative of the maximum of all finite comparable IVFs is the maximum of their gH-Hadamard derivative. The proposed derivative is observed to be useful to check the convexity of an IVF and to characterize efficient points of an optimization problem with IVF. For a convex IVF, we prove that if at a point the gH-Hadamard derivative does not dominate to zero, then the point is an efficient point. Further, it is proved that at an efficient point, the gH-Hadamard derivative does not dominate zero and also contains zero.

This algorithm imitates group and individual behaviours in the reality of teaching and learning, applies group-individual multi-mode cooperation strategies to form new search mechanism. The CTLBO contains three phases, i.e. preparation phase, teaching and learning phases. In the preparation phase, there are two operators, i.e. teacher self-learning and teacher-learner interaction operators. In the teaching phase, class teaching and performance-based group teaching operators are implied. In the learning phase, neighbour learning, student self-learning and team-learning strategies are mixed together to form three operators. Two sets of experiments are conducted to test the performance of CTLBO. The first set of experiments validates the improvement effect of CTLBO by comparing it with the original TLBO and other authors’ improved versions of TLBO. The second set of experiments illustrates the advantage of CTLBO by comparing it with other 17 meta-heuristic algorithms in solving 30 general benchmark functions and 15 CEC2015 test suit functions. The results of experiments show that CTLBO algorithm has significant improvement effect compared with TLBO. It is the most effective one amongst the improved versions of TLBO selected for comparison, and outperforms all other 17 meta-heuristic algorithms. The algorithm can significantly improve the convergence ability and the accuracy in solving different-scale complex optimization models.},

  abstract     = {The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its application in various fields has resulted in the generation of significant amounts of data for processing. The Hybrid Cloud–Fog architecture makes it possible to send latency-sensitive tasks to Fog resources because of its proximity to IoT devices. More complex tasks should be sent to the Cloud data center because of its computational power and storage capacity. The scheduling of requests to optimize latency and energy consumption is a major challenge and an NP-hard problem in Cloud–Fog computing. In this study, first, we define a new multi-objective function to make a good trade-off between latency and energy. Then, to optimize this multi-objective function, we propose a Multi Objectives Cuckoo Search algorithm (MOCS) algorithm, improved by Boltzmann function, to reduce the latency and energy consumption. The simulation result proves that the improved MOCS algorithm is more effective in optimizing latency and energy consumption compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Using Evaluation Criteria indicates that the improved MOCS, based on the Boltzmann function, enhances its exploration and exploitation capabilities.},

Firstly, the feasible region of the problem is completely characterized and two necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed to determine the feasibility of the problem. Also, a general method is proposed for finding the exact optimal solutions of the non-linear model. Then, to accelerate the general method, five simplification techniques are provided that reduce the work of computing an optimal solution. Additionally, a polynomial-time method is presented for solving general latticized linear optimization problems subjected to the continuous FRI. Moreover, an application of the proposed non-linear model is described where the objective function and the FRI are defined by the well-known Lukasiewicz s-norm and product t-norm, respectively. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the identification of feedback nonlinear systems with unknown time delay (FNTD) by the chaotic decreasing weight sparrow search algorithm (CWSSA). The CWSSA algorithm uses the improved circle chaos to map the sparrow population, which avoids the problems of clustering and low coverage in the solution space of the initial solution. Thus, the global search ability and convergence speed of the algorithm are improved. By introducing a linear decreasing weight, the risk of the sparrow search algorithm being prone to premature maturity is reduced, and the oscillation phenomenon that is easy to occur near the global optimal solution in the later stage of the algorithm is avoided. Using the search capability of CWSSA and the iterative identification technology, all parameters and the unknown delay of the FNTD system are estimated simultaneously. Finally, the identification results of CWSSA, SSA and PSO are compared through a numerical example. The results show that CWSSA is superior to SSA and PSO in terms of convergence speed and estimation accuracy. The effectiveness of the CWSSA is also verified by the identification of the electro-hydraulic servo position system.},

In this study, stochastic operating room scheduling is discussed under the uncertainty of operation times. In real life, variability may vary depending on many factors from operation to operation/patient to patient. These factors are the surgeon&#39;s experience, the difficulty of the operation, the patient&#39;s weight, age, disease history, etc. In this study, separate coefficients of variability were determined for each operation, taking into account the variability factors. Operations are scheduled, taking into account the operation-specific coefficients of variation. To evaluate the variability factors, analytical network process method was used considering the interaction between them. The level of uncertainty/coefficient of variation of each operation was determined with the PROMETHEE method. Finally, the logical modeling power of constraint programming is used to solve the operating room scheduling problem. In the proposed constraint programming model, the flexibility of the goal programming method was utilized. For the modeling of uncertainties, a chance-constrained approach was used. The case study demonstrates that the proposed approach is a novel and outstanding technique, and the proposed CP model is efficient in solving the problem. As a result of the study, the uncertainty in the operation time of each patient was calculated as the variability according to the factor weights, and the tables were reconstructed according to this situation. The performance and effectiveness of the new schedules obtained under variability are shown.},

In this paper, we provide insights into the preference of subsidy mode, government’s subsidy strategies and firms’ strategies of researching and pricing among product subsidy, innovation subsidy, and product-innovation subsidy. We find that the government and companies prefer the product-innovation subsidy and detest innovation subsidy. Moreover, there is a trade-off in the government’s subsidy strategy under the product-innovation subsidy, where the product subsidy payment is higher than that under the product subsidy, and the innovation subsidy payment is lower than that under the innovation subsidy. In terms of price strategies, the manufacturer’s price is lowest under the product subsidy, and the supplier’s price is lowest under the innovation subsidy. Furthermore, the investment strategies under the three subsidy cases are positively correlated with consumer recognition and firms’ R &amp;D capabilities, while the government subsidy strategy under the innovation subsidy show some differences. Government should make the product-innovation subsidy as the first choice, and turning to the innovation subsidy as companies’ R &amp;D capabilities and consumer recognition increasing.},

  abstract     = {The Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA) is a meta-heuristic model inspired by the hunting behaviours of humpback whales. Similar to many other meta-heuristic models, e.g., Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO), the WOA is susceptible to the issues of slow convergence and local optima. In this study, we address these short comings by first proposing an Enhanced WOA (EWOA) model for tackling single-objective optimisation. Specifically, EWOA integrates the WOA and Differential Evolution (DE). DE is a population-based algorithm that generates new candidate solutions by combining the existing ones, employing a simple yet robust formula. This amalgamation aids in generating diverse solutions during the exploration stage by utilising a non-linear coefficient vector, adaptive weight, and sub-population strategies. Furthermore, fast non-dominated sorting and crowding distance techniques from the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are incorporated into EWOA, resulting in a multi-objective EWOA (MOEWOA) model. We evaluate both EWOA and MOEWOA with a broad spectrum of benchmark functions. The results from 51 single-objective optimisation problems indicate the usefulness of EWOA in terms of a fast convergence rate and with increased performance. On the other hand, MOEWOA demonstrates a better convergence rate and an effective balance between convergence and diversity in 12 multi-objective optimisation problems. In addition, MOEWOA successfully solves 21 complex multi-objective constrained mechanical design problems, outperforming other compared algorithms at the 95% confidence level. The empirical outcomes of our study indicate the potential of EWOA and MOEWOA for undertaking complex, real-world optimisation problems.},

The neural networks optimized by MOEA/D-NN were also tested on problem instances based on REDS graphs generated using varying values of R, E, and S parameters and were found to be applicable to these instances for certain ranges of parameters.

  abstract     = {S-boxes, the key nonlinear component in numerous cryptographic systems, play a crucial role in ensuring security. The quest for random highly nonlinear S-boxes, a desirable attribute for better diffusion and confusion properties, is, therefore, a critical endeavor in cryptographic research. However, generating such nonlinear S-boxes often involves significant computational effort, presenting a major challenge for researchers. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an optimized version of the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm specifically tailored for efficient generation of highly nonlinear S-boxes. Our work introduces a multithreaded implementation of the SA algorithm, a heuristic search method known for its proficiency in combinatorial optimization. The multithreading feature enhances computational efficiency, making our approach more suitable for large-scale cryptographic applications. We further optimize the algorithm by incorporating additional exit criteria for both internal and external loops, which significantly reduces the computational complexity associated with the nonlinear substitution generation process. Furthermore, we undertake comprehensive experiments to identify the optimal parameters of the SA algorithm, aiming to maximize the probability of generating target S-boxes while minimizing the number of iterations. This optimization step provides a clear pathway to improve the success rate of the generation process. The results of our study demonstrate a significant improvement over previous works, showing a 30–40% enhancement in the generation of nonlinear S-boxes.},

Nevertheless, diversity and convergence are two significant PSO limits, particularly when tackling challenging optimization issues. This paper develops a PSO with comprehensive learning and a modified dynamic multi-swarm strategy (CLDMSL-PSO) to solve these problems. In the beginning, each iteration of CLDMSL-PSO splits the total population into two subpopulations, one for exploration and the other for exploitation. The comprehensive learning (CL) strategy builds exemplars for the exploration subpopulation. The modified dynamic multi-swarm (DMS) strategy is equipped with the Quasi-Newton method to create the exploitation subpopulation. Second, a self-regulation nonlinear inertia weight, which considers the search level of different sub-swarms, is developed to accelerate the search speed in the early stage and strengthen the exploitation ability in the latter stage of the exploitation subpopulation. Third, the exploitation subpopulation uses a dynamic regrouping period parameter to regulate the frequency of information exchange among the sub-swarms. Finally, the Cauchy mutation is adopted to prevent falling into local optima during the search process. CLDMSL-PSO has been tested on extensive benchmark functions and a multifilament melt spinning process problem. Experimental results show that CLDMSL-PSO outperforms other state-of-art evolutionary algorithms on most optimization problems.},

This paper is concerned with the issues of deterioration of the items of the inventory system where the importance of time-varying holding cost on the memory-dependent inventory model has been studied. For the inclusion of the memory effect, fractional order derivative and fractional order integration have been used. Illustrative numerical examples and graphical presentations are exploited to verify the efficiency of the effect of fractional rate of change of inventory model and memory-affected costs. The numerical result shows that the output of memory-affected systems is different from the output of memory-less and low-memory-affected systems. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out in long memory effect as well as low memory effect to highlight the critical parameters of the two different systems. Sensitivity analysis clears that in the long memory effect, a small change in deterioration rate can disturb the system but in the low memory effect, such type of disturbances does not arises.

This paper addresses the optimization of four conventional and nonconventional machining processes: drilling, grinding, water jet machining (WJM), and wire electrical discharge machining (EDM). The input process parameters are: cutting speed, feed rate, cutting environment, depth of cut, grit size, water jet pressure, diameter of water jet nozzle, traverse rate of the nozzle, stand-off-distance, ignition pulse current, pulse-off time, pulse duration, servo reference mean voltage, servo speed variation, wire speed, wire tension, and injection pressure. The multi-objective EDM optimization problem is converted to a single-objective problem using the weighted-sum method. Two nature-inspired algorithms of artificial intelligence (AI) are implemented for solving these problems, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the flower pollination algorithm (FPA). Penalty functions are introduced to handle the constraints and to enhance the algorithms for better results. The machining outputs, required number of function evaluations, CPU time, and standard deviations are the performance metrics.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of making inference for a multicomponent stress–strength (MSS) model under Type-II censoring. It is assumed that stress–strength components of the multicomponent system follow unit generalized Rayleigh (UGR) distributions. Inferences are derived when the strength and stress have a common unknown UGR parameters. We derive maximum likelihood estimator of MSS reliability based on observed censored data. In sequel, interval estimator is evaluated using delta method and asymptotic normality property. Pivotal quantities based inference upon MSS reliability are derived as well. In addition, we further consider the case when all the parameters of stress–strength model are unknown and obtain various inferences for the reliability. Equivalence of model parameters is considered based on likelihood ratio test. Assessment of different methods is evaluated from Monte Carlo simulations and remarks are presented for further discussion. Three numerical examples including a petroleum reservoirs data are analyzed for illustration purposes.},

Further, linear positive operators can be modified suitably to approximate integrable functions. In this paper, we prove theoretical results on the estimates for the rate of approximation of a new sequence of operators. In addition, we find an error estimate for a larger class of functions, the functions of bounded variation. Finally, the theory is supported by suitable numerical examples, and the convergence estimates of the proposed operator are compared with the classical modified Bernstein–Durrmeyer operator.},

In this study, we focus on identifying the rings R for which the graph G(R) exhibits planarity. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the class of ring for which G(R) is toroidal, denoted by $$\gamma (G(R))=1$$ . Furthermore, we also evaluate the energy of the graph G(R).

  abstract     = {Feature selection and classification are widely used in machine learning in the context of big data. In many data sets, both attributes and decision classes can be preference ordered. Therefore, to process the data and information based on preference-ordered attributes, dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) has been proposed. DRSA considers dominance relation between objects and can process the information with preference-ordered attribute domains. The it should be noted that the majority of the algorithms based on DRSA use dependency as an underlying criterion measure for different tasks. However, calculating dependency using the conventional DRSA approach requires the calculation of lower and upper approximations which is a computationally expensive task. A new approach has been proposed in this paper which calculates the dominance-based rough set dependency measure without calculating the lower and upper approximations. The proposed methodology is called the “Incremental Dominance-based Dependency Calculation Method” (IDDC). To justify the proposed approach, both IDDC and conventional approaches are compared using various data sets from the UCI data set repository. Results have shown that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach by depicting on average $$46\%$$ and $$98\%$$ decrease in execution time and required runtime memory, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In modern industrial settings, the datasets available for mechanical fault diagnosis are often limited in size and exhibit significant imbalance posing a challenge to both the accuracy and stability of diagnostic processes. A particularly difficult task is the detection and localization of surface defects in textured materials. The complexity arises due to variable textures and the frequent scarcity of defective samples for preliminary testing. Conventional defect detection methods used in industry are typically complex, labor-intensive, and heavily dependent on expert knowledge due to the manual extraction of features and the complexity of the processing pipeline. To address these issues, the paper introduces an innovative imbalanced fault diagnosis approach leveraging the Fuzzy Clustering Generative Adversarial Network (FCGAN) model. The FCGAN is an advancement of the traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) which integrates fuzzy clustering into the discriminator’s training process for unsupervised learning. The integration of fuzzy clustering enhances the generative network’s performance. The model efficiency is further augmented by the feature extraction capabilities of FusionNet which undergoes structural optimization and conditional augmentation to generate diagnostic samples for machine faults. The effectiveness of the model is validated using two publicly accessible datasets i.e., DAGM 2007 synthetic and CCSD-NL Magnetic-Tile-Defect. The proposed method which is tested on two famous datasets, including DAGM 2007 synthetic and CCSD-NL Magnetic-Tile-Defect, has achieved prediction accuracy of 95.21% and 96.24% with a standard deviation of 65.78% and 57.44%, respectively. The results have been compared with other DL and traditional methods, including GAN, CNN, and adaptive deep CNN. The comparisons show that the proposed FCGAN data-driven fault diagnosis method has achieved significant improvements.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, environmental concerns have emerged as significant obstacles to economic advancement, leading to a critical examination of the complex relationship between environmental sustainability and economic expansion. With the economy expanding swiftly and environmental hazards intensifying, immediate action must be taken to address these problems. This necessitates innovative policies and practices that foster sustainable economic growth while minimizing environmental impact. To solve these issues, this study proposed an extensive analytical framework employing machine learning techniques, particularly artificial neural networks (ANNs), to investigate the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. According to the EKC hypothesis, environmental degradation worsens before economic growth occurs. This study examines GDP per capita and key environmental indicators to measure economic development, using data from Anhui Province, China, from 2012 to 2019. The analysis provides empirical support for the theory and establishes a modeling framework that seamlessly integrates ML methodologies with EKC analysis, systematically examining and assessing the EKC&#39;s reliability for Anhui Province. The intricate interplay between Anhui Province&#39;s environment and economy, utilizing industrial waste gas, wastewater, and solid waste as critical indicators, evaluates environmental quality. At the same time, per capita GDP is the economic growth parameter. The findings indicate that the EKC does not adhere to an unchanging law but instead displays variations in distribution characteristics. The experimental results of the proposed ANN model demonstrate an impressive accuracy rate of 87%, outperforming five alternative models, including RF, KNN, DT, and LR. This superior model performance underscores the effectiveness of the ANN-based approach in capturing the intricate dynamics linking economic development and environmental pollution.},

  abstract     = {The growth of global environmental concerns has prompted a worldwide movement towards sustainable development. In recent years, China&#39;s rapid economic growth has been reflected in increased environmental degradation, exacerbated by rapid urbanization, the urban–rural divide, and a government commitment to urban ecological preservation at the expense of rural areas. At the same time, rural communities require increased cultural awareness of environmental conservation and sustainable practices. To address the indiscriminate depletion of natural resources endangering China&#39;s rural landscapes, this paper presents a novel framework that combines deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with rural ecological governance. A thorough understanding of rural ecological dynamics is made possible by the integration of cutting-edge CNN technology, which facilitates complex data processing and image recognition from satellite and sensor data. Utilizing the Eurostat dataset, it carries out an extensive sustainability analysis of rural ecological governance by applying fundamental theories of environmental governance, such as polycentricity and symbiosis, that are adapted for rural environments. The pastoral environmental governance issues are systematically addressed by means of a multi-stage PPS hierarchical approach. The framework also suggests a novel approach to household waste management for isolated communities, focusing on natural sewage treatment and waste recycling as ways to reduce environmental impact. This all-encompassing strategy seeks to transform rural ecological management by providing customized solutions to protect resources and promote sustainable development in China&#39;s rural areas. The experimental results show a fantastic accuracy rate of 98.5% of the CNN model. This compares favorably to recognized architectures such as ResNet16, ResNet32, and ResNet64, demonstrating CNN&#39;s ability to handle complex features of rural landscapes. A comparative analysis with RNN and LSTM highlights CNN&#39;s capacity to extract hierarchical features and capture spatial dependencies. In addition, the work reveals that rural residents have an overall satisfaction rate of 85.2% with environmental governance, of which 45.6% provide high levels of satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid development of the world’s economy has led to the large-scale development and utilization of ecological resources on the earth, due to which the ecological environment has been continuously and seriously damaged, resulting in the waste of resources, soil erosion, land desertification, etc. To avoid further damage to the ecological environment and ecological resources, improve the utilization rate of ecological resources, and ensure the sustainable development of human society, it is necessary to evaluate the ecological environment. In this study, we collected the required data using the Delphi method and remote sensing technology. Secondly, the green Olympic building evaluation system (which refers to the CASBEE method in Japan) was used to evaluate the impact of green roofs on architectural design and the urban ecological environment. Third, a deep learning (DL)-based hybrid model, which consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long–short-term memory (SLSTM), known as CNN–LSTM, was used to evaluate the impact of green roofs on urban ecology and building architectural design. The influence of thermal comfort on the indoor environment of green roof buildings was studied. For experimentation, six samples of Shanghai Thumb Plaza, Splendid Tesco Point, Chaoshan Yuan Hotel, Green Management Office, Huangpu District Domestic Waste Transfer Station, and Changning District Fuxin Slaughterhouse were selected as evaluation objects, and the effect of green roofs on building design and urban ecology was evaluated from six levels: ecological, ornamental, safety, functional, social, and economic. Both the CASBEE and DL-based methods, CNN–LSTM, performed well and increased the evaluation results to some extent. The CNN–LSTM model increased the accuracy of the system by 3.55%, precision by 3.50%, recall by 4.46%, and F1-score by 3.30%. Overall, this study summarizes the existing problems of green rooftop buildings in Shanghai at this stage, which is conducive to formulating optimization strategies to improve the ecological benefits of green roof buildings and has important practical significance for realizing the sustainable development of human society.},

  abstract     = {In sports such as football, baseball, basketball, and tennis, advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and virtual reality (VR) have opened up new opportunities for training simulation and data analysis. Recently, these technologies have been applied to football to better analyze team behavior and individual player behavior. The existing work, however, relies solely on VR technology or AI; they do not combine the two. In this study, however, we proposed a three-dimensional tactical training system for football players that applies both AI and VR. To meet the needs of football players&#39; training and improve the efficiency of football players&#39; tactical training and competition results, this paper aims to conduct an in-depth study on the application of AI and VR technologies in football players&#39; tactical training. We started with the design of a thorough system architecture, which links the perceptual interface and model calculus subsystems together. We created realistic three-dimensional football tactical training scenarios using virtual reality technology as part of the perceptual interaction domain. Additionally, the physical characteristics of football mobilization are computed using the model calculus subsystem as a component of logic modules to boost training realism. We incorporated an artificial neural network (ANN) into the framework of the system, providing real-time error feedback and changes. This ANN constitutes the nucleus of a cutting-edge training methodology and integrates effortlessly into our architectural framework. We carefully assessed the ANN&#39;s performance as well as the performance of the proposed model as a whole to demonstrate how well it works for football players and coaches. The results of our proposed system are remarkable when compared to the currently suggested methods in the literature on this topic.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of technology has resulted in significant changes in the field of education. In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Bayesian network technology have emerged as promising tools for enhancing operations research and teaching performance evaluation. IoT devices and sensors can provide real-time data on student performance, while Bayesian network technology can analyze and predict the complex relationships between various variables. This paper proposes a performance evaluation model based on IoT and Bayesian network technology for operations research teaching. Operations research is a broad discipline with a high level of practicality and applicability. It is widely used in business administration, production planning, traffic management, engineering construction, and financial economics. Using experiments, analysis, and quantification, operations research organizes and manages all types of resources in the system, such as human resources, funds, and goods, and formulates the best business plan. Operations research teaching must combine intuitive geometry and immaterial theorems to improve students’ understanding. The methods used in the teaching stage are simple: the teaching content could be more exciting and unintended, and it is difficult to grasp the teaching focus, making accurate evaluation of teaching performance difficult. Therefore, in the Bayesian network, the incremental results and the performance evaluation model of operations research achieve an accuracy of 87.3%. By thoroughly examining the fundamentals of Bayesian network technology, one can offer technical assistance in building an operational research teaching performance evaluation model. To combine with real-world teaching scenarios to assess the likelihood of risky events occurring during instruction and make a teaching performance evaluation model grounded in operational research. The B5 teaching effect has the highest risk probability of teaching work (0.89), and teachers with high professional titles have higher average values.},

These advancements have created unprecedented opportunities for leveraging data-driven insights and informed decision-making. Urban populations swiftly adopt information technology solutions to monitor and regulate noise levels and environmental pollutants effectively. This research aims to bridge the traditional gap between environmental science and economics by harnessing cutting-edge AI and IoT technologies. Support vector machine (SVM) is a robust machine learning algorithm known for its ability to decipher complex, non-linear relationships within large and intricate datasets. This study constructs a robust simultaneous equation model by integrating economic indicators, real-time IoT sensor data, and relevant covariates.

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of IoT technology presents transformative opportunities across various sectors, with education being a prominent beneficiary. Smart classrooms, a product of IoT integration, are being widely adopted to create technology-enhanced, student-centric learning environments that cater to students&#39; information literacy needs, particularly during events like pandemics. This widespread adoption generates substantial amounts of educational data, commonly known as big data, necessitating innovative solutions for analysis and utilization. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes utilizing the Apriori algorithm—a data mining technique renowned for uncovering valuable patterns and associations within extensive datasets. This paper evaluates the impact of various information resources with differing quality, considering individuals&#39; information literacy skills. Utilizing data mining techniques, it delves into university students&#39; information literacy data, integrating it with the university library resources to establish a data-driven information literacy education model. It then focuses on criteria, components, and effective methods for instructing college students in information literacy. Finally, a diverse group of students, from first-year undergraduates to doctoral candidates at a specific university, is studied for their engagement in information literacy instruction. Based on the experimental findings, sophomore students exhibited the highest level of participation at 75.9% accuracy, while postgraduate students received more information literacy training than undergraduates and Ph.D. students. When comparing this method to others, such as SVM, KNN, LR, RF, and DT, it achieved superior performance. Additionally, the quality of information literacy training in university libraries was assessed through three dimensions: student learning, behavior, and achievements. Only junior, senior, and first-year graduate students scored above 4, with scores of 4.18, 4.15, and 4.26, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The fast rise of rural tourism in China has necessitated an assessment of the ecological circumstances in rural areas. But because rural landscapes are complicated and there are many different characteristics to consider, this can be challenging. With an emphasis on Pingchang County, Bazhong City, Sichuan Province, in particular, this study aims to provide a technique for the comprehensive assessment of the ecological environment quality in rural tourism zones. Analyzing the variables influencing these tourist destinations’ ecological environments is one of the multiple-criterion decision-making procedures known as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The fuzzy synthesis method was used after the hierarchical model was constructed and weight calculations were completed. To complete the assessment, a judgment matrix was created, and the weights of each indicator were determined. The assessment was then carried out through detailed review and consistency testing. The proposed approach works well for managing complex decision-making circumstances, including multiple criteria, and agreeing with professional opinions. The results of this study show consistent criteria ranking, high stability across iterations, minimal sensitivity to changes in criteria, and strong alignment with expert judgments. The results obtained using the proposed AHP method were numerically consistent, with a consistency ratio (CR) of 0.08, meaning that the criteria ranking remained constant across the iterations. In addition, the approach demonstrated a 0.95 alignment score with expert opinions, confirming its strength and reliability in providing evaluations in accordance with professional insights to direct rural tourism development plans.},

This research explores vocal music teaching against the backdrop of the twenty-first century educational reforms seeking innovation and pursuing new teaching methodologies. The goal is to develop an autonomous learning framework reinforced by machine learning techniques that use conventional neural networks. The present study aims to implement machine learning algorithms in education, because esthetic education promotes excellence and humanistic attributes in educational environments, and art is essential in social activities. The main goal is to provide a framework that enables music education majors to access a customizable learning environment by integrating a pluralistic network approach and the strength of conventional neural networks. Music education constitutes an integral facet of quality, ideological, and moral education within general colleges and universities. The mission of music education, cultivating competent teachers for various Chinese institutions, necessitates a comprehensive understanding of students’ learning patterns, thinking characteristics, and behavioral phenomena. This study analyzes these facets across diverse levels and perspectives, employing empirical generalization, literature synthesis, logical reasoning, and action research methodologies. The research findings underscore an accuracy rate of 97.4%, emphasizing the augmentation of students&#39; independent learning abilities in vocal music education at higher education institutions. The proposed approach outperforms machine learning techniques such as RNNs, LSTMs, and DNNs.

On any given platform, it is thought that 14% of the reviews are fraudulent. To identify bogus reviews, several academics have put forth several strategies. The drawback of existing techniques is that they analyze the entire review text, which lengthens calculation times and reduces accuracy. In our suggested method, just these elements and their corresponding feelings are used for the detection of phony reviews. Aspects that have been retrieved are sent to CNN for learning. To detect false reviews, the reproduced attributes are input into long short-term memory (LSTM). As far as we are aware, despite the optimization it provides, aspects of replication and extraction are not employed to detect fake reviews, which is a big contribution from us. Performance comparisons with more modern methods are done using the Ott and Yelp Filter datasets. Analysis of the results of experiments shows that our suggested strategy beats current strategies. To demonstrate that dense hybrid network models (d-HNM) are superior to established machine learning techniques for difficult computing problems, our approach is also contrasted with others.},

Stealth assessment might radically extend the impact and scope of learning analytics. Stealth assessment describes the unobtrusive assessment of learner by using emergent data from the digital traces in electronic learning environment via machine learning technology. This study presents a new stealth assessment model using ensemble learning for inferring the student competency in a game-based learning (GBL) environments, named ELSAM-GBL technique. To perform automated and accurate stealth assessment, this study focuses on the design of ensemble learning model by the incorporation of three DL models, namely gated recurrent unit (GRU), sparse auto encoder (SAE), and vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN). At the same time, the hyperparameter tuning of the DL models takes place using the atomic orbital search (AOS) optimization algorithm, which helps in improving the ensemble learning process. To demonstrate the enhanced stealth assessment performance of the ELSAM-GBL technique, a comprehensive experimental analysis is conducted. The comparative study shows the enhanced performance of the presented ELSAM-GBL technique over other DL models in terms of different metrics.},

  abstract     = {In 2021, Lu et al. proposed a reversible data hiding (RDH) scheme for interpolated images based on a multilayer center-folding strategy with a high embedding rate and image quality. However, their data encoding method and the chosen block size are not optimal, leaving the watermarked image quality and the embedding rate to be improved. To further reduce the distortion caused by embedded data, we propose an improved RDH scheme for interpolated images using an improved data encoding method. First, an improved two-layer data encoding method is proposed, which encodes the original data $${\varvec{R}}$$ by comparing the amplitude of $${\varvec{R}}$$ and its complement and the center folding strategy to form a new encoding pair $$({\varvec{R}}^{&#39;&#39;}, {\varvec{F}})$$ . Thereafter, the neighbor mean interpolation method proposed by Jung and Yoo is used to generate an interpolated image divided into $${\varvec{m}}\times {\varvec{m}}$$ non-overlapping blocks. Additionally, the interpolated pixels in each block are pre-processed to solve the overflow/underflow problem. Finally, the encoded data $${\varvec{R}}^{&#39;&#39;}$$ and $${\varvec{F}}$$ are embedded into the pre-processed interpolated pixels to achieve blind extraction. We theoretically prove that the image quality obtained with a block size of $$2\times 2$$ is superior to that of many other blocks. The results of extensive experiments on the BossBase, BOWS-2, NCID, and SIPI databases confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms several state-of-the-art schemes, with the average PSNR value improved by $$\sim $$ 7.58 dB when 3-bit data are embedded into each interpolated pixel. These results indicate that our proposed scheme is effective.},

  abstract     = {The digital era brings up on one hand massive amounts of available data and on the other hand the need of parallel computing architectures for efficient data processing. String similarity evaluation is a processing task applied on large data volumes, commonly performed by various applications such as search engines, biomedical data analysis and even software tools for defending against viruses, spyware, or spam. String similarities are also used in musical industry for matching playlist records with repertory records composed of song titles, performer artists and producers names, aiming to assure copyright protection of mass-media broadcast materials. The present paper proposes a novel GPU-based approach for parallel implementation of the Jaro–Winkler string similarity metric computation, broadly used for matching strings over large datasets. The proposed implementation is applied in musical industry for matching playlist with over 100k records with a given repertory which includes a collection of over 1 million right owner records. The global GPU RAM memory is used to store multiple string lines representing repertory records, whereas single playlist string comparisons with the raw data are performed using the maximum number of available GPU threads and the stride operations. Further on, the accuracy of the Jaro–Winkler approach for the string matching procedure is increased using both an adaptive neural network approach guided by a novelty detection classifier (aNN) and a multiple-features neural network implementation (MF-NN). Thus, the aNN approach yielded an accuracy of 92% while the MF-NN approach achieved an accuracy of 99% at the cost of increased computational complexity. Timing considerations and the computational complexity are detailed for the proposed approaches compared with both the general-purpose processor (CPU) implementation and the state-of-the-art GPU approaches. A speed-up factor of 21.6 was obtained for the GPU-based Jaro–Winkler implementation compared with the CPU one, whereas a factor of 3.72 was obtained compared with the existing GPU implementation of string matching procedure based on Levenstein distance metrics.},

Our purpose is to identify the drawbacks of the existing models and then improve the risk assessment of failure modes under uncertain environments. For this purpose, we present a novel FMEA technique based on rough numbers and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) in multi-criteria decision-making problems. The presented FMEA model integrates the advantages of the PROMETHEE approach and the modified entropy weight method in coping with the roughness of linguistic assessment information. To illustrate its potential applications, the proposed method is tested to examine the risks of the general anesthesia process in the medical field.

A model used to recognize handwritten Hindi (Devanagari) characters is called Hindi OCR (optical character recognition). Despite the fact that only a few nature-inspired algorithms are used for OCR, none are used for the characters seen in natural scenes due to the difficulties presented by the various fonts, lighting, orientation, and texture variations. Also, Hindi’s curved and complicated architecture makes it challenging to separate and analyze the text or character. Better feature databases are created using the proposed Hybrid EHO–B3C model to facilitate categorization. Two standard datasets of English characters, Char74k and ICDAR03, are used to assess the performance of the novel Hybrid EHO–B3C on natural scene characters. The proposed model is also evaluated on the Devanagari handwritten character dataset, which is a dataset consisting of characters from the Hindi language. Results show 83% results on Char74k and 86.4% on ICDAR, comparable to most available techniques. We have also examined our algorithm for face recognition by examining it on five different datasets, namely MUCT, Faces94, Extended Yale B, Georgia Tech, and Grimace, and attained high recognition results, even though the data sets differ in size, image size, brightness and ethnicity of people.},

The present study incorporates the quantity-dependent ordering cost and time-dependent holding cost. A partial prepayment scheme is developed for inventory purchase decisions. The spoilage impact can be effectively reduced by an optimal investment in refrigeration. The optimal decision policy has been proposed by using three metaheuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization, real-coded genetic algorithm, and differential evolution algorithm. A comparison is made for these metaheuristic schemes based on the numerical illustrations.

The application of computer vision to diagnose tomato diseases and pests presents two significant challenges. Firstly, the collected dataset of tomato pests and diseases is often imbalanced, leading to poor model performance. Secondly, mainstream models struggle to balance the relationship between training efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method for diagnosing tomato pests and diseases using a lightweight network. Specifically, we develop Squeeze and SE Net (SSNet), a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based on SqueezeNet and SENet. We evaluate the performance of SSNet through comparative experiments for diagnosing tomato pests and diseases. Additionally, we examine the impact of dataset balance, data volume, and hyperparameters on model performance. Our results demonstrate that SSNet achieves model accuracies of 98.80% and 98.39% for tomato pests and diseases, respectively, with only 0.398 M parameters. This approach provides a promising and lightweight alternative to existing models.},

This article proposes parameter extraction of solar PV models using the Artificial Humming bird Optimization (AHO) algorithm. The AHO algorithm is inspired by hummingbird flight dynamics and mimics hummingbird foraging behavior. Three objective functions are developed to minimize the root mean square difference between the experimental and estimated currents. The first objective function is based on the conventional RMSE, while the second is developed using the Lambert W function, and the third is developed using the iterate Newton–Raphson approach. The AHO algorithm has been utilized to determine the parameters for a basic single-diode model (SDM), a double-diode model (DDM), and a photovoltaic module. The AHO algorithm exhibits an average RMSE value of 7.2985 $$\times $$ 10–04 for the SDM model and 7.4080 $$\times $$ 10–04 for the DDM model.

This paper addresses the aforementioned challenges by introducing a linear–quadratic-regulator (LQR) controller assisted by the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) to stabilize the pendulums on the cart, while also allowing it to follow the desired movements and overcoming the unmodeled dynamics of the system. The GSA is used to improve the system performances while maintaining stability. The suitability of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental studies, including cases with additional weights on the bob and on the cart and external disturbances. The improvements in system performances are shown through a comparative study with the performances of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and quantum PSO-based LQR controllers. The findings corroborate the efficacy of the proposed method in stabilizing the underactuated double inverted pendulum system on a cart in the nominal operating conditions and situations with additional weights and external disturbances.},

In this paper, an effective and efficient algorithm is proposed to measure the quality (i.e., deficiency) of a Mahjong hand by introducing a hierarchical branch and bound method. In the proposed approach, an updating knowledge-based octree search method is first developed to explore all possible quasi-decompositions for one hand to ensure the correctness of the result. Meanwhile, an updated knowledge-based evaluation method is designed to calculate the cost of each quasi-decomposition, and a hierarchical branch and bound method is presented to accelerate the efficiency of getting its deficiency by layering the quasi-decompositions according to the number of their tiles. Moreover, the block decomposition is further adopted in the process of finding all quasi-decompositions to enhance its efficiency. Compared to existing methods, the proposed algorithm not only demonstrates computational efficiency but also provides the exact deficiency in all cases. Experimental results on different types of hands show its effectiveness and efficiency.},

The results of our study indicate that the incorporation of fundamental financial data alongside technical data significantly enhances the accuracy of predicting future prices compared to systems relying solely on past price data. To further assess the effectiveness of our FISs, we conducted t-tests to compare their results with those of traditional technical trading strategies and the Buy–Hold strategy.

However, the studies on resilient supply chain design considering these two types of risks are limited. Furthermore, how to quantify the uncertainty arising from the lack of historical data in the planning stage has not been sufficiently studied. Aiming at these problems, this paper presents two uncertain programming models that optimize strategic decisions before disruptions and supply chain operations after disruptions. The proposed models introduce p-robustness measure to control the cost in disruption scenarios. Besides, uncertainty theory is adopted to handle parameter uncertainty without historical data. Later, these two programming models are converted into their corresponding deterministic equivalents, which can be solved by cplex. Finally, we illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed models and explore the impact of critical parameters on the optimal solution by implementing a series of randomly generated instances and a practical case.

Clustering is a widely adopted strategy to improve the performance and longevity of the network by organizing it into smaller groups called clusters. Most swarm-based clustering algorithms aim to optimize a single objective, such as finding optimal cluster centers. However, in practical situations, simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives is often necessary to obtain promising cluster centers. In this study, we propose a multi-objective binary Grey wolf optimizer to find Pareto optimal clustering centers and achieve five objectives: maximizing overall cluster head energy, minimizing cluster compactness, minimizing the number of cluster heads, minimizing energy consumption from non-cluster head to cluster head transmission, and maximizing cluster separation. Our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art evolutionary clustering protocols, such as SEP, IHCR, ERP, and BEECP, in terms of minimizing the percentage of dead nodes. Additionally, the stability period of the network is increased by 56% with our proposed approach. Simulation outcomes demonstrate improved performance in terms of total residual energy, number of elected cluster heads, and network lifetime.},

  abstract     = {As a nature-inspired metaheuristic method, the firefly algorithm (FA) arises more attentions in academic and engineering fields. However, too much attraction in FA’s global attraction model leads to low computational efficiency, and the stochastic model with fixed randomization parameter is hard to balance the exploitation and exploration of the algorithm. Thus, FA still needs improvement to deal with complex engineering problems. An integrated firefly algorithm (IFA) that combines two novel attractive models with a new stochastic model is proposed to improve the standard FA. Firstly, the attractive model and stochastic model of standard FA are investigated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. And the factors that affect the computational efficiency and accuracy of FA are revealed. Based on the analysis results, two new fitness-based update formulas for attractiveness parameter are constructed to avoid the invalidation. The proposed virtual attractive model and global best attractive model can reduce the computation complexity and enhance the exploitation ability. Moreover, an adaptive strategy is presented for the stochastic model to achieve a better balance between exploitation and exploration. The nonlinearly decreased model for the update of parameter α can adjust the population diversity through the iteration and ensure the convergence. Additionally, an adaptive penalty function method is developed to handle the constraints effectively. Then, the initial parameters are tested, and the best initial parameters corresponding to the optimal performance of IFA are obtained. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by CEC2015 hybrid composition and a set of classical functions. The numerical experimental results show that the proposed techniques can enhance the solution accuracy and accelerate the convergence speed. Finally, IFA and other metaheuristic algorithms are applied to solve five engineering design optimization problems with mixed variables and multiple constraint conditions. The results indicate that IFA with adaptive penalty function needs fewer fitness evaluations and costs less computational time to obtain the optimal solutions. Furthermore, it exhibits better accuracy and robustness than other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This research article presents a novel two-step generalized parametric approach to address various fuzzy parameter-based multi-objective transportation problems. These problems involve uncertain or imprecise data, making it challenging to find precise solutions. This research article aims to find multiple optimal solutions for various values of the parameter $$\mu \in [0,1]$$ , ultimately giving decision-makers a range of options from which the final solution is to choose. The suggested methodology consists of two main steps. In the first step, the fuzzy data is partitioned into distinct split levels using parametric equations controlled by the precision parameter $$\mu $$ , thereby transforming the FMOTPs into CMOTPs. In the second step, fuzzy programming techniques are employed to solve the CMOTPs for varying values of $$\mu $$ , generating multiple optimal solutions. The gray relational analysis (GRA) technique is utilized within each split level to identify the best optimal compromise solution for that specific level. Furthermore, the preferred compromise solution is selected based on its minimal Euclidean distance to the ideal solution across all split levels, offering additional insights for decision-making. The proposed method is illustrated on three numerical problems, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing a range of trade-offs between conflicting objectives. A comparative analysis with existing methods in the literature highlights the advantages of the proposed approach, showcasing its practical usefulness in real-world transportation decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {This review aims to exploit a study on different benchmark test functions used to evaluate the performance of Meta-Heuristic (MH) optimization techniques. The performance of the MH optimization techniques is evaluated with the different sets of mathematical benchmark test functions and various real-world engineering design problems. These benchmark test functions can help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of newly proposed MH optimization techniques. This review paper presents 215 mathematical test functions, including mathematical equations, characteristics, search space and global minima of the objective function and 57 real-world engineering design problems, including mathematical equations, constraints, and boundary conditions of the objective functions carried out from the literature. The MATLAB code references for mathematical benchmark test functions and real-world design problems, including the Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC) and Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) test suite, are presented in this paper. Also, the winners of CEC are highlighted with their reference papers. This paper also comprehensively reviews the literature related to benchmark test functions and real-world engineering design challenges using a bibliometric approach. This bibliometric analysis aims to analyze the number of publications, prolific authors, academic institutions, and country contributions to assess the field&#39;s growth and development. This paper will inspire researchers to innovate effective approaches for handling inequality and equality constraints.},

Protist Algorithm (PA) is modelled based on the Protist’s natural activities. Protist exists in moist places. The leading nutritious phase is Plasmodium, the energetic and vibrant phase of Protist. In this segment, the organic substance in Protist search for food in surroundings and conceals enzymes for digestion. Natural actions of Otocyon megalotis are emulated to design the OOA approach. In the projected OOA searching of regions in exploration, for foodstuff the Otocyon megalotis mark the prey in the space is indicated as a global exploration. Real power loss reduction and Voltage stability enhancement are the key objectives of the paper. To solve the problem, Protist algorithm (PA) and Otocyon megalotis optimization algorithm. In the course of the migration procedure, the anterior end outspreads and interconnected arterial system that authorize cytoplasm to stream inside. Then, mutation and cross-over probability are employed to augment the performance of the Protist algorithm (PA). With this integration engendering of the population is done. Mutation classes the population exploration agents (PN) in uphill order conferring to the agents appropriateness (fitness) cost. Consequently, the technique splits the organized agents into three fragments rendering to their fitness value. In which PN/3 denotes to the population possess pre-eminent (aptness) fitness values, subsequently with second pre-eminent and poorest aptness (fitness) values. Then, in this paper, Otocyon megalotis optimization algorithm (OOA) is applied for solving the Power loss lessening problem.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the automotive industry has witnessed the increasing adoption of mixed-model assembly lines (MMALs) to meet the demands of mass customization. However, the diverse components of various end products are posing significant challenges to the material feeding processes in MMALs. To address this issue and enhance the material feeding efficiency, this paper proposes an innovative automatic monorail shuttle system (AMSS). The AMSS is designed based on the layout of line-integrated supermarkets and incorporates the load-exchangeable shuttles and crossovers. Considering the importance of cost control in manufacturing enterprises, the objective of this paper is to minimize the total costs associated with the material feeding system, which includes the installation costs of crossovers, as well as the input and operation costs of load-exchangeable shuttles. A mathematical model is thereby established to describe the problem, and its accuracy is validated through the Gurobi solver. Recognizing the NP-hard nature of the proposed problem, a shuffled frog leaping-based hyper-heuristic (SBHH) algorithm is developed to allocate and schedule the shuttles and crossovers, which adopts the shuffled frog leaping algorithm as the high-level heuristic for selecting low-level heuristics. To further improve the performance, dynamic decision unit is introduced to raise the solution accuracy and the convergence speed. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed SBHH algorithm both in solution quality and convergence speed by comparing with other benchmark optimization algorithms. Managerial applications indicate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach, offering implications for practitioners in the automotive industry.},

  abstract     = {The explosion of wireless network services has led to a need for new technologies and resource allocation schemes. Device-to-device (D2D) can reduce the access pressure of base station (BS) equipment, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can multiplex network spectrum resources. The integration of them can further improve the performance of multi-cell networks. However, users still face more interference in multi-cell networks. This paper analyzes the relationship between transmission power and serial interference cancellation decoding order. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate of D2Ds, we propose three feasible frameworks based on the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. First, we invoke a coevolution DE-based resource allocation (CDRA) framework, which encodes the RB assignment and power allocation into the same individual for evolution. Second, we propose an iteration-combining DE-based resource allocation (IDRA) framework, which adopts a two-step DE algorithm to solve optimal power allocation and RB assignment scheme iteratively. Lastly, we invoke the power-repairing DE-based resource allocation (PDRA) framework, which can perform power repair on individuals with failed evolution. Simulation results demonstrate that: (1) the integration of D2D and NOMA techniques is capable of enhancing the achievable sum rate of D2Ds; (2) the three proposed frameworks for multi-cell NOMA networks can effectively optimize the objective function. Compared with CDRA and IDRA, PDRA performs better in terms of convergence speed and maximum D2D rate.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive understanding of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is a key problem in contemporary biology, which is a critical issue in gene regulation. Identifying a pattern of TFBSs in every DNA sequence, motif discovery reveals the basic regulatory relationship and compassionate the evolutionary system of every species. In this case, recognizing the high-quality (ℓ, d) motif is a great challenge. This problem is addressed in motif discovery and motif finding, using the proposed algorithms, such as Segmentation to Filtration (S2F) and Firefly with FREEZE (FFF), respectively. In this study, the whole DNA sequences are divided into two segments. Segment 1 involves motif discovery and is sliced by base and sub k-mers applying an iterative approach, followed by filtration 1 and 2 techniques, respectively. This approach obtains the top five percent of the best motifs (TOPbk_mer) based on accuracy. In segment 2, the motifs recognized in segment 1 are given as input to the FFF algorithm to identify the TFBs locations. The standard firefly algorithm with two freezing techniques, local and global, is employed to recognize the final motif. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated on the simulated datasets and real datasets such as the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) dataset, mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) dataset, and human species ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immuno Precipitation Sequences) dataset. All of these datasets have a running time of the experiment within 3 min, and the sequence numbers (t) hold ranges up to 39,601. It is evident from the results that the two proposed algorithms, S2F and FFF, can identify the high-quality motif, and it is faster than the state-of-the-art PMS and QPMS algorithms.},

The aim is to estimate the traffic volumes for a given set of routes under the assumption that the available sensors are insufficient to uniquely identify all route flows. We present a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to determine the sensor locations so that in the system of linear equations solved in the path reconstruction phase, those routes whose volume cannot be uniquely determined, are linked to each other by equations involving a small number of unknowns. By this approach, experts’ opinions or historical information can be used to give a more precise estimation for those routes whose volumes are not uniquely observable. Since the direct resolution of the model via MILP solvers is time-consuming over moderate- and large-sized instances, by utilizing the problem structure, a genetic algorithm is adopted to find high-quality solutions to the model. Computational experiments over different instances, taken from the literature, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

On the other hand, assembly line balancing (ALB) problems provide details on operational decisions which encompass production levels and inventories and therefore should be flexible enough to react when changes in resource availability and product demands occur. This study develops a novel combination of these independent problems as a multi-objective SCND-ALB problem which considers economic, environmental, and social objectives in determining the optimal design and operational conditions of the supply chain which consists of U-shaped assembly lines. Furthermore, the normal type belief degree-based uncertainty is considered to reflect the uncertainty of the parameters of the problem. The uncertain formulation is crisped using two different approaches. Then, two multi-objective solution approaches of the literature such as TH and GCM approaches are considered to simultaneously account for the three sustainability objectives of the obtained crisp multi-objective formulations. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the problem in detail. Furthermore, several test problems are used to compare the performance of the solution approaches. Based on the obtained results, the TH approach performs better in 100% of the experiments.},

  abstract     = {Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a type of swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. The GWO has strong local search ability and fast convergence. Moreover, GWO is easily implemented due to its small number of parameters and unique population structure. Nevertheless, GWO still has the shortcoming of low accuracy, and it is easy to fall in local optima. To overcome this shortcoming, an ameliorated grey wolf optimizer (AGWO) is proposed in this paper. In the AGWO, an opposition-based learning strategy is employed to optimize the GWO algorithm for making a balance between exploration and exploitation. This process can efficiently prevent the AGWO from falling into a local optimum. In addition, to solve the problems of dimensional degradation and computational complexity in opposition-based learning, orthogonal design is introduced to reverse in certain dimensions. At the same time, to reduce the calculation time of the algorithm, two most representative individuals (the best individual and the worst individual) are selected to perform orthogonal opposition-based learning. The proposed AGWO is evaluated on 23 benchmark functions and the well-known IEEE CEC2022 benchmark suite. Based on the simulation results, it is observed that AGWO achieves superior solution compared to GWO and most algorithms. Moreover, AGWO is utilized to optimize the parameters of three engineering design problems, and the results show that AGWO can solve real-world engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, numerous mutants of SARS-CoV-2 have since been evolved owing to high transmissibility and virulence. Due to the limited effectiveness of previously imposed vaccines and preventive therapies, these strains are still causing concern. This paper proposes comparative evaluation of three novel genomic signal processing-based methods employing discrete wavelet decomposition with lifting (DWT), discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and singular value decomposition (SVD) for the classification of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants utilizing feature extraction from collected SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired from the NCBI virus database. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed alignment-free algorithms have been tested using three Coronavirus datasets including human Coronavirus (HCoV), SARS-CoV-2 variants (CoV-Variants and Omicron). The viral nucleotide sequences which are converted into numerical representation leveraging purine-pyrimidine mapping, DNA walk &amp; Z-curve are fed into DWT, SVD, &amp; DFT processors, respectively. In the approach with DWT, the second-generation wavelet transform employs two best wavelet bases Daubechies (Db) and Biorthogonal (Bior) based on the validation of the HCoV dataset for the feature extraction of the CoV-Variants dataset. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, and ensemble, are used to classify the virus strains and evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm. Finally, hyper-parametric tuning is done utilizing the Bayesian optimization technique to select the best fit model for KNN and SVM. The proposed algorithm has successfully classified the CoV-Variants dataset with an average accuracy of 98.76% utilizing the DWT, DFT, and SVD, while the best-achieved accuracy for this dataset is 98.9% using the DWT technique employing purine–pyrimidine mapping. The best-achieved accuracy rate for predicting Omicron is 99.8% using SVD-based technique. The best-obtained accuracy for HCoV dataset is 100% resulted in all three methods.},

  abstract     = {Sports effect evaluation is the main module of modern information construction. To improve the accuracy of sports effect evaluation and enhance the training level of athletes, this paper aims to conduct in-depth research on sports effect evaluation based on feature selection under the background of big data. Firstly, a sports evaluation system is designed based on the Window Presentation Foundation (WPF) that adopts a Client–Server (C/S) mode. The overall architecture of the system is proposed by expounding the functional modules and the schema of information tables in the database. To assess the impact of sports, the data mining algorithm and big data analytics technique called Random Forest (RF) is used as the core evaluation system. With the help of information gain, feature selection is performed, based on which decision trees are constructed by generating branch nodes. The random forest is created by combining all the decision trees, which helps in improving the generalization. The proposed method is experimentally verified and it is found that the overall stability of the effect evaluation system is good and it effectively improves the efficiency and accuracy of sports effect evaluation, thus enhancing the level of athletes&#39; training. The proposed sports effect evaluation method performs excellently in the experimental validation, as seen by the remarkable F1 Score of 85.32%, average accuracy of 84.28%, precision of 86%, and recall of 82.28%. In comparison, this performs noticeably better than current approaches, proving its improved efficacy in assessing the effects of sports and confirming its ability to improve athlete training proficiency.},

Some mathematical properties of the TRTL distribution are discussed namely, density shapes, moments, variance, the coefficient of skewness, coefficient of kurtosis, and moment generating function. We use the maximum likelihood method for point and interval estimation. The asymptotic confidence intervals based on maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) are derived. A extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to evaluate the performances of the MLEs with respect to mean squared error (MSE) criterion. Finally, three COVID-19 patient data examples are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the introduced model in modelling real-life data. According to the results of real-world data examples, we observe the best-fitted model is the TRTL among the competitor models.},

  abstract     = {Generally, the transportation of cargo plays a vital role in effective supply chain management. For the safe transportation of the goods, the Returnable Containers (RCs) are provided by the container management organization to the consignee as rental basis. Unfortunately, some of the RCs are returned as delay in time for some situations. This study explores a situation of container management organization that unexpected delay of empty containers and then suggests a restoring strategy for shortfall units. As a strategy of restoring the shortfall units, this research considers the leasing option instead of buying the new RCs. This paper examines the container inventory model with the consideration of the delayed return of containers under the fuzzy arena. Because the container&#39;s return rate is unpredictable and uncertain, the container inventory model is formulating under fuzzy environment. This research describes a container inventory model with price-sensitive demand. In this model, the container return rate as well as the proportion of repairable from received RCs as Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs). The optimal duration of inspection of the container and the optimal duration of the lease of an RC are obtained. The expected total cost using the fuzzy return rate and the fuzzy proportion of repairable RCs is computed. The container inventory model under fuzzy arena is proposed to attain the approximate outcome for the unpredictable and uncertain parameters. The impact of the fuzzy proportion of retuned RCs, fuzzy reparable from received RCs, and the changes in some parameters on optimal solutions are performed in the sensitivity analysis.},

Moreover, slip effect is also entertained. The considered system is simplified by approximating with long wavelengths and very low Reynolds numbers. Perturbation technique is chosen to obtain the closed form analytical solutions. The impact of influential parameters is presented through plots and physically discussed in detail. The main conclusions of this work are that the velocity and temperature fields exhibit opposite behavior for the Hartman number and Hall parameter. The slip parameter has minimizing impact on velocity distribution. The fluid velocity tends to increase when Reiner-Rivlin fluid parameter is incremented. The Darcy number has upgrading impact on fluid temperature. The solute concentration minifies when slip parameter is incremented. It can be visualized that size of trapped bolus becomes larger on increasing the value of Hall and slip parameter.

  abstract     = {Effective management of urban rail transit systems increasingly centers on short-term passenger flow prediction which is a key factor in operational scheduling decisions. The critical need to use existing infrastructure efficiently and avoid potential emergencies due to large crowd gatherings. The advancements in short-term passenger flow forecasting have become essential within the intelligent transportation system domain. Despite its importance, there is a prominent gap in research specifically addressing the prediction of various types of passenger flows in subway systems. To bridge the gap, the paper proposed an innovative integrated method combining CNN-LSTM and SVM with Wavelet Transform harnessing their collective strengths. The approach involves a multi-stage process. Initially, passenger flow data is dissected into high and low-frequency series using wavelet transform. In the prediction phase, CNN-LSTM and SVM techniques are employed to, respectively learn and forecast these high and low-frequency sequence. The final phase involves the reintegration of these various predicted sequences through wavelet transform. The integrated approach aims to provide a more accurate prediction of short-term passenger flows in urban rail transit catering to the specific demands of the complex and dynamic field. The analysis shows that the SVM based Wavelet Transform method outperforms the CNN-LSTM based Wavelet Transform method in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Both approaches achieve better results than classical prediction techniques for passenger flow prediction on evaluation metrics, i.e., MAPE (9.80% and 7.28%), VAPE (0.78% and 3.85%), RMSE (2.48% and 0.76%), MSE (14.86% and 4.65%), R2 (1.57% and 12.57%) and accuracy (85.00% and 90.00%) respectively.},

  abstract     = {In today’s global landscape, efficient logistics management is crucial for fostering sustainable development across industries. Integrating big data analytics into logistics operations has emerged as a transformative approach to boost efficiency, minimize waste, and mitigate environmental impact. This paper aims to explore the significance of utilizing big data analytics to optimize logistics management for sustainable development. The current challenges in logistics management primarily revolve around four key aspects: the efficiency of goods delivery, raw material costs, one-stop solutions, and service evaluation. These challenges persist in traditional logistics management due to their strong independence. Therefore, this paper is devoted to the optimization of logistics flow management through the lens of sustainable development and ecological cycles. Initially, by considering the Sustainable Development logistics management mode and survey data from 302 logistics enterprises, improvements are made in the four aspects. Subsequently, a four-element analysis function is designed, comprising factors for efficiency improvement, cost reduction, comprehensive optimization, and service enhancement. This function, which aims to assess logistics operations thoroughly, is a crucial component of the research. It includes components for enhancing services, cutting costs, improving efficiency, and conducting comprehensive optimization. MATLAB 21.0 b software is utilized for model analysis, primarily focusing on Volar model area analysis. The aim is to identify and categorize new optimization directions for SD logistics management mode based on the collected data and analyzed samples. The effectiveness of the SD logistics management mode is verified by observing model results and trends. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates the relevance of optimizing logistics management mode by significantly improving the efficiency of goods delivery, reducing raw material costs, enhancing one-stop solutions, and evaluating service-sharing information.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new revolution that integrates multiple technologies to improve our lifestyle and healthcare. With the use of this technology, football players may be safeguarded from health issues such as a cardiopulmonary respiratory system that could arise during a game or practice. This paper investigates the effect of inhalable particle pollution on the number of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases during outdoor football games using an advanced IoT-enabled approach. First, this research work investigates the negative impacts of inhalable air particles on the health of IoT-enabled outdoor football players. Second, it designs a sophisticated IoT-based monitoring system for real-time health evaluation, with a particular emphasis on the impact of inhalable particle pollution on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems of the participants. This proposed system is made up of three interconnected layers: the Sensory Layer, which is outfitted with lightweight IoT sensors and meticulously stationed for real-time monitoring of the players&#39; physiological parameters and stadium environmental conditions; the Network Layer, which is in charge of facilitating seamless data flow between the sensors and the Cloud Layer; and the Cloud Layer, which is in charge of secure data storage, intricate analysis, and the extraction of invaluable information. Third, it employs Kriging estimation as a multi-step method that includes variogram modeling to analyze spatial data dependency, providing insights into how data points relate to distance and direction. Kriging calculates the difference between data points and generates spatial concentration maps that illustrate the geographical distributions of particle pollutants. Finally, it employs Linear Regression (LR) analysis to investigate the relationship between inhalable particle pollution and cardiopulmonary respiratory disease in outdoor football players. The data are dimensioned before comparison to produce the correlation coefficient, which reveals the relationship between these variables. The experimental result shows that in the single pollution model of inhalable particulate pollutant PM2.5, the relative risk values of cardiorespiratory diseases in different populations of outdoor football are 1.0022, 1.0019, 1.0024, 1.0025, and 1.0028, respectively. In CO, SO2, NO2, O3, and other multi-pollutant models, the concentration level of inhalable particulate pollutant PM2.5 increased by 10 μg/m3, and the number of visits for cardiorespiratory diseases in the whole population increased by 0.339% (95% CI 0.220–0.458) after the 10th day of outdoor football. In addition, the number of visits for cardiorespiratory diseases in men and women who lagged on the 10th day of outdoor football increased by 0.322% (95% CI 0.198–0.446) and 0.345% (95% CI 0.223–0.467), respectively. The number of visits for cardiorespiratory diseases of the elderly and children who lagged on the 10th day of outdoor football increased by 0.373% (95% CI 0.234–0.512) and 0.364% (95% CI 0.229–0.500), respectively.},

  abstract     = {The industrial internet of things (IIoT) refers to a system of interconnected equipment, sensors, and devices deployed within industrial environments whose primary function is to collect and facilitate the exchange of data. IIoT has gained significant traction in several domains, encompassing remote monitoring, equipment management, and condition tracking. The utilization of IIoT in different environments gives rise to apprehensions regarding the security of data. As a result of this, it is imperative to ensure that rigorous safety measures are in place to safeguard the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transmitted. The utilization of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and quantum key exchange (QKE) in IIoT networks holds promise for achieving robust and predictable security measures. ECC is a widely adopted type of public-key cryptography due to its efficiency and security. It has gained significant popularity in contemporary systems. QKE is an innovative methodology that originates from the fundamental principles of quantum physics. The system has the ability to generate a secret key that is impervious to hacking attempts, as it leverages natural principles instead of conventional mathematical procedures. Due to this characteristic, quantum key distribution (QKD) is widely recognized as one of the most reliable methods for key exchange. The combination has led to the creation of a novel cryptographic model that integrates elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and quantum key exchange (QKE) techniques for the generation and distribution of cryptographic keys. The model leads to an increase in the base probability of the Bennett–Brassard protocol (BB84) from 0.5 to 1. Subsequently, the keys that are produced are employed for the encryption of data through a streamlined and adapted variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), thereby expediting the secure exchange of data while upholding its level of safeguarding.},

This study employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a specific architectural configuration to examine the intricate connections between digital economy indicators and regional economic growth. The MLP comprises an input, two hidden, and an output layer. The complexity of the relationships within the data set drove the decision to include two hidden layers. Multiple hidden layers allow the model to capture intricate patterns and non-linear dependencies, enhancing its capacity to discern the nuanced impact of digital economy indicators on regional economic dynamics. The number of neurons in each layer is tailored to optimize the models. It utilizes specific techniques in data cleaning, including log and Box–Cox transformations, to address skewed distributions and stabilize variance. Data splitting incorporates a systematic approach with continuous validation throughout the analysis, iteratively refining cleaning and pre-processing steps based on gained insights. Through rigorous training, validation, and evaluation processes, the MLP demonstrates robust operations, showcasing competitive metrics, such as an accuracy of 55%, precision of 34%, recall of 68%, and an F1 score of 45%. The anticipated outcome is a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between the digital economy and regional economic dynamics, supported by a comprehensive ROC analysis. This model, with its carefully tuned architecture and specific inclusion of two hidden layers, outperforms three other studies in the same domain, contributing valuable insights to the discourse on the impact of the digital economy on regional growth.},

This research proposes a revolutionary scalable attention mechanism $$({\text{s-AM}})$$ technique. On a collection of 360-degree X-ray images of the lungs, the suggested approach and many other lightweight deep learning methods were trained. Several accuracy criteria were used to analyze and compare these quick techniques. The trained model for the suggested scalable attention mechanism $${\text{s-AM}}$$ technique and it outperformed other methods in terms of IoU is 0.90, Dice is 0.92, HD is 4.9, VOE is 0.19 and RVD is 0.25. This work demonstrates that the lung X-ray image segmentation approach that was suggested only needs a modest amount of memory storage and yet performs comparably.

  abstract     = {Internet of things establishes communication among heterogeneous devices. IoT network is low power and lossy network known as LLN. The components in LLN use low power for its operations. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined routing protocol for standardized LLN, i.e., routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL). One of the major challenges in RPL is efficient conservation of node energy to improve the life of the LLN network. In the RPL network, most of the energy is consumed while regulating and controlling the packets rather than transmission. The algorithm used for regulating and controlling packet in RPL is called trickle timer algorithm. Hence to improve the lifetime of network it is essential to modify the existing trickle timer algorithm. In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm called EE-trickle. The performance of EE-trickle is compared with existing trickle using the simulator Cooja and using open test bed of future Internet of things lab. From the experiments, it is identified that EE-trickle provides better PDR along with less energy consumption than the existing trickle. Hence, the paper helps the future researchers who work on energy consumption in RPL to make use of EE-trickle in their experiment rather than existing trickle.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the focus on modernization and advanced communication technologies has shifted to smart cities, where society and families, particularly, are engaged with various means of entertainment, e.g., cinema. In the context of cinema, movies have a pivotal role, where cultural heritage, along with urban and rural images, have gradually been marginalized from the commercial field to an elite position. The real picture of rural life has been narrowed down to explore the local cultural heritage. In China, rural communities have existed for centuries, where the rural images of farmers depict their standard of living, civilization and the way in which the ecological environment is protected. This paper studies the factors relevant to the transmission of rural images for a better understanding of cultural heritage conducive to rural culture&#39;s inheritance and development. This paper first constructs water yield and soil conservation models for rural eco-environmental protection. Next, the paper analyzes the main factors that influence the communication of rural images in these models, followed by an analysis of the communication mode used by each factor. Moreover, the proposed study disseminates rural images by creating an imaging action framework. Wuzhen, a famous historic town in China, is taken as a case study for this paper. The study analyzed the representation of Wuzhen&#39;s rural pictures over time, with 77% of the content dominated by bridges and rivers. The highest number of shootings, involving 82 households, was recorded in 2018. Therefore, 2019 showed a slight decline in shootings, with 67 households involved, indicating potential fluctuations in interest or external factors affecting video production that year. However, in 2019, bridges and rivers still constituted 75% of the content, underscoring their enduring significance in portraying the rural beauty of Wuzhen. These findings highlight the appeal and importance of these natural features in the region’s visual narrative.},

By operating on language-agnostic, universal graph-like structures easily extractable from source code files (abstract syntax trees), the deep learning agent learns which transformations should be effectively applied to various structures recognized in the source code in order to improve it. By defining a metric which we want to improve and introducing an optimization task—a reinforcement learning setting, an agent learns to automatically apply a chain of transformations to the program, drastically improving it. While similar program improvement processes exist, they exclusively use exhaustive search algorithms to try all the possible code transformations which is a long process susceptible to local optimum issues. Our solution aims to model and embed structural knowledge about the programs being transformed which greatly helps the agent to choose best possible code transformations to apply. Elements of the approach we present in this paper are further applicable not just to automatic software improvement tasks, but also to other code-related tasks.},

These defects lead to considerable power losses, significantly impacting the reliability and performance of the PV system. Several approaches have been implemented, but an accurate solution has not been found. Therefore, an optimal Deep Belief with Buffalo Optimization (DB-BO) algorithm is applied in the grid-connected system for detecting faults and regulating its classes. Moreover, principal component analysis is used to analyze the power loss issues, and linear discriminant analysis is utilized to mitigate the voltage deviation issues. MATLAB or Simulink is used as the implementation process, and simulation outcomes are compared with recent conventional models. It has been revealed that the developed DB-BO algorithm has reduced the power loss to 3.4 mW. Also, total harmonic distortion (THD) is improved compared to the existing security methods. Thus, the efficiency of the model that was built has been proven by getting the best results in accuracy, total harmonic distortion (THD), and power loss. The computation time of the proposed model (0.238 s) is compared with metaheuristic algorithms such as CSE (0.315629 s) and GWA (3.636 s).},

Given the issue of information asymmetry, high financing failure rates, and high market risk in crowdfunding project investment, prompt risk identification and assessment can help to lessen the detrimental impact on backers. Therefore, this study presents a risk assessment approach for the risk assessment of crowdfunding project investment by integrating failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and the fuzzy super-efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM). Firstly, in addition to the existing parameters of severity, occurrence, and detection, two parameters called the probability of losing control, and the expected costs are attached to the FMEA model for the characteristics of crowdfunding projects. Then, considering the vagueness and uncertainty of FMEA team members in their assessments, the fuzzy super-efficiency SBM method is utilized to prioritize risks and identify critical failure modes. Finally, the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a case study, further comparative analysis, and agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis. Consequently, the results of this study provide important references and recommendations for crowdfunding project backers to make rational decisions and optimize resource allocation.},

In PDPSO, the particle is encoded as discrete values, which can be straightforwardly used to represent the product portfolio with discrete attributes. PDPSO adopts a probability-based mechanism to update particles. Specifically, a probability vector is used to decide the probability of three search behaviors, i.e., learning from the personal best position, global best position, or random search. In experiments, the search performance of PDPSO has been compared with that of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm on generated PPP problem cases with different sizes. The results indicate that PDPSO obtains significantly better optimization results than GA and SA in most cases and obtains desirable/near-optimal solutions on various PPP problem cases. A case study of notebook computer portfolio planning is also presented to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PDPSO.},

  abstract     = {A rapid expansion in the world’s population needs an enormous supply of food grains to satisfy agricultural needs. Unfortunately, crop diseases adversely impact food production and disrupt the supply chain. To circumvent the limitations of continuous human monitoring, machine learning techniques can automatically diagnose leaf diseases in their early stages based on image data. In this paper, an Interpretable Leaf Disease Detector (I-LDD) framework for image-based leaf disease detection using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed. The choice of ELM for this work has been motivated by its quicker convergence, good generalization capability, and shorter learning time compared to the standard gradient-based learning algorithms. Experiments have been carried out using a publicly available PlantVillage dataset comprising healthy and diseased leaf images for 32 categories. In the first phase, the leaf images are preprocessed and segmented using the k-means clustering algorithm. In the second phase, textural and frequency-based features are extracted from the segmented images. In the third phase, several machine learning classifiers are trained using tenfold cross-validation. It is observed that I-LDD achieves an accuracy of 0.9322 ± 0.0088 at a 95% confidence level, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, a statistical significance test on the classification performance metrics also revealed the superiority of I-LDD over the state-of-the-art classifiers. Further, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is used to obtain the top 10 superpixels that contributed most to the class predicted by I-LDD.},

In order to solve the problem that the network coupling information and information transfer mechanism in the existing node importance metric affects the accuracy of the metric, we propose a measure of node importance based on multiple feature fusion (MFF). The method uses an improved Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to fuse the centrality, transmissibility, and prestige measurement of nodes and rank the importance of nodes based on the fusion results. The proposed method was first evaluated against similar methods on six real networks in terms of robustness and vulnerability, as well as in terms of SIR propagation characteristics. Then, we simulated the changes in the number of users who believed the rumor after the rumor was propagated in three cases: before the control, after suppress rumors by random nodes, and after suppress rumors by important nodes. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more accurate for node importance measurement and more effective in rumor control.},

Second, we construct a comprehensive indicator system in which basic indicators, technical indicators, overseas return rate indicators, and macroeconomic indicators are considered simultaneously. Third, we use four machine learning models, namely long short-term memory (LSTM), gate recurrent unit (GRU), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), to predict China’s stock market risk. Experimental results show that: (1) Considering the macroeconomic indicators and basic indicators of Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC), ShenZhen Component Index (SZCZ) and Hang Seng Index (HSI) can significantly improve the performance of predicting China’s stock market risk.

The extended mapping (EM) hybrid ARQ (HARQ) protocol has been developed using irregular repetition code with turbo processing. This protocol uses EM and ARQ to improve efficiency, including retransmission for error correction. The existing hybrid ARQ technique uses a horizontal iterative decoding scheme to reduce error. The suggested method employs both serial and parallel iterative decoding schemes for error detection and correction. A bit error rate (BER) analysis evaluates the proposed model, EM-HARQ performance in the additive white Gaussian noise channel. The results show a significant gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the theoretical limit of the irregular repetition coding using MATLAB simulation software. The adoption of EM in the proposed method improves the SNR to a 0.99 dB performance gap difference and 0.3 dB performance gain due to enhanced error detection. Even with low SNR channels, the proposed EM-HARQ system can achieve a low BER and close to the theoretical limit capacity.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is an important component of the machine learning domain, which selects the ideal subset of characteristics relative to the target data by omitting irrelevant data. For a given number of features, there are 2n possible feature subsets, making it challenging to select the optimal set of features from a dataset via conventional feature selection approaches. We opted to investigate glaucoma infection since the number of individuals with this disease is rising quickly around the world. The goal of this study is to use the feature set (features derived from fundus images of benchmark datasets) to classify images into two classes (infected and normal) and to select the fewest features (feature selection) to achieve the best performance on various efficiency measuring metrics. In light of this, the paper implements and recommends a metaheuristics-based technique for feature selection based on emperor penguin optimization, bacterial foraging optimization, and proposes their hybrid algorithm. From the retinal fundus benchmark images, a total of 36 features were extracted. The proposed technique for selecting features minimizes the number of features while improving classification accuracy. Six machine learning classifiers classify on the basis of a smaller subset of features provided by these three optimization techniques. In addition to the execution time, eight statistically based performance metrics are calculated. The hybrid optimization technique combined with random forest achieves the highest accuracy, up to 0.95410. Because the proposed medical decision support system is effective and ensures trustworthy decision-making for glaucoma screening, it might be utilized by medical practitioners as a second opinion tool, as well as assist overworked expert ophthalmologists and prevent individuals from losing their eyesight.},

Considering the existence of different data in the field of various projects, the use of data-driven approaches to evaluate and select projects in previous studies has been neglected. To cover this gap, the purpose of this study is to provide a hybrid data-driven framework for selecting investment projects in the telecommunication industry. To do this, first by reviewing the theoretical literature and surveys of experts, project evaluation criteria through sustainability paradigm as well as strategic issues are identified, and then with the best–worst fuzzy approach (FBWM), the weight of each criterion is determined. According to the FBWM findings, the most important criteria identified include initial capital requirements, initial revenue, number of specialists employed, energy consumption reduction, and market share increase. After identifying the important criteria, using data envelopment analysis (DEA), the performance of each project was determined separately for each year. Then, based on project labels specified by DEA, the efficiency of projects is measured and evaluated with a forward-looking view through machine learning algorithms such as random forest and support vector regressors. Results show that both models can predict the project performance appropriately, while the random forest regressor has the highest evaluation metrics in both train and test sets. So, the managers could use these results for more efficient project selection.},

Subsequently, three individual machine learning models, namely support vector machine regression (SVR), extreme learning machine (ELM), and deep neural network (DNN), are separately employed to predict decomposed sub-series, and then the obtained sub-series predictions of each individual prediction model are aggregated to generate the preliminary stock price predictions. In the second stage, an ELM-based nonlinear ensemble strategy is employed to combine preliminary stock price predictions. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage model, it is compared with a total of fourteen models in terms of accuracy evaluation, improvement percentage comparison, and statistical test.

  abstract     = {“Epilepsy” is a common neurological brain disorder that may affect the human being at any stage of life. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is the most important tool for the early detection of epileptic seizures in several applications of epilepsy diagnosis. Recent research has carried out various possibilities of predicting and analyzing epileptic seizures by using conventional methods which employed EEG signal processing for feature extraction and further classified by either one of deep learning/ machine learning-based methods. So, there is a requirement to find a suitable and more reliable method to detect and classify EEG signals as epileptic and non epileptic. This paper proposes a non-conventional method in which EEG time series signals are transformed into multiple recurrence plots. Transfer learning methods are used to extract features from these recurrence plots and relevant features are selected by using principal component analysis thereby reducing the computational complexity. These features are fed into various machine learning classifiers which include Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian, Random Forest, Bagging, and Support Vector Machine. Among these classifiers, SVM gives the best performance with 98.15% sensitivity, 99.61% precision, and 98.21% accuracy. This proves to be a novel approach as it evaluates the performance of different machine learning classifiers in two ways. First, with the extracted features only and second by using feature selection on extracted features. The outcomes confirm that employing feature selection enhances the performance of each classifier, thereby validating the effectiveness of feature extraction using deep learning. The proposed work has the potential to classify the epileptic and non-epileptic EEG signal more efficiently in terms of tradeoffs between sensitivity and accuracy. This is an added advantage as it uses the non-conventional and hybrid approach to classify the raw EEG signal and thus opening the possibility of intervention required to prevent the possibility of upcoming seizure.},

Next, the weight of each barrier was calculated using the improved fuzzy step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (IMF-SWARA). Then, fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (F-WASPAS) was used to rank solutions to overcome these barriers. The findings may help organizations advise nascent social entrepreneurs about potential obstacles, which may help reduce the number of entrepreneurs abandoning their ideas.

  abstract     = {The parking system is a vital element within intelligent transport systems, playing a pivotal role in alleviating traffic congestion and mitigating associated stress and anxiety. In response to evolving operational requirements, specialized parking systems such as autonomous valet parking (AVP) and smart parking systems (SPS) are employed based on the specific characteristics of vehicles. This research endeavor begins by introducing a loosely connected middleware designed to accommodate a variety of vehicles within a unified parking area. While the automatic parking system is designed for automated vehicles, and the manual parking system caters to manually operated vehicles, both systems lack the ability to effectively manage both automatic and manual vehicles. To address this challenge, a middleware solution is introduced, which acts as an intermediary layer between vehicles and the parking system. This middleware consists of various modules, enabling the seamless entry of all vehicle types into parking areas, regardless of classification or mode of operation. Second, it uses the Markov Chain model to determine the enhancement in the usability of the parking system after the incorporation of the middleware. Lastly, the suggested loosely coupled middleware approach is compared with tightly coupled smart parking approaches like automatic and manual systems. The matrices of assessment evaluated showed that the recommended scheme outperform its predecessors. In addition, it demonstrated remarkable achievement in terms of cost function, space availability (70%), and traffic jam reduction (56%). The advocated middleware, apart from keeping smooth traffic flow, assists in fulfilling the dire need for parking areas.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid development of the economy, increasing level of urbanization, and industrialization, air pollution has transformed from the traditional coal-fired type to the composite pollution of coal-fired type and motor vehicle exhaust. With this transformation, the excessive release of many gases results in drastic climatic changes, global warming, ozone layer depletion, and more, which dramatically affect human lives in many sectors including sports. Based on the above, this research employs the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to study and predict the effect of atmospheric pollution on the health of soccer players. First, the paper evaluates the impact of air pollution on the physical health of soccer players. It starts with a rigorous evaluation of the influence of various atmospheric pollutants on the health of athletes. Second, it investigates data analysis using numerous tests, including the Augmented Dickey–Fuller test, to evaluate the stationarity of the data and choose the most suitable models for further examination. Third, the research explores the complex correlations between meteorological factors and atmospheric pollutants by considering the dynamic interplay of environmental variables on health results. This analysis offers a nuanced understanding of how meteorological conditions affect pollutant concentrations and their potential health implications. Finally, the research constructs a prediction model that incorporates these complicated associations by employing GAMs with cubic spline functions to capture the non-linear interactions among multiple factors influencing soccer players&#39; health. This advanced modeling technique offers a full examination of air pollution&#39;s complex effects, opening the way for useful findings in the disciplines of public health, environmental management, and sports medicine. The experimental results show that the proposed GAM outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy (85%), precision (88%), F1-Score (87%), consistency (90%), recall (86%), specificity (91%), and sensitivity (82%). These remarkable achievements highlight the importance of the proposed GAM in predicting the effect of air pollution on soccer players&#39; health.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, developments in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence have created new opportunities for studying sports performance. With advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to use massive volumes of video data to get deeper insights into sports dynamics, especially in precision-based video sports like table tennis. To develop skills, a thorough examination of player movements is required. With the development of vision-based human posture recognition, computers can function like humans and derive intelligent judgments from outside data. This paper presents a novel method that uses graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) to detect and identify improper postures and movements in table tennis players. In addition to conventional methods, the proposed method dissects the human skeleton into finely detailed head, trunk, and leg features. Deep-level features that offer a more comprehensive understanding of athlete movements are extracted after feeding these features into the network. The softmax classifier combines these features to produce the final recognition result. The effectiveness of this approach has been evaluated through extensive experimentation. The GCN model performs remarkably well, with accuracy rates of 86.4% on the NTU-RGB + D dataset and 79.1% on the COCO dataset. This accomplishment is significant because the model consistently yields accurate detection results, even in complex and occlusion-filled scenes. In comparison tests, the proposed model performs better than GraphSAGE, GAT, ChebNet, GIN, and GC-LSTM in identifying relevant body part movements in table tennis players while ignoring irrelevant ones. According to proposed experiments, this enhances the recognition of improper postures in most table tennis actions.},

  abstract     = {Martial arts involve highly complex motions with intricate poses and maneuvers. Current video analysis methods face challenges in robustly scaling across diverse data while accurately modeling the nuances of techniques and forms. This research develops a deep learning framework integrating convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) on Apache Spark to model martial arts poses and motions. The CNN extracts hierarchical visual features, highlighting athletes and movements in multimedia data. The GRU layers leverage temporal dynamics by processing pose sequences and actions via gating mechanisms. The GRU maintains an internal state, updating it based on current inputs and previous states. Its gates selectively retain context enabling the GRU to summarize variable-length time series into fixed pose encodings. The framework concatenates CNN visual features and GRU sequential states to provide interpretable pose representations. This granular encoding captures subtle posture details for fine-grained technique analysis. Comparative experiments validate the approach through accurate classification on UCF101 and precise pose estimation on the MADS dataset. The Spark integration enables scalable distributed training on these datasets. Specifically, the approach achieves 94% validation accuracy on martial arts action recognition. It also demonstrates robust performance with low MSE of 2.48 and MAE of 1.89 for pose estimation. The validated framework powers applications such as augmented coaching, optimized training regimes, progress tracking, and skill assessment to enhance martial arts mastery. Overall, the research pioneers an interpretable deep learning solution tailored for fine-grained martial arts training through scalable spatio-temporal modeling of complex motions.},

  abstract     = {A significant challenge in viral marketing is the efficient identification of a group of influential users within a given network, maximizing the spread of influence, known as influence maximization (IM). Numerous strategies have been put forth to gauge users’ influence and pinpoint influential user sets within social networks. These include greedy, heuristic, etc. However, using greedy algorithms to solve the IM problem is not ideal, as they are time-consuming and lack of scalability when dealing with large-scale networks. While heuristic-based approaches offer practical efficiency, they lack theoretical guarantees. To address these challenges, this work uses approach called metaheuristic–Golden ratio optimization method (GROM-IM) for optimizing the IM problem. In addition, our methodology incorporates the expected diffusion value function, which provides a reliable estimate of expected influence spread under both linear threshold and independent cascade models. This method selects the most effective nodes. The outcomes from experiments conducted on five actual social networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the base algorithm in terms of both efficiency and the extent of influence spread.},

To tackle this issue, the present study deals with developing a new fuzzy decision-making mechanism for dynamic adjusting the trade-off between the exploration and exploitation search behaviors of the Jaya method. The new algorithm is named Fuzzy Reinforced Jaya (FRJ) method. The search capability of the FRJ is evaluated in solving a suite of unconstrained mathematical benchmarks and constrained mechanical and structural optimization problems with buckling and natural frequency constraints. Also, the relevant decision variables are selected from both continuous and discrete domains. To provide a deeper insight into the effect of the defined auxiliary fuzzy module, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated and discussed using normalized diversity concept and behavioral diagrams. Also, employing different statistical analyses (e.g., Q–Q diagrams, Wilcoxson and Friedman tests), the significance of the outcomes is evaluated. Also, the numeric achievements are compared with six other well-stablished techniques.

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) technology exhibits significant potential as a form of energy due to its green characteristics. Nevertheless, the modeling of PV modules is subject to unpredictability due to the fluctuating levels of heat and irradiance. To optimize efficiency and reduce the return on investment of a PV system, it is necessary to keep the PV panels at the highest possible power point (MPP). The application of fuzzy logic control-based intelligent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) approach is found to be more appropriate than traditional techniques in PV systems for addressing the issue of unpredictability. The study presents an investigation of an isolated PV system that utilizes a push–pull converter in conjunction with a fuzzy logic-based MPPT technique. To address the previously mentioned issues, this research proposes the utilization of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that is centered on a modified sparrow search algorithm (MSSA) as a means to enhance the performance of the current MPPT controllers. The findings demonstrated the efficacy of the recommended approach in precisely following the global maximum power point (GMPP) with improved convergence rates and reduced power fluctuations when compared to alternative methods. The PV system, which incorporates the MSSA-MPPT algorithm, has been developed with MATLAB/SIMULINK program. The mathematical evaluation of the proposed approach, which increases the tracking effectiveness of PV systems to 99.7%, is well validated by the system findings. In instances where the solar array fails to generate sufficient energy to satisfy the required demand, the Battery Energy Storage (BES) system is activated to ensure continuous power within the test system.},

  abstract     = {Natural disasters lead to massive human and financial losses yearly; thus, disaster planning is of critical importance. One of the most crucial measures for disaster planning is developing an efficient disaster relief supply chain (DRSC) network. Thus, many researchers have focused on this field while overlooking some crucial actual conditions as a result of the complexity of the problem. Consequently, this study develops a DRSC network considering the perishability of relief commodities (RCs), the gradual injection of the limited pre-disaster budgets, pre-disaster lateral transportation, and the time value of money. In this respect, a novel multi-period multi-commodity mixed-integer non-linear programming model is presented, which optimizes pre-disaster warehouse location and inventory management and the post-disaster re-procurement and distribution of RCs in each period. Utilizing a new service utility index, the proposed model strives to minimize deprivation cost while maximizing demand coverage and fair service. To provide the required RCs in the pre-disaster phase, a bidirectional quantity flexibility contract (BQFC) is proposed, which is integrated with multi-sourcing and allows for two-part buybacks, installment and delayed payments, and quantity-based discounts on its terms. The applicability and performance of the model are validated via a real case study in Mashhad, Iran. Various sensitivity analyses are provided to highlight the desirable performance of the model and achieve helpful managerial insights.},

In the first circumstance, the project deadline can be postponed by paying a penalty; while the deadline cannot be deferred in the second one. The random key (RK) and the subcontractor list representation schemes are employed as encoding procedures, and the serial schedule generation scheme (SSGS) is utilized as a decoding scheme. Comparing the results of applying the presented ICA in a case study with the results obtained using an exact method and genetic algorithm (GA) validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to solve SSP in multiple project environments.

The recommended adaptive two-level controller has all the welfare of fuzzy logic system (FLC) and PID control. Zieglere–Nichols technique is used to fine-tune the initial PID’s gains. The PID’s gains are updated with FGS-PID in transient and steady-state conditions to cope with fluctuations, minimize settling time and ensure stability. FLC is used for gain factors to deal with tuning of conditioned input signals of the FGS-PID. Moreover, FLC and an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) are applied to tune the member functions (MFs) of FGS. The use of this algorithm can lead to automatic regulation of the triangular MFs. Simulations are done to confirm the edge of this approach over conventional methods. It is very fast and accurate in tracking the maximum power. It provides minimum oscillations and improved dynamic response than other approaches.

  abstract     = {A combined electric vehicles (EVs) and controllable loads scheduling framework is presented in this paper for a microgrid aimed at minimizing the operating cost and emissions. The microgrid is equipped with renewable power generation by using wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In this respect, EVs would be used for load profile flattening and controllable loads would be used to address the reserve requirements of the system mainly due to intermittent renewable power generation. The problem is formulated as a two-stage scheduling program to specify the expected operating cost and reserve. The first stage aims to minimize the total costs including the generation and reserve costs. The second stage seeks to minimize the redispatch costs due to volatile renewable power generation. The resulting optimization problem is then solved by using the modified manta ray foraging optimization algorithm known as &quot;MMRFO&quot;. This algorithm is an efficacious one being capable of handling various types of optimization problems. The findings obtained from a 24-h analysis of an MG model demonstrate the superior performance of the MMRFO algorithm when compared to other established methodologies. The obtained results by applying the MMRFO method indicate high efficiency of this algorithm in comparison with some other well-known algorithms when tackling the combined EV and controllable loads scheduling problem in the presence of wind and solar power generation.},

  abstract     = {In this research, the problem of optimal conjunctive operation of surface and groundwater systems is investigated by proposing a cyclic storage approach. This problem is solved here using mathematical programming and some efficient Meta heuristic algorithms. For this purpose, the mathematical model of this system is defined and first solved by the nonlinear programming (NLP) method. In addition, the performance of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are also studied to solve this problem. Here, two case studies, meaning a hypothetical benchmark system and conjunctive use of Buchan dam reservoir and Miandoab aquifer located in the catchment area of Urmia Lake (ZarrinehRoud catchment area) as a real problem, are considered to study the performance of proposed methods. In other words, for the hypothetical benchmark system, the results show that the optimal operating cost and related computational time are equal to 5.2428 Billion Rials and 5400 s, respectively, obtained by using the NLP method. In addition, in comparison with the result of the NLP method, the operation costs increased by 26.36%, 26.1%, 44.91% and, 21.28% using ABC, GA, GSA and, PSO algorithms, respectively. However, the computational time is extremely decreased in comparison with the related value of the NLP method using these algorithms for a particular case. In other words, for the real benchmark system, the results show that the optimal operating cost and related computational time are equal to 139.0145 Billion Rials and 259,200 s, respectively, obtained by using the NLP method. In addition, in comparison with the result of the NLP method, the operation costs increased by 43.74%, 32.32%, and 50.57% using ABC, GA and, PSO algorithms, respectively. However, by using this algorithm, the computational time is extremely decreased in comparison with the related value of the NLP method for a particular case. Furthermore, in both case studies, the water demands are fully stratified using the proposed methods. Therefore, the obtained results show the efficiency and effectivity of the proposed methods to solve this complex optimization problem considering a cyclic storage approach.},

  abstract     = {The exponential growth of urban data presents significant challenges in efficiently analyzing and gaining actionable insights for urban planning and design. This paper proposes a big data analytics framework using MapReduce-based parallel FP-growth (MP-PFP) algorithm leveraging tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, and distributed crawlers to uncover patterns and trends from large-scale, heterogeneous urban datasets. A key contribution is the integration of diverse data types, from socio-economic datasets to environmental parameters, into a consistent analysis framework. The methodology employs frequent pattern mining algorithms on a scalable analytics platform to process behavior data and derive planning directives. Additionally, data visualization and parametric analysis techniques transform raw statistics into interactive 3D landscape representations that expose environmental site attributes. Specifically, the MapReduce capabilities enable distributed parallel processing of vast urban data volumes, ensuring speed and efficiency. The data visualization module creates immersive VR representations of urban landscapes, allowing interactive modifications. Advanced simulation techniques are incorporated to model the impact of planning directives on multiple landscape attributes. The framework is designed as a scalable, customizable solution that can integrate diverse urban data sources with customizable analytics, modeling and visualization modules through APIs. Comparative evaluations demonstrate a classification accuracy improvement from 68 to 93% over prevailing approaches. The framework has proven superior in data integration, real-time responsiveness, and accurately modeling the dynamic complexities of urban landscapes. The quantifiable simulations empower designers to make more informed planning decisions aligned with community needs. Despite ongoing data accuracy and privacy concerns, the methodology shows promising capabilities in harnessing urban big data to drive intelligent, sustainable urban development through its integration of data-driven insights, computational analysis, and interactive visualization. It brings impactful innovations to the future of urban informatics and planning.},

Differently from existing work on the topic, this paper explores the effect of training-time randomness of deep neural networks, which is overlooked by the related literature. Training-time randomness is regulated by the seed of the pseudorandom number generator, and affects the performance of IDS models. The seed selection is studied in conjunction with other critical learning parameters: to the best of our knowledge, there are no similar studies in IDS. The experiments are done with a recent and widely consolidated intrusion detection benchmark, which is used to train and test a neural network under different combinations of seeds and parameters both in supervised and semi-supervised learning modes. The results are inferred by a mixture of explorative analysis, design of experiments, and analysis of variance. According to the results, the choice of the seed yields either excellent or scarce detection metrics; more importantly, the seed selection might be as relevant as the other major learning parameters assessed.},

  abstract     = {Brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) have complex intrinsic structures with abundant edges, corners, and fine details. Besides these structural complexities, noise and intensity inhomogeneity in the MR images affect the segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called kernelized-bias-corrected fuzzy C-means approach using local Zernike moments (LZMs)-based unbiased nonlocal filtering (KBCFCM-LZM) to improve the segmentation performance of brain MR images. The approach works in two phases. In the first phase, we apply LZM-based unbiased nonlocal means filtering on the MR images that provides better pattern-matching capability under various geometric and photometric distortions in the images to remove the effect of Rician noise. In the second phase, the bias field correction process reduces the impact of intensity inhomogeneity, and the segmentation process is performed simultaneously. Further, the segmentation process in the proposed method is carried out in kernel space, which efficiently deals with the problem due to data outliers and provides faster convergence. Thus, the proposed method provides a framework that effectively yields high segmentation accuracy even under high noise and intensity inhomogeneity levels. A comprehensive comparative performance analysis is provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art kernel approaches.},

  abstract     = {As an important extension of the rough set theory, interval-set rough sets provide an effective method to solve the problem that the objective sets cannot be accurately expressed in the rough approximation process and to induce classification rules from incomplete information systems. In practical information systems, the value of an object’s decision attribute may be set-valued due to missing decision information or multiple decision values. However, this situation is not considered by any of the existing rough set models. Therefore, to properly deal with the information system where decision attributes are set-valued, we construct the interval-set rough set model on the information system and study attribute reductions of interval-set rough sets. First, we define the information system where decision attributes are set-valued as an extended set-valued decision information system (ESVDIS) and construct the interval-set rough set model on the ESVDIS. Second, the accuracy and the roughness are extended to the interval-set approximation accuracy and the interval-set approximation roughness, respectively. The two extended measures can be used to measure the uncertainty caused by rough approximations. In addition, the dependency degree of interval-set rough sets called the interval-set dependency degree is defined to estimate the significance of attribute subsets. By adopting the interval-set dependency degree, we propose the definition of attribute reduction based on interval-set rough sets and design a heuristic attribute reduction algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed attribute reduction algorithm is demonstrated using 12 public data sets. Experimental results show that the model is applicable to some fields, such as missing decision information and group decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is the most common disease and is a major cause for blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. Thus, early prediction of diabetes is very crucial to initiating proper treatment to avoid further serious complications of the disease. The performance of recent diabetes detection schemes based on clinical data is highly influenced by low feature distinctiveness and unwanted features such as dermatologic manifestations. Different machine learning classifiers need tedious hyper-parameter tuning, which fails to assure a better diabetes detection rate. This article presents an analytical model to detect diabetes based on an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) using decision level fusion to improve the diabetes detection rate. The hyper-parameters SVM, KNN, and RF are optimized using a multi-objective function-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, which considers various clinical entities for the diabetes detection, such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), glucose, insulin, number of pregnancies, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function. The extensive experiments on the Indian Pima diabetes dataset confirmed that the diabetes detection using hybrid classifiers can provide a better prediction rate (94.27%) compared with single classifiers and the previous state of arts.},

Once exposed or illegally used, the security context can be exploited to derive various keys for authentication and encryption. Despite its importance, challenges and questions still remain in the previous relevant research. To fill this gap, by adopting the security protocol verification tool ProVerif, we provide a comprehensive formal model of the fast authentication procedure based on the security context to analyze whether security goals can be met. Unfortunately, we uncover two vulnerabilities, including one never reported before. Our analysis shows that these vulnerabilities stem from fundamental design flaws in the cellular network protocol and thus apply to the 4G network. These vulnerabilities could be exploited to launch several attacks, including impersonation and eavesdropping. We have validated these attacks using 5 mobile phones from 5 different baseband manufacturers through experimentation in three mobile carriers. We find an insecure implementation of one of these phones, which exposed it to replay attacks. And we further discuss the security threats posed by the impersonation attack, such as location spoofing and one-tap authentication bypass, which is verified on 10 popular apps. We finally propose several countermeasures to eliminate these security issues. Actually, we have reported the novel vulnerability to the GSM Association and received a confirmation in the form of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) number CVD-2022-0057.},

  abstract     = {Cotton is a crucial crop that has a significant impact on the global economy, and the timing of the harvest is crucial for maximizing the yield and quality of cotton fiber. However, predicting and detecting the harvesting stage of cotton plants is a complex task that requires analyzing various factors such as plant growth, leaf senescence, and boll maturity. Traditional methods for harvesting prediction are labor intensive and time consuming, making it essential to develop efficient and accurate methods. In this paper, we present a novel deep adversarial network (DAN) called CropCycleNet, which combines the features of both convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks. The proposed DAN can identify different stages of cotton plant growth, detect diseases, and affect plants to ensure proper removal. We propose Histogram base Gradients Feature Orientation Transform method influences feature descriptors and allows feature-level fusion to improve object recognition accuracy. Experimental validation of CropCycleNet was performed to evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 performance metrics at various stages of cotton plant growth. The proposed DAN identified the harvesting stage in cotton fields with 93.27% prediction accuracy, outperforming other existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) play a pivotal role in monitoring body movements and collecting crucial health metrics such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, and physiological conditions. These health parameters are acquired through sensor clusters strategically deployed on the human body and subsequently transmitted to fog or cloud layers for essential decision-making processes. This research study commences by enhancing energy efficiency within WBANs through the introduction of an innovative weight-based algorithm known as the weight-based next neighbor selection algorithm (WBNN). WBNN assigns specific weights to each route connecting pairs of sensors by considering the distance between them. A small weight implies a small distance, while a high value of weight implies a high distance. The total weight of each route is then computed. During the forwarding mechanism, sensor nodes opt for routes with the smallest weight, signifying reduced energy consumption. Secondly, it provides insights into various clustering schemes and routing algorithms employed for data exchange among different sensors and network layers. Lastly, the suggested algorithm is compared with the latest routing algorithms on the basis of four parameters, i.e., network utilization, number of dead nodes, throughput and energy consumption. The results show that the described protocol surpasses traditional routing protocols by achieving superior outcomes, including a 6% reduction in energy consumption, a 72% increase in throughput, and a 68% decrease in number of dead nodes. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed protocol to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of WBANs in the domain of smart healthcare applications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made remarkable strides in the music industry, profoundly impacting various aspects of our lives. This progress has extended to revolutionizing industries, streamlining processes, and enhancing personalization in music. AI&#39;s expanding capabilities have driven computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning breakthroughs. As music enthusiasts increasingly turn to online platforms, the need for effective recommendation systems has become more pressing. The exponential growth of musical content poses a challenge in discovering music tailored to individual tastes. This paper proposed a personalized music recommendation system powered by deep learning, explicitly utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address the challenges posed by expanding music libraries and diverse song resources. In today’s era of ever-growing music databases and increasing content diversity, more than traditional retrieval methods are needed to efficiently connect users with their preferred track. Traditional music platforms rely solely on retrieval mechanisms, necessitating manual inputs such as artist names and titles to locate specific songs. However, this approach needs in-depth music data analysis and delivers personalized recommendations generated by various deep learning-based algorithms. This paper bridges this gap by harnessing deep learning algorithms for comprehensive music data analysis and personalized song suggestions. The proposed CNN-based recommendation system explores the domains of deep learning and content-based approaches, empowering users to discover their favorite tunes swiftly. This innovative mechanism leverages CNNs and deep learning algorithms to offer efficient, personalized, and data-driven music recommendations, transforming the user experience with their music collections. In experimental results, the proposed CNN model is compared with various deep learning algorithms, including DNN, RNN, and LSTM, as well as traditional algorithms like SVM, KNN, RF, and DT. Impressively, the CNN model achieved the highest accuracy at 95%, surpassing all other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) have various applications in different sectors of life, such as healthcare, agriculture, industries, transportation, smart cities, smart homes, etc., and their number is increasing with each passing day. The rapid development of IoT and its increasing demand in different fields of life create a serious problem of security for the IoT environment, which needs serious consideration to protect the IoT-enabled systems from external networks and cyber-attacks. Because of the open deployment environment and constrained resources, the IoT is prone to malicious assaults. Furthermore, the IoT’s diverse and dispersed properties make it difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to keep up with current technological developments. An ML-enabled IoT-based IDS is one of the most important security methods that can assist in defending computer networks and the IoT environment from numerous attacks and malicious activities. Keeping in mind the significant contribution of ML to securing the IoT environment, we proposed an ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT networks and applications in this study. In the proposed system, we proposed a modified Random Forest (RF) algorithm and compared its performance with nine well-known ML algorithms for the detection of network attacks. Further, two of the most recent and well-known network datasets, i.e., TON-IoT and UNSW-NB15, are used to check the effectiveness of the ML-enabled IDS. The performance of the utilized ML algorithms was measured with the help of different performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, etc. The experimental outcomes illustrate the importance of the proposed ML-enabled IDS for securing the IoT environment and applications. The proposed system applies to almost all of the resource-constrained devices that use the IoT network.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted international trade, benefiting national and international economies. It has increased trade and financial liberalization in many countries. Ecological and environmental protection have become critical issues due to the fast mobility of money and commodities. The purpose of this paper is to find a way to balance foreign trade growth with environmental protection. We aim to achieve this by using IoT to establish a co-integration model that takes into account the comprehensive environmental index, imports and exports, and the capital-labor ratio. We have collected data from Quanzhou City between 2011 and 2019, based on various environmental pollution indicators, import and export trade volume, capital-labor ratio, and other factors. Our analysis includes an examination of the empirical model of foreign trade and the ecological environment, as well as the impulse response. Additionally, we used prediction variance decomposition and the Granger causality test to understand the coordinated relationship between foreign trade and the ecological environment. Our results demonstrate that when the volume of exports (EX) increases by 1 percent, the ecological environment in Quanzhou City is negatively impacted by about 0.06%. On the other hand, when the volume of imports (IM) increases by 1 percent, there is a 0.26% positive effect on the ecological environment of the city. Finally, when the capital-to-labor ratio (K) increases by 1 percent, there is a 0.40% deterioration of the city&#39;s ecological environment.},

The emergence of these technologies and fast internet connectivity has led to the growing popularity of distance learning in academic circles and society. The goal of this paper is to improve online music learning through the use of cloud computing and fuzzy clustering. A significant amount of data regarding students and their activities is collected. Following data cleaning and organization, students are grouped according to their preferred style of music learning using a technique called fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering. Each group is then given a customized learning plan that matches them with appropriate music resources. To put this into practice, a simple online music learning platform is created, enabling teachers and students to sign in, give instructions, view results, and log out with ease. To ensure that our approach remains effective even under high user loads, we designed the system to function properly for up to 400 concurrent users. An educational resource database is used to find the best learning materials for students, and FCM helps them pick the right resources. To make everything more organized, a resource library is designed using a simple language called XML. This library has different categories for learning materials and follows international standards to make sure everything works together smoothly. The performance of the system is measured in terms of scalability (8/10 response time, 7/10 throughput, 9/10 resource utilization), usability (8/10 user satisfaction, 7/10 task completion time, 6/10 error rate), effectiveness (9/10 learning outcomes, 8/10 student engagement, 9/10 retention rates). It has a 99% uptime and no security incidents have been reported. This study shows that our method can improve online music education, making it more personalized and effective for each student. The steps we followed, like using the FCM clustering method and creating a user-friendly system, can be applied to other areas of online learning to make them better too.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in technology have led to a significant growth of agricultural data. The potential for forecasting crop yield depends on parameters such as climate, soil characteristics, and water factors has emerged as significant research area. Combining a comprehensive dataset from diverse sources like climate, soil and water parameters for precise time series forecasting in agricultural yield prediction is a significant challenge. Therefore, there is a need to integrate this data with agricultural processes to enhance crop production. In this paper, propose Genetic Algorithm based Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Reinforced Random Forest Algorithm forecasting models for enhancing crop yield prediction. The genetic algorithm emulates the evolutionary process, simulating the selection of the strongest individuals over weaker ones through mechanisms such as selection, crossover, and mutation. The new approach incorporates reinforcement learning during the selection of attributes for tree construction by optimizing sample usage. By assessing variable significance, it identifies the most significant variables for node splitting improving model development and maximizing training data utilization. In addition to internal cross-validation, the method minimizes parameter tuning, mitigates overfitting, accelerates computations, and enhances transparency. The proposed model Genetic Algorithm based ARIMA achieves better results for enhancing crop yield forecasting on evaluation metrics, i.e., MAE (0.80%), RMSE (3.75%), RRSE (1.21%), RAE (0.82%), MSE (0.07%), R2 (0.54%) and accuracy (80.00%). For Reinforced Random Forest Algorithm model, i.e. MAE (1.28%), RMSE (2.48%), RRSE (0.54%), RAE (0.91%), MSE (0.55%), R2 (0.98%) and accuracy (78.00%). The analysis reveals that the genetic algorithm based ARIMA model outperforms the reinforced random forest algorithm in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Both proposed models better perform than machine learning classical models excelling not only in enhanced crop yield forecasting but also in terms of computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of digital music distribution has led to the emergence of new challenges in protecting the rights of musicians and copyright holders. This research paper presents a novel approach to designing a music copyright management system based on deep belief networks (DBNs) and blockchain technology. The integration of these two technologies provides a robust solution for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of copyrighted music content in the digital world. DBNs are utilized to extract meaningful features from music data and accurately classify it, enabling the identification and tracking of copyrighted content. The ability of DBNs to learn complex patterns and representations enhances the system&#39;s capability to detect unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted music. Blockchain technology is employed to provide a decentralized and secure platform for recording and managing copyright-related transactions. Cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures are utilized to ensure data integrity and authenticity. The immutable and tamper-proof nature of the blockchain establishes a reliable and verifiable record of ownership and licensing for copyrighted music. The storage efficiency of our system is optimized through the use of lightweight verifier and Merkle proofs. By storing only block headers and utilizing Merkle proofs for verification, the system minimizes storage overhead while maintaining the ability to validate the integrity of transactions. This optimization contributes to the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the system. Through this research, a comprehensive music copyright management system is introduced, offering a secure framework for detecting and preventing copyright infringement. The integration of DBNs and blockchain technology provides a robust solution for securing the rights of musicians and ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the digital music landscape.},

  abstract     = {The ability to identify human actions in uncontrolled environments is essential for human–computer interaction, especially in sports, to provide athletes, coaches, and analysts, important information about movement techniques and aid in making well-informed decisions regarding player’s movements. Recognizing player’s actions, particularly in the context of basketball sports remains a challenging task due to issues like complex backgrounds, obstructed actions, and inconsistent lighting conditions. Artificial Intelligence and deep learning has promising applications in basketball movement analysis, as it can help basketball athletes enhance their shooting techniques and accuracy, thereby improving the efficiency of both games and training sessions. However, the traditional deep learning-based feature extraction methods lack robustness due to simple architecture and low efficiency. In this study, a hybrid Yolo-T2FLSTM system is proposed for basketball player’s detection and action recognition. An enhanced Yolo algorithm is employed for detecting players in the frame and the integration of LSTM and fuzzy logic is used to perform the final basketball action classification. The models of VGG 16, VGG 19 and ResNet50 are combined in the backbone of Yolo for multi-feature extraction to establish a multi-feature fusion approach and enhance the performance of basketball player and action recognition. The proposed model is evaluated on different basketball videos and achieved a high recognition rate for player detection and 99.3% accuracy for eight basketball actions. Comparative experiments are carried out under various conditions to validate the robustness of the hybrid Yolo-T2FLSTM model. Results show that the proposed method has a high player detection and action recognition rate as compared to other feature extraction models.},

  abstract     = {Building robust perception systems for autonomous vehicles requires addressing multimodal data fusion and large-scale deep network training challenges. This work puts forth an integrated methodology based on specialized deep learning architectures including Faster R-CNN and DeepLabV3 adapted for autonomous driving tasks. The approach encompasses a robust data curation pipeline handling multimodal data preprocessing, including sensor synchronization for temporal alignment, normalization using standardization techniques, quality enhancement via noise filtering and controlled augmentation via techniques like cropping and brightness variation. For perception, Faster R-CNN leverages a region proposal network to generate candidate object bounding boxes, followed by a classification network using Feature Pyramid Networks for multi-scale object detection and localization. DeepLabV3 adopts atrous convolutions with varying dilation rates and multiple spatial pyramid pooling modules for semantic segmentation and pixel-level scene understanding. Further elements include object tracking using similarity metrics between extracted features, trajectory forecasting based on past motions, sensor fusion mechanisms like early and mid-level fusion to combine complementary modalities, and coordinated training procedures leveraging joint losses tailored for autonomous driving datasets. Extensive comparative benchmarks demonstrate the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with top scores of 94% accuracy, 93% precision and 94% AUC and low error rates such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE on tasks corresponding to object localization, segmentation and scene understanding. Ablation studies provide detailed insights into optimal configurations. The comprehensive methodology unifies deep neural perception pipelines tailored for autonomous driving, serving as a crucial enabler for next-generation intelligent vehicle systems.

  abstract     = {In recent years, transformative technological advances have reshaped countless sectors, including higher education, leaving a lasting and indelible mark. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) coming together has proven to be an influential driving force for the development of creative solutions to the ever-evolving challenges faced by educational institutions. Traditional classroom teaching methods have encountered unprecedented hurdles with the widespread integration of the Internet into education. China’s commitment to “governing the nation by law” has elevated the need for legal expertise. As society evolves, pedagogical approaches must adapt. Information and communication technology trends, combined with the rise of the IoT, are reshaping education and offering tools to bolster campus security, monitor vital assets, and enrich classroom accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-based hybrid model and an IoT-infused teaching approach personalized for legal education in colleges and universities, employing the decision tree algorithm. The study’s focal point is the development of legal professionals possessing the robust capabilities and qualities society seeks, using teaching methods compatible with modern information technology. The foundation of this endeavor lies in the hybrid teaching mode, specifically Internet-based legal research. Within this platform, educators can disseminate instructional materials, videos, and exercises, with the option to enlist teaching assistants to aid in managing student learning. Comparing varied and traditional teaching classes, the passing rates were 96.75% and 95.36%, respectively. Data analysis using decision trees identifies factors influencing these rates. The study also evaluates students&#39; accuracy in five in-class exercises; in the mixed class, correctness rates were 96.4%, 93.5%, 82.5%, 64.2%, and 62.8%. The proposed method is compared with other machine learning algorithms (SVM, KNN, LR, RF) and Decision Trees to evaluate the educational impact of the mixed teaching approach comprehensively.},

  abstract     = {In the age of multimedia networks and advanced educational tools, there is a growing need for innovative and effective educational systems. To engage students more effectively and enhance learning results, traditional physical education programs have seen a need for modernization. This paper investigates the creation of a cutting-edge video resource platform for physical education to address these issues, revolutionizing the educational process by utilizing micro-videos and multimedia technology. To build the foundation of our platform, we make use of multimedia networks and various kinds of micro-videos. The platform combines the power of real-time conversation, animation, and video to create an immersive learning environment. In addition, we use data-driven adaptive teaching methodologies, which assess student performance and change educational material through individual growth. Our approach begins with collecting data and processing signals, with audio signals serving as the primary input for our watermarking method. To determine masking thresholds across important frequency bands, we compute power spectral density (PSD) using the Fast Fourier Transform. Using watermarking to integrate health data, these thresholds, both tonal and non-tonal, ensure imperceptibility and robustness. In turn, physical education is personalized using integrated data. Health information that has been extracted is carefully incorporated into the curriculum, enhancing it and assisting pupils with a range of medical issues. Our study results show that engagement and learning outcomes have significantly improved. For instance, we noticed a considerable improvement in student satisfaction levels, with an average rise of 25%, and an average increase in learning efficiency of 30% for students. These results highlight the potential of our proposed platform to revolutionize physical education.

A comprehensive review of the existing literature on Arabic text classification (ATC) reveals that most research concentrates on methodologies and approaches, with no thorough evaluation of ATC. Consequently, this systematic review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art in ATC, illuminate the present challenges, and discuss prominent trends in large-scale research. From a collection of 2875 studies, 60 were determined to satisfy the eligibility criteria and were rigorously analyzed. The selected studies were divided into three categories: topic areas, tasks/applications, and ATC phases. The topic areas were classified into six primary sectors: healthcare, legal, security and cybersecurity, history, culture and religion, social media, and agriculture. The ATC tasks/applications were classified into nine groups: gender identification, author identification, disease detection, threat and spam detection, dialect identification, hierarchical categorization, news article classification, web page clustering, and question classification. The ATC phases were organized into five categories: corpus creation, preprocessing (stemming and tokenization), feature selection, feature extraction, and classifiers/approaches. The review emphasizes the proposed solutions in each ATC study and offers insights for future research. This review also underscores the potential applications of ATC in addressing current challenges across various industries and highlights the significance of developing a benchmark dataset for ATC to facilitate model comparison. The review concludes by proposing areas where further research is required, such as addressing the unbalanced dataset issue, enhancing the preprocessing phase, and exploring human factors’ role in utilizing ATC systems.},

  abstract     = {Production scheduling is a critical factor to enhancing productivity in manufacturing engineering and combinatorial optimization research. The complexity and dynamic nature of production systems necessitates innovative solutions. The Job Shop Flexible Programming Problem (FJSP) provides a realistic environment for production, where processing times are variable and uncertain, and multiple objectives need optimization. To solve the Multi-Objective Flexible Fuzzy Job Shop problem with partial flexibility (P-MOFfJSP), this paper proposes a hybrid metaheuristic approach that combines the Teaching–Learning-based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm with a Genetic Algorithm. The proposed algorithm of Adaptive TLBO (TLBO-A) uses two genetic operators (mutation and crossover) with an adaptive population reconfiguration strategy, ensuring solution space exploration and preventing premature convergence. We have evaluated the TLBO-A algorithm&#39;s performance on benchmark instances commonly used in programming problems with fuzzy variables. The experimental analysis indicates significant results, demonstrating that the adaptive strategy improves the search for suitable solutions. The proposed algorithm (TLBO-A) exhibits low variations (around 11%) compared to the best mono-objective heuristic for the fuzzy makespan problem, indicating its robustness. Moreover, compared with other heuristics like traditional TLBO, the variations decrease to around 1%. However, TLBO-A stands out as it aims to solve a multi-objective problem, improving the fuzzy makespan, and identifying good results on the Pareto frontier for the fuzzy average flow time, all within this low variation margin. Our contribution addresses the challenges of production scheduling in fuzzy time environments and proposes a practical hybrid metaheuristic approach. The TLBO-A algorithm shows promising results in solving the P-MOFfJSP, highlighting the potential of our proposed methodology for solving real-world production scheduling problems.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world problems, each sample has more than one label, which may also exist semantic correlations among labels. However, in multi-label datasets, there are many irrelevant features that impact the accuracy of multi-label learning. A solution to this problem is feature selection. Although many papers have presented new methods to select features, more effort needs to be put into improving their accuracy. This paper presents a novel feature selection method based on correlation labels using a belief function called FSCLBF. Our proposed method increases the accuracy of multi-label learning by considering the correlation labels and the data uncertainty. The proposed method’s first step is to select the essential features for each label using a belief function based on a rough set theory (B-R belief function). The next step is to identify equivalent labels based on overlapping their essential features. Then, the tag of samples is determined in the set of equivalent labels. In the final step, our proposed method selects the essential features for each equivalent label set, using the B-R belief function by considering the sample differentiation to label. The experimental results show the superiority of FSCLBF to state-of-the-art methods in terms of Hamming Loss, One error, and Accuracy measures.},

A total data set of 138 samples has been collected from various reliable and authentic published experimental researches, out of which 96 samples are used for training and 42 samples for testing using 70:30 split ratio. For each soft computing technique, coefficient of correlation (CC), Wilmott index (WI), mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), scattering index (SI) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were calculated as the statistical indicators for analysing the performance of each soft computing technique. The RF model&#39;s dominance over the other models was confirmed by statistical indicators with values of CC as 0.9141, WI as 0.950, MAE as 1.1028, RMSE as 1.661, NSE as 1.0006, SI as 0.12077 and MAPE as 7.802, while the RT model also has shown competitive prediction ability over the M5P_pruned and M5P_unpruned, REP and MLR models. A sensitivity analysis presented that the bitumen content was the most effective parameter for predicting the Marshall stability using RF-based model. The results of this computational evaluation clearly showed that the applied soft-computing technique was capable of accurately calculating the Marshall stability of the asphalt concrete.},

  abstract     = {The transportation of dangerous aquatic organisms and pathogens in ballast tanks causes problems on a global scale and therefore, The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has put into force the “International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Waters and Sediments”. There are many ballast water treatment systems (BWTS) available in the market. The most important issue in the integration of the systems to the ships is to have technical information about the available options and to determine the most suitable solution for the ship among these alternatives. For this, the interested parties need to make an appropriate choice by knowing the features, advantages, and disadvantages of the BWTSs. The main aim of this article is to assess the five types of BWTS technologies that are frequently used and to make an optimum choice by consulting the opinions of experts in the sector. In this context, this study used the fuzzy ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite’) method and proposed a novel approach for handling BWTS selection based upon interval type-2 fuzzy sets. It has been evaluated that a hybrid system in which filtration + ultrasound + ultraviolet (UV) systems can be used together would be more appropriate.},

Four percentages of basalt fiber (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4%) by volume fraction were added to concrete mix and BFRC cubes of 150 mm size were prepared and tested after 28 days curing age. It was found that the compressive strength of concrete with basalt fibers (1–4 percent) decreased in the range of 9.71–18.62 percent for M25. To predict the compressive strength of BFRC, three soft computing techniques, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Random Tree, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied for Nine inputs, i.e., Cement, Fine Aggregate, Coarse Aggregate, Water, Fly Ash, Superplasticizer, BF, length of Fiber, curing time, and which is Compressive Strength as output.

This research is crucial for energy field researchers who are interested in optimizing energy consumption. The primary objective is to optimally manage load demand, reduce the average peak ratio, lower electricity bills, and enhance user comfort. To accomplish this goal, the load conversion strategy is used to coordinate household appliances and manage the home power system effectively. This approach aims to minimize peak–average ratios and electricity costs while ensuring consumer convenience. To minimize electricity bills, the study schedules the consumer’s daily activities based on actual time and next day’s energy demand. Furthermore, a fitness criterion is used to balance the load between off-peak and on-peak hours. The scheduler is designed to achieve an optimal device on/off state that minimizes device waiting time by coordinating household appliances in real time. To address the background problem of real-time rescheduling, dynamic programming is employed. The study evaluates the modified algorithm’s performance using three pricing strategies: critical peak pricing, real-time pricing, and time of use. The modified IBES technique is utilized to achieve the specified objectives of minimizing the electricity bill, reducing the peak–average ratio, and enhancing user convenience.},

The sanitized teacher learning-based optimization algorithm is utilized for training the feed-forward ANN using the experimental data. Then, the water cycle algorithm is employed to tune the parameters of the FOPID controller. To examine the performance of the proposed technique, two different solar panels are taken for the study under various operating conditions, cloudy conditions, and partial shading conditions. The proposed technique is also tested for different array configurations of the solar panel. It is noticed that the proposed hybrid technique demonstrates better results in terms of various performance indices such as maximum power, efficiency recorded close to 99.99%, relative error recorded to be 0.000549, and minimum tracking speed recorded to be 0.059 s as compared to latest published work in the literature.},

This study presents a novel approach that combines the concepts of Brownfield redevelopment and CNN-based land classification to transform industrial wastelands. The study commences by elaborating on the redevelopment of Industrial wastelands by combining features of Brownfield redevelopment and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) based land classification model. It uses the CNN approach to classify wasteland datasets acquired from Kaggle into three categories: contaminated land, abandoned land, and vacant land. Second, the ResNet architecture within CNN is harnessed for land transformation. The methodology used enhances the process of identification of wastelands and their classification. Finally, it measures the performance of the classification model using CNN by devising a confusion matrix. The CNN-based land classification model of the study is designed to restore urban industrial wastelands and has yielded promising results. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 69% and a precision rate of 51%. Additionally, it demonstrated notable performance in terms of Sensitivity (70%), Specificity (67%), and overall accuracy (59%). These results underscore the potential of this approach in addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with neglected industrial lands by fostering environmental rejuvenation and promoting community well-being.},

  abstract     = {Precise and content-aware style transfer in oil painting remains a significant research focus. This involves preserving the semantic content of the original image while accurately emulating the desired painting style. Developing robust algorithms for accurate recognition and classification of various patterns within oil paintings remains a challenge which identify and categorize styles, textures and visual elements to contribute comprehensive understanding of the artwork. The conventional image style transfer algorithm mainly relies on mathematical modeling to characterize image texture facilitating the combination of a content image with a style image to realize style transfer effects. These algorithms neglect the distribution of image edges leading to blurred contours in the resulting images. To address these limitations, this paper proposed a novel decoration pattern style migration algorithm based on SRCNN (Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) model using UNet-based architecture. The algorithm leverages the Laplace operator for image sharpening by accentuating edge distributions. Downsampling techniques are used to generate low-resolution images mitigating the protracted duration of image style transfer iterations. The incorporation of Gaussian sampling and a parallelization algorithm contributes to the efficacy of this method in facilitating the transfer of oil painting styles. The proposed model achieves better results using Facades data set, i.e., variance (6.35%), standard deviation (8.67%), uncertainty (11.21%), SSIM score (94.45%), PSNR score (40.24%), MSE score (6.21%) and accuracy (95.00%).

The traditional physical education classes offered by universities and colleges no longer meet the needs of modern society in terms of teaching, research, and evaluation. To address this issue, we utilized VR and ML to create a physical learning environment for university and college students. This environment allowed them to practice in a virtual setting while also learning new exercise routines. We established an immersive physical activity setting equipped with Kinect technology and VR-ready computers to create an interactive and engaging VR experience. For this, we proposed a layered architecture that includes a presentation layer, business layer, application service layer, data layer, and hardware layer. The Kinect technology is placed at the hardware layer, the database is designed and placed at the data layer, and the user interface is designed and placed at the presentation layer. The business layer is made up of support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) which accurately classify and evaluate students’ performance in a range of physical activities on the basis of interactive and immersive VR content generated by the hardware layer. Through experimental verification, this study provides a complete framework for modernizing physical education in universities and colleges, exploring the integration of VR and optimization methodologies.

  abstract     = {Designing a Student Management System based on big data and deep learning is paramount in the modern educational landscape. This innovative approach allows institutions to harness the power of vast datasets to gain actionable insights into student performance, preferences, and learning patterns. The research begins by identifying various facets and modules within the student ecosystem that impact student success, including examination results, health records, grades analysis, demographics, co-curricular activities, teacher information, and parental details. The data pertaining to these modules are inherently distributed, and the system organizes it into a unified format using the big data tool Apache Hadoop. The goal is to consolidate the data for utilization by deep learning models in predicting student success. Apache Hadoop, as a robust big data tool, facilitates efficient storage and analysis of large datasets. Subsequently, a Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN) model is developed to extract distinctive patterns indicative of student success. The planned FNN architecture incorporates 128 neurons and employs Rectified Linear Unit (RELU) and SoftMax activation functions to enhance predictive capabilities. The increased number of neurons in the model allows for a comprehensive exploration of all student data sources, thereby improving the true positive rate. Ultimately, the computation of execution and timely interventions by teachers, parents, and administration demonstrates heightened precision resulting from the analysis and rotation creation methods, leading to an efficient student management system. A thorough comparison with earlier approaches underscores its superior effectiveness, with a noteworthy 45% increase in accuracy and a significant 55% enhancement in precision.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of dynamic multi- objective optimization problems (DMOPs), by demonstrating new approaches to change detection and change prediction in an evolutionary algorithm framework. Because the objectives of such problems change over time, the Pareto optimal set (PS) and Pareto optimal front (PF) are also dynamic. First, we propose a new change detection method which achieves greater sensitivity by considering changes in both the PS and the PF, unlike most previous approaches. Second, when changes occur, a second-order (acceleration-based) prediction strategy is proposed to predictively reinitialize the population close to the new set of optima. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against two other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature, using ten different dynamic benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the proposed change detection strategy in this paper can not only consider the effect of the optimal individuals but also can consider the effect of their corresponding objective values. Compared with the other two methods, the DMOPs achieved both the ability of precisely predicting the direction of changes and the ability of predicting the future trend of change direction. So, the DMOPs can also converge to the true PF in much less iterations compared with other methods. After multiple experiments, the proposed method outperforms the other algorithms on most of the test problems.},

  abstract     = {Special attention to the Agri-food closed-loop supply chain is more critical during global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The main reason for this issue is the importance of food security in different communities during various crises. On the other hand, strategic analysis helps Agri-food organizations to be more prepared to face threats and use the opportunities of these crises. Consequently, the combination of supply chain management and strategic analysis can be utilized for better planning in this situation. In the present study, the closed-loop supply chain of canned food in uncertain conditions is investigated. One of the main features of the problem is to use the canned food waste to increase profitability during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Robust Probabilistic Chance Constrained Programming (RPCCP) approach is presented to face the uncertainty of the problem. One of the main features of the approach is to determine the confidence level of the system proactively to add the concept of robustness to the problem. After using the combined approach and prioritizing strategies for the case study from an emerging economy, &quot;Increased export share of canned food products through virtual marketing and exhibitions&quot; was selected as the superior strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the comparison of the results with the organization&#39;s current conditions, it was found that the income from the sales of primary products and recycled products increased by 39.8% and 10.79%, respectively. Implementing this strategy indicated that the values of other essential criteria of the closed-loop supply chain also increased.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hybrid algorithm called rough sine cosine algorithm (RSCA) is introduced for solving engineering optimization problems by merging the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) with the rough set theory concepts (RST). RSCA combines the benefits of SCA and RST to focus the search for a promising region where the global solution can be found. Due to imprecise information on the optimization problems, efficient algorithms roughly identify the optimal solution for this type of uncertain data. The fundamental motive for adding the RST is to deal with the imprecision and roughness of the available information regarding the global optimal, especially for large dimensional problems. The cut concept of RST targeted the more interesting search region so the optimal operation could be sped up, and the global optimum could be reached at a low computational cost. The proposed RSCA algorithm is tested on 23 benchmark functions and 3 design problems. RSCA’s obtained results are mainly compared to the SCA, which is used as a first level of the proposed algorithm in this work and those of other algorithms in the literature. According to the comparisons, the RSCA can provide very competitive performance with different algorithms.},

Therefore, the accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm cannot be guaranteed. To improve the performance of AOA, this paper reconstructed a nonlinear MOA function, which is expected to balance the exploitation and the exploration of AOA. Furthermore, four hybrid elite pool strategies are integrated to enhance the ability to escape local optima. The proposed algorithm inherits the fast convergence of AOA and develops the performance of escaping local optima.

Each solution is generated with the aid of the step-length and search direction. The step-length is determined with the aid of the Tait’s model of the trajectory of the golf ball, which is a physical model. The search direction is from the current position in the search space toward the position of a different individual or its reflected position. Such a direction determines the movement direction in the optimization process. A crossover operator is introduced to increase exploration at the starting and exploitation at the ending stages of the search. Performance of the GSIS is compared with many algorithms on 23 + 14 unconstrained classic functions, 29 functions of CEC 2017 benchmark suite and six constrained engineering design problems. Experiments indicate that with the aid of its cleverly designed operators, GSIS is able to produce promising results. Besides a cooperative game theoretic approach is introduced, which is able to measure the effectiveness of different operators in reducing the search cost. Such an approach can be used to measure the effectiveness of different operators that an evolutionary or swarm-intelligence algorithm owns.},

As a result, there has been a significant increase in data collection on students&#39; athletic skills. To manage these data, educational institutions are implementing information management systems. However, tracking sports results remain challenging since sports information may not always be collected during sports teaching. This work presents a systematic strategy to address this problem by evaluating student athletes&#39; abilities using an Apriori algorithm, decision tree (DT), and association rule. It covers the processes for collecting data, preprocessing, selecting features, and evaluating models. The efficiency of the DT algorithm in solving classification problems, including student achievement analysis, is emphasized. The association rule algorithm is applied to figure out the correlation between students&#39; physical fitness and their involvement in physical education. The Apriori algorithm is introduced to reduce the amount of data needed in merging item sets. Lastly, the overall architecture of the college students&#39; physical fitness analysis system is presented. It covers the insertion of sports test scores, the calculation of total scores, and the application of DT analysis for evaluating student achievements. The process involves standardizing database information, selecting a training instance set, and determining attributes based on information gain. The efficiency of the system is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In comparison with previous works, our recommended system can track and analyze students&#39; athletic capability, fitness, and physical ability to create personalized workout routines and monitor their health in real-time.},

LLSH replaces the traditional LSH (locality-sensitive hashing) function families with parallel multi-layer neural networks, which reduces the time and memory consumption and guarantees query accuracy simultaneously. The proposed LLSH demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the hash index with learning-based neural networks and open a new door for developers to design and configure data organization more accurately to improve information-searching performance. Extensive experiments on different types of data sets show the superiority of the proposed method in query accuracy, time consumption, and memory usage.},

  abstract     = {The application of recycled aggregate (RA) as a replacement for natural aggregate (NA) in concrete members brings benefits in both cost reduction and environment protection. However, the inferior quality of RA results in significant decrease in the mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) compared to NA. The shear capacity of RAC is one of the challenges for its application. To address this problem, high accurate calculation of shear capacity of RAC beam and its optimal design become urgent. Here, a data-driven hybrid methodology implemented by support vector regression (SVR) with the optimal parameters from genetic algorithm (GA) optimization approach called SVR-GA is proposed to predict the shear capacity of RAC beams, which achieves the minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3949 MPa under five-fold cross-validation, yielding the best performance among RF, SVR and ANN, and the RMSEs and MAPEs of which are all lower than that of existing conventional methods. The results indicate that GA is efficient for tuning hyper-parameter of SVR model. The hybrid SVR-GA model can achieve the best prediction accuracy in prediction the shear strength of RAC beam, with the highest correlation coefficient and lowest RMSE. Moreover, parametric sensitivity analysis reveals beam width, shear span ratio and stirrup spacing are the most sensitive variables and the replacement ratio of RA has little effect on shear strength of RAC beam. Furthermore, to meet the targets of lowest cost, minimum CO2 emissions and maximum shear strength in the design RAC beams, SVR-GA model combining Monte Carlo method was employed for multi-objective optimization discovering the trade-offs among cost, CO2 emissions and shear strength of RAC beams by the Pareto front. The proposed approach can be used as guidance in the design of RAC beam with higher accuracy and convenience.},

In this paper, in order to further enhance the clustering performance, we propose a novel similarity measure function based on neighbor relations. The proposed method is called SC-NR. It uses the Gaussian kernel function to measure the similarity between two objects. Since Euclidean distance cannot fully reflect the relation between data, this method adds a weight related to the order of nearest neighbors to the distance between two points. The similarity is better expressed by weighted-Euclidean distance. In experiments, we compared the proposed method with the previous works via the external indexes, that is, clustering accuracy (ACC), normalized mutual information (NMI), and F-measure. The comparison of indexes with state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the superiority of our algorithm. The experiment includes six synthetic datasets and twelve real-world datasets. For instance, in the PenDigits dataset F-measure metric is 16.50% higher than the current algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Infrared small and dim target has posed great challenges on the target detection and tracking, especially for early warning, navigation and guidance. However, most common tracking algorithms are inefficient for infrared small target due to huge computation, and complicated feature analysis on such target is useless and needless. As such, a fast and useful algorithm based on the kernel correlation filter (KCF) is proposed in this paper. It supplies a solution for target without clear characteristic, target missing and analog interference in complex backgrounds. The proposed algorithm focuses on model update and scale update rules, fusion feature expression and multi-cues constrained re-detection module; all of the ideas aim to optimize process and improve practicability. Firstly, the improved ridge regression model with solving boundary effect and model consistency can get more precise results. Secondly, a useful strengthened feature description (SFD) including the fused feature extraction and complete confidence indicator is proposed to improve the reliability of tracking. Thirdly, the stabilized re-detection (SR) strategy is designed based on motion rules, which can cope with abnormal disturbance and missing states. Fourthly, an adaptive model update is proposed, which can reduce the error accumulation. The experiment results and the comparative studies with some common algorithms show that the proposed algorithm achieves the success rate of tracking above 98%, RMSE of center location below 5 pixels and speed above 120 fps and tends to be more effective.},

Furthermore, the notion of C-mappings is proposed between augmented formal contexts to obtain a category of augmented formal contexts. Then we show the category is equivalent to that of continuous lattices whose morphisms are Scott continuous functions.},

Besides that, a theorem related to fuzzy rate of convergence has been derived with the help of fuzzy modulus of continuity, which gives clarity to understanding the analogous observations between fuzzy set theory and classical theory. Additionally, an example is illustrated which gives a better idea to understand that summability in two variable-based Korovkin type theorem has less drawback over fuzzy set theory.},

(2) A method of constructing such kind of fuzzy number which can be used to represent multi-channel uncertain or imprecise discrete digital information is given. (3) The concept of weighted centroid value of such discrete fuzzy number is introduced, a fuzzy binary relation on space of such discrete fuzzy numbers is set up, and their properties are investigated.

  abstract     = {One of the extremely useful branches in graph theory is the labeling of a graph. Graph labeling plays a vital role in many fields such as database management, astronomy, coding theory, X-ray crystallography, communication network addressing and radar. A labeling of a connected simple graph $$G\left( {V,E} \right)$$ is a map that assign each element in $$G$$ with a positive integer number. An edge irregular total $$\lambda^{\!\!\!\!\!-}$$ -labeling is a map $$\beta :V\left( G \right) \cup E\left( G \right) \to \left\{ 1,2,3, \ldots ,\lambda^{\!\!\!\!\!-} \right\}$$ such that $$W_\beta \left( h \right) \ne W_\beta \left( z \right)$$ where $$W_\beta \left( h \right)$$ and $$W_\beta \left( z \right)$$ are weights for any two distinct edges. In this case, $$G$$ has total edge irregularity strength (TEIS) if $$\lambda^{\!\!\!\!\!-}$$ is minimum. In this paper, a new family of graphs called square snake graphs is defined and denoted by $$C_{4,n}$$ . Moreover, we define some related graphs of square snake graphs named double square snake graph $$D\left( {C_{4,n} } \right)$$ , triple square snake graph $$T\left( {C_{4,n} } \right)$$ and $$m$$ -multiple square snake graph $$M_m \left( {C_{4,n} } \right)$$ . Finally, we determine TEIS for square snake graphs, double square snake graph, triple square snake graph and $$m$$ -multiple square snake graph, which have many applications in coding theory and physics.},

  abstract     = {The linear induction motor based on local public transport has turned out to be more cost-effective in respect of energy cost as well as maintenance. This is due to the fact that linear induction motors constitute a strong durability rate, simple geometrical structure, large force application capability, and independent adhesiveness that make the motor more advanced than conventional motors based on propulsion systems. The single linear induction motor for urban transit modeled by T-type equivalent circuit model enhancement is proposed in this paper. For the proposed system, a double-sided and single-sided linear induction motor is described. For the linear induction motor, the converter control strategies are implemented which is responsive to the velocity and force/current control system, and their integrated performance propulsion drives is described in this paper. Finally, the efficiency and other intrinsic factors needed for the structure’s performance assessment are derived. The relationship between penetration depth and frequency is performed and the penetration rapidly drops at low frequencies and tends to stabilize beyond 10 Hz, with the Al having a relatively larger penetration depth. Finally, the performance analysis such as variation in the number of poles, mechanical air gap, penetration depth and frequency variations are calculated on the basis of various features.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {The widespread availability of digitized fine art collections in museums and galleries has generated a demand for efficient software tools. These tools enable rapid retrieval and semantic classification of art images. Traditional image classification methods often rooted in shallow structure learning algorithms offer the capacity to extract various image features. However, there is need for deep understanding of fundamental painting knowledge during this process due to the reason that certain features may be lost. In this paper, we present an innovating approach for classifying digital paintings based on artist attribution. Our approach centers on the creations of multi-scale pyramid representation derived from a given painting image which facilitate the incorporation of both global and local information within a single image. The training of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is performed for the assignment of class labels on each level of the pyramid. To establish connections among localized image patches, we use Markov Random Fields through the optimization of the Gibbs energy function. We validate the proposed approach which referred to as the multi-scale CNN framework using fusion-based Markov random field using two challenging painting image datasets: WikiArt and Web Gallery of Art (WGA). The proposed model archives better results using WikiArt dataset for painting image classification, i.e., precision (74.12%), recall (70.23%), F1-score (72.65%), and accuracy (80.00%).

  abstract     = {Advancements in internet of things (IoT) technology have empowered the creation of intelligent systems for enhancing the lives of persons with disabilities (PWDs) by improving their mobility and transportation access. The absence of resources and inclusive PWD policies incurs significant costs, amounting to 7% of GDP in some nations. To address PWD mobility challenges, this research study presents a wearable network-based intelligent transportation framework, integrating sensor fusion techniques with robust communication protocols. The study commences by illustrating an integrated IoT model, linking PWD-worn devices with the intelligent transport system through the use of IoT-assisted networks. This integration ensures that PWDs can seamlessly access transport data and services. It evaluates data access performance in terms of reliability and availability when data are accessed from the fog and cloud layers. The use of fog computing improves reliability and availability, providing a robust data access environment. Additionally, we explore the impact of IoT on PWD mobility, employing a provenance-based model with fog computing, enhancing the traceability of data access. This aids in maintaining an effective record of user visit history for enhanced performance. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis, measuring the degree of difficulty, network utilization, latency, and revenue generation for visually impaired, physically disabled, and hearing-impaired individuals. Our results underscore a noteworthy 30% decrease in the level of difficulty experienced by PWDs, consequently leading to improved mobility. This proposed approach not only substantially enhances the mobility of PWDs but also makes substantial contributions to enhanced efficiency and accessibility within intelligent transport systems, thereby resulting in a remarkable degree of facilitation at 55% and a substantial Impact on Revenue Generation at 76%, benefitting society as a whole.},

  abstract     = {Adolescent mental health issues like depression and anxiety are rising among adolescents worldwide, leading to serious long-term consequences if left untreated. However, stigma and lack of resources delay access to timely screening and care. Traditional subjective methods fail to detect early warning signs and risk factors. This paper develops a novel hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model to enable early warning of common mental health risks like depression in teenagers. The model is trained on a large clinical dataset with over 50,000 adolescents encompassing electronic health records and neuroimaging data. This allows discovering subtle predictive patterns within clinical encounters and brain structure or function at the population level. The methodology centers on a tailored CNN and LSTM architecture to comprehensively model the multivariate clinical time series data, combining CNN spatial feature learning with LSTM temporal sequence modeling. The hybrid approach leverages complementary techniques to analyze the neuroimaging and electronic health record data. The model achieves an accuracy of 95%, AUC of 97%, precision of 94%, recall of 91%, and F1 score of 92% on held-out test data, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art models which had lower accuracy. Detailed predictive feature analysis and clinical validation confirm the model&#39;s utility for early mental health risk screening and targeted intervention in teenagers. Overall, the study demonstrates an effective approach to integrating big data, deep learning and rigorous evaluation for developing more accurate, explainable and useful models to support adolescent mental healthcare through data-driven early warning systems.},

This paper is based on vehicle prediction to achieve the arrival time and the quantity of cargo-laden vehicles at freight stations, and adjust the stowage plan in real time to achieve dynamic cargo stowage. In the establishment of real-time dynamic stowage model, the truck arrival and departure time window and truck stay time constraints at the station are added. The purpose is to reduce the impact on the successive truck stowage. Then, the method combining genetic and simulated annealing algorithm is used to solve the model with the help of Matlab platform. The results show that the algorithm can effectively reduce the delay time of trucks at the freight station, improve the operation efficiency of the freight station, and, at the same time, visualize the stowage results. Finally, through the comparison of dynamic and static stowage, it can be concluded that dynamic stowage is more realistic and reduces the waste of related resources at the freight station and reduces the operation cost.},

As a consequence of this, the idea of using intrusion detection systems to combat network threats has been advocated. Machine learning aids common intrusion detection methods which show poor detection rates and requires wider feature engineering. This research offers the random synthetic over-sampling (RSO) Linguistic algorithm for detecting network intrusion and to identify communication anomalies. Deep learning method for network security is combined with an attention mechanism and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network. Frequent pattern stream characteristics were retrieved using CNN network and weights in each channel are changed. Hyperparameter tuning techniques like improvised elephant herding optimization algorithm is employed to increase the Bi-LSTM’s efficiency. The training process, the number of hidden layers and epochs are chosen optimally using these strategies. The RSOA-IEHO-BiLSTM model&#39;s effectiveness testing showed that it outperformed the competing techniques.

  abstract     = {At present times, indoor surveillance becomes a hot research topic among researchers and business sectors. Human detection is one of the vital areas of focus in the surveillance system owing to its significance in proper person detection, human activity identification, and scene classification. Since the indoor spaces comprise poor lighting, variable illuminations, shadowing, and complex background, the human detection process becomes a tedious task. The advent of computer vision and deep learning (DL) models is commonly employed for human detection. This article presents a new intelligent deep learning model for human detection in indoor surveillance videos (IDL-HDIS). As data augmentation process is one of the most renowned ways to increase the size of the dataset which is highly essential for enhancing the prediction accuracy of the model, the same is carried out as a part of even this research work which includes performing rotation, translation and flipping. The IDL-GDIS model uses Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) model for human detection. The Faster R-CNN comprises of Fast R-CNN and Region Proposal Network (RPN). The RPN uses Capsule Networks (CapsNet) model as a shared convolution neural network (CNN), which acts as a feature extractor and generates the feature map. Besides, dropout is employed to avoid overfitting problem in the CapsNet architecture, the validation of IDL-HDIS model is done by a comprehensive simulation analysis under different aspects. The validation is supported by the evident results of the IDL-HDIS model which is given in the paper.},

  abstract     = {To preserve Chinese cultural heritage, the originality and complexity of calligraphy characters are proof of the country&#39;s unique literary heritage. However, it has long been challenging to comprehend and appropriately classify these complex characters. The absence of a quantitative standard for calligraphy Chinese character recognition has limited accurate assessments and recognition, allowing room for improvement. Therefore, this article seeks to improve the digital evolution of Chinese calligraphy and painting works by leveraging the quick development of computer-aided technology and deep learning algorithms. We collected Chinese calligraphy samples and refined them through digitization, preprocessing, noise reduction, and resizing. We used the HOG approach to identify the unique features of each character and the Euler distance to measure spatial relationships between target and background points, capturing their distinct strokes and patterns. Then, we employed the Google LeNet Inception-v3 model to take advantage of the Convolutional Neural Network’s (CNN) capability. Our system can reliably recognize and categorize different calligraphy styles thanks to our CNN-based methodology, going beyond the constraints of conventional recognition techniques. Finally, we carefully evaluated the precision, recall, and accuracy, recognition capacity of our proposed recognition system to assess its effectiveness in correctly identifying calligraphy Chinese characters. The outcomes of our thorough analysis show a recognition rate of 93.12%, illuminating the tremendous potential of our strategy. Our method regularly beats competing algorithms, even in the presence of Gaussian white noise, obtaining accuracy rates of 91.3%, 90.9%, and 89.4% for noise levels of 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06, respectively.},

This information is broad in scope and covers a variety of fields, including the medical field, transportation sector, business firms, and education institutes. Due to the abundance of information, it is challenging to identify useful materials in general, but finding the right materials for students is particularly challenging. To address this issue, this paper aims to study the design of a personalized sports teaching resource recommendation system using a fuzzy clustering technique. To do so, we collected relevant data from entities such as students and teachers, which includes a range of attributes related to physical education, including curricular materials, student profiles, past performance records, and resource metadata. The collected data were then preprocessed to prepare it for further analysis. The features, preferences, and learning styles of each student are examined to develop student profiles based on the data that have been collected. A database schema was created that stored all the information related to physical education teaching resources, students, and teachers. The fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used to improve the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm and reduce the data sparsity of the teaching resources recommendation algorithm. Through a series of experiments, it has been proven that the system designed in this paper can recommend suitable learning resources for different learners and has good performance. At the same time, the recommended method has higher recommendation accuracy and can effectively improve the quality of physical education teaching.},

A new era of individualized learning and teaching administration has begun as a result of the fusion of cutting-edge educational technologies and pedagogical theories. In light of this, we introduced a teaching management system created for the ever-changing needs of physical education in colleges and universities. We use support vector machines (SVM) to personalize and improve students&#39; educational experiences by using the Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as our theoretical framework. In the very first step, we started with the collection of diverse student information, such as academic records, athletic prowess, and many intelligence profiles. To obtain this information, multiple skills of all the students were thoroughly analyzed using MI’s theory. By conducting thorough feature engineering and data preprocessing, we established the foundation for our analysis using SVM. In this phase, we score each student&#39;s performance in sports-related skills. From there, we created a profile for each student and preprocessed the data to build a useful dataset. This dataset trains an SVM model to forecast student engagement and performance using specific kernels and hyperparameters. Our proposed system places a big emphasis on personalized learning. We enable teachers to design a learning environment that fosters student potential by adapting teaching tactics to individual student&#39;s strengths and limitations in both sports skills and multiple intelligences. The effectiveness of the system is assessed by separating the students into two groups: one group received training using our suggested system, known as the experimental group, and the other group, known as the control group, received training using the conventional approach. The result shows that the score of the experimental group is 88.9, which is higher than the control group&#39;s 83.5. The result shows that after applying MI’s theory and SVM in physical education teaching in colleges and universities, the scores have been significantly improved, which can maximize the students&#39; multiple intelligences.},

The given input imagery is segregated into the structure, microstructure, and texture components, and the AGMRF-driven features and statistical features are extracted from the segregated components and are formulated as a feature vector of the query imagery. Cosine direction and Bhattacharyya distance measures are deployed to match the feature vector with the feature vector of the feature vector database. If the query imagery features match the feature-vector database&#39;s features, then the reference imagery in the database is marked and indexed. The indexed imageries are retrieved. Three different benchmark data sets, SceneSat, PatternNet, and UC Merced, have been used to validate the proposed AGMRF–BDCNN method. For the SceneSat data set, the AGMRF–BDCNN method results in 0.2319 scores for ANMRR and 0.7156 scores for mAP; for the UC Merced data set, it yields 0.2316 scores for ANMRR and 0.7816 scores for mAP; for PatternNet data set, it achieves 0.2405 scores for ANMRR and 0.6979 scores for mAP.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the escalating global concerns surrounding climate change have placed a growing emphasis on achieving dual objectives: reducing carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. Businesses and organizations are under mounting pressure to align their operations with these crucial environmental goals. This paper introduces the concept of an enterprise carbon performance evaluation index system (ECPIS) to strike a balance between economic development and environmental protection and enhance overall enterprise management and development strategies. The ECPIS framework is constructed using machine learning and advanced data mining techniques, particularly support vector machines (SVM). Its core purpose is to provide enterprises with a systematic tool to gauge, analyze, and enhance their carbon performance, addressing dual carbon objectives. ECPIS development hinges on data mining techniques, extracting insights from diverse data sources to construct a comprehensive system that accommodates these dual carbon goals’ intricacies. Its methodology includes data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and data mining algorithms to unveil vital patterns and relationships within data. It conforms to international standards, establishing a tailored carbon performance index system aligned with China’s national conditions. It validates carbon-related enterprise data and employs data mining’s association rules to uncover pertinent carbon performance information. The results obtained from ECPIS are auspicious, boasting an experiential accuracy rate of 97.5%. This level of accuracy surpasses that achieved by other algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR). ECPIS stands out by considering various factors, including carbon emissions reduction, energy consumption, supply chain efficiency, and financial performance indicators. This multifaceted approach enables enterprises to gain a comprehensive understanding of their carbon performance and identify areas for improvement.},

  abstract     = {The constant development and the wider usage of computed tomography (CT) has gained the attention of researchers during medical practice related to radiation dose. The intention to eradicate the dosage causes increased artefacts and noise influences the confidentiality of the radiologist. Specifically, various noises like speckle, pepper, impulse, salt and Gaussian noise are determined as the complex source of image noise. Therefore, the enhancements in image reconstruction from the CT image need to be enhanced with the diagnostic performance are a challenging issue related to ill-posed nature. Various CT prediction approaches have given superior outcomes. Moreover, there are fewer works in image denoising using learning approaches as these approaches pretend to reduce mean square error (MSE) among the denoised CT images. The outcomes of the models are compromising and show the visibility of aggressive denoising. This research focuses on modelling an efficient approach for CT image denoising with an adaptive adversarial network model that uses weighted similarity measure ( $$\mathrm{aa}-\mathrm{WSM}$$ ). The anticipated model has the key concept of enhancing the performance and reducing the error rate. The proposed model concentrates on migrating the noise distribution and learning the visual perception knowledge to perform the denoising task. The PSNR of the proposed model is 16.6 and SSIM is 0.64 which is comparatively better than existing methods. The suppressed noise is 5.2, artefacts reduction is 3.6 and the overall quality is 3.8 which is nominal than others. The model handles the essential information and manages the error rate with promising outcomes.},

In this paper, automatic generation and frequency control in interconnected power system is presented. A multisource such as thermal, hydro, and gas-based power plant is considered in this study, which is carried out by incorporating nonlinearity like generation rate constants, HVDC link, and the conventional PID controller design. Further, an optimal setting of the PID controller is performed by employing evolutionary, and metaheuristic algorithm-based approaches such as differential evolution and firefly algorithm, respectively. With these algorithms, the proposed model has been tested with their performance evaluation and comparison characteristics are discoursed. The robustness of the proposed controllers is assessed based on comparative analyses to regulate the interconnected power network’s frequency profile under different loading conditions. The stability analysis is performed using the Eigen and Nyquist plots to assess the proposed controllers’ efficacy. Besides, the frequency control study is summarized with comparative assessment through various performance indices such as settling time, peak overshoot and undershoots under different operating conditions. Finally, the proposed control scheme, in the interconnected power system, is validated through a real-time digital simulation platform, i.e., OPAL-RT 5142. The comparison of simulation and real-time results demonstrates the effectiveness of the FA-optimized PID controller in comparison with that of the DE-optimized PID controller.},

This study proposes a novel environmental efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) in conjunction with predicting artificial intelligence algorithms. The proposed model—fuzzy undesirable slacks-based measure DEA model (FUNSBM)—measures environmental efficiency in terms of the directional distance function and weak disposability, and its combined approaches (artificial neural network (ANN), ANN + particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial immune system (AIS)) predict optimal values of inefficient decision-making units (DMUs) so that they become more efficient considering the possible reduction of CO2 emissions in their production process. The FUNSBM model is applied to a dataset of 30 Iranian forest management units. The findings show that almost 47% DMUs are operating at low efficiency levels with a weak efficiency dispersion; however, these inefficient DMUs could improve their efficiency border via following the combined approaches. This analysis shows that the FUNSBM-AIS approach, by 53% reduction of CO2 emission, is the best approach to predict and/or control CO2 emission in optimal way while FUNSBM-ANN and FUNSBM-ANN + PSO are reduced CO2 emission by 15% and 32%, respectively. As the major conclusion, the FUNSBM-AIS approach exhibits a high degree of reliability to predict the lowest amount of CO2 emission and can help improve the inefficient DMUs by following their predicted optimal values.},

  abstract     = {The air humidity is one essential measurable characteristic widely used in engineering and science. It is highly associated with the air temperature and closely involved with our daily life and work in indoor or outdoor environments. As high humidity can cause damage to building materials and resident health, the humidity issue in buildings seems to have been one widespread concern recently. There is a growing recognition that humidity control is crucial for various occasions. Changes of daily 24-h air humidity, which may be influenced by many factors, can also be expressed as one time series. Contributions of this study are: Firstly, for engineering application purposes, one concise and well-formed called the LS (“least-squares”)-extended DCT (“discrete cosine transform”) model is proposed for hourly air humidity forecasting from the perspective of time-series analyzing or data-driven modeling. Actually, conventional Fourier-based models cannot be straightly applied for forecasting. To reckon the LS-optimal DCT coefficients for forecast modeling on the basis of limited humidity time-series observations, the LS approach is integrated in implementation of the proposed LS-extended DCT forecast model. Then, the proposed method is applied to tasks of forecasting hourly air humidity changes at eight observing stations. Computer-based modeling and simulation results of hourly air humidity prediction at the observing stations as well as comprehensive comparisons indicate potentiality of the proposed method that it provides one concise and well-formed approach for hourly humidity modeling and prediction. To conclude, the proposed method can be used for reference to other related engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Extensive utilization of power electronics in different applications injects harmonics into degrading the power quality. Harmonics can be eliminated in distribution systems using low-cost passive filters, but, they become bulky and complex in design with the increase in harmonic order. Hence, active power filters (APFs) are proposed as a voltage source converter (VSC) for providing better compensation, but active filtering is costly. To minimize such demerits, this article represents a hybrid shunt active power filter (HSAPF). For reference current calculation, dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) is used here and conventional proportional–integral (CPI), type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic controllers (T1FLC and T2FLC) are employed for parameter optimization of HSAPF, to enhance the harmonic compensation ability and power factor. The case studies are performed in both simulations as well as real-time experimental setup using dSPACE, and it is analyzed that the proposed DT-CWT and type-2 fuzzy-based HSAPF provide better compensation performance in comparison to other controllers under different operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {With the industry’s fast adoption of cloud computing, it’s been hard to keep trust between cloud service providers and people who use their services. In fact, trust management in cloud computing has become very challenging given the urgent need for cloud service requesters to choose efficient, trustworthy, and non-risky services. One of the most important factors that can be considered in the applicant’s trust or distrust of a service is the different quality of services related to the service. Therefore, approaches are needed to assess the trustworthiness of cloud services with respect to their quality of service (QoS). Given the uncertainty that exists for cloud services, it is more realistic to model their QoS parameters as random variables and also consider different dependencies between them. In this paper, a new trust model for cloud services is proposed using a Bayesian network, which is a probabilistic graphical model that can be used as one of the best methods to control uncertainty. Using Bayesian networks makes it possible to infer more accurate QoS values, which leads to the selection of highly trustworthy services by several cloud service requesters. To evaluate the proposed trust model, experimental results are performed using a real-world cloud service quality feedback, collected by the $$CloudArmor$$ project. The results of the experiments show that the proposed trust model is highly accurate and significantly reduces the estimation error.},

Rolling element bearings are the utmost dominant part in rotating machinery, so even small defects in these components could result in catastrophic system failure and enormous financial losses. Hence, it is crucial to create consistent and affordable condition monitoring and fault diagnosis systems that estimate severity level and failure modes and to create an appropriate maintenance strategy. The studies reveal that the fault diagnostic system focuses on single fault diagnosis of the shaft-bearing system. However, in real scenarios, the occurrence of a single fault is very unlikely. Thus, multifault diagnosis of the shaft-bearing system is of greater significance. This paper aims at steadily and broadly summarizing the development of the intelligent multifault diagnostic and condition monitoring systems. In addition, there is a rapid development of application of Internet of things, cloud computing and artificial intelligence techniques for fault diagnosis. In this paper, we summarize the study of various fault diagnostic system built on the architecture and application of these cutting-edge technologies for predictive maintenance of mechanical equipment.},

In this study, 32 different rock types included metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rocks were investigated in the laboratory to investigate the relationships between the DRI and input parameters. The modeling results show that the relationships determined for estimating the DRI by TLBO and GWO algorithms are accurate and close to the real value.

  abstract     = {Due to their robustness against large-scale geometric transformations, keypoint-based detection methods play an important role in revealing copy–move evidence. However, where copy–move forgeries are only involved in low-contrast or small or smooth regions, these approaches do not yield high-performance results because the number of keypoints in these regions is very limited. We recommend a highly efficient copy–move forgery detection algorithm by ADaptive Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (ADSIFT). Initially, by adapting the gamma factor for contrast threshold and rescaling factor values for feature matching and forgery detection, we produce an adequate number of keypoints that occur even in low-contrast or small or smooth regions of noisy or noiseless images. The proposed approach delivers greater performance than the existing methods as compared to precision and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Although t-way strategy tries to generate a minimum test suite (TS) for detecting errors in software systems, its functionality is affected by three important challenges. The first one, which relates to the quality of the generated TS, expresses that some complex errors (e.g., deadlocks in concurrent systems) may not be detected through the generated TS. The second one is that manually preparing parameters and their values in the modern software systems is difficult or even impossible, whereas the third one is the low generation speed and the large size of the generated test suite. In this paper, we propose a three-phase approach (so-called TPA) to handle these challenges. It seems that injecting some information about special errors into the test suite can raise its quality. For this purpose, TPA, in the first phase, uses an optimized version of model checking to extract such information from a model of the system under test. The extracted information is then injected into the test suite. In the second phase, TPA uses the generated state space in the first phase to automatically prepare parameters and their values. In the last phase, TPA applies an adopted version of evolution strategy to improve the functionality of t-way strategy in terms of generation speed and test suite size. Multiple and pairwise comparisons of results confirm that TPA has the best functionality in comparison with other evolutionary algorithms.},

The EHF problem under consideration is highly nonlinear and the nonlinearity confronted in the problem is in the form of a rational function and has a singularity at the point $$x=0$$ . To construct a non-uniform grid, we use a grading function. This function generates a finer mesh near the singular point. The efficiency and applicability of the new method are demonstrated by applying it to the EHF equation for small and large values of two relevant parameters, namely the strength of nonlinearity $$\alpha $$ and the electric Hartmann number $$\tilde{H}$$ . The velocity field of EHF flow of a fluid in radial direction is computed. It is shown that the proposed new scheme produces a fourth-order numerical approximation to the solution of the considered EHF problem and the velocity field is clearly influenced by the parameters $$\tilde{H}$$ and $$\alpha $$ .

  abstract     = {Speech-driven 3D human face animation has made admirable progress. However, synthesizing 3D facial speakers with head motion is still an unsolved problem. This is because head motion, as a speech-independent appearance representation, is difficult to model by a speech-driven approach. To solve this problem, we propose 3D head-talk, which generates 3D face animations combined with extreme head motion. In this work, we face a key challenge to generate natural head movements that match the speech rhythm. We first form an end-to-end autoregressive model by combining a dual-tower and single-tower Transformer, with a speech encoder encoding the long-term audio environment, a facial grid encoder encoding subtle changes in the vertices of the 3D facial grid, and a single-tower decoder automatically regressing to predict a series of 3D facial animation grids. Next, the predicted 3D facial animation sequence is edited by a motion field generator containing head motion to obtain an output sequence containing extreme head motion. Finally, the natural 3D face animation under extreme head motion is presented in combination with the input audio. The quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, and stabilizes the non-area region while maintaining the appearance of extreme head motion.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of data-driven analytics and intelligent monitoring systems is radically transforming the world of competitive sports. However, robust real-time activity recognition remains elusive for rapid-paced sports like table tennis due to the complexity of strokes and quick maneuvering. This paper tries to overcome this challenge through an innovative cloud-supported system integrating the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and wearable sensors for automated analysis of table tennis gameplay. We strategically set up a multi-camera IoT system around a table tennis court to compile a rich labeled image dataset encapsulating over 15,000 frames. To improve model generalization, the images captured various playing styles, lighting conditions, and camera angles. We developed tailored SVM and CNN architectures optimized for table tennis activity classification. The models were trained on GPU-accelerated platforms using the curated dataset. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the CNN model achieved 96.2% accuracy, a precision value of 96.3%, a recall value of 95.2%, and an F1-score of 96.3% in classifying standard strokes and serves. Additionally, the models exhibited impressive processing speeds of 22–34 fps, enabling real-time utilization. Our proposed model outperformed the latest models in this field with higher accuracy, recall values, F1-score, and precision. While expanding the dataset diversity and testing variations of deep network architectures could further enhance performance, this paper demonstrates a crucial leap toward helping real-time analytics in table tennis using an AI-powered computer vision approach. The hybrid system combining IoT, wearables, and machine learning establishes a framework to transform data into actionable and timely insights for table tennis players and coaches.},

PID controllers are still used primarily in the industry, because they are Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The LQR provides an efficient way to tune the parameters of a PID controller. The LQR has the disadvantage of requiring accurate models of the system, as well as reducing a high-order system to a second-order model. First, we explore the new horizons of control theory in the form of the state-space model for high nonlinear systems. Second, the Lagrangian method establishes the new mathematical model of the two-stage linear inverted pendulum system. In addition, real-time LQR parameters are calculated under variable load.

  abstract     = {In multiple attribute decision making (MADM), there is often a need for comparing the attributes. In situations such as time pressure and lack of adequate knowledge, eliciting exact numerical weights from decision maker (DM) is impossible, but instead, obtaining a ranking of the attributes using an elicitation method is practical. Hence, many investigators have concentrated on a branch of the methods called approximate weighting. These methods generate the surrogate weights for the precise numbers that cannot be extracted from the DM’s mind. Many researchers have attempted to get the best approximate weights as close as possible to precise weights. There are several approximate weighting methods; among others, it is well known that the rank order centroid (ROC) outperforms the others. In competition with the ROC method, this paper develops a novel method, called rank order logarithm (ROL), that is based on a justifiable and well-founded concept. Three evaluations are performed to compare the ROC and ROL methods: a set of simulation experiments, a theoretical analysis, and a real-case analysis. Interestingly, the results of all the three evaluations reveal that the ROL method is comparable to the ROC method in most situations. To show applicability of the ROL method in real-world situations, a study case taken from high-technology selection in petroleum industry is examined.},

Here, the goal is to efficiently deliver milk from a production facility to multiple retail outlets, considering both the cost of transportation and time of delivery as the two primary objectives of the solid transportation problem. Hence, the bi-objective solid transportation problem (BOSTP) is solved, supposing its constraints are fuzzy due to various unpredictable factors during the transportation period. These uncertain values are initially de-fuzzified into the equivalent crisp values using the α-cut approach. Later, the STP is solved with single objectives at once using Vogel’s approximation method. This mathematical model is then formulated to optimize the total transportation cost and time and solved using the hierarchical order goal programming technique to determine the most cost-effective and time-efficient route. The results show that the hierarchical order goal programming technique minimizes the total transportation cost and time while improving the effectiveness of milk distribution.},

Although various distances have been proposed, there are some distances that do not meet the axiomatic definition of distance or some distances that induce counter-intuitive results. To address the above defects, this paper gives a new distance between picture fuzzy sets by aggregating three-dimensional divergence, due to the capability of divergence to distinguish information. This new distance not only satisfies the axiomatic definition, but also overcomes the counter-intuitive defects. Furthermore, the proposed distance is applied to solve the multi-attribute decision-making problem. Through comparison and analysis of decision results, this distance not only provides reasonable decision results, but also has high degree of confidence.},

Under this background, this paper focuses on a third-party platform whose multilateral users are manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers. There exist various cross-side network effects (i.e., CNEs) and same-side network effects (i.e., SNEs) among users (including manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers) at different development stages of the platform, which may affect the multi-value chain collaboration of users positively or negatively. By building a system dynamics model, this paper examines the interactions of the network effects and analyzes their impacts on the multi-value chain collaboration and platform’s revenues. Then, the key factors that affect the network effect interactions are explored. The results show that the network effect interactions are significant in the early development stage of the platform. The growth of the SNEs of suppliers and logistics providers has significant impacts on their own CNEs and profits. Interestingly, the increase of manufacturers’ SNEs can affect the CNEs of their own and suppliers simultaneously, which may decrease the profits of other participants but does not change their own profits. Affected by multiple network effects, the platform needs to implement a differentiated pricing strategy for its users. That is, the platform should charge suppliers and logistics providers access fee while giving manufacturers a certain subsidy. These findings can provide some valuable insights to the operation of the third-party platform.},

To analyze the influence of imbalanced network traffic data on the performance of standard classification algorithms, the imbalanced data augmentation algorithms are first designed to obtain the imbalanced network traffic data set with gradually varying Imbalance Ratio (IR) and belonging to the same distribution. Then, to obtain more objective classification result and simplify the evaluation process, the evaluation metric AFG is used to evaluate the classification performance of standard classification algorithms based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F-measure and G-mean. Finally, based on AFG and coefficient of variation (CV), performance stability of standard classification algorithms on imbalanced network traffic data is obtained. Experiments of eight widely used standard classification algorithms on 25 different imbalanced network traffic data demonstrate that the classification performance of GNB, RF and DT is unstable, while BNB, KNN, LR, GBDT, and SVC are relatively stable and not susceptible to imbalanced data. Especially, the KNN has the most stable classification performance. Also, the results are statistically confirmed by Friedman and Nemenyi post hoc statistical tests.},

  abstract     = {For a few decades, parallelization in statistical computing has been an increasing trend, and researchers have put significant effort into converting or adjusting known statistical methods and algorithms in parallel. The main reasons for the transition to parallel processes are the rapid growth in the size and the volume of data and the accelerated hardware developments. Divide and (re)combine (DnR) is one of the parallelization methods that allows the existing data or method to be implemented by dividing it into smaller pieces. It is possible to use the DnR method in most regression methods to reveal the relationship between the data. Although several libraries have been created in existing programming languages for many regression methods, such an approach is not yet used for kernel regression. However, it should be kept in mind that the kernel regression calculation method takes a relatively long time. For this reason, parallelization would be a handy strategy to decrease the calculation time in kernel regression. In this study, we aim to demonstrate how time efficiency is achieved using DnR methods for kernel regression with the help of several parallelization strategies in R. The results indicate that the computation time can be reduced proportionally with a trade-off between time and accuracy.},

First, we analyze the Fermatean fuzzy power Bonferroni mean (FFPBM) and Fermatean fuzzy weighted power Bonferroni mean (FFWPBM) operators, which combine the properties of the Bonferroni mean and the power average operators. The proposal for a new operators can not only force decision-makers to consider the possible interaction between each attribute in the decision-making process, but also embrace the balance of data by calculating the support degree and aggregating the attribute values, thereby improving generalization ability overall. Then various qualities, such as idempotency, permutation, and boundedness, are demonstrated. After that, the MADM method is proposed with the developed operators. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate the new approach&#39;s validity and viability.},

Also, we present two types of state residuated lattices: state i-simple residuated lattices and state i-local residuated lattices, and characterize them. Moreover, the relationship between state ideals and state filters is analyzed using the set of complement elements. Furthermore, we prove that the lattice of all state ideals of a given state residuated lattice is a complete lattice.

This study employs a new method for regression model prediction in an uncertain environment and presents fuzzy parameter estimation of fuzzy regression models using triangular fuzzy numbers. These estimation methods are obtained by new learning algorithms in which linear programming is used. In this study, the new algorithm is a combination of a fuzzy rule-based system, on the basis of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization ACOR. In the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system method, the output is crisp. In this research, a hybrid algorithm has been proposed to get the fuzzy output based on linear programming. Meta-heuristic algorithms have been used to reduce the error in the proposed methods based on PSO and ACOR. In addition, two simulation and two practical examples in the field of machining process are applied to indicate the performance of the proposed methods in dealing with crisp input and fuzzy output (CIFO) problems where the observed output variables have the nature of inhomogeneity, randomness, and imprecision. Finally, the results of the proposed algorithms are evaluated. Based on examples, the proposed method is more accurate than the LP and FWLP methods but is not more complicated than the FWLP in computations. Using paired t test, a significant difference was shown between the proposed methods and previous methods, such as LP and FWLP, but there was no significant difference between the two proposed methods ACOR and PSO.},

In this regard, we provide information on these surfaces’ behavior by deriving them associated with involute–evolute curve pairs and calculating their certain curvatures. Notably, we establish a link between the curvatures of these curve pairs and the Gaussian and mean curvatures of Hasimoto surfaces. Our research further identifies the precise conditions under which the parameter curves of these surfaces assume the roles of geodesics, asymptotics, or lines of curvature on the surface.

There are several studies in the literature on the Cesàro summability method and its statistical version, in classical, fuzzy, and intuitionistic fuzzy normed spaces. However, what distinguishes this study from others, besides the techniques used, is that it is a more comprehensive research in terms of both the space being studied and the path to the statistical convergence from the statistical Cesàro summability method. Our primary goal in this work is to investigate whether conditions designated as O-type like q-boundedness and statistical slow oscillation require statistical Cesàro summable sequences be statistical convergent with respect to the intuitionistic fuzzy norm $$(\mu ,\nu ).$$ Moreover, we inquire about the existence of a more inclusive condition than these conditions, from which we can derive a similar inference. Our second aim is to present a series of auxiliary results designed to be utilized in the proofs of our main results. To go into a little detail, we discuss some algebraic properties of statistical limits, including additivity and homogeneity, as well as the existence of a statistical limit of subsequences and moving averages of a sequence. Finally, we give some examples of the application of the intuitionistic fuzzy normed space in engineering, in order to extend the area of influence of the relevant space and to support the studies carried out in the context of this space.},

  abstract     = {Seikh and Dutta (Soft Comput 26: 921–936, 2022) claimed that there does not exist any approach to solve single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic (SVTrN) matrix games (matrix games in which each payoff is represented by a SVTrN number). To fill this gap, Seikh and Dutta, firstly, proposed SVTrN non-linear programming problems (NLPPs) corresponding to Player-I and Player-II. Then, Seikh and Dutta proposed two different approaches to transform the proposed SVTrN NLPPs into crisp linear programming problems (CLPPs). Finally, Seikh and Dutta claimed that an optimal solution of the transformed CLPPs also represents an optimal solution of SVTrN NLPPs. Brikaa (Soft Comput 26: 9137–9139, 2022) pointed out that a mathematically incorrect result is considered in Seikh and Dutta’s first approach to transform SVTrN NLPPs into CLPPs. Therefore, the transformed CLPPs are not equivalent to SVTrN NLPPs. Hence, it is mathematically incorrect to assume that an optimal solution of the transformed CLPPs also represents an optimal solution of SVTrN NLPPs. Brikaa also proposed an approach to transform the SVTrN NLPPs into CLPPs. In this paper, it is pointed out that on solving the CLPPs, obtained by Brikaa’s approach corresponding to SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II, different optimal value is obtained. Also, it is pointed out that on solving the CLPPs, obtained by Seikh and Dutta’s second approach corresponding to SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II, a different optimal value is obtained. However, in the actual case, the obtained optimal value should be the same as in the literature; it is proved that the CLPPs corresponding to Player-I and Player-II represent a primal–dual pair. This indicates that neither the CLPPs, obtained by Brikaa’s approach nor the CLPPs, obtained by Seikh and Dutta’s second approach, are equivalent to the SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II. Hence, it is inappropriate to use the CLPPs, obtained by Brikaa’s approach as well as Seikh and Dutta’s second approach to find an optimal solution for the SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II. Also, Brikaa’s approach as well as Seikh and Dutta’s second approach is modified to transform SVTrN NLPPs into their equivalent CLPPs. Furthermore, it is proved that the CLPPs corresponding to SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II, obtained by the proposed modified approaches, represent a primal–dual pair. Finally, the correct result of a SVTrN matrix game, considered by Seikh and Dutta to illustrate their approaches, is obtained by the proposed modified approaches.},
