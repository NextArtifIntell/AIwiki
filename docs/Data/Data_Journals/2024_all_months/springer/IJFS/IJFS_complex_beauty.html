  abstract     = {In real-world scenarios, datasets often lack full supervision due to the high cost associated with acquiring decision labels. Completing datasets by filling in missing labels is essential for preserving the valuable feature information of individual samples. Furthermore, in the era of big data, datasets tend to exhibit high dimensionality, which adds complexity to subsequent data processing. In this study, a new semi-supervised feature selection technique is introduced. Firstly, a fully supervised dataset is created by utilizing a local density decision-labeling algorithm to fill in missing decision labels within the semi-supervised dataset. Next, a fuzzy dependency-based feature selection approach is presented to find and keep the most pertinent characteristics for the finished datasets. Finally, the effectiveness and reliability of our proposed method are validated through a series of rigorous experiments.},

  abstract     = {Concept-cognitive learning (CCL) has been an active topic in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing. Two-way concept-cognitive learning (TCCL), an efficient cognitive mechanism to discover knowledge from an arbitrary information granule, has attracted attention to the problems of concept learning. Although TCCL has been widely adopted for cognitive and learning concepts, the existing studies still have some issues: learning concepts can only from the standard formal context, i.e., extent with discrete information, and ignoring the fuzziness of object information that is also important to precise cognitive and learning concepts. Hence, this paper proposes a novel L-fuzzy concept learning method via two-way concept-cognitive learning and fuzzy residual implication, namely, L-fuzzy concept-cognitive learning (LF-CCL). Specifically, we give the theoretical underpinnings of the L-fuzzy CCL method and a pair of dual cognitive operators are presented based on residual implication. Then L-fuzzy two-way granule spaces are constructed to explore the transformation of information granules and the generation of knowledge granules from arbitrary cognitive clues. Meanwhile, we analyze the CCL progress using L-fuzzy operators based on fixed points. Moreover, the corresponding algorithms are designed, and the decision value of this method in financial investment applications is explored through experimental analysis. Finally, numerical experiments verify the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The adulteration of camellia seed oil with different processes will seriously violate the rights and interests of consumers. The accurate identification of camellia seed oil processes is of great significance to reduce such illegal activities. However, the fatty acid composition of camellia seed oil is complex and the content varies greatly in the same process, while the difference is small in different processes. This multivariate data are easy to lead to the fuzzy characteristics of camellia seed oil, which increases the difficulty of identifying camellia seed oil quality. To solve these problems, we propose a multi-scale interactive attention network (MIANet) for the accurate identification of camellia seed oil. Firstly, a one-dimensional multi-scale convolutional feature extraction method (OMCM) was proposed, which was used to reduce the difference from multivariate fuzzy features and better solve the problem of fuzzy features of camellia seed oil fatty acids with the same process. Secondly, the interactive attention mechanism (IA) was proposed to enhance the deep characteristics of multivariate fatty acids from the fusion of two dimensions, so that the model paid more attention to the subtle differences between different processes, and effectively solved the problem of fuzzy fatty acid characteristics of camellia seed oil in different processes. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of MIANet, MIANet is compared with classical machine learning methods such as SVM, KNN, LR, LDA, QDA, classical deep learning method AlexNet, and the most advanced deep learning methods such as DMCNN and HCA-MFFNet. The accuracy of MIANet reached 94.10%, which was better than the eight methods. The experimental results show that MIANet is an effective method for the accurate identification of camellia seed oil data with fuzzy characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Biomedical data exhibit high-dimensional complexity in its internal structure and are susceptible to noise interference, making classification tasks in biomedical data highly challenging. Twin support vector machine (TSVM) is a machine learning algorithm that can effectively solve pattern recognition problems. To mitigate the negative impact of noise, researchers have combined fuzzy set theory with TSVM and use fuzzy membership to describe the influence of different samples on constructing the optimal hyperplane, thus, extending TSVM to fuzzy twin support vector machines (FTSVM). In this paper, the dissimilarity measure based on data distribution is innovatively introduced into the fuzzy membership assignment process, and a novel fuzzy membership assignment strategy is designed to effectively reduce the negative impact of noise in biomedical data. Rather than rely on geometric distance, this strategy takes data distribution as the primary factor in measuring dissimilarity between samples and then constructs a heuristic function to assign fuzzy membership to different samples. Combining this strategy with TSVM, this paper proposed a fuzzy twin support vector machine based on dissimilarity measure (DFTSVM), which could effectively solve the classification problem with noise and shows excellent generalization performance in biomedical data. Moreover, DFTSVM employs a coordinate descent strategy with shrinking by active set to reduce computational complexity, which significantly improves the training speed of the model. Experiments are conducted on 14 biomedical datasets to compare the performance of DFTSVM with 10 heterogeneous machine learning classification algorithms and four homology algorithms. The results demonstrate that DFTSVM outperforms other algorithms in terms of classification performance on biomedical data. It exhibits excellent generalization performance in noisy environments, and its advantages in terms of generalization performance and noise robustness become more prominent as the noise rate increases.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy logic is the core method for handling uncertainty and vagueness of information in agricultural natural language processing, and it also plays a crucial role in word segmentation and text classification algorithms using the neural network. Word segmentation is often the primary step in Chinese text classification tasks and has a profound effect on the generation ability of classification algorithm-based fuzzy logic. However, the high complexity of text classification models structure and specificity of agricultural data take a great challenge to studying the effect of word segmentation. Although there have been several attempts to resolve this issue, the main effort focuses on word segment Precision or the generalization performance of multiple word segment methods for the same classification algorithm and does not involve agricultural text. To solve this problem from the perspective of rational analysis and empirical analysis, a comprehensive analysis has been made to study the effect of Chinese word segmentation on fuzzy-based classification algorithms for agricultural questions. It initially discusses the characteristics of agricultural questions for the subsequent analysis of the field adaptability of word segmentation and classification algorithms, employs fuzzy logic to convert the Chinese word segmentation task into a sequence labeling problem, and then analyzes the characteristics, techniques, and performance disparities of the seven mainstream open-source Chinese word segmentation integration tools at the current stage. Subsequently, an exploration has been conducted into the impact of Chinese word segmentation on the generalization performance of classification algorithms under the proposed unified model framework for text classification based on fuzzy logic. Finally, many experiments have been performed on the actual data crawled from typical agricultural websites to empirically study the differences and robustness of the effect of different word segmentation tools on classification performance, as well as the contribution of the external dictionary. Comparative experimental results show which word segmentation tools have a solid effect on classification performance and a strong robust effect on the typical text feature extraction layer for classification tasks, and the external dictionary have no significant effect on classification performance. The research results have essential reference significance for how to select appropriate word segmentation tools to deal with Chinese natural language processing tasks in future.},

  abstract     = {The class imbalance problem is one of the critical research areas of machine learning and deep learning and has received widespread attention from researchers. To solve the class imbalance problem, current typical methods only use positive samples to generate synthetic samples that are similar to the minority class while ignoring the characteristic information of negative samples. Therefore, when the number of positive samples is too small and has highly similar features, it will cause the classifier to have fitting problems. In response to the above problems, we propose a new positive sample enhancement algorithm (PENH) to solve the class imbalance by simulating the process of chromosome cross-fusion. We select the fuzzy negative sample set around the positive sample by the K-nearest neighbor algorithm and adopt the beyond empirical risk minimization (Mixup) to randomly hybridize the positive sample with the negative sample of the set. To overcome the problem of sample imbalance, we adopt the One-class SVM with overfitting of positive samples to select the newly generated unlabeled samples to obtain the balanced dataset. We construct multiple experiments in 20 open datasets. The results show that our PENH outperforms the other six baseline methods in multiple evaluation indicator.},

To address these issues, a feature selection algorithm for LDL under dynamic conditions is proposed, which takes full use of dynamic information from data. Specially, a novel rough set model called F-double-fuzzy rough set is created to handle dynamic LDL data, which is extended from F-fuzzy rough set. Then, F-fuzzy-condition entropy is defined to fuse information together in F-double-fuzzy rough set, which is considered as a measure for feature selection. Thirdly, a dynamic feature selection algorithm for LDL is proposed with the F-fuzzy-condition entropy. Fourthly, a novel method of covering set is proposed to simulate dynamic LDL data, and its merits are explained intuitively. At last, experiments on 14 datasets with six widely used metrics demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm has advantages over the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Different from the existing observer-based control strategy, a distinguishing feature of this paper is that constructed observers can make full use of current and past output measurements to enhance the performance of the observers in state estimation. However, the introduction of past output measurements has brought challenges to stability analysis and controller design. To tackle these difficulties and design a set of non-fragile fuzzy controllers to stabilize the systems, a new augmented state vector is constructed. First, a new non-fragile observer-based $$H_\infty $$ control criterion is deduced based on the fuzzy Lyapunov function method. Then, the method of simultaneously solving observer and controller gains is obtained by introducing free matrix variables and using the linear matrix inequality approach. This solving method is more efficient than the traditional two-step method. Finally, two confirmatory instances are given.},

  abstract     = {As an essential tool for processing fuzzy or chaotic information, the main feature of the first-order Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) neuro-fuzzy model is utilizing a set of IF-THEN fuzzy rules to represent non-linear systems, showcasing commendable non-linear approximation ability and significant interpretability. However, the coexistence of linear rules and the affiliation function of fuzzy sets makes the integer-order gradient descent method (IOGDM), commonly used in training the first-order T–S neuro-fuzzy model, fail to accurately capture the intricate relationships among weights, resulting in the error function struggling to converge rapidly to low values. To enhance the convergence speed and training accuracy of the first-order T–S neuro-fuzzy model during the training process, a fractional-order gradient descent method (FOGDM) is proposed to update the fuzzy rule parameters and neural network weights of the model in this paper. By subdividing the gradient into fractional orders, FOGDM exhibits heightened flexibility in gradient adjustments, thus better capturing the complex non-linear relationships among parameters during the optimization process. The weak and strong convergence of the proposed approach is meticulously demonstrated in this paper, ensuring that the weight of error functions converges to a constant value and that the gradient of the error functions tends toward zero, respectively. Simulation results analysis indicates that, compared to IOGDM, FOGDM exhibits faster convergence speed and more significant generalization capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Safety life analysis can provide guidance for safety service and maintenance plan of structure. To efficiently analyze the structural safety life under required failure possibility in the presence of fuzzy uncertainty, this paper proposes a sequential Kriging (SK)-based fuzzy simulation (FS) combined with dichotomy (SK-FS-D) method. Firstly, based on monotonic relationship of time-dependent failure possibility (TDFP) and service time, the SK-FS-D uses dichotomy method to search the safety life. Secondly, the SK-FS-D proposes a strategy of sequentially updating Kriging surrogate model in the candidate sample pool (CSP) of fuzzy simulation (FS) to estimate the TDFP corresponding to each possible life searched by dichotomy, and the next dichotomy interval is determined by TDFP estimated by the convergent Kriging model. This strategy can improve the efficiency of SK-FS-D by avoiding training Kriging model at the life not visited by dichotomy and extend the engineering applicability of SK-FS-D by inheriting the advantages of FS method. Moreover, the CSP reduction strategy is further adopted to improve the computational efficiency of TDFP according to some correct information provided by the convergent Kriging model and the property of fuzzy design point. Finally, one numerical example and three engineering examples are introduced to verify the superior performance of the proposed SK-FS-D over the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {With the fast-growing demand for wind energy, small wind turbines are becoming a viable and cost-effective source of clean and renewable electricity for residential, businesses, small industries, and remote applications. To harness the maximum power, wind turbines (WT) should be operated at full capacity; hence, it is crucial to design an effective maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control scheme. This paper presents an effective MPPT control algorithm based on fuzzy logic control (FLC) which tracks the slope of the mechanical power of the WT as a function of the rotational speed. The output of this MPPT generates the duty cycle for the DC–DC converter to allow the WT to extract the maximum power under a wide range of wind speed and loading conditions. The electrical generator used in the studied wind energy conversion system is the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The proposed FLC-MPPT strategy is simple to implement and does not require any prior knowledge of the WT parameters. The proposed FLC-MPPT technique for WT is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and validated experimentally on a laboratory setup using a dSPACE1104 board. In addition, a comparison between the proposed FLC-MPPT and other methods under significant wind speed fluctuations and variable load conditions is presented to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed MPPT has a fast convergence with a high tracking accuracy and exhibits low steady-state oscillations.},

As only single-loop sampling is needed in the SLFS, the computational complexity and cost of the proposed method are both reduced compared to the DLFS.

Based on the candidate sampling pool of SLFS to sample the fuzzy inputs and the time parameter in the same level, a single Kriging can be more efficiently constructed and updated.

Fuzzy logic excels in assessing stressed fish conditions by handling inherent uncertainties. Simultaneously, YOLOv7 with fuzzy color enhancement (YOLOv7FCE) is used to detect damaged fish nets, thereby mitigating losses and upholding the integrity of the net infrastructure. This approach also leverages YOLOv7FCE for identifying Cobia fish within shoals, streamlining the identification process. Subsequently, DeepLabv3 is implemented to meticulously segment the recognized Cobia fish, facilitating precise measurements of their physical attributes. This comprehensive methodology yields profound insights into growth patterns and feeding tendencies within the confined aquatic environment.

  abstract     = {Fish diseases are among the major limiting factors to increase global aquaculture production. They lead to increased fish mortality, low breeding and growth rates, and low meat quality. The success of aquaculture is heavily dependent on the timely identification of disease. Therefore, we propose a fuzzy U-Net model to automatically identify fish disease from underwater images. U-Net is enhanced with multi-head channel and spatial attention and used to segment infected fish regions from fish disease images. Color pixel intensity features are then extracted from the localized regions, a form of guided feature extraction. Fuzzy C-means clustering is then used to find the cluster centroids and data distribution within the clusters, for the design of fuzzy membership functions. Moreover, the number of clusters are determined by silhouette score. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is then trained, tested, and cross-validated for fish disease identification. The model parameters are optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and compared with gradient-based methods. For image segmentation, the enhanced U-Net achieved a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 86.29%, mean pixel accuracy of 90.94%, mean precision of 93.58%, and mean recall value of 89.94% on 42 test images. Subsequently, ANFIS with PSO achieved overall superior performance on fish disease identification over gradient-based methods, with accuracy of 99.31%, precision of 99.00%, recall of 99.00%, and F1-score of 99.00%. The high-performance results of the optimized ANFIS confirm the robustness and efficacy of the proposed method to automatically identify fish diseases in aquaculture.},

Because of this feature, information communication between leader ships, which are farthest from each other in formation and containment problems, isn’t required. However, the analysis problem in the IT-2 fuzzy containment controller design method is caused by the leader’s formation controller. A design concept for the unknown leader’s input of linear multi-agent systems is successfully extended to solve the problem by the expression of IT-2 T-SFM. Nevertheless, the analysis process will become conservative while the agent number or fuzzy rule number is increased. Thus, a relaxed analysis method is also considered for the containment controller design. Additionally, the passive performance constraint is combined into the IT-2 fuzzy formation controller design method to dissipate the disturbance effect and improve the control performance.

  abstract     = {As an effective tool to show the fuzziness of qualitative information, the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (PHFS) can utilize a group of membership degrees with a clear probability distribution to show the opinions of decision-maker (DM). Given this merit, many probabilistic hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making (PHF-MCGDM) methods have been designed. However, most of the existing PHF-MCGDM methods have some limitations, including the difficulty of reflecting DMs’ ambiguous and hesitant preferences for criteria weights and the inability to comprehensively show the impacts of DMs’ irrational behaviors. To address these limitations, this paper develops a novel PHF-MCGDM method that integrates the defining interrelationships between ranked criteria (DIBR) approach and tri-reference point (TRP) theory. First, the PHF-DIBR approach is constructed to determine criteria weights by fully expressing DMs’ ambiguous and hesitant preferences for the importance of criteria. Second, the novel probabilistic hesitant fuzzy correlation coefficient (NPHFCC) is developed for deriving the weights of DMs, which remedies the flaws of the existing correlation coefficients (CC). Moreover, TRP theory is used to describe the psychological behavior effects of DMs and derive the order of alternatives. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is validated by the case about office flooring material selection, while the sensitivity and comparison analyses are also conducted to further prove its advantages and effectiveness.},

Second, as the signal transmission inevitably suffers from delay and data dropouts because of the limited network bandwidth, an event-triggered scheme is constructed to complete the communication scheduling and save the communication resource. Third, considering that there is an unavoidable asynchronous constraint between the fuzzy system and the fuzzy controller due to the communication delay, a hierarchical event-triggered fuzzy controller design approach is given via a new Lyapunov functional. Moreover, a differential distribution scheme is introduced to obtain the desired torque of each tire of the vehicle. Finally, experimental results validate that the presented controller in this paper is able to improve the path following accuracy by 61.93% with a resource economization 92.04% compared with the existing method.},

In addition, a switched observer is adopted to reduce the conservativeness caused by the use of a common observer. Then, by combining the average dwell time scheme and the backstepping technology, a novel observer-based fuzzy adaptive controller is developed, which can assure that all the closed-loop signals of the switched systems are bounded under a type of slowly switching signals and the tracking error converges to a pre-specified range in finite time even if the initial value of the tracking error is greater than the performance function. Finally, the simulation results are shown to verify the feasibility of the presented control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of dynamic event-triggered dissipative filtering for T–S fuzzy systems. First, a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is proposed to save communication resources, and it is equipped with two dynamic trigger thresholds. One of the thresholds is a state-dependent time-varying threshold, which is adjusted to the output error. The other is an additional dynamic auxiliary variable, which is described by a differential equation. The DETM makes communication data be transmitted periodically to reduce computation and communication resources. Second, based on the proposed DETM, a new event-triggered reliable dissipative filter is designed to subject to the asynchronous constraint of the membership function. By constructing the Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are developed to ensure asymptotic stability and strict dissipativity of the filtering error system. Finally, the given simulation example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In the field of fuzzy sets, distance measures can effectively quantify the relevant uncertainty. Regarding hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), improved hesitant fuzzy distance measures have recently been proposed by fusing classical distance measures with hesitation degrees, and the corresponding information enrichment can be probabilistically advanced to pursue new distance measures of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets (PHFSs). Aiming at PHFSs, the improved distance measures of HFSs are simulated and extended in this paper, and thus improved distance measures of PHFSs are proposed; the new PHFSs distances are utilized to construct a new method of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy decision-making, called MEREC-TODIM. Firstly, the new probabilistic hesitant fuzzy Hamming distance and Euclidean distance are directly and parametrically established by incorporating hesitation degrees; accordingly, the improved distance measures exhibit a $$2\times 2$$ system on (non-parameter, parameter) and (Hamming, Euclidean), and their distance property, measure size, parameter monotonicity, and promotion degeneration are investigated and acquired. Furthermore, a modified score function is proposed for MEREC to determine attribute weights, and thus a corresponding decision method with TODIM (i.e., MEREC-TODIM) is established for PHFSs applications on evaluation sorting and optimization selection. Finally, MEREC-TODIM is validated through parameter analyses and decision comparisons, and it is effectively applied to two practical examples: Carbon Capture Utilization Storage and PhD Admission Interviews.},

The goal is to invest in renewable energy in the most efficient way to meet rising energy demand and reduce the challenges posed by climate change. However, decision makers must carefully weigh various factors when selecting the most appropriate renewable energy investment projects. This paper presents a novel method for Multi-Attribute Decision Making(MADM) that uses the Bipolar Complex Fuzzy(BCF) to convey the vagueness and uncertainty of decision makers, so that the result obtained better reflects the actual scenario and the subjective biases of decision makers. We defined BCF Einstein Weighted Averaging (BCFEWA) operator and BCF Einstein Ordered Weighted Averaging (BCFEOWA) operator to aggregate evaluation information. Then we discussed some properties of the proposed aggregation operators. Additionally, we present an integrated MADM technique grounded in the BCF framework that combines the CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) and ELECTRE III methods. Specifically, the CRITIC method determines attribute weights, and the ELECTRE III method ranking the alternatives to determine the best renewable energy investment projects. After analysing the results and comparisons, it can be inferred that the suggested methodology offers an effective evaluation process.},

  abstract     = {The remote sensing satellite observation process involves multiple stakeholders and significant costs, so selecting an appropriate observation scheme and reaching an agreement on the chosen scheme among the evaluators/stakeholders is essential. From this perspective, the observation scheme selection problem can be viewed as a large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) problem, challenging due to its complex group composition and the high consensus level required. Accordingly, this paper investigates an adaptive bi-directional consensus model that incorporates the evolution of social influence to address the LSGDM problem. Firstly, the dual-attribute affinity propagation algorithm is employed to divide the large-group into manageable subgroups. Secondly, the social influence evolution model is established, where evaluators’ social influences are determined by considering their opinion similarity and trust level, and subgroups’ social influences are updated by measuring their decision risk. Thirdly, the bi-directional feedback mechanism is designed to adaptively generate adjustment strategies corresponding to different scenarios based on the evolution model. Finally, an observation scheme selection case is analyzed using the proposal to demonstrate its practicality. During the process of remote sensing satellite observation, the selection of an appropriate observation scheme can optimize the utilization of existing satellite resources and ensure the quality of satellite observation services, thereby better meeting the demands of diverse application areas such as environmental monitoring, disaster management, and urban planning.},

The quadratic boundedness (QB) technique is employed to depict the closed-loop stability of the concerned networked control systems (NCSs). Two adequate theorems are given based on Lyapunov stability theory for designing the observer-based and dynamic output feedback-based controllers, which guarantee the stability and robust performance of the required system.

Existing literature on nursing homes primarily focuses on influenza and general public health emergencies, neglecting preventive policies for highly infectious and less curable diseases. With limited treatment options and vaccines for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, exploring preventive strategies becomes crucial. This study addresses the research gap by utilizing the fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) method, including the fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)—based analytic network process, fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). Methodological enhancements, such as integrating fuzzy importance-performance analysis and fuzzy DANP into a 2D matrix, are proposed. The study also considers resource acquisition and technical difficulty, leading to fuzzy multidimensional importance-performance analysis. Incorporating the theory of inventive problem-solving (TRIZ) into FMCDM addresses practical solution gaps from previous evaluations. The study provides pertinent recommendations for academic and related institutions to enhance preventive strategies and contingency policies for highly infectious diseases in nursing homes and healthcare facilities. The research contributes methodological advancements and practical insights by integrating fuzzy decision-making methods and TRIZ, facilitating the development of effective preventive measures and policies.},

This paper introduces a multi-agent trading system to achieve this goal, termed QF-FRL, based on quantum finance and fuzzy reinforcement learning (QF-FRL). The system comprises two agents: (1) The trading agent, constructed using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). This agent employs a Denoising Auto Encoder (DAE) to extract stock representations from historical time series data. The trading agent initially employed the DDPG model, which was subsequently supplanted by the TD3 model. It integrates traditional financial technology indicators, like moving averages, with modern deep reinforcement learning technology to generate buying and selling signals for determining the optimal strategy. (2) The risk control agent, founded on quantum finance and an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system. This agent merges the QPL indicator with a fuzzy risk control method to ascertain transaction amounts. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy system, aiming to enhance profits and ensure accuracy in transactions at specific amounts. The experiments in this study involved selecting nine stocks and testing them against seven competing quantitative trading models. Upon comparing the profit rate, trading frequency, Sharpe ratio, and average return of each stock, eight stocks within the QF-FRL system achieved the highest returns and a greater number of transactions. Additionally, the QF-FRL system has also attained the highest average return and the second highest average Sharpe ratio. The results indicate that QF-FRL outperforms competing models, yielding higher profits and being particularly suitable for long-term investment. Moreover, it exhibits more favorable risk-adjusted returns and a notable degree of robustness.},

Initially the fractal dimension method is used and analyzed single abnormal gene structure with the help of box counting method where the grids are segmented into triangles. Further the analysis is enhanced through grid and triangular method of improved box counting methods named as Ruby Triangular dimension which is the novelty of the research. Comparison of Grid Dimension with Triangular Dimension based fractal and fuzzy fractal dimension in the severity of disease from its secondary structure of the disorder related genes structures are performed. Further the complexity of the Single Abnormal Gene structure evaluated to generate a unique Attractor for the prediction of the α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia disorder in earlier diagnosis, refer as bifurcation theory. The results shows that the triangular Ruby Dimension based improved box counting method facilitate quick with more exactitude.

This paper studies how to evaluate and allocate the cooperation payoff when the players cooperate partially. Different from previous research that directly uses the cooperation level to calculate the payoffs of fuzzy coalitions, we introduce the concept of dual fuzzy cooperative games, where the payoffs of fuzzy coalitions equal the difference between the original payoff and the lost payoff caused by the decline of the cooperation level. Meanwhile, the dual Shapley value is introduced, and its axiomatic systems are studied. Further, a special kind of dual fuzzy cooperative game with Choquet integral form is presented. Finally, we provide an application of dual fuzzy cooperative games in the manufacturer–retailer supply chain to allocate the payoff for vertical co-op advertising.},

  abstract     = {The additive ratio assessment system (ARAS) method is an effective technique for simplifying complex decision problems by determining the optimal alternative through the relative index (utility degree) to the ideal solution. However, there are still some shortcomings in the existing researches on the extension of this method when it is utilized in different decision environments, such as ignoring the correlation relationship between attributes, the lack of flexibility in the utilization of the decision process, and the relative index to the ideal solution may be scaled up or down with the ratio form. In order to overcome these disadvantages, this paper proposes the novel T-spherical fuzzy (TSF) cross entropy (TSFCE) measure and T-spherical Aczel-Alsina Heronian mean (TSFAAHM) aggregation operators and uses them to improve the ARAS method in the TSF environment. For the TSF multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems, a group decision making model based on the improved ARAS is designed. In this model, the experts’ weights are obtained by the TSFCE-based similarity measure. The attribute combined weights are calculated by fusing the objective weights obtained by TSFCE-based entropy measure and the subjective weights got by the extended stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) integrated with TSFCE. In the improved ARAS method, the T-spherical Aczel-Alsina Weighted Heronian mean (TSFAAWHM) operator can capture the correlation relationship between the attributes. Compared with the relative index, the TSFCE can reflect the difference between the alternatives and the ideal solution to obtain a more stable solution ranking. Lastly, an illustrative example about the sustainable supplier selection of power battery echelon utilization (PBEU) for a 5G base station is used to demonstrate the proposed method. The effectiveness, practicability and superiority of proposed method are illustrated by parameters influence and methods comparison analysis.},

However, more important factors need to be improved first to avoid excessive increases in costs. Thus, a priority analysis needs to be carried out to determine the variables that most affect the performance of technology investments. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the investments of digital twin technologies for virtual energy market in the Metaverse. A novel artificial intelligence-based fuzzy decision-making model is constructed to reach this objective. Firstly, the expert choices are prioritized with artificial intelligence-based decision-making method. Secondly, the investment priorities are analyzed for digital twin technologies with quantum picture fuzzy rough sets (QPFRS)-based Multi Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (M-SWARA). Finally, the alternatives for virtual energy market in the metaverse are ranked by VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje). There are limited studies in the literature that computes the weights of the experts while generating a decision-making model. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is integrating the artificial intelligence approach and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodology. Within this scope, an artificial intelligence-based application is performed when creating the decision matrix. Owing to this issue, the importance weights of experts are determined according to the qualifications of these people. This situation contributes to the results obtained being more realistic. The findings demonstrate that operational performance is the most important indicator for the improvements of the digital twin technology investments for virtual energy markets in metaverse platform because it has the greatest weight (0.267). Furthermore, integrated data production is another critical factor for the performance increase of these projects with the weight of 0.257. It is also concluded that optimization of energy consumption with smart grids has the best ranking performance among the alternatives.},

As a fundamental component of Granular Computing, information granules play an important role in human-centric computing, such as human cognition and decision-making. Driven by the concerns of data privacy and confidentiality, it is of interest to investigate how to construct information granules on the basis of horizontally partitioned numeric data distributed across different sites using a privacy-preserving approach. To meet this challenge, federated learning has become an appealing solution to the problem of forming meaningful clusters (information granules) while ensuring data privacy and confidentiality. A two-development strategy is applied in the proposed algorithm: first, a collection of numeric representatives (prototypes) is obtained with the use of federated Gustafson–Kessel algorithm, which is able to reveal ellipsoidal shapes in the datasets and second, information granules are built through engaging the principle of justifiable granularity. A series of experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed federated Gustafson-Kessel algorithm in revealing the structure of the entire dataset. The formed ellipsoidal information granules help us gain a better insight into the topology of the overall dataset.},

Hierarchical structure, among others, has become a representative one, which is mathematically depicted as a tree-like structure or directed acyclic graph. Most studies in the literature focus on static feature selection in hierarchical information system. In this study, in order to solve the incremental feature selection problem of hierarchical classification in a dynamic environment, we develop two incremental algorithms for this purpose (IHFSGR-1 and IHFSGR-2 for short). As a preliminary step, we propose a new uncertainty measure to quantify the amount of information contained in the hierarchical classification system, and based on this, we develop a non-incremental hierarchical feature selection algorithm. Next, we investigate the updating mechanism of this uncertainty measure upon the arrival of samples, and propose two strategies for adding and deleting features, leading to the development of two incremental algorithms. Finally, we conduct some comparative experiments with several non-incremental algorithms. The experimental results suggest that compared with several non-incremental algorithms, our incremental algorithms can achieve better performance in terms of the classification accuracy and two hierarchical evaluation metrics, and can significantly accelerate the fuzzy rough set-based hierarchical feature selection.},

Incomplete fuzzy formal context is employed to present the uncertainty or lack of memberships between individuals and attributes. Acceptable implications and necessary implications are two types of implications that assess the validity of knowledge within incomplete formal contexts. On the one hand, attribute exploration approaches within incomplete formal contexts rely on the prior knowledge of experts. On the other hand, in the existing reasoning mechanism for acceptable implications and necessary implications, the bases are inconvenient as they recursively involve the bases of all the completions of the incomplete formal context. Another critical issue is that the inference rules, originally apply to the implications in formal contexts, may yield invalid implications when they are applied to the two types of implications. In this paper, we firstly discretize incomplete fuzzy formal context into incomplete formal context by employing a dual-threshold filter function and then model the incomplete formal context by two specially constructed decision contexts. Next, we re-represent acceptable implications and necessary implications based on decision implications and demonstrate that the inference rules Augmentation and Combination, initially designed for decision implications, are practicable for necessary implications and acceptable implications. Furthermore, we utilize Augmentation, Combination, and another inference rule Reflexivity to jointly define the completeness and non-redundancy for sets of necessary implications and that of acceptable implications. Finally, we establish necessary implication basis and acceptable implication basis, which preserve all the information implied in the two types of implications while simultaneously minimizing the total number of implications.},

  abstract     = {The Adaptative neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has shown great potential in processing practical data from control, prediction, and inference applications, reflecting advantages in both high performance and system interpretability as a result of the hybridization of neural networks and fuzzy systems. Matlab has been a prevalent platform that allows to utilize and deploy ANFIS conveniently. On the other hand, due to the recent popularity of machine learning and deep learning, which are predominantly Python-based, implementations of ANFIS in Python have attracted recent attention. Although there are a few Python-based ANFIS implementations, none of them are directly compatible with scikit-learn, one of the most frequently used libraries in machine learning. As such, this paper proposes Scikit-ANFIS, a novel scikit-learn compatible Python implementation for ANFIS by adopting a uniform format such as fit() and predict() functions to provide the same interface as scikit-learn. Our Scikit-ANFIS is designed in a user-friendly way to not only manually generate a general fuzzy system and train it with the ANFIS method but also to automatically create an ANFIS fuzzy system. We also provide four kinds of representative cases to show that Scikit-ANFIS represents a valuable addition to the scikit-learn compatible Python software that supports ANFIS fuzzy reasoning. Experimental results on four datasets show that our Scikit-ANFIS outperforms recent Python-based implementations while achieving parallel performance to ANFIS in Matlab, a standard implementation officially realized by Matlab, which indicates the performance advantages and application convenience of our software.},

  abstract     = {As a powerful tool for depicting uncertain information, hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs) have been favored by many experts and scholars. Consequently, the aggregation of HFEs plays an imperative role in both theory and practice. Although there exist many kinds of hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators nowadays, limitations and irrationality still exist because they cannot satisfy some basic properties of a valid aggregation operator, such as idempotency and boundedness. Motivated by this case, this article aims to develop some novel hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators for handling HFEs that can satisfy three basic properties of a reliable aggregation operator. We first define two normalized operations on HFEs that avoid crossover operation. Furthermore, we propose some normalized aggregation operators from the perspective of arithmetic aggregation and geometric aggregation respectively. Additionally, we establish a decision-making method based on the proposed aggregation operators. Finally, the feasibility and reliability of the method is illustrated by two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy ranking plays a vital role in decision-making problems and various fuzzy applications. There are plenty of ranking methods that are used to rank fuzzy numbers. However, they fail to give satisfactory results in certain situations due to the complexity of the problem. In this present study, an attempt has been made to introduce four types of ranking methods in the field of intuitionistic dense fuzzy (IDF) depending on centroid and graded mean ranking. Also, arithmetic operations based on $$\lambda _1, \lambda _2$$ -cuts, fuzzy numbers, and extension principles are defined for IDF environment. A model is framed to rank MCDM problems, which are aggregated using a weighted aggregation operator and ordered using the proposed and extended ranking methods. To illustrate the proposed MCDM model under the field of IDF, the problem of robot selection is taken for war fighter robots and exoskeleton robots to help and replace humans in war and help assistive walking patients with spinal cord injuries. The result reveals that the Ripsaw and Rewalk emerge as preferable options for substituting humans in the contexts of war fighters and exoskeleton robots, respectively. To analyze the effectiveness of the ranking results, comparative and sensitivity analyses are examined. Thus, the results provide a satisfactory output.},

  abstract     = {The research on decision making driven by product rankings faces challenges due to the rise of extensive positive reviews and the widespread distribution of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) across multiple platforms. There is a limited body of research that examines the impact of platform credibility on the quality of product rankings. Hence, based on the basic uncertain linguistic information (BULI), which enables simultaneous representation of information and its credibility, we investigate the development of a ratings aggregation approach for cross-platform distribution (CPD) with the aim of facilitating decision-making processes, focusing specifically on the aspect of credibility. To begin with, this paper introduces the concept of BULI as a means to effectively represent both product ratings and their corresponding levels of credibility. Subsequently, we proceeded to devise the BULI-based aggregation functions that are well suited for the aggregation of CPD ratings and that can be degraded to the existing operator. In addition, we develop a credibility evaluation index system and credibility calculation model for the platform in order to derive a product BULI matrix consisting of ratings and their corresponding levels of credibility. In this study, we propose two models, namely the feature information-based user weighting model and the BULI distance measure-based technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (BULI-TOPSIS) model, to enhance the product ratings aggregation approach for decision-making purposes. The utilization of the proposed method is exemplified through the case study of passenger car ranking, showcasing its practicality and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Evaluation and prioritization are indispensable for selecting the appropriate FWTT (food waste treatment technique). Previous research shows that the decision methods are suitable for selecting FWTTs. Nevertheless, current literature on choosing FWTTs seldom considers the impact of experts’ bounded rational behavior and interactive criteria, especially with uncertain information. This article proposes a q-ROFS (q-rung orthopair fuzzy set)-generalized TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making method)-based hybrid framework for coping with the selection problem of FWTTs. In the information fusion process, the fuzziness and ambiguity of information are expressed by the q-ROFS. Then, the q-ROFS-CRITIC (criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation) method is introduced to calculate the criteria weights considering the interactive criteria. Next, the q-ROFS-generalized TODIM framework is presented to rank the alternative techniques considering the experts’ bounded rational behavior. Finally, a real case of selecting FWTTs with q-ROFSs is performed to examine the applicability and feasibility of this framework. The result shows that the alternative $$f_{2}$$ (anaerobic digestion) has the highest priority for food waste treatment with the largest overall dominance degree value. After that, a sensitivity study of different parameters and comparative analysis with similar selection methods are organized to elaborate on the reasonability of the provided framework.},

Herein, the fractional-order calculus was used to obtain the goal of the stability design. To meet the goal of the construction of the master and slave, the fractional-order chaotic system was used. First, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy was used to remodel the master and slave systems with support of the Grunwald–Letnikov approximation technique from continuous time to discrete time domain. Second, the DO was equipped to the slave system to reject the unwanted on both public channels and uncertain values on the master and slave sides. Third, the sliding mode control was designed based on the given stability theorem. Fourth, the stability was provided based on Lyapunov condition.

The filter being studied is prone to a non-stationary Markovian process when both quantization output and deception attack are taken into account simultaneously. It is proposed to implement an asynchronous IT2 fuzzy filter characterized by two different piecewise-stationary Markov chains specifying the deception attacks and the modes of the system. A new event-triggering protocol (ETP) is investigated as a means of reducing unnecessary signal transmissions on the communication channel. Based on the linear matrix inequality analysis and using the information on upper and lower membership functions, it is demonstrated that stochastic sufficient conditions exist for the desired filter such that it exhibits mean square stability and achieves the prescribed mixed $$H_\infty $$ and passivity performance index. Moreover, an optimization-based problem for computing filter gains is proposed. An experimental numerical illustration based on a truck-trailer system is used to validate the developed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In practical decision-making, linguistic term set is a useful tool to describe the uncertainty and fuzziness of data sources. However, in some decisions, when the data source is unreliable or the decision involves future factors, the evaluation given by the linguistic term set will have a certain degree of error. This paper proposes a binary risk linguistic set based on linguistic term set and R-set. The binary risk linguistic set considers the linguistic term set and the risk factors that may lead to errors in language evaluation. In order to facilitate the use of binary risk linguistic set, the risk conversion function and operational laws are introduced. Next, since group decision-making involves multiple experts, considering the social relations between experts, a method to estimate the missing values in the social network matrix is proposed by utilizing the trust intensity propagation operator and the relationship intensity propagation operator. Risk perception can reflect the subjective judgment of experts on the characteristics and severity of a particular risk, and different judgment results can reflect the attitude of experts to risk. Hereby, this study proposes a risk clustering method based on the risk perception of experts. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weight updating method based on social network matrix. Then, a binary risk linguistic fuzzy behavioral TOPSIS method is proposed to deal with the multi-attribute large-scale group decision-making (MALSGDM) problem. Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented method, and its effectiveness is validated through comparison with other MALSGDM methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, this study also perform sensitivity and stability assessments of the decision-makers’ weight and behavior characteristics.},

In addition, the command filtered method is utilized to conquer the ‘explosion of complexity’ emerged in the classic backstepping method and the error compensation mechanism is adopted to diminish the error generated by filtering process. Further, the impact of actuator failures is dealt with based on fault-tolerant control. It is proven that the designed controllers not only assure the semi-global boundedness of all the controlled system signals, but also make the output tracking error is preserved in a specified prescribed performance within a finite-time interval.

  abstract     = {An essential component of case-based reasoning (CbR) is the similarity function. The existence of incorrect similarity values, one of the primary issues of similarity function, occurs when two cases seem to have a lot in similarity but actually differ greatly from one another. The aim of this study is to suggest a fuzzy similarity function that might be used with CbR, which has been executed in three primary phases. Firstly, a knowledge base is created. Secondly, the inference engines are created. To determine fuzzy similarity values, the proposed approach employs Graded Mean Integration Representation (GMIR), which takes into consideration the impact of each evidence on the case. Finally, model testing is determined by comparing GMIR with the additive function and additive weighting and using them as the sensitivity test. A comparison of similarity methods was carried out using the k-NN, Euclidean, and Pearson similarity. Expert evaluation carries out external validity checking. The degree of similarity between the CbR output solution and the expert solution is determined using the Intuitive Fuzzy Weighted Arithmetic Mean (IFWAM). The results demonstrate that the GMIR function applied with thresholds of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 provides the fewest instances of similar cases when compared to the additive and additive weighting approaches. GMIR is able to provide a variety of alternatives using the threshold value. IFWAM performs 93.33% when used in 15 test scenarios, and only one of the solutions from the CbR output differs from that offered by the pshycologs. The main reason is the challenge of selecting keywords for every item of evidence provided. When CbR’s validity was examined, it was also demonstrated that IFWAM was reliable in estimating the degree of similarity between CbR output and expert solutions.},

  abstract     = {Intuitionistic fuzzy sets have been widely studied and applied as an important means of dealing with information uncertainty. However, the existing intuitionistic fuzzy sets and their extension methods are limited and single in their fuzzy spatial representation of information. Under this environment, this paper proposes a new generalized fuzzy set, called qth Rung Root Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (q-RROFS). Since the q-RROFS can adjust the range of fuzzy space expression by the parameter q, it is superior to intuitionistic fuzzy sets, SR-fuzzy sets, and CR-fuzzy sets. We give some definitions and properties of q-RROFS and give their proofs. Under the q-RROFS, we give its operations and properties and introduce four new weighted aggregation operators, namely, qth Rung Root Orthopair Fuzzy-weighted average operator (q-RROFWA), qth Rung Root Orthopair Fuzzy-weighted geometric operator (q-RROFWG), qth Rung Root Orthopair Fuzzy-weighted power average operator (q-RROFWPA), and qth Rung Root Orthopair Fuzzy-weighted power geometric operator (q-RROFWPG). We discuss the properties of these operators in detail and follow the proof procedure. Then, we give a Multi-criteria decision-making approach under q-RROFS. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology through practical application examples and comparisons with other methods.},

  abstract     = {The theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) plays an essential role to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity. However, the IFSs deal only with anticipation, not periodicity. But, complex IFSs (CIFS) can handle both uncertainties and periodicity at a time. Therefore, this paper focuses on a new multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach using Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator in connection with the CIFS setting. Then, we develop some CIF partitioned based MSM (CIFPMSM) operators and their weighted form by considering that all the criteria can be arranged into some groups. The proposed operators not only deal with the interrelationship among criteria but also deal with the partitioned relationship among criteria. We discuss the properties of these proposed operators and investigate their cases. Finally, a decision-making approach for radio frequency identification (RFID) for manufacturing companies is developed based on the proposed operators and compared the results with the existing method to show the application and feasibility of the proposed method.},

An AQPSO algorithm is proposed to train and optimize the SOIT2FNN soft sensor model&#39;s structure and parameters in order to improve forecasting accuracy. Firstly the number of rules and parameters of SOIT2FNN are mapped to the spatial position of each particle of AQPSO, which is convenient for the parameter and structure optimization of the network model. The weighted average optimal position and the adaptive shrinkage coefficient are introduced in order to enhance the global search ability of PSO and ensure the robustness and convergence of the algorithm during the optimization process. By dynamically adjusting the network structure, the network size of each particle approximates the network size of an ideal particle, thereby improving the search efficiency and optimization results of the model. Finally, the proposed AQPSO-SOIT2FNN was applied to the Mackey–Glass chaotic time series prediction and soft sensor modeling of total phosphorus in wastewater treatment effluent. The results of the experiments show that the proposed AQPSO-SOIT2FNN is capable of producing a relatively compact network topology with high identification and prediction accuracy. address uncertainty satisfactorily, which is computationally more implementable.},

  abstract     = {Rough fuzzy K-means (RFKM) decomposes data into clusters using partial memberships by underlying structure of incomplete information, which emphasizes the uncertainty of objects located in cluster boundary. In this scheme, the settings of cluster boundary merely depend on subjective judgment of perceptual experience. When confronted with the data exhibiting heavily overlap and imbalance, the boundary regions obtained by existing empirical schemes vary greatly accompanied by skewing of cluster center, which exerts considerable influence on the accuracy and stability of RFKM. This paper seeks to analyze and address this deficiency and then proposes an improved rough fuzzy K-means clustering based on parametric decision-theoretic shadowed set (RFKM-DTSS). Three-way approximation is implemented by incorporating a novel fuzzy entropy into the decision-theoretic shadowed set, which rationalizes cluster boundary through minimizing fuzzy entropy loss. Under the secondary adjustment method and improved update strategy of cluster center, the proposed RFKM-DTSS is thus featured by a powerful processing ability on class overlap and imbalance commonly seen in scenarios, such as fault detection and medical diagnosis with unclear decision boundaries. The effectiveness and robustness of the RFKM-DTSS are verified by the results of comparative experiments, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

The fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate unknown functions, and a fuzzy state observer is built to estimate the unavailable states. Meanwhile, an improved hysteresis quantizer is introduced to achieve the quantized inputs for saving communication resources. To improve the approximation capacities of fuzzy logic systems, the compensated tracking errors and the prediction errors are used to construct the adaptive laws parameters. Furthermore, a composite adaptive fault-tolerant fuzzy control strategy is developed, which can guarantee proper operations of the systems when encountering actuator faults, and overcome the issue of “explosion of complexity” in the backstepping approach. It is strictly demonstrated that the system output can follow a desired signal within a small error zone and all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, the simulation results are given to confirm the validity of the presented control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle hydraulic braking systems are widely used, structurally complex. Reliability allocation during the design phase is crucial, yet there is a relatively limited body of research on this subject. In response, a new method for vehicle hydraulic braking system is proposed: the comprehensive reliability allocation method based on partial fuzzy ratings and considering failure correlation (CRA-PFRAFC). Based on the analysis of reliability allocation criteria impacting the braking system, the fuzzy set theory is introduced into the comprehensive allocation method, and the criteria with strong subjective dependence are fuzzy evaluated. The braking system allocation model is established by Gumbel Copula function. According to the set reliability target, the model is solved to allocate the failure rates to each subsystem according to the allocation vector. An example illustrates the advantages of this method. The results show that the reliability of the brake assembly is the lowest, while the reliability of the vacuum booster system is the highest. By fuzzy rating the failure severity and failure occurrence, the subjective quantification problem in traditional method is avoided. Meanwhile, compared with the traditional subsystem independent assumption model, this method is more realistic, and the failure rate of subsystem allocation is increased by 20% on average. Therefore, this study provides necessary and effective theoretical basis for reducing the design and manufacturing costs of vehicle hydraulic braking systems.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate losses from public health emergencies, promptly choosing an emergency medical supply distribution center is essential. The success of rescues hinges on the center’s location. Location decision for such centers is fraught with uncertainty and risk, complicating the task for decision makers (DMs). Often, DMs operate under bounded rationality in urgent situations. In response, this paper introduces a novel fuzzy multicriteria decision-making approach, integrating interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) effect, and cumulative prospect theory, to address the uncertainty and risk in decision-making. The method begins by introducing the NIMBY effect to construct the evaluation criteria system of emergency medical supply distribution centers. Next, the alternative under the evaluation criteria is evaluated by fuzzy linguistic terms and interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used to determine the weight of each DM by calculating the relative scores of advantage and disadvantage. The criteria weight is determined via a combination of fuzzy network analysis and the entropy weight method. Cumulative prospect theory is then employed to rank site selections, factoring in DM risk preferences. The approach is tested on an emergency medical supply distribution center location for sensitivity and comparative analysis, proving its efficacy and stability. This research presents an innovative fuzzy model for evaluating emergency medical supply distribution center site selection in uncertain conditions, suggesting the need to incorporate multiple dimensions such as realistic criteria systems, uncertain decision information, and variable environments in such decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {The lives of humans working in hazardous fields are often at risk. Therefore, replacing humans with robots can help to reduce the mortality rate. Hence, this work considers four dangerous operations, namely, earthquake rescue, fire rescue, water rescue and bomb disposal operation, and determines the most wanted field for the replacement of robots concerning their death rate. The fields’ prioritization is examined using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models. Since the alternatives (fields) lack information with respect to the criteria, this work utilizes the sub-alternatives (field performer) to fill in the information of the alternatives in order to prioritize the fields and detect the impact of the robots in the field. When uncertainty prevails in crisp data, the MCDM methods are generally considered in a fuzzy environment. The intuitionistic trapezoidal dense fuzzy (ITpDF) set which is one of the extensions of fuzzy set is dealt here. Considering the MCDM models such as extended PSI, COCOSO, PIV and MARCOS in the ITpDF field, the integrated ITpDF–PSI–COCOSO–PIV–MARCOS model is framed, where the final ITpDF score values from each considered models are aggregated using the Bonferroni mean aggregation method. The aggregated ITpDF score values are defuzzified and ranked using the novel ITpDF incircle ranking. The result reveals that earthquake rescue robots have a lesser impact compared to robots utilized in bomb disposal operations. Finally, the sensitivity and comparative analysis are performed to find the effectiveness of the model and the quality of the outcome, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Trust network analysis has been widely applied in various fields, such as group recommendation, group decision-making and other related areas. In this paper, we focus on obtaining the complete trust network in which experts express their trust relationships for another with a single linguistic term or distribution assessments of a linguistic term set. We first discuss the conditions of obtaining the complete trust network, and the propagation and aggregation of the trust relationships with a single linguistic term. Since the linguistic term set may be symmetric and uniform, symmetric and non-uniform, or asymmetric and non-uniform, we translate linguistic terms into numerical indexes and define the propagation operator based on the semantics of the linguistic term and the Archimedean t-norm. The propagation result is translated to 2−tuple linguistic model because it may not exist in the initial linguistic term set. Some properties are proposed to verify that the proposed operator is compatible with human thought. Then the 2−tuple distribution assessments on a linguistic term set are defined, and the other aggregation operator is proposed to propagate linguistic distribution assessment trust relationships. The second aggregation operator focuses on both the aggregation of linguistic terms and symbolic proportions of linguistic terms and is a generalization of the first operator. Finally, a numerical example of CouchSurfing comparative analyses further demonstrates that the proposed operators are effective and reasonable, and can consider the different semantics of a linguistic term in practical application.},

  abstract     = {How to reasonably distribute the final payoffs to each enterprise alliance participating in cooperation is one of the hottest issues in cooperative game problems. Notably, existing scholarly investigations addressing such problems often overlook the disparate contributions made by individual players to the alliance, opting instead to assign same distribution weights to all participants. Obviously, it is inconsistent with the realistic cooperative game scenario and may cause inequitable payoffs distribution in the cooperative game. In this paper, we proposed a novel combination approach aimed at obtaining the value of payoffs distribution that aligns more closely with actual circumstances. Firstly, we obtain the initial Shapley values of cooperative game alliances and construct the weighted normalized aggregated q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy decision matrix. Subsequently, the Borda-MULTIMOORA method is employed to calculate correction coefficients that can reflect the enterprises’ contributions to the alliance within the cooperative game, thereby enhancing the fairness of the allocation process. Ultimately, the availability and superiority of proposed payoffs distribution model is verified by a numerical example of three new energy sharing electric vehicle companies.},

Uncertainty measurement and attribute reduction of TFISs-2 are key issues when describing and analyzing complex fuzzy data. However, existing researches mainly focus on the traditional fuzzy data, and seldom consider type-2 fuzzy data. This paper focuses on finding an effective indicator to measure the uncertainty of TFISs-2, and carries out the research of attribute reduction based on this indicator. Firstly, the weighted membership distance and the weighted membership similarity are defined, which are used to describe the relation between two objects in TIFSs-2, and $$\sigma $$ similarity relations are introduced. Secondly, a fuzzy neighborhood structure is defined based on $$\sigma $$ similarity relations. The classical rough set model is extended on TFISs-2, and the definitions of upper and lower approximation, accuracy and roughness are given. Then, a novel indicator called $$\sigma $$ self-information is used to describe the uncertainty of TFISs-2, and a heuristic greedy selection attribute reduction algorithm is proposed. Finally, the experimental results show that the constructed uncertainty measurement indicator is suitable for TFISs-2, and the proposed attribute reduction method is effective. This study is beneficial to promote the understanding of complex fuzzy data, and contributes to the data analysis and processing of TFISs-2.},

  abstract     = {Many attempts have been made to generalize the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) like Pythagorean (PFS), q-rung orthopair (q-OFS), and linear Diophantine (LDFS). However, these generalizations have many advantages and disadvantages. Among the disadvantages, the main concern with these sets is that they cannot capture the situation where both or at least one of the memberships and non-membership grades are equal to 1. Secondly, how to reduce the dependency between the membership and non-membership grades. Thus, any data in the form X = {&lt; x1; (1,0.9) &gt; , &lt; x2; (0.3,1) &gt; , &lt; x3; (1,1) &gt;} is not handled by the IFS and other versions of IFS because 1 + 0.9 = 1.9 &gt; 1, 0.3 + 1 = 1.3 &gt; 1, and 1 + 1 = 2 &gt; 1. We propose the new idea of the q-fractional fuzzy set ( $$qf_{r} s$$ ), which can handle all such situations, using the q-intercept of the straight line and letting both membership and non-membership grades approach 100% without depending on each other. The q = 2 is the smallest value for which all the situations in the first quadrant are tackled, and the sum of membership and non-membership grades is near 1. For all other values of q &gt; 2, the sum of membership and non-membership grades approaches 0, i.e., the larger the value of q, i.e., the intercepts, the sum of memberships and non-membership grades approaches 0. For q = 1, the first intercept is simply the intuitionistic fuzzy set. We provide the basic properties of the q-fractional fuzzy set using the extension principle of fuzzy sets and develop some aggregation operators. We also developed a new q-fractional fuzzy neural network and provided an example.},

IF aggregation operator is a popular data processing method that can be used for data dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, data compression, and so on. Some existing MCGDM techniques based on IF aggregation operators have been criticized for reasons that include disregarding the comprehensive correlations of the criteria and ignoring the monotonicity of the decision information. This paper aims to construct some IF aggregation operators based on Yager’s triangular norms and Heronian mean to shed light on decision-making issues. At first, some novel IF operations such as Yager sum, Yager product, and Yager scalar multiplication on IFSs are presented. Based on these new operations, the generalized IF Yager Heronian average (GIFYHA) operator and the generalized IF Yager weighted Heronian average (GIFYWHA) operator are proposed and their corresponding properties are also proved in detail. Then, an improved MCGDM algorithm is constructed that relies on suggested operators. Its effectiveness and applicability are verified by applying it to select the best location for a company. In addition, the sensitivity of the parameters in the proposed operator to decision findings is also discussed. Finally, the comparative analysis of the proposed operator with the existing operators shows that the proposed operator is suitable for aggregating IF information with correlations both on “non-empty lattice” and total orders on IF values.},

According to fusion function which contains the error in joint angular velocity and position, the cost function is established. The integral reinforcement learning (IRL) is integrated into the VI algorithm, which solves the optimal tracking control issue without system drift dynamics. For purpose of improving the control effect, the optimal tracking control issue of manipulator can be reconsidered as the optimal compensation issue which adopting the local dynamics information. Then the uncertainty in the model can be compensated by an adaptive fuzzy backstepping compensation controller which is constructed by fuzzy logic system (FLS) and backstepping control method. The optimal compensation control strategy is adopted to deal with the interconnected dynamic coupling (IDC), which contains global information about each joint. Based on the VI algorithm and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method, an effective solution of Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is presented. According to Lyapunov theorem, the trajectory tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) by using the adaptive fuzzy backstepping optimal control method.

In particular, the event-triggered threshold (ETT) is dynamically regulated in line with system information, and not only the data from the plant to the filter but also that from the filter to the plant, are both quantized using different logarithmic quantizers. Second, the hybrid cyber-attacks platform is adopted, of which including the random deception attacks (DAs), random replay attacks (RAs) and DoS attack. Third, leveraging the principles of Lyapunov theory, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the exponential admissibility (EA) of the resulting error dynamics and their adherence to a prescribed $$\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$$ performance index. Through the utilization of several matrix inequalities, the desired filtering gains are given. Finally, the effectiveness of the achieved results is demonstrated by two examples.},

  abstract     = {Predefined performance control (PPC) has been applied to many engineering fields, such as unmanned aerial vehicle, emergency braking, and so on. Note that above engineering applications have the characteristic of hysteresis, which results in degraded performance for most existing PPC schemes. This paper investigates the problem of PPC for stochastic nonlinear systems with hysteresis input. Different from existing PPC schemes, an improved finite-time performance function is introduced to select the desired convergence time flexibly. By incorporating an intermediate parameter into the controller, a novel control design framework is presented to adaptively compensate hysteresis input. Besides, the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the systems are approximated by fuzzy logic systems, and the computational complexity problem is reduced by using dynamic surface control technique. Then, the proposed control scheme ensures that tracking error converges to the specific region, which can be set arbitrarily within the physical limitations. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of proposed scheme.},

However, to stabilize this type of system, feedback linearization techniques and complex adaptive schemes usually need to be adopted. This paper focuses on the stabilization of uncertain fractional-order (FO) systems with unmeasurable states, external disturbances, and time delays, where certain “IF-THEN” rules based on an FO T–S model are proposed to describe FO systems. A new FO $$H_\infty$$ performance model is established to provide stabilization sufficient conditions. A fuzzy observer is implemented to reconstruct system states, and a feedback controller is established to stabilize the integrated system. Benefiting from a continuous frequency distribution model, the stabilization can be discussed through integer-order stabilization theories, and several stabilization conditions are obtained. Moreover, the proposed control approach avoids the usage of feedback linearization techniques, which effectively reduces the computational complexity.

The large amount of EEG data but the lacks of labeling, multi-feature attribute, and data uncertainty are the difficulties in its recognition problem. A multi-view semi-supervised Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (MV-SS-TSK) fuzzy system is developed for EEG emotion classification in this paper. In the learning of fuzzy system consequent, firstly, a novel joint learning of semi-supervised learning, sparse representation, and low-rank coding is developed for semi-supervised sparse consequent factor learning, which makes the consequent parameter learning as a pseudo-label-only optimization problem. In particular, to simplify fuzzy rules, the sparse constraint term ensures the consequent parameters to be sparse in rows. Secondly, the consequent factor learning in a single feature view is extended into the multi-view learning model. In particular, low-rank coding is considered in multi-view semi-supervised consequent parameter learning. The low-rank constraint on view-shared component of consequent factor is implemented to exploit global data structure. The sparse constraint on view-dependent component of consequent factor is implemented to retain the feature diversity representation. By minimizing the intersection between view-shared component and view-specific components for different views, MV-SS-TSK can take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between various features and capture the consistency from multi-view features.

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness triggered by decreased dopamine secretion. Fuzzy logic has gained substantial attention in PD diagnosis research. PD detection using fuzzy logic has presented more precise outcomes as compared with common machine learning approaches. In this research, a hybrid method combining supervised learning, unsupervised learning and feature selection techniques is developed. In a type-1 fuzzy system, the membership functions used for the fuzzification of the crisp inputs are mapped to single numbers. However, in a type-2 fuzzy system, these numbers are represented as intervals, adding an extra dimension to the definition of the membership function. The first step of the proposed method involves clustering the data using the Expectation–Maximization (EM) technique. The performance of EM clustering is performed using the Davies–Bouldin index. Subsequently, feature selection is performed using the backward stepwise regression. To predict the UPDRS, Type-2 Sugeno fuzzy inference system (T2SFIS) is implemented on the clusters generated from the previous steps. The Parkinson&#39;s telemonitoring dataset is used in this study for method evaluation. Using the EM algorithm, the PD dataset was clustered into 13 segments, and the most important features for accurate UPDRS prediction were chosen in each segment using backward stepwise regression. The hybrid method was evaluated using R-squared (R2) and RMSE. The evaluation results showed that the combination of EM, backward stepwise regression, and type-2 Sugeno FIS obtained the best accuracy in predicting Motor-UPDRS and Total-UPDRS.},

The paper introduces a strategy based on an event-triggered scheme to reduce bandwidth utilization in the NCS by leveraging inherent constraints, including communication time delays and data transmission limitations. The presence of communication time delay leads to an asynchronous interaction between the designed control algorithm for T–S fuzzy systems, which utilizes novel LMI–based conditions, and the proposed T–S fuzzy controller. Additionally, this paper proposes a model of operation based on synchronous behaviour, enabling the design of a linear controller that is more easily implementable. In comparison to recent literature results, these results are obtained by using an associate Lyapunov Krasovskii Function (LKF) with fuzzy properties, in addition to different forms of integral inequalities as alternatives. A fuzzy model for NCSs is illustrated through an example of tracking control for output response.},

Firstly, a state observer with a simplified structure is constructed to approximate the unavailable system states based on fuzzy logic systems. The difficulties caused by time-varying state constraints are effectively addressed in a direct approach via the nonlinear state-dependent functions. Compared to the classical barrier Lyapunov functions-based (BLFs-based) method, the strict condition imposed on the virtual controller is eliminated, which significantly enhances the applicability of the controller in practical systems. Meanwhile, to handle the issue of “explosion of complexity,” a novel adaptive fuzzy tracking control technique is proposed by using the sliding-mode differentiator. Finally, rigorous stability analysis is employed to verify that the error between the system output signal and the reference signal can converge to an arbitrarily small set around the origin, and all closed-loop signals are bounded without time-varying state constraints violation. The effectiveness of the theoretical result is further illustrated by two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {The concept of leveraging knowledge from previous experience to accelerate learning forms the crux of transfer learning. Within the realm of reinforcement learning (RL), the agent typically requires protracted interaction with the environment, which can be time-consuming and can lead to slow convergence. Transfer learning offers a promising solution in such settings. In this paper, we investigate the application of transfer learning in the fuzzy reinforcement learning domain, specifically within the context of differential games. We introduce a novel approach for knowledge transfer across analogous tasks, employing fuzzy logic controllers as function approximators, notably within the Fuzzy Actor-Critic Learning (FACL) algorithm. Specifically, we propose a strategy for fuzzy rule transfer aimed at mapping fuzzy rules between the source and target tasks. The target task is assumed to be related to the source task yet it contains more complex states. Our approach has been implemented and tested within the domain of differential games in which all state space and action space are continuous. The simulation outcomes demonstrate that the application of knowledge transfer enables RL agents to learn faster and achieve asymptotic performance more rapidly in the target task.},

First, an adaptive robust control is investigated which can render the desired servo constraint to be followed even if there exists uncertainty in the system, and through stability analysis by selecting appropriate Lyapunov function which proves uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness of tracking error. The second step is to find a parameter selection guideline for the optimal control parameter. Based on the fuzzy description of system uncertainty, a performance index consisting of system performance and control cost can be developed. Then, the selection of optimal control parameters translates into finding the parameter that makes the performance index minimized.

The fuzzy mask is designed based on the binocular overlap to adjust the weight of the dissimilarity for each pixel. More than 68% of pixels with significant dissimilarity outside binocular overlap are suppressed with weights less than 0.5. The model with the proposed fuzzy mask would focus on learning the depth estimation for pixels within binocular overlap. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the inference of the fuzzy mask only increases the training time of the model by less than 1%, while the number of pixels whose depth is accurately estimated enhances, and the monocular depth estimation also improves.},

  abstract     = {In the paper, an intelligent actor-critic learning control method augmented by a fuzzy broad learning system with output recurrent feedback (abbreviated as ORFBLS) is proposed for obstacle-avoiding trajectory tracking of heterogeneous Mecanum-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robots (HMOMRs) augmented with un-modeled errors and the learning control system’s parameters are changed with the working environment. By using actor-critic learning algorithms and the ORFBLS online function approximation, a new ORFBLS-based actor-critic learning control approach, dubbed as ORFBLS-ACLC, is presented to accomplish stable trajectory tracking of such uncertain HMOMRs. The ORFBLS-ACLC method combined with an obstacle avoidance scheme is presented to follow the desired collision-free trajectory tracking more closely than the existing methods do. The merits, superiority, and practicality of the raised control approach are well verified by carrying out three simulation comparisons and two experiments on an uncertain HMOMR.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel control method for the quadrotor suspension system, addressing the challenges posed by a suspended load, external disturbances, input saturation and model dynamic uncertainty. The primary goal of this method is to achieve precise quadrotor trajectory tracking while minimizing oscillations in the suspended load. To model the system, the Udwadia-Kalaba equation is employed to handle the interaction between the quadrotor and the suspended load. Input saturation is mitigated using the hyperbolic tangent function, and a trapezoidal acceleration algorithm is utilized for trajectory design. To deal with composite disturbances, an adaptive fuzzy control method is developed and a double closed-loop nonlinear control method ensures system stability based on the Lyapunov stabilization criterion. Simulation results confirm the method’s effectiveness in accurately regulating the quadrotor system in the presence of external disturbances and model uncertainties, while also reducing suspended load oscillations under input saturation conditions.},

Firstly, a type of two-sided mode-dependent loop-based Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is constructed, which compensates for the large delay and makes fuller use of the information in sampled-data interval. Secondly, the proposed method is used to give the design scheme of an aperiodic sampled-data controller, and furthermore, an iterative algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the requested control gains is provided. Finally, two coupled vehicle pendulum systems and two-area interconnected power systems are applied to demonstrate the efficiency of the presented approach.},

The Aczel-Alsina t-norm and t-conorm are very useful for constructing any kind of new aggregation operators, which was presented by Aczel and Alsina in 1982. Moreover, complex Pythagorean fuzzy (CPF) sets and hesitant fuzzy (HF) sets are the most generalized and very useful techniques to cope with unreliable and awkward information in genuine life problems. In this manuscript, we combine the HF set and CPF set to derive the complex Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy (CPHF) set and its fundamental laws. Furthermore, we evaluate the Aczel-Alsina operational laws based on Aczel-Alsina norms and CPHF information. Additionally, based on the Aczel-Alsina operational laws for CPHF information, we investigate the CPHF Aczel-Alsina-weighted averaging (CPHFAAWA) operator, CPHF Aczel-Alsina-ordered weighted averaging (CPHFAAOWA) operator, CPHF Aczel-Alsina-weighted geometric (CPHFAAWG) operator, and CPHF Aczel-Alsina-ordered weighted geometric (CPHFAAOWG) operator. Some remarkable properties are also examined for the invented theory. Moreover, a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) technique is presented based on discovered operators for CPHF information. Finally, we aim to illustrate some examples for comparing the proposed techniques with some existing ones to show the worth and feasibility of the discovered approaches.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy set plays an important role in handling vagueness for controlling uncertain dynamical systems. However, conventional type-1 fuzzy set (T1FS) requires precisely defined membership function, which is usually unavailable in practical control applications. This study pioneers the use of IT2FS for the control design of uncertain dynamical systems to relax this limitation of conventional T1FS-based control design. Concretely, the considered (possibly fast) time-variant uncertainty is bounded with the bound lying within IT2FS (hence interval type-2 fuzzy dynamical system, IT2FDS). A robust control design approach is proposed without invoking any IF-THEN fuzzy rules, providing a two-layer performance. The lower layer renders uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness for the system by the Lyapunov analysis, ensuring the bottom line. The upper layer improves the fuzzy-based control performance by optimal gain design oriented by a two-player zero-sum game, taking advantage of the interval description of membership function. It is shown that the equilibrium of the game which contains the optimal gain always exists. A semi-analytical solution strategy for the equilibrium is given. This is the first endeavor in exploring IT2FS-based control design without using any IF-THEN rules. It is shown in the demonstrative examples that the proposed IT2FS-based approach can achieve better control performance than the conventional T1FS-based approach.},

Vigorously investing in and developing renewable energy projects is of great strategic significance for enhancing sustainable energy development. Due to the unique nature of energy project investment, evaluating the investment risks of renewable energy projects is crucial for enhancing project feasibility. Therefore, this study propounds a novel multiple-criteria group decision framework based on the extended TODIM method (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive and Multi-criteria Decision Making) under q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) set for the application of renewable energy project investment risk assessment. To begin with, a novel q-ROF Lance distance measure is propounded for conquering the deficiencies caused by the prior distances. Then, an improved weight model by the defined q-ROF Lance distance is applied for determining the weight of experts, and an integration model that incorporates the group individual best and worst (GIBWM) and criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) is presented for ascertaining the synthetics weight of criteria. Afterward, an extended TODIM method based upon the prospect theory using the proposed Lance distance measure is developed to rank alternatives. Furthermore, a hybrid decision framework is constructed to assess the investment risk of renewable energy projects. The sensitivity analysis regarding the risk avoidance coefficient is conducted to explore the stability and robustness of the propounded assessment framework. Further, the extant methodologies are utilized to compare with the designed decision framework to highlight its strengths and superiorities. The outcomes exhibit that the propounded framework can provide efficient decision support for assessing renewable energy project investment risk by modeling the uncertainty and psychological behavior of the assessment procedure.},

First, the paper shows what problems arise when using the affine T–S fuzzy model to design a controller, and in turn by employing the S-procedure, what kind of quadratic inequalities are required to help solve the resulting LMIs. It turns out that by partitioning the state space into certain cells based on the information of the antecedents of fuzzy rules, the required quadratic inequalities can be formularised. Taking advantage of the cell partition, a fuzzy controller is proposed using piece-wise Lyapunov functions, in which ensuing problems such as continuity functions used in the piece-wise Lyapunov functions and control input chattering also are addressed. Finally, examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Simultaneously, the rationality of the proposed ranking method is analyzed theoretically. Besides, the techniques of aggregating Pythagorean fuzzy information are investigated. To expand the practical application scope of the DOWA operator to Pythagorean fuzzy environments, we present two kinds of Pythagorean fuzzy monotonic DOWA (PFMDOWA) operators by utilizing the power index measure of PFN. If the weights of attributes are considered, we further develop two kinds of Pythagorean fuzzy hybrid monotonic DOWA (PFHMDOWA) operators. The main advantage of the PFMDOWA operator and PFHMDOWA operator is that the weights associated to the operators can be generated and adjusted dynamically.

  abstract     = {Resilience is the sustainable competitive advantage of suppliers in the supply chain, and the ability of resilient suppliers to manage risk and perform better in supply than traditional suppliers in the event of disruption has driven the complexity of the current supply chain. Therefore, studying how to select a resilient supplier is necessary for establishing a supply chain with flexibility in the case of interruption. A hybrid fuzzy Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making (MCGDM) framework is developed in this paper for Resilient Supplier Selection Problems (RSSPs). First, Probabilistic Uncertain Linguistic Term Sets (PULTSs) are introduced to deal with the subjectivity and uncertainty of experts’ assessments. Second, considering that experts may have different views on the relative importance of resilient criteria depending on their different knowledge backgrounds, the Probabilistic Uncertain Linguistic Best–Worst Method (PUL-BWM) is constructed to determine the weights of resilient criteria under different experts. In addition, given that the traditional Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) cannot handle the information metrics with negative values or reflect the correlation of information, the extended TOPSIS method based on a novel Probabilistic Uncertain Linguistic Synthetic Correlation Coefficient (PULSCC) is constructed to select the optimal resilient supplier. The novel PULSCC also overcomes the drawbacks of the existing correlation coefficient between PULTSs by considering the mean, variance, and information completeness of PULTSs. Finally, an example of resilient supplier selection in the automotive industry is performed to validate the applicability and feasibility of the proposed approach. The sensitivity and comparative analyses are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Cloud infrastructure has enough memory storage space to store large data, so it is used to perform calculations in industrial sectors. The generated data are updated on the cloud server and sent to the consumer through the network. However, the development of blockchain is being adopted by various users to store important data at a low cost. But the stored data are not secure and reliable. IoT devices increase the number of transactions that work as colleagues in different systems, thus causing an inefficient storage problem. To overcome these issues, we use a metaheuristic algorithm to find a good solution to an optimization problem by identifying less frequently queried blocks in BC. Thus, a Fuzzy Hybrid-Flash Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (FHFBOA) is proposed to reduce storage weight in the blockchain and focuses on the problems of storing partial blocks in the cloud, and transforms storage issues into a multi-objective optimization issues. Based on storage cost, local space occupancy, and query probability, an objective function is developed in solving the storage capacity problem of blockchain. The ToN-IoT dataset is utilized to conduct the experiment. The HFBOA algorithm implements various stages of the algorithm such as optimization stage, local search, initialization stage, switch parameter setting, and global search to transfer the number of blocks in the blockchain to the cloud (optimal solution). Here, parameters in HFBOA are evaluated for performance evaluation in terms of storage space required, running time, CPU time, and time spent querying using a bottleneck strategy. The proposed FHFBOA model shows minimal storage space and this method shows large improvements in CPU time requirements from 75 to 98%. It achieves 98% data throughput for a total of 130 runs.},

  abstract     = {Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy set (AIFS)-based C-means algorithms are successful in clustering uncertain or vague real-world datasets. The AIFS-based clustering algorithms are classified into adaptive class and non-adaptive class. An algorithm from the adaptive class computes its feature weight distribution with the help of the given dataset. On the other side, the algorithm belonging to the non-adaptive class mostly computes the feature weight distribution by employing an equally likely approach. The guarantee to reach up to the mark clustering performance is missing within this approach. Simultaneously, the performance gets deteriorated if the datasets showcase noises/irrelevant features. The irrelevant features in the datasets add to the computational cost. So, a feature reduction-equipped clustering algorithm called uni-weighted intuitionistic fuzzy C-means (uW-IFCM) is introduced in the paper. Moreover, the probabilistic weights-based adaptive clustering algorithm, namely bi-weighted probabilistic intuitionistic fuzzy C-means (bW-PIFCM) is proposed under the AIFS environment. The parametric analysis for uW-IFCM is provided to comprehend and compare its performance with bW-PIFCM, PIFCM, IFCM, and FCM algorithms. Here, an intuitionistic data fuzzification technique transforms the real-valued dataset into AIFS dataset, therefore bW-PIFCM and uW-IFCM algorithms cluster the real-valued datasets. The research proposal of Yang and Nataliani in [IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26(2), 817–835] motivates us to introduce a feature reduction-equipped uW-IFCM algorithm. We have considered synthetic datasets and some UCI machine learning datasets for the experimental study of uW-IFCM and bW-PIFCM. The efficacy and the precision of proposed algorithms are tested in terms of some popular benchmark indexes as well.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent computing has distinct cognitive characteristics, especially when dealing with some multi-attribute group decision-making questions, it is regarded as a human behavior based on cognition. Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is not only an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), but also can handle some fuzzy decision-making problems of multi-attribute information on a larger scale, especially some new methods have been rapidly spread and developed in decision-making science. In this paper, some defects in the existing ranking criteria for Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (PFNs) were pointed out through some counterexamples, the main reasons of these flaws are analyzed, so that all IFNs are unified into PFNs space through coordinate transformation. Secondly, a novel improved score formula and ranking method are proposed by the residual sector area (RSA) and hesitancy degree of PFNs in a geometric background, and the rationality of this ranking criterion is further demonstrated through rigorous mathematical methods, and then the fundamental properties of the score function are discussed. Finally, the superiority of the novel score function was interpreted through comparison and analysis with other existing seven score formulas, and the new score formula was applied to multi-attribute group decision-making problems through an example, and the superiority of the novel method was fully displayed. In fact, the proposed method achieves a perfect ranking of all PFNs, especially for the equivalent PFNs, it can be achieved precise comparison or ranking, which overcomes some flaws of other methods, and ending the confusion caused by the independent ranking of IFNs and PFNs.},

  abstract     = {The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), an efficient soft computing approach, has both high interpretability and self-learning ability. ANFIS can effectively handle the both classification and regression of low-dimensional data, but it deals poorly with high-dimensional big data due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a highly interpretable deep neural-fuzzy system (DNFSA)-based algorithm to efficiently and effectively train fuzzy classifiers. It integrates several novel techniques: (1) independent membership functions (MFs) and fuzzy c-means clustering, which initialize rule by fuzzy c-means clustering to train Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system efficiently and (2) maximal information coefficient, which identifies interesting relationships between pairs of variables, so as to enhance the interpretability and generalization performance. Specifically, by viewing improved ANFIS as the base learner, we construct DNFSA in the fashion of parallel layer by layer. A visualized structure can be obtained automatically and presented to the users for better understanding of DNFSA. Furthermore, the proposed DNFSA can effectively determine which base learners should be abandoned from a set of available sub-fuzzy systems, which reveals that it may be better to ensemble many sub-fuzzy systems instead of all at hand. Experiments are conducted to confirm the DNFSA can significantly reduce the rules along with the parameters to have better interpretability.},

Many uncertainties exhibit in flexible-joint manipulators, which brings a great challenge to the leader–follower consensus control design, especially considering state constraints. In this work, a nonlinear state-dependent function is first constructed to deal with the full-state constraint problem. Then, a novel event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control strategy is presented by the function approximate technique, where a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced to avoid continuous updates of the controller, and thereby control resources and communication burden can be effectively reduced. On the basis of Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proven that all error signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded, and the leader–follower consensus of flexible-joint manipulators is realized without violating full-state constraints. Simulation results and some comparisons are provided to validate the effectiveness of the presented control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) is a crucial component of modern decision theory, with extensive application in several practical problems. In this particular setting, the pervasive problem of uncertainty has prompted the development of many theoretical frameworks, most notably the fuzzy set (FS) and its subsequent expansions, to address imprecise and ambiguous information. Among the many frameworks, the neutrosophic set (NS) has become a significant paradigm due to its ability to clearly define truth, falsehood, and indeterminacy. This unique characteristic allows for a more nuanced approach to dealing with ambiguity within decision-making scenarios. However, both the FS and the NS demonstrate constraints when faced with ambiguous and inconsistent circumstances. To address these constraints, this research explores the conceptual domain of neutrosophic fuzzy set (NFS), which represents a fusion of fuzzy FS and NS theories. This study presents a novel scoring mechanism that enables a comprehensive evaluation of NFSs and a customized distance measure designed to accurately identify inconsistencies within the dataset in both forward and backward directions. Following that, a decision-making framework is presented, derived from the extensions of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Autocratic approaches for group MADM using NFSs. The amalgamation of these techniques is further augmented using frequency as a criterion to get a definitive ranking for alternatives. Simultaneously, using the distinctive benefits of the TOPSIS and the Autocratic technique enables a thorough assessment, enhancing the strength and knowledge of decision-making in situations that include group decision-makers and NFS. The suggested strategy is applied to deal with industrial machine selection problems, where the decision values of the attributes for alternatives and the weights of the attributes are given by decision-makers based on NF values. These values facilitate assessing determination levels of alternative characteristics and attribute weights. This study contributes significantly to the broader discussion on decision-making in situations involving uncertainty and its direct relevance to the selection of machines. One notable characteristic of these approaches to reduce computation complexity is integrating decision and weight matrices from various management viewpoints into a unified aggregated assessment matrix. Despite strategies aimed at addressing decision-making challenges involving group suggestions and the use of neutrosophic fuzzy numbers, the analytical results indicate that the proposed approaches demonstrate a desirable level of computational simplicity.},

To provide outstanding fault tolerant control performance and approximation of system uncertainties, a type-2 fuzzy logical switching approach law eliminates the chattering phenomenon and reduce the need of prior knowledge without affecting the system’s robustness.

  abstract     = {In the modern era, the demand for an interconnected power system, which can integrate electric vehicles and renewable energy sources is increasing day by day. The primary goal of this demand is to make a sustainable and green power source, which can be fulfilled by utilizing Electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. However, there are some demerits of this technology, its lesser system inertia and hence it is not sufficient to respond to the required load capabilities. Further, the approach of electric vehicles with moving batteries can enable higher performance and resolve the issue. In this current analysis, the vehicles to grid idea (V2G) technique has been discussed, which can react as automatic generation control (AGC) in a three-area deregulated environment including hydro, thermal, and gas turbine units. In this type of power grid, all the sources such as Solar, wind, geothermal, and DEG power is also incorporated. To grip various ambiguities, the current study proposed a cascade combination of Interval type-2 fuzzy and Fractional Order Proportional-integral-derivative (FOPIDN) controllers. Further, the current work proposed a modified quasi-opposition Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (QOAOA) to tune the scaling factor and membership function of an interval type-2 fuzzy FOPIDN controller. To discuss the significance of the anticipated controller, the estimated outputs have been compared with previously reported controllers and optimization techniques. The effect of constant and variations in DG, the penetration level of (PEVs) in various operating modes, subjected to step and random load disturbances have been focused on. Finally, to validate the outcomes of the proposed controller, a real-time (RT) hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation has been adopted by using OPAL-RT.},

Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are trained online to estimate and compensate for unknown nonlinear system dynamics, effectively improving uncertainties rejection capabilities. To solve unmeasurable states, a state observer, including FLSs, is built and does provide a fairly good observation accuracy. Notably, an asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov function is constructed to realize full-state constraint satisfactions. Based on the above theoretical findings, an adaptive fuzzy tracker is designed in a recursive manner. A Lyapunov analysis demonstrates the stability of the closed-loop system, and particularly, the constrained conditions will not be violated during the whole operation.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a model predictive control scheme is developed for networked interval type-2 (IT-2) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems. To prevent the excessive use of bandwidth, the controller is designed in an event-trigger manner. However, the event conditions often require the transmission of all system states, imposing a substantial demand on network bandwidth; on the other hand, they are subject to network delay and packet loss. For this reason, in the existing approaches, event-triggered mechanisms primarily deployed in close proximity to the plant, or observer-based structures are used to enhance flexibility for implementing the controller. However, a common limitation in all these solutions is the assumption of network links being ideal, or at the very least, not accounting for all network-related limitations. The occurrence of faults is also an inevitable factor that has been overlooked in most related methods. To resolve this issue, a more comprehensive framework for event-triggered controllers is proposed in this paper in which an adaptive fuzzy observer is embedded, and the effects due to delay and packet loss are included in this observer. In addition, by developing an adaptive fault estimator and the introduction of a compensator term into the observer and controller formulations, a fault-tolerant performance of the event-triggered mechanism along with the controller is provided. These features enable the possibility of implementing the event-triggered mechanism next to the controller and at any desired distance from the plant, which resolves a serious concern in this area. Another important challenge considered in this work is ensuring the optimal performance of the controller in the entire prediction horizon. Also, the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system is proved such that defined $${\mathcal{H}}_{2}$$ and $${\mathcal{H}}_{\infty }$$ performance indices are satisfied. Finally, the proposed control approach is evaluated using numerical and practical examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a new fuzzy symbolization technique for energy load forecasting with neural networks, FPLS-Sym. Symbolization techniques transform a numerical time series into a smaller string of symbols, providing a high-level representation of time series by combining segmentation, aggregation and discretization. The dimensional reduction obtained with symbolization can speed up substantially the time required to train neural networks, however, it can also lead to considerable information losses that could lead to a less accurate forecast. FPLS-Sym introduces the use of fuzzy logic in the discretization process, maintaining more information about each segment of the neural network at the expense of requiring more space in memory. Extensive experimentation was made to evaluate FPLS-Sym with various neural-network-based models, including different neural network architectures and activation functions. The evaluation was done with energy demand data from Spain taken from 2009 to 2019. Results show that FPLS-Sym provides better quality metrics than other symbolization techniques and outperforms the use of the standard numerical time series representation in both quality metrics and training time.},

A fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used to approximate unknown nonlinear function, which consists of parametric uncertainty and modeling uncertainty of quadrotor system. To compensate for control input saturation, a second-order auxiliary system is constructed to reduce the amplitude of the designed control signal. Furthermore, two adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control techniques are proposed to achieve attitude tracking of a quadrotor, where two disturbance rejection strategies are developed. The stability of closed-loop system is proved by Lyapunov theory. The defined tracking error is guaranteed to converge to a neighborhood of zero and the transient bound of real tracking error is derived. The simulation is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, we propose a new method for minimizing the fuzzy single-objective function under fuzzy constraints. The algorithm of the method is based on the use of the null set concept. The null set concept allows us to use partial ordering for subtraction between fuzzy numbers, such as simple subtraction and the Hukuhara difference. From this, we have defined the types of solutions for a single-objective optimization problem, namely optimal solutions and H-optimal solutions. In practice, the method starts by turning the initial optimization problem into a deterministic nonlinear bi-objective optimization problem. Then, it uses Karush–Kuhn–Tucker’s optimality conditions to find the best solution of the bi-objective optimization problem. Finally, it deduces the solution to the initial problem using fuzzy algebraic operations to convert the deterministic solution into a fuzzy solution. Through some theorems, we have demonstrated that the obtained solutions by our method are optimal or H-optimal. Furthermore, the resolution of five examples of which a real-world problem has allowed us to compare our algorithm to other algorithms taken into the literature. With these results, our method can be seen as a good choice for solving a single-objective optimization problem where the objective and constraint functions are fuzzy.},

This paper seeks to address these issues and decrease the computational cost. Considering that pyramid fuzzy systems (PFSs) have been developed to improve the accuracy while simplifying the structure of fuzzy systems. On this basis, a hierarchical cluster-based optimization algorithm of hierarchical pyramid fuzzy system (HPFS) modeling is proposed, and a T-S-type PFS is considered as its subsystem. First, a new clustering method based on the K-means algorithm is applied to partition the input universe in the learning process of the initial structure. Unlike a traditional fuzzy system with a predefined rule number, the number of fuzzy rules (i.e., the cluster size) can be defined automatically. Secondly, a novel hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) that produces a tree-like chromosome structure, i.e., a natural structure identical to HPFS that combines several low-dimensional T-S-type PFSs, is proposed. To verify and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, four experiments are performed, and detailed comparisons with other methods are given.},

  abstract     = {Research into renewable energies is expanding quickly, especially photovoltaic (PV) systems. PV systems are employed extensively in several renewable energy applications. The primary challenge with PV systems is maximizing electricity output. Consequently, a significant amount of research into modeling PV continues to focus on maximizing the generated power. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) refers to the optimization of PV power generation. Accordingly, an effective MPPT approach deploying a converged barnacles mating optimizer (CBMO)-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is introduced in this paper. The mentioned strategy is utilized to detect and track the maximum power point (MPP) in two phases. At the initial stage, ideal voltages are determined using the CBMO algorithm in various temperatures and irradiances in the offline mode. After being trained, the ANFIS calculates the ideal voltage depending on the radiation conditions on solar panels. It then enters the tracking cycle and attempts to identify the MPP. To evaluate the behavior of the suggested technique, a Matlab/Simulink-based MPPT model is created. The proposed approach is evaluated under various weather conditions. The results demonstrate that the suggested methodology for tracking is efficacious under all environmental circumstances. Simulation of the suggested technique is carried out, and the results demonstrate that the introduced MPPT algorithm will effectively give the global maximum under a variety of climatic circumstances. Additionally, this approach is exceedingly effective, rapid, and stable. The findings demonstrate that the suggested technique properly identifies the optimum MPP at 99.3% efficiency.},

Moreover, our proposed model incorporates attribute weights, decision maker weights, and hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted operators. Secondly, considering the inconsistency in the cardinality of elements within the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, we define the hesitant fuzzy linguistic signed distance (HFLSD).

When a malicious attacker launches the intermittent DoS attacks, all the output signals of the systems are corrupted so that the traditional backstepping methods cannot be applied to design controller directly. To solve this difficulty, a switched fuzzy state observer is designed by improving the average dwell time method. By introducing the barrier Lyapunov function, an observer-based adaptive resilient tracking control design method is developed, which guarantees the output errors of the systems can be constrained within the specified range regardless of whether the considered systems are attacked or not. Different from the existing results, the designed control method not only deals with the resilient control design problem of the nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems with tracking errors constraints, but also removes the assumption that the nonlinear functions need to satisfy the global Lipschitz condition. Ultimately, a practical simulation example illustrates the viability of the developed control algorithm.},

To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes the Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy distance measure in combination with the VIKOR method to deal with the extracted review information and evaluate the similarity between different movies in a given genre. We then transform this information into Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy attribute evaluation terms using the Probabilistic Linguistic Term Set (PLTS) and apply conflict degree theory to calculate similarity scores. The algorithm proposed in this paper employs the VIKOR method to select recommended movie products that match the preferences of users and satisfy their needs. Comparative analysis demonstrates its reliability and stability. In addition, according to the comparative data, its performance is better than the comparable method in the selection of alternative schemes, which highlights its contribution in the field of movie recommendation systems.},

  abstract     = {Aggregating various decision information provided by a group of decision makers (DMs) into an integrated one is essential for seeking the optimal solution. This paper aims to propose an effective method for information aggregation in group decision-making (GDM) in an uncertain environment. The approach introduces a family of incentive-induced cluster-based uncertain ordered weighted averaging (II-CUOWA) operators from the perspective of incentive management. Specifically, the II-CUOWA operator is first introduced, involving the definition, the clustering method of judgment information, the calculation method of position weights, and several mathematical properties. Then, the study delves into the exploration of generalized formulas for the II-CUOWA operator, as well as discussing special cases achievable by adjusting internal parameters. Finally, this paper outlines the aggregation process of II-CUOWA operators when addressing GDM problems, accompanied by a practical example illustrating its application and validity in employees’ performance assessment. The results show that II-CUOWA operators not only highlight the distributed structure of decision information but also possess the capability to reward or penalize alternatives, thereby guiding their development by considering the manager’s incentive preference. The proposed method enriches the methodology of GDM theory from a novel research perspective and provides a solution to practical GDM problems.},

  abstract     = {The T-spherical fuzzy set (T-SFS) has been widely used in multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems due to its powerful expression ability for uncertain information. The evidential reasoning (ER) method can avoid the information loss when aggregating the evaluation values of an alternative with regard to all attributes, which can prevent the decision result from being dominated by extreme evaluation values. Considering the significant advantage of the ER method in information aggregation, this paper develops a new aggregation model assimilating the T-SFSs and the ER method, which is called evidential T-spherical fuzzy MADM (ET-SFMADM). The ET-SFMADM can prevent information loss in the decision process, so as to obtain a correct ranking of the alternatives. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a T-spherical fuzzy cross entropy (T-SFCE) to determine the weights of attributes, which can reduce dependence on decision-makers. Finally, the viability of the ET-SFMADM is illustrated through a numerical example for the implementation effect of the hierarchical medical treatment system in different regions, and further the sensitivity analysis and comparison analysis with existing MADM methods are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

This work puts emphasis on its theoretical aspects and presents a framework for fuzzy logic reasoning considering time-varying uncertainty based on robust control theory. The proposed framework is built upon one basic setting, the Fundamental Axiom of Reasoning, which provides a criterion to demonstrate the validness of a chain reasoning by analytically quantifying its truth value based on multiple fuzzy implication models. The fuzzy reasoning system is casted to a dynamic system where the reasoning process is proactively controlled without violating the basic setting. The time-varying uncertainty in system variables or parameters is addressed by involving the delicately designed robust control. Furthermore, the diverse ways in which time-varying uncertainty impacts the system are also discussed, from modeling stage to control stage. Finally, an automated speed control problem with time-varying uncertainty is considered to demonstrate how to apply the proposed framework.},

Hence, the sufficient stability condition for the general type of robust fuzzy tracking controls has been formulated and the performance of the controller has been tested for different classes of the fuzzy models. It has been demonstrated that the smooth fuzzy compositions have better performance rather than the standard fuzzy compositions, (i.e., min–max compositions and product–sum compositions). Considering that the smooth fuzzy compositions are efficient in face of the uncertainties, it is believed that the present work opens up new doors for wider applications of the smooth fuzzy compositions in the industry.},

The resulting model is called the function-link fuzzy brain emotional learning controller (FLFBELC). The FBELC consists of two sets of neural networks inspired by the two sets of systems of the brain, the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, which are responsible for decision-making and emotional response, respectively. These two networks are the sensory network and the emotional network, which affect each other’s learning capabilities and are jointly responsible for the control output of the controller. The function-link neural network (FLNN) is a method shown to facilitate faster convergence and reduce computational load through function approximation. The FLNN structure is integrated with the FBELC, with the resulting controller’s intent to acquire these characteristics. The weights of the proposed FLFBELC network can be approximated using function expansions of the control system’s input. Finally, the FLFBELC is applied for the tracking control of nonlinear systems to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The results are compared to other recent controllers to contrast the favorable performance of the FLFBELC.},

By employing the unique positivity of positive systems, a new event-triggered mechanism is introduced to select necessary signals so that the communication resources can be saved effectively while guaranteeing the system performance. It is different from the traditional event-triggered mechanism that is designed in the quadratic form for general systems, the one adopted in this paper is in linear form which is beneficial to facilitate the stability analysis in terms of a linear copositive Lyapunov function. However, the tricky non-convex problem makes controller design extremely challenging. For handling this issue, the matrix decomposition technique plays a very important part in designing the feedback control law. Furthermore, improving the relaxation of the analysis results is another considerably vital but challenging issue. To break through this difficulty, an asynchronous premise re-construct method is presented to extract the information of membership functions (MFs), which is conducive to obtaining more relaxed stability and positivity analysis. Finally, the validity of this control strategy is illustrated by simulation examples.},

The sources of environmental pollution are climate change, increase in CO $$_{2}$$ and CO level, wastage of electronic material in industries, pollution due to sound and vehicles, etc. It leads to environmental degradation. Wastage material in automobile industries is also creates environmental pollution. It is necessary to bring these wastage material in to the re-manufacturing process. The re-manufacturing process will help to decrease the environmental pollution and reuse in reproduction. The Government of India have launched voluntary scrappage policy to reduce the wastage of inventory and to protect the environment from hazardous material. Thus, a green reverse single stage supply chain model for re-manufacturing the obsolete product is developed with fuzzy stochastic re-manufacturing capacity by giving the optimum reward to the customer for returning the obsolete product to the manufacturer. There is no past information about remanufacturing item. Thus, we used fuzzy stochastic modelling. The expected manufacturer profit is highly non-linear hence it is solved by using Newton–Raphson method. For the applicability of the fuzzy stochastic re-manufacturing supply chain model, a real world numerical case study viz, SM Tech industry is considered and obtained the profit for this industry. SM Tech manufacturer produces four wheeler vehicles for commercial and private purpose across South-East Asia, mostly in India and South Africa. The impact of acceptance and recovery rate on manufacturer profit is analyzed using sensitivity analysis. The proposed reward function and recovery rate affected on the optimum profit inversely.},

The main objective is to develop a novel collaborative control algorithm to achieve consensus and impulse free for each agent described by nonlinear singular systems while only knowing local information, namely the state information of the agent itself and its neighbors. To overcome the analysis limitation of nonlinear singular multi-agent systems, the fuzzy logic system method is applied to deal with nonlinear items. Specifically, the consensus issue of singular multi-agent systems with fuzzy logic systems is equivalently simplified to an asymptotic stability analysis process for error systems. To achieve this objective, a novel distributed adaptive collaborative controller is designed, where the adaptive rate adjusts the coupling weight between each agent. In the research of the singular linear multi-agent system, a tolerance region is introduced, and stability of the closed-loop system is established according to Lyapunov theory. Then, fuzzy approximation theory is used to transform unknown nonlinear functions into fuzzy functions satisfying Lipschitz conditions, and the stability and impulse-free property are addressed by constructing LMI conditions.

Variable threshold concept lattice is a fuzzy concept lattice constructed from fuzzy data. However, variable threshold concept lattice is not robust to noise because it employs a single threshold, instead of an interval to derive formal concepts. Thus, the paper introduces the tolerance threshold to variable threshold concept lattice, and forms the ROBust variable threshold fuzzy Concept Lattice (RobCL). By analyzing the properties of RobCL, we show that RobCL has some incremental characteristics and is able to model the incremental cognitive process, which makes RobCL distinctive from other concept lattice models. A comparative study shows that variable threshold concept lattice is just a special case of RobCL; in other words, when two thresholds coincide with each other, RobCL degenerates to variable threshold concept lattice and the incremental characteristics vanish. In addition, the proposed model is also applied to medical diagnosis and shows its superiority over the previous model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of real-time reachable set synthesis for a type of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy uncertain singular systems founded on an adaptive event-triggered strategy is discussed. Firstly, based on the adaptive event-triggered strategy, a proportional and differential feedback controller is designed to transform the singular system into a normal system to ensure the admissibility of the system. Secondly, combined with Lyapunov stability theory, the sufficient conditions of reachable set boundary are given in the form of linear matrix inequality, and the stability of closed-loop control system is verified. In addition, the required real-time reachable set boundary data and controller gains are calculated using the matrix decoupling approach. Finally, an actual DC motor model is used in the simulation part to verify the efficacy of the presented approach.},

Using this observer, an event-triggered finite-time output feedback control scheme is designed based on the backstepping method. The proposed controller guarantees finite-time convergence of the tracking error and boundedness of all states in the closed-loop system. Additionally, it reduces the computing burden and communication resources.

The framework consists of five phases. In the first phase, a real ASD dataset of 538 autistic patients is obtained and diagnosed based on 42 medical and sociodemographic criteria. In the second phase, an ASD methodology for triaging the 538 autistic patients into three levels (i.e., minor, moderate, and urgent) is presented using fuzzy approach-based MCDM techniques, namely, fuzzy Delphi method and fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency, followed by the processes for triaging autism patients. In the third phase, cost-sensitive learning is employed to balance two ASD datasets: one labeled based on the ASD triage methodology and the other labeled by specialized psychologists. Two multimodal of artificial intelligence are developed in the fourth phase using nine machine-learning algorithms for the balanced ASD datasets. The evaluation of the two multimodal setups is carried out using nine metrics. In the fifth phase, the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) model is used to interpret the models using two scenarios. Four new algorithms are presented in the developed framework.},

  abstract     = {Malignant tissue in the skin is highly harmful. As melanoma is of identical look and lacks color variation, detection of skin cancer from dermatoscopic scans is a difficult task. The raw dataset is imbalanced that has been rarely studied. This is considered in this work to improve the accuracy level. The data have been studied and balanced using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The classifiers are considered as fuzzy-based classifiers that are statistical in nature and can pick the specific class, so that all the oversampled may not be useful except the informative samples. A combination of both homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble learning termed a hybrid ensemble learning model is proposed. The homogeneity is formed by using two similar models, i.e., two adaptive resonance theory mapping (ARTMAP) models. One ARTMAP is trained with the raw imbalanced dataset, whereas the other one is trained with the balanced dataset. The heterogeneity is considered using fuzzy min–max (FMM) as the third base classifier. Its learning strategy is different from ARTMAP. Finally, the classification is performed using the rule-based neuro-Fuzzy classification (NEFCLASS) model. The open-source Kaggle HAM10000 skin dermatoscopic dataset is used for the training and detection of skin cancer. The proposed model provided 98.4% classification accuracy that competes with state-of-the-art models in the field of skin cancer detection. An improved form of ensemble learning is proved to be an efficient choice in the field of image processing.},

Firstly, a parameter contained variable weight vector is developed based on the definition of variable weight vector, and then further extended to obtain the fuzzy variable weight vector. Its capability on weights changing can be adjusted by changing the parameter. In order to make the fuzzy variable weight vector for different changes of states to be selected and applied easily, the concept of fuzzy dispersion degree, which can be used to measure the balance of decision factors’ states, is proposed; And then the concept of fuzzy average relative adjustment degree, which can be used to measure the capability of fuzzy variable weight vector on weight changing, is also proposed. Based on the concepts of fuzzy dispersion degree and fuzzy average relative adjustment degree, relationship between the weight changing capability of the developed fuzzy variable weight vector and the parameters it contains is analyzed. With consideration of keeping balance among states, steps on selecting fuzzy variable weight vector with its corresponding capability on weight changing are presented. Based on the fuzzy combined weighting method, a FCDM model with fuzzy variable weight is developed. The fuzzy structured element is used to express fuzzy numbers and fuzzy operations in the model. An analytical algorithm of the FCDM model based on the fuzzy structured element is presented. The developed model was then applied on evaluating and predicting for coal and gas outburst of coal mining panels. The research finding provides an alternative way for fuzzy operations and determination of weights in other fuzzy analysis models.},

Fuzzy-logic systems are implemented to approximate uncertain nonlinear functions of the system. Using fuzzy-logic systems and the first-order filter, the dynamic surface control is combined with backstepping design to tackle the problem of computational complexity. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a fixed-time fuzzy controller is designed such that not only the closed-loop system is practically fixed-time stable but also the tracking error converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. It is shown that the settling time of the proposed control method is independent of the initial conditions of the controlled system.

  abstract     = {Due to the intense competition in the market today, choosing of an appropriate healthcare device vendor in long-term organ transplant networks has emerged as a key issue in raising life expectancy. A complicated multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) process problem with several viable alternatives and sustainable criteria may be used for evaluating sustainable healthcare equipment vendors. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (QROFS) is more effective at expressing ambiguous and fuzzy information since it is a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS). The fact that QROFSs provide a wider range of acceptable membership grades and give decision-makers more leeway to express their real thoughts is their most valued feature. The Heronian mean (HM) operator and power aggregation (PA) operator are instances of classic aggregation operators. They are preferable because they can replicate the correlations between attributes and remove the negative effects of awkward information. The Aczel-Alsina t-norms, which were put out by Aczel and Alsina in 1982, constitute a very successful and widely used method for creating any type of aggregation operators. Additionally, the parameter Φ $$\in \left( {0, + \infty } \right)$$ makes the Algebraic t-norms as a special case of the Aczel-Alsina t-norms. To take the above advantages, in this article, initially, the Aczel-Alsina (AA) operational laws are combined, with power average and Heronian mean operators to propose the QROFAA power Heronian aggregation (QROFPWHA) operator and QROFAA power geometric Heronian aggregation (QROFAAFPGHA) operator. Moreover, some core characteristics and various core cases with respect to the parameters are investigated and found that some of the existing aggregation defined on AA operational laws are special cases of the suggested aggregation operators. Secondly, the weighted forms of the suggested aggregation operators are initiated. Thirdly, based on these newly aggregation operators two novel MAGDM models with unknown weights of the decision makers and attributes are initiated. Finally, an illustrated example about evaluating sustainable healthcare equipment vendors is provided to assess the effectiveness of the suggested models, and a comparison analysis is provided to support and corroborate the suggested approaches. Additionally, assessment for key parameters in the proposed models is carried out to evaluate the implications on results.},

  abstract     = {This research addresses the problems of finite-time boundedness and disturbance rejection for T-S fuzzy networked systems that are vulnerable to actuator faults, linear fractional uncertainties and multiple disturbances through a reliable anti-disturbance control design. In particular, multiple disturbances encompasses two kinds, where the first kind of disturbance is matched, which is produced by fuzzy exogenous systems and the second kind is mismatched disturbance, which is norm-bounded. Moreover, in order to depict the reality more precisely, the actuator faults are taken into account in the system under consideration. In particular, the fuzzy disturbance observer is constructed for closely estimating the matched disturbances. After that, a reliable anti-disturbance controller is designed in accordance with the output of the conceived disturbance observer. Furthermore, the $$(\xi _1,\xi _2,\xi _3)-\eta $$ dissipative performance is deployed in order to reduce the imprints of mismatched disturbances to the greatest extent feasible. Moreover, by constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a set of adequate criteria in the form of linear matrix inequalities is established, which guarantees that the undertaken system achieves finite-time boundedness. In conclusion, two numerical examples are shown, one of which is a model of a tunnel diode circuit, which reveals the competence and applicability of the suggested control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this study is to provide a framework for a novel concept, which is highly effective at expressing ambiguous information in two dimensions. As a result, of the absence of a neutral degree in interval-valued complex Pythagorean fuzzy sets, we developed the theory of interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy sets. Moreover, a network security system prevents a variety of potential threats from entering or spreading within a network, thereby protecting a company&#39;s infrastructure from damage. This is a broad and comprehensive term that refers to processes, regulations, and settings pertaining to network use, accessibility, and overall threat prevention, as well as hardware and software solutions. It is the field of cybersecurity that focuses on protecting computer networks against cyber threats. To represent and solve the given problem, we establish the new mathematical concept known as interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations, defined as the cartesian product of two interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy sets. Furthermore, a range of interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations has been developed, characterized by interesting properties and outcomes. The interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy set and interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations supersede all pre-existing frameworks and methods for dealing with fuzziness. Additionally, this research investigates the application of interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations to assess the impact of various communication network security measures and the threats encountered by these networks. We further examine the positive, neutral, and negative effects of one factor on the other factors in the proposed applications, denoted by the membership grade, abstinence grade, and non-membership grade, respectively. Finally, we examine the proposed method to reveal its advantages and superiority to the current approaches.},

First, a unified barrier function is employed to constrain the states into asymmetric time-varying functions directly. Then, through fuzzy logic systems (FLS) and DETC strategy, the issues of unknown nonlinear functions and computation burden are solved. Meanwhile, with the aid of backstepping technology and Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all state variables are successfully within the asymmetric time-varying functions and all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded in a fixed time. In the final, two simulation experiments illustrate the feasibility and suitability of the controller.},

First, a useful coordinate transformation is firstly given such that the problem caused by the unknown control coefficients is figured out, and then the researched system is transformed into an equivalent system. Second, with the combination of the nonlinear decomposition of an asymmetric hysteresis quantizer and a simplified asymmetric dead zone model obtained by adopting the integrated design algorithm, a feasible connection between system input and control signal is established. Then, the difficult control issue that results from the coexistence of the asymmetric hysteresis quantization and asymmetric fuzzy dead zone is overcome. Third, the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. By introducing a smooth function, a novel adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed via backstepping technique. It is proved that the integrated fuzzy controller can make all the signals of the closed-loop system bounded and make the tracking error as small as possible. Finally, simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In modern nations, people are more conscious of their health. As a result, one of the most active research fields has been improving medical field applications. According to medical data, Myocardial Infarction (MI) is the leading cause of illness and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of MI involves a lot of uncertain values and imprecise information. Linear Diophantine Fuzzy Set (LDFS) removes the restrictions of existing prevailed concepts such as Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS), Pythagorean Fuzzy Set (PFS), and q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Set (q-ROFS). In this manuscript, we impart the idea of Linear Diophantine Multi-Fuzzy Soft Set (LDMFSS) and inspect some depict rudimentary properties. An order between parameters is established and the innovative theory of Lattice ordered Linear Diophantine Multi-Fuzzy Soft Set (LLDMFSS) is launched. The algorithmic approach is instigated by introducing Root Mean Square Sum (RMSS) soft set for diagnosing the risk level of patients, since Heart disease diagnosis continues to be a significant challenge for medical professionals with less experience. Here, our suggested theory is designed to address such a problem by considering the people who are most impacted by MI. In order to prioritize the parameters based on our demands, LLDMFSS is best appropriate for particular types of difficulties. The main goal is to introduce the idea of LLDMFSS and the use of LLDMFSS to predict MI. Its superiority is demonstrated with a comparison of our proposed work to current fuzzy sets.},

The fuzzy logic system is introduced into the sliding mode control to estimate the system uncertainties. For compensating the unknown lumped disturbance and accelerating the convergence process, an adaptive super-twisting sliding mode controller is proposed with a novel adaptive law. The system states reach the sliding mode surface in a finite time and the control effect is continuous without over-estimation and control chattering. Depending on the Lyapunov stability theory, the tracking error converges to zero in a fast-exponential form. The effectiveness of the proposed method is fully indicated by the simulation of a robotic manipulator system.},

  abstract     = {Real-world problems often deal with uncertainties related to imprecision and vagueness, for which fuzzy modeling has provided a successful approach. Ranking fuzzy numbers is a necessary and complex task in multiple processes, such as decision making. To facilitate the task of ranking fuzzy numbers, it has been introduced an approach to construct fuzzy distances from classical interval distances because their α-cuts are continuous intervals. Usually, extant interval distances use interval endpoints or midpoints, leading to results that might not reflect the correct distance because of information loss. This paper introduces a new fuzzy distance based on a novel interval distance that considers all points within the intervals by using the concept of integration to calculate the average distance between all points belonging to two intervals, respectively. Subsequently, a series of distances between fuzzy numbers based on the proposed interval distances are defined and proved. A new method for ranking fuzzy numbers using the new fuzzy distances is then presented. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed distances will be demonstrated by a comparative analysis of numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Typically, the parameters of a practical problem are considered to be deterministic. Nevertheless, there may be possibility that these parameters are incomplete owing to observational or experimental errors. Fuzzy sets are capable of handling such problems. In addition, the majority of studies on fuzzy fractional heat equations have employed two spatial variables and fuzzy sets with deterministic membership. In some instances, however, there may be more than two spatial variables, and the membership grade associated with an uncertain parameter may also contain imprecise information. Consequently, dealing with such a situation may be fascinating. In this regard, the main objective of this research is to develop alternative methods for solving the $$n+1$$ -dimensional fractional order heat equation with an external source term in an uncertain environment. The problem is addressed by using the Elzaki transformed homotopy perturbation method and the fractional reduced differential transformation method in the fuzzy environment. Caputo fuzzy fractional derivatives are considered here. In this study, triangular fuzzy numbers and Gaussian fuzzy numbers are utilised to handle type-1 fuzzy uncertainty, whereas triangularly perfect quasi type-2 fuzzy numbers and newly introduced Gaussian-triangular type-2 fuzzy numbers are used to handle type-2 fuzzy uncertainty. Numerical examples with graphical representations are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the approaches. Convergence plots are also provided.},
