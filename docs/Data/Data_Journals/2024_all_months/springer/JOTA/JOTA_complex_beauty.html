  abstract     = {Gradient tracking methods have emerged as one of the most popular approaches for solving decentralized optimization problems over networks. In this setting, each node in the network has a portion of the global objective function, and the goal is to collectively optimize this function. At every iteration, gradient tracking methods perform two operations (steps): (1) compute local gradients, and (2) communicate information with local neighbors in the network. The complexity of these two steps varies across different applications. In this paper, we present a framework that unifies gradient tracking methods and is endowed with flexibility with respect to the number of communication and computation steps. We establish unified theoretical convergence results for the algorithmic framework with any composition of communication and computation steps, and quantify the improvements achieved as a result of this flexibility. The framework recovers the results of popular gradient tracking methods as special cases, and allows for a direct comparison of these methods. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed methods on quadratic functions and binary classification problems.},

The proposed model considers the ambiguity set of portfolio returns in which the marginal distributions and their copula are close—in terms of the Wasserstein distance—to their nominal counterparts. We develop a cutting-surface method to solve the proposed problem, in which the distribution separation subproblem is nonconvex and includes bilinear terms. We propose three approaches to solve the bilinear formulation, namely (1) linear relaxation via McCormick inequalities, (2) exact mixed-integer linear program reformulation via disjunctive inequalities, and (3) inner approximation method via a novel iterative procedure that exploits the structural properties of the bilinear optimization problem. We further carry out a comprehensive set of computational experiments with distributionally robust portfolios featuring Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measures. These tests aim to compare the accuracy of the proposed algorithms, analyze the impact of the radius of the Wasserstein ambiguity ball on the portfolio, and assess portfolio performance. We use a rolling-horizon approach to conduct the out-of-sample tests, which show the superior performance of the portfolios under marginal and copula ambiguity over the equally weighted and ambiguity-free Mean-CVaR benchmark portfolios.},

One class of VI solution methods is to reformulate a VI into a normal map nonsmooth equation system, which is then solved using nonsmooth equation-solving techniques. In this article, we propose a first practical approach for furnishing B-subdifferential elements of the normal map, which in turn enables solving the normal map equation system using variants of the B-subdifferential-based nonsmooth Newton method. It is shown that our new method requires less stringent conditions to achieve local convergence than some other established methods, and thus guarantees convergence in certain cases where other methods may fail. We compute a B-subdifferential element using the LD-derivative, which is a recently established generalized derivative concept. In our new approach, an LD-derivative is computed by solving a sequence of strictly convex quadratic programs, which can be terminated early under certain conditions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the convergence properties of our new method, based on a proof-of-concept implementation in Python.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic first-order methods are standard for training large-scale machine learning models. Random behavior may cause a particular run of an algorithm to result in a highly suboptimal objective value, whereas theoretical guarantees are usually proved for the expectation of the objective value. Thus, it is essential to theoretically guarantee that algorithms provide small objective residuals with high probability. Existing methods for non-smooth stochastic convex optimization have complexity bounds with the dependence on the confidence level that is either negative-power or logarithmic but under an additional assumption of sub-Gaussian (light-tailed) noise distribution that may not hold in practice. In our paper, we resolve this issue and derive the first high-probability convergence results with logarithmic dependence on the confidence level for non-smooth convex stochastic optimization problems with non-sub-Gaussian (heavy-tailed) noise. To derive our results, we propose novel stepsize rules for two stochastic methods with gradient clipping. Moreover, our analysis works for generalized smooth objectives with Hölder-continuous gradients, and for both methods, we provide an extension for strongly convex problems. Finally, our results imply that the first (accelerated) method we consider also has optimal iteration and oracle complexity in all the regimes, and the second one is optimal in the non-smooth setting.},

We explore its relevance for various machine learning tasks, with a particular focus on shallow rectified linear unit (ReLU) and leaky ReLU networks with scalar input. Building on a detailed examination of critical points of the square integral loss function for shallow ReLU and leaky ReLU networks relative to an affine target function, we show that gradient descent circumvents most saddle points. Furthermore, we prove convergence to global minima under favourable initialization conditions, quantified by an explicit threshold on the limiting loss.},

To address the complexity of the coupled nonlinear model of a fixed-wing aircraft, this paper introduces a Fractional-Order Type-2 Fuzzy PID (FOTFPID) controller. The adoption of interval valued type-2 fuzzy sets, as an extension of conventional fuzzy sets, has endowed decision makers with the ability to assign membership and non-membership values as intervals. This enhanced capability facilitates more resilient decision-making processes. The Bat optimization algorithm is also employed to fine-tune the membership functions, scaling factors, and primary controller parameters, aiming to minimize the integrated absolute error index. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed controllers in comparison to classical PID controllers, while subjecting the aircraft system to various disturbance conditions.},

  abstract     = {The polynomial complementarity problem (PCP) is an important extension of the tensor complementarity problem (TCP). The main purpose of the present paper is to extend the results on the bounds of solutions of TCP due to Xu–Gu–Huang from TCP to PCP. To that end, the concepts of (generalized) row strictly diagonally dominant tensor to tensor tuple are extended and the properties about them are discussed. By using the introduced structured tensor tuples, the upper and lower bounds on the norm of solutions to PCP are derived. Comparisons between the results presented in the present paper and the existing bounds are made.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of second-order optimization methods based either on sub-sampling, randomization or sketching has two serious shortcomings compared to the conventional Newton method. The first shortcoming is that the analysis of the iterates has only been shown to be scale-invariant only under specific assumptions on the problem structure. The second shortfall is that the fast convergence rates of second-order methods have only been established by making assumptions regarding the input data. In this paper, we propose a randomized Newton method for self-concordant functions to address both shortfalls. We propose a Self-concordant Iterative-minimization-Galerkin-based Multilevel Algorithm (SIGMA) and establish its super-linear convergence rate using the theory of self-concordant functions. Our analysis is based on the connections between multigrid optimization methods, and the role of coarse-grained or reduced-order models in the computation of search directions. We take advantage of the insights from the analysis to significantly improve the performance of second-order methods in machine learning applications. We report encouraging initial experiments that suggest SIGMA outperforms other state-of-the-art sub-sampled/sketched Newton methods for both medium and large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the standard formulation of an optimization problem when the computation of gradient is not available. Such a problem can be classified as a “black box” optimization problem, since the oracle returns only the value of the objective function at the requested point, possibly with some stochastic noise. Assuming convex, and higher-order of smoothness of the objective function, this paper provides a zero-order accelerated stochastic gradient descent (ZO-AccSGD) method for solving this problem, which exploits the higher-order of smoothness information via kernel approximation. As theoretical results, we show that the ZO-AccSGD algorithm proposed in this paper improves the convergence results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, namely the estimate of iteration complexity. In addition, our theoretical analysis provides an estimate of the maximum allowable noise level at which the desired accuracy can be achieved. Validation of our theoretical results is demonstrated both on the model function and on functions of interest in the field of machine learning. We also provide a discussion in which we explain the results obtained and the superiority of the proposed algorithm over SOTA algorithms for solving the original problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the convergence properties of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method for finding a stationary point of a given objective function $$J(\cdot )$$ . The objective function is not required to be convex. Rather, our results apply to a class of “invex” functions, which have the property that every stationary point is also a global minimizer. First, it is assumed that $$J(\cdot )$$ satisfies a property that is slightly weaker than the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) condition, denoted here as (KL’). It is shown that the iterations $$J({\varvec{\theta }}_t)$$ converge almost surely to the global minimum of $$J(\cdot )$$ . Next, the hypothesis on $$J(\cdot )$$ is strengthened from (KL’) to the Polyak–Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. With this stronger hypothesis, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence of $$J({\varvec{\theta }}_t)$$ to its limit. Using these results, we show that for functions satisfying the PL property, the convergence rate of both the objective function and the norm of the gradient with SGD is the same as the best-possible rate for convex functions. While some results along these lines have been published in the past, our contributions contain two distinct improvements. First, the assumptions on the stochastic gradient are more general than elsewhere, and second, our convergence is almost sure, and not in expectation. We also study SGD when only function evaluations are permitted. In this setting, we determine the “optimal” increments or the size of the perturbations. Using the same set of ideas, we establish the global convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm under more general assumptions on the measurement error, compared to the existing literature. We also derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the SA algorithm under appropriate assumptions.},

The objective is to establish an analog of the Pontryagin’s maximum principle. The major challenge stems from the presence of infinitely many point-wise constraints on the system’s state, which are imposed at any point from a given continuum set of independent variables. Necessary conditions for optimality in the form of an “abstract” maximum principle are first obtained for a general optimal control problem couched in the language of functional analysis. This result is targeted at a wide class of problems, with an idea to absorb, in its proof, a great deal of technical work needed for derivation of optimality conditions so that only an interpretation of the discussed result would be basically needed to handle a particular problem. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated via obtaining the afore-mentioned analog of the Pontryagin’s maximum principle for a state-constrained system of high-order elliptic equations and the Navier–Stokes equations.},

Some abstract convergence results for a broad class of linesearch methods are established. A general scheme for inexact reduced gradient (IRG) methods is proposed, where the errors in the gradient approximation automatically adapt with the magnitudes of the exact gradients. The sequences of iterations are shown to obtain stationary accumulation points when different stepsize selections are employed. Convergence results with constructive convergence rates for the developed IRG methods are established under the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property. The obtained results for the IRG methods are confirmed by encouraging numerical experiments, which demonstrate advantages of automatically controlled errors in IRG methods over other frequently used error selections.},

Their proper modifications allow a significant acceleration of these schemes when the objective function has favorable properties (smoothness, strong convexity).

  abstract     = {Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) that integrate conventional and renewable energy generation and energy storage technologies represent a viable option to serve the energy demand of remote and isolated communities. A common way to capture the stochastic nature of demand and renewable energy supply in such systems is by using a small number of independent discrete scenarios. However, some information is inevitably lost when extracting these scenarios from historical data, thus introducing errors and biases to the design process. This paper proposes two frameworks, namely robust-stochastic optimization and distributionally robust optimization, that aim to hedge against the resulting uncertainty of scenario characterization and probability, respectively, in scenario-based HRES design approaches. Mathematical formulations are provided for the nominal, stochastic, robust-stochastic, distributional robust, and combined problems, and directly-solvable tractable reformulations are derived for the stochastic and the distributional robust cases. Furthermore, an exact column-and-constraint-generation algorithm is developed for the robust-stochastic and combined cases. Numerical results obtained from a realistic case study of a stand-alone solar-wind-battery-diesel HRES serving a small community in Northern Ontario, Canada reveal the performance advantage, in terms of both cost and utilization of renewable sources, of the proposed frameworks compared to classical deterministic and stochastic models, and their ability to mitigate the issue of information loss due to scenario reduction.},

The proposed framework facilitates risk-averse sequential decision-making by distributed methods. The new approach is compared theoretically and numerically to other systemic risk measurements from the existing literature. We formulate a two-stage decision problem for a distributed system using a systemic measure of risk. The structure accommodates distributed systems arising in energy networks, robotics, and other practical situations. A distributed decomposition method for solving the two-stage problem is proposed and applied to a problem arising in communication networks. We have used this problem to compare the methods of systemic risk evaluation. We show that the risk evaluation via linear scalarizations of outcomes leads to less conservative risk evaluation and results in a substantially better solution to the problem at hand than aggregating the risk of individual agents.},

The algorithm enjoys performance guarantees on the last primal iterate, as opposed to those derived for ergodic means for standard DDSG algorithms. Our work improves the recently published convergence rate of $${{\mathcal {O}}}(\log T/\sqrt{T})$$ with decaying step-sizes to $${{\mathcal {O}}}(1/\sqrt{T})$$ with constant step-size on a metric that combines sub-optimality and constraint violation. We then numerically evaluate the algorithm on three grid optimization problems. Namely, these are tie-line scheduling in multi-area power systems, coordination of distributed energy resources in radial distribution networks, and joint dispatch of transmission and distribution assets. The DDSG algorithm applies to each problem with various relaxations and linearizations of the power flow equations. The numerical experiments illustrate various properties of the DDSG algorithm–comparison with standard DDSG, impact of the number of agents, and why Nesterov-style acceleration can fail in DDSG settings.},

  abstract     = {In the context of finite sums minimization, variance reduction techniques are widely used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art stochastic gradient methods. Their practical impact is clear, as well as their theoretical properties. Stochastic proximal point algorithms have been studied as an alternative to stochastic gradient algorithms since they are more stable with respect to the choice of the step size. However, their variance-reduced versions are not as well studied as the gradient ones. In this work, we propose the first unified study of variance reduction techniques for stochastic proximal point algorithms. We introduce a generic stochastic proximal-based algorithm that can be specified to give the proximal version of SVRG, SAGA, and some of their variants. For this algorithm, in the smooth setting, we provide several convergence rates for the iterates and the objective function values, which are faster than those of the vanilla stochastic proximal point algorithm. More specifically, for convex functions, we prove a sublinear convergence rate of O(1/k). In addition, under the Polyak-łojasiewicz condition, we obtain linear convergence rates. Finally, our numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proximal variance reduction methods over their gradient counterparts in terms of the stability with respect to the choice of the step size in most cases, especially for difficult problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, an interest appeared in integrating various optimization algorithms in machine learning. We study the potential of ensemble learning in classification tasks and how to efficiently decompose the underlying optimization problem. Ensemble learning has become popular for machine learning applications and it is particularly interesting from an optimization perspective due to its resemblance to column generation. The challenge for learning is not only to obtain a good fit for the training data set, but also good generalization, such that the classifier is generally applicable. Deep networks have the drawback that they require a lot of computational effort to get to an accurate classification. Ensemble learning can combine various weak learners, which individually require less computational time. We consider binary classification problems studying a three-phase algorithm. After initializing a set of base learners refined by a bootstrapping approach, base learners are generated using the solution of an linear programming (LP) master problem and then solving a machine learning sub-problem regarding a reduced data set, which can be viewed as a so-called pricing problem. We theoretically show that the algorithm computes an optimal ensemble model in the convex hull of a given model space. The implementation of the algorithm is part of an ensemble learning framework called decolearn. Numerical experiments with CIFAR-10 data set show that the base learners are diverse and that both the training and generalization error are reduced after several iterations.},

The developed closed-loop supply chain model, based on the variational inequality theory, accounts for the forest deployment and the production of paper using both virgin pulp and recyclable paper waste in an area that is subject to the ETS. In addition, it considers the exchanges of virgin pulp, paper, recyclable and not-recyclable paper waste between this regulated area and geographical zones where no environmental policies apply. The aim of this paper is to investigate the ETS impacts on the pulp and paper industries located in an environmentally regulated area in terms of operating costs, production and trading volumes of the aforementioned commodities, and emissions generated. The case study focuses on the European pulp and paper companies, which are among the energy-intensive industries deemed to be exposed to the carbon leakage risk as a consequence of the ETS application. Sensitivity analyses on the carbon price value and on the trade flexibility are conducted. Our results show that the ETS implies additional costs for the European pulp and paper companies and induces them to resort more on imports of virgin pulp and paper from not-regulated zones.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a general framework for solving multiobjective nonconvex optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems in which multiple objective functions have to be optimized simultaneously. Thereby, the nonconvexity might come from the objective or constraint functions, or from integrality conditions for some of the variables. In particular, multiobjective mixed-integer convex and nonconvex optimization problems are covered and form the motivation of our studies. The presented algorithm is based on a branch-and-bound method in the pre-image space, a technique which was already successfully applied for continuous nonconvex multiobjective optimization. However, extending this method to the mixed-integer setting is not straightforward, in particular with regard to convergence results. More precisely, new branching rules and lower bounding procedures are needed to obtain an algorithm that is practically applicable and convergent for multiobjective mixed-integer optimization problems. Corresponding results are a main contribution of this paper. What is more, for improving the performance of this new branch-and-bound method we enhance it with two types of cuts in the image space which are based on ideas from multiobjective mixed-integer convex optimization. Those combine continuous convex relaxations with adaptive cuts for the convex hull of the mixed-integer image set, derived from supporting hyperplanes to the relaxed sets. Based on the above ingredients, the paper provides a new multiobjective mixed-integer solver for convex problems with a stopping criterion purely in the image space. What is more, for the first time a solver for multiobjective mixed-integer nonconvex optimization is presented. We provide the results of numerical tests for the new algorithm. Where possible, we compare it with existing procedures.},

In this paper, the application of those strategies is exported to Riemannian optimization, wherein minimization is to be performed with respect to variables restricted to lie on a manifold. More specifically, classic and linesearch extrapolated variants of direct search are considered, and tailored strategies are devised for the minimization of both smooth and nonsmooth functions, by making use of retractions. A class of direct search algorithms for minimizing nonsmooth objectives on a Riemannian manifold without having access to (sub)derivatives is analyzed for the first time in the literature. Along with convergence guarantees, a set of numerical performance illustrations on a standard set of problems is provided.},

This structure encapsulates numerous significant nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems in the current literature including the linearly constrained difference-of-convex problems. Relying on the successive linearization and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the proposed algorithm exhibits the global subsequential convergence to a stationary point of the underlying problem. We also establish the convergence of the full sequence generated by our algorithm under the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property and some mild assumptions. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is tested on a robust principal component analysis problem and a nonconvex optimal power flow problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we characterize Lipschitzian properties of different multiplier-free and multiplier-dependent perturbation mappings associated with the stationarity system of a so-called generalized nonlinear program popularized by Rockafellar. Special emphasis is put on the investigation of the isolated calmness property at and around a point. The latter is decisive for the locally fast convergence of the so-called semismooth* Newton-type method by Gfrerer and Outrata. Our central result is the characterization of the isolated calmness at a point of a multiplier-free perturbation mapping via a combination of an explicit condition and a rather mild assumption, automatically satisfied e.g. for standard nonlinear programs. Isolated calmness around a point is characterized analogously by a combination of two stronger conditions. These findings are then related to so-called criticality of Lagrange multipliers, as introduced by Izmailov and extended to generalized nonlinear programming by Mordukhovich and Sarabi. We derive a new sufficient condition (a characterization for some problem classes) of nonexistence of critical multipliers, which has been also used in the literature as an assumption to guarantee local fast convergence of Newton-, SQP-, or multiplier-penalty-type methods. The obtained insights about critical multipliers seem to complement the vast literature on the topic.},

Motivated by this fact, in this work, we propose local solution concepts, study their interrelations and relations with global concepts and prove existence results as well as stability of local solution map of parametric variational inequalities. The key ingredient of our results is the new concept of local reproducibility of a set-valued map, which we introduce to explore such local solutions to quasi-variational inequality problems. As a by-product, we obtain local solutions to quasi-optimization problems, bilevel quasi-optimization problems and Single-Leader-Multi-Follower games.},

Indeed, while in the latter case C could be reformulated as being generated by one function, however, this function is only Lipschitz, and hence, the method established for one generating smooth function is not applicable to this framework.

  abstract     = {Much is known about when a locally optimal solution depends in a single-valued Lipschitz continuous way on the problem’s parameters, including tilt perturbations. Much less is known, however, about when that solution and a uniquely determined multiplier vector associated with it exhibit that dependence as a primal–dual pair. In classical nonlinear programming, such advantageous behavior is tied to the combination of the standard strong second-order sufficient condition (SSOC) for local optimality and the linear independent gradient condition (LIGC) on the active constraint gradients. But although second-order sufficient conditons have successfully been extended far beyond nonlinear programming, insights into what should replace constraint gradient independence as the extended dual counterpart have been lacking. The exact answer is provided here for a wide range of optimization problems in finite dimensions. Behind it are advances in how coderivatives and strict graphical derivatives can be deployed. New results about strong metric regularity in solving variational inequalities and generalized equations are obtained from that as well.},

In this paper, we prove that, under a controllability assumption, the “best approximation” optimal control minimizing the distance (and thus finding the “gap”) between the two sets is of bang–bang type, with the “gap function” playing the role of a switching function. The critically feasible control solution (the case when one has the smallest control bound for which the problem is feasible) is also shown to be of bang–bang type.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of inertial dynamics with dry friction within the context of a Hilbert framework for convex differentiable optimization. Our study focuses on a doubly nonlinear first-order evolution inclusion that encompasses two potentials. In our analysis, we specifically focus on two main components: the differentiable function f that needs to be minimized, which influences the system’s state through its gradient, and the nonsmooth dry friction potential denoted as $$\varphi = r\Vert \cdot \Vert $$ . It’s important to note that the dry friction term acts on a linear combination of the velocity vector and the gradient of f. Consequently, any stationary point in our system corresponds to a critical point of f, unlike the case where only the velocity vector is involved in the dry friction term, resulting in an approximate critical point of f. To emphasize the crucial role of $$\nabla f(x)$$ , we also explore the dual formulation of this dynamic, which possesses a Riemannian gradient structure. To address these dynamics, we employ the recently developed generic acceleration approach by Attouch, Bot, and Nguyen. This approach involves the time scaling of a continuous first-order differential equation, followed by the application of the method of averaging. By applying this methodology, we derive fast convergence results for second-order time-evolution systems with dry friction, asymptotically vanishing viscous damping, and implicit Hessian-driven damping.},

To this end, the proposed algorithm hinges on two key features: taking inertial steps in the dual space, and allowing for possibly negative inertial values. The interpretation of relative smoothness as a two-sided weak convexity condition proves beneficial in providing tighter stepsize ranges. Our analysis begins with studying an envelope function associated with the algorithm that takes inertial terms into account through a novel product space formulation. Such construction substantially differs from similar objects in the literature and could offer new insights for extensions of splitting algorithms. Global convergence and rates are obtained by appealing to the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property.},

Under these assumptions, the constrained local Lipschitzian error bound does not hold, unlike the common settings of convergence and rate of convergence analyses. In this work, we complement those previous results by considering the case when the equation mapping is 2-regular with respect to a direction in the null space of the Jacobian which is in the tangent cone to the set, but need not be interior feasible. Under some further conditions, we still show linear convergence of order 1/2 from a large domain around the solution (despite degeneracy, and despite that there may exist other solutions nearby). Our results apply to constrained variants of the Gauss–Newton and Levenberg–Marquardt methods, and to the LP-Newton method.

The proposed distributed method is established based on a hybrid structure mainly consisting of both algebraic and analytical parts, in which two neural networks (NN) are simultaneously tuned in an online manner by using neighbourhood information for each subsystem. To tackle the unknown dynamics, a new distributed data-driven model is established to reconstruct subsystem dynamics and estimate system states. Moreover, by using the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) based formulation, a distributed NN-based optimal control is designed to minimize both the performance of the corresponding subsystem and its neighbours, in the presence of unknown dynamics. Through Lyapunov’s direct method, the uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of the overall closed-loop system is guaranteed, and the provided results of the stability are exploited to find updating rules for the NN-based observer and controller.

  abstract     = {Energy-related carbon dioxide ( $$\text {CO}_2$$ ) emissions have significantly contributed to the increase in atmospheric $$\text {CO}_2$$ concentrations. Curbing the carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy generation is crucial for reducing the radiative forcing of carbon dioxide and tackling the climate change issue. The use of renewable energy technologies is one of the most advocated avenues to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy sector. This study presents a mathematical model designed to analyze the influence of renewable energy technologies on the control of atmospheric $$\text {CO}_2$$ concentrations. The proposed model consists of a set of nonlinear differential equations that describe the dynamic interplay among the human population, carbon dioxide level, energy use, and renewable energy technologies. An extensive mathematical analysis of the model is presented to delve into the long-term impact of renewable energy technologies on the control of atmospheric $$\text {CO}_2$$ levels. The model’s analysis reveals that increasing the adoption rate of renewable energy technologies and improving their efficiency in reducing carbon dioxide emissions contribute to a reduction in the equilibrium $$\text {CO}_2$$ levels in Earth’s atmosphere. One of the primary challenges to the widespread implementation of renewable energy technologies is the associated implementation costs. This study identifies optimal control strategies for lowering $$\text {CO}_2$$ levels while simultaneously minimizing the expenses linked to the deployment of renewable energy technologies by employing optimal control theory. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to illustrate how changes in key parameters affect the system’s dynamics. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical conclusions.},

  abstract     = {It is common practice to apply gradient-based optimization algorithms to numerically solve large-scale ODE constrained optimal control problems. Gradients of the objective function are most efficiently computed by approximate adjoint variables. High accuracy with moderate computing time can be achieved by such time integration methods that satisfy a sufficiently large number of adjoint order conditions and supply gradients with higher orders of consistency. In this paper, we upgrade our former implicit two-step Peer triplets constructed in [Algorithms, 15:310, 2022] to meet those new requirements. Since Peer methods use several stages of the same high stage order, a decisive advantage is their lack of order reduction as for semi-discretized PDE problems with boundary control. Additional order conditions for the control and certain positivity requirements now intensify the demands on the Peer triplet. We discuss the construction of 4-stage methods with order pairs (3, 3) and (4, 3) in detail and provide three Peer triplets of practical interest. We prove convergence of order $$s-1$$ , at least, for s-stage methods if state, adjoint and control satisfy the corresponding order conditions. Numerical tests show the expected order of convergence for the new Peer triplets.},

  abstract     = {It is of practical importance to incorporate a risk-averse objective in an optimal control problem under uncertainty. By leveraging the dual relationship between risk and regret measures, the risk-averse optimal control problem can be equivalently transformed into an optimal control problem with nonanticipativity constraints and expectation objective function. A modified progressive hedging algorithm is then proposed to solve the transformed problem, in which the descent conditions are enforced to ensure global convergence of the algorithm. Numerical results of three different types of problems are presented to show the applicability and effectiveness of the modified progressive hedging algorithm.},

Even though this problem is non-convex in the Euclidean sense and only very locally convex in the Riemannian sense, we discover a structure for this problem that is similar to geodesic strong convexity, namely, weak-strong convexity. This allows us to apply similar arguments from convex optimization when studying the convergence of the steepest descent algorithm but with initialization conditions that do not depend on the eigengap $$\delta $$ . When $$\delta &gt;0$$ , we prove exponential convergence rates, while otherwise the convergence is algebraic. Additionally, we prove that this problem is geodesically convex in a neighbourhood of the global minimizer of radius $${\mathcal {O}}(\sqrt{\delta })$$ .},

We derive the closed-form solutions which are optimal among all feasible controls at initial time, i.e., precommitted strategies. Moreover, the precommitted strategies are also optimal at the intermediate time for “bad” market states. A contingent claim on Merton’s portfolio is constructed to replicate the optimal portfolio.

Under the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) exponent of the objective function, we establish the finite-time convergence of the trajectories to the optima from any initial point. Making use of the Moreau envelope, we adapt our finite-time convergent algorithm to solve weakly convex nonsmooth optimization problems. In addition, we unify and extend the contemporary results on the KL exponent of the Moreau envelope of weakly convex functions. A dynamical system is also introduced to find a fixed point of a nonexpansive operator in finite time and fixed time under additional regularity properties.

  abstract     = {We investigate an empirical quantile estimation approach to solve chance-constrained nonlinear optimization problems. Our approach is based on the reformulation of the chance constraint as an equivalent quantile constraint to provide stronger signals on the gradient. In this approach, the value of the quantile function is estimated empirically from samples drawn from the random parameters, and the gradient of the quantile function is estimated via a finite-difference approximation on top of the quantile-function-value estimation. We establish a convergence theory of this approach within the framework of an augmented Lagrangian method for solving general nonlinear constrained optimization problems. The foundation of the convergence analysis is a concentration property of the empirical quantile process, and the analysis is divided based on whether or not the quantile function is differentiable. In contrast to the sampling-and-smoothing approach used in the literature, the method developed in this paper does not involve any smoothing function and hence the quantile-function gradient approximation is easier to implement and there are less accuracy-control parameters to tune. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and compare it with a smoothing method for the quantile-gradient estimation. Numerical investigation shows that the two approaches are competitive for certain problem instances.},

The proposed optimality conditions can be elaborated further as second-order conic expressions for robust two-stage quadratic multiobjective optimization problems with separable functions and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. We also propose relaxation schemes for finding a (weak) efficient solution of the robust two-stage multiobjective problem by employing associated semidefinite programming or second-order cone programming relaxations.

The bidimensional situation is particularly analyzed, providing new more precise characterizations than those in higher dimension and joint those given earlier by the authors.

Generally speaking, federated PCA algorithms based on direct adaptations of classic iterative methods, such as simultaneous subspace iterations, are unable to preserve data privacy, while algorithms based on variable-splitting and consensus-seeking, such as alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM), lack in communication-efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel consensus-seeking formulation by equalizing subspaces spanned by splitting variables instead of equalizing variables themselves, thus greatly relaxing feasibility restrictions and allowing much faster convergence. Then we develop an ADMM-like algorithm with several special features to make it practically efficient, including a low-rank multiplier formula and techniques for treating subproblems. We establish that the proposed algorithm can better protect data privacy than classic methods adapted to the federated PCA setting. We derive convergence results, including a worst-case complexity estimate, for the proposed ADMM-like algorithm in the presence of the nonlinear equality constraints. Extensive empirical results are presented to show that the new algorithm, while enhancing data privacy, requires far fewer rounds of communication than existing peer algorithms for federated PCA.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the learning abilities of linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Gradient Descent. We present a theoretical guarantee demonstrating that these linear RNNs can effectively learn any stable linear dynamical system with polynomial complexity. Importantly, our derived generalization error bound is independent of the episode length. For any stable linear system with a transition matrix C characterized by a parameter $$\rho _C$$ related to the spectral radius, we prove that despite the non-convexity of the parameter optimization loss, a linear RNN can learn the system with polynomial sample and time complexity in $$\frac{1}{1-\rho _C}$$ , provided that the RNN has sufficient width. Notably, the required width of the hidden layers does not depend on the length of the input sequence. This work provides the first rigorous theoretical foundation for learning linear RNNs. Our findings suggest that linear RNNs are capable of efficiently learning complex dynamical systems, paving the way for further research into the learning capabilities of more general RNN architectures.},

The method iteratively computes Pareto critical points, where in each iteration, an approximation of the Clarke subdifferential is computed in an efficient manner and then used to compute a common descent direction for all objective functions. To prove convergence, we present some new optimality results for nonsmooth multiobjective optimization problems in Hilbert spaces. Using these, we can show that every accumulation point of the sequence generated by our algorithm is Pareto critical under common assumptions. Computational efficiency for finding Pareto critical points is numerically demonstrated for multiobjective optimal control of an obstacle problem.},

We consider a derivative-free algorithm based on a linesearch extrapolation technique. First we prove that it enjoys the same complexity properties which have been proved for pattern and direct search algorithms, namely that the number of iterations and of function evaluations required to drive the norm of the gradient of the objective function below a given threshold $$\epsilon $$ for the first time is $${{\mathcal {O}}}(\epsilon ^{-2})$$ in the worst case. This is the first contribution proving worst-case complexity properties for derivative-free linesearch-type algorithms. Then we show that the lineasearch approach used by the described algorithm allows us to guarantee the further property that the number of iterations such that the norm of the gradient is bigger than $$\epsilon $$ is $$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon ^{-2})$$ in the worst case.},

In this paper, assuming mild regularity hypotheses on the data, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for global asymptotic controllability with regulated cost is the existence of a special, continuous Control Lyapunov Function, called a Minimum Restraint Function. The main novelty is the necessity implication, obtained here for the first time. Nevertheless, the sufficiency condition extends previous results based on semiconcavity of the Minimum Restraint Function, while we require mere continuity.},

In our setting, time-inhomogeneity stems not only from the reward function but, in particular, from the time dependence of the drift coefficient of the one-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) which drives the stopping problem. In order to obtain our results, we mostly employ probabilistic arguments: we use a comparison principle between solutions of the SDE computed at different starting times, and martingale methods of optimal stopping theory. We also show a variant of the main theorem, which weakens one of the assumptions and additionally relies on the renowned connection between optimal stopping and free-boundary problems.},

Although MLMFG covers wide range of real-world applications, its research is still sparse. Notably, fundamental solution methods for this class of problems remain insufficiently established. A prevailing approach is to recast the MLMFG as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) and solve it using a solver. Meanwhile, interpreting the solution to the EPEC in the context of MLMFG may be complex due to shared decision variables among all leaders, followers’ strategies that each leader can unilaterally change, but the variables are essentially controlled by followers. To address this issue, we introduce a response function of followers’ noncooperative game that is a function with leaders’ strategies as a variable. Employing this approach allows the MLMFG to be solved as a single-level differentiable variational inequality using a smoothing scheme for the followers’ response function. We also demonstrate that the sequence of solutions to the smoothed variational inequality converges to a stationary equilibrium of the MLMFG. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the smoothing method by numerical experiments.},

Halperin showed that a point in $$C_1\cap C_2 \cap C_3$$ can be found by iteratively projecting any point $$x_0 \in H$$ onto all the sets in a periodic fashion. The limit point is then the projection of $$x_0$$ onto $$C_1\cap C_2 \cap C_3$$ . Nevertheless, a non-periodic projection order may lead to a non-convergent projection series, as shown by Kopecká, Müller, and Paszkiewicz. This raises the question how many projection orders in $$\{1,2,3\}^{\mathbb {N}}$$ are “well behaved” in the sense that they lead to a convergent projection series. Melo, da Cruz Neto, and de Brito provided a necessary and sufficient condition under which the projection series converges and showed that the “well behaved” projection orders form a large subset in the sense of having full product measure. We show that also from a topological viewpoint the set of “well behaved” projection orders is a large subset: it contains a dense $$G_\delta $$ subset with respect to the product topology. Furthermore, we analyze why the proof of the measure theoretic case cannot be directly adapted to the topological setting.},

This is mainly motivated by the robust requirement in the modeling process as well as the possible calculation error in the numerical process. After that, we investigate qualitative convergence properties as the relaxation parameter tends to zero. Considering the perturbation of ambiguity sets, we further study the quantitative stability of the relaxation DRVI.

Recently, a growing number of local algorithms that build sequences of sets has been devised, following the real nature of multiobjective optimization, where the aim is that of approximating the efficient set. This calls for a new analysis of the necessary optimality conditions for multiobjective optimization. We explore conditions for sets of points that share the same features of the necessary optimality conditions for single-objective optimization. On the one hand, from a theoretical point of view, these conditions define properties that are necessarily satisfied by the (weakly) efficient set. On the other hand, from an algorithmic point of view, any set that does not satisfy the proposed conditions can be easily improved by using first-order information on some objective functions.

Secondly, the connections between $$\varpi $$ and bounded rationality are discussed by an abstract rationality functions. Moreover, we construct the problem space of $$\varpi $$ which is represented by $$\varLambda $$ and show that most $$\varpi \in \varLambda $$ are structurally stable and robust to $$\varepsilon $$ -equilibrium on the meaning of Baire category.

  abstract     = {Global approximations of scalar optimization problems in terms of variational convergence have been studied for several decades. However, there are very few results for vector models in the literature, which are limited to epi-convergence of vector functions, nothing has been obtained for vector bifunctions. This paper is the first attempt to consider approximations of vector optimization in terms of variational convergence of bifunctions. We first consider the vector quasi-equilibrium problem since it encompasses most optimization-related models. Then, we apply the obtained results to the vector Nash quasi-game (vector generalized non-cooperative game), which is one of the most important practical problems in applied mathematics. We approach to the vector problems in question via scalarization. Our scalarization tools are the Tammer and the Hiriart-Urruty scalarization functions. By scalarizing, we define types of vector variational convergence corresponding to some types of scalar variational convergence. We show that under these types of convergence of problems approximating the vector problems under consideration, approximate solutions of the former problems tend to solutions of the latter ones in the sense of set convergence.},

It is shown that the considered problem is ill-posed, and thus, some regularization method has to be employed in order to obtain stable approximations. In this regard, we obtain regularized approximations by solving some non linear integral equations which is derived by considering a truncated version of the Fourier expansion of the sought solution. Under different Gevrey smoothness assumptions on the exact solution, we provide parameter choice strategies and obtain the error estimates. A key tool in deriving such estimates is a version of Grönwalls’ inequality for iterated integrals, which perhaps, is proposed and analysed for the first time.},

Solving the non-Lipschitz MPEC is highly challenging since the standard constraint qualifications fail due to the existence of equilibrium constraints and the subdifferential of the objective function is unbounded due to the existence of the non-Lipschitz function. On the one hand, for tackling the non-Lipschitzness of the objective function, we introduce a novel class of locally Lipschitz approximation functions that consolidate and unify a diverse range of existing smoothing techniques for the non-Lipschitz function. On the other hand, we use the Kanzow and Schwartz regularization scheme to approximate the equilibrium constraints since this regularization can preserve certain perpendicular structure as in equilibrium constraints, which can induce better convergence results. Then an approximation method is proposed for solving the non-Lipschitz MPEC and its convergence is established under weak conditions. In contrast with existing results, the proposed method can converge to a better stationary point under weaker qualification conditions. Finally, a computational study on the sparse solutions of linear complementarity problems is presented. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We show that there is a setting where the newly introduced system preserves and even improves the well-known fast convergence properties of the function and Moreau envelope along the trajectories and also of the gradient of Moreau envelope due to the presence of time scaling.

Unfortunately, to date, the iterative numerical methods to find even only the local minima of these nonconvex cost functions are extremely slow and strongly affected by the initialization chosen. We devise a predictor–corrector strategy that efficiently computes locally optimal solutions to these problems. An initialization-free convex minimization allows to predict a global good preliminary candidate, which is then corrected by solving a parameter-free nonconvex minimization. A simple algorithm, such as alternating direction method of multipliers works surprisingly well in producing good solutions. This strategy is applied to the challenging problem of decomposing a 1D signal into semantically distinct components mathematically identified by smooth, piecewise-constant, oscillatory structured and unstructured (noise) parts.},

  abstract     = {We consider robust empirical risk minimization (ERM), where model parameters are chosen to minimize the worst-case empirical loss when each data point varies over a given convex uncertainty set. In some simple cases, such problems can be expressed in an analytical form. In general the problem can be made tractable via dualization, which turns a min-max problem into a min-min problem. Dualization requires expertise and is tedious and error-prone. We demonstrate how CVXPY can be used to automate this dualization procedure in a user-friendly manner. Our framework allows practitioners to specify and solve robust ERM problems with a general class of convex losses, capturing many standard regression and classification problems. Users can easily specify any complex uncertainty set that is representable via disciplined convex programming (DCP) constraints.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we advocate for Isaacs’ method for the solution of differential games to be applied to the solution of optimal control problems. To make the argument, the vehicle employed is Pontryagin’s canonical optimal control example, which entails a double integrator plant. However, rather than controlling the state to the origin, we require the end state to reach a terminal set that contains the origin in its interior. Indeed, in practice, it is required to control to a prescribed tolerance rather than reach a desired end state; constraining the end state to a terminal manifold of co-dimension n − 1 renders the optimal control problem easier to solve. The global solution of the optimal control problem is obtained and the synthesized optimal control law is in state feedback form. In this respect, two target sets are considered: a smooth circular target and a square target with corners. Closed-loop state-feedback control laws are synthesized that drive the double integrator plant from an arbitrary initial state to the target set in minimum time. This is accomplished using Isaacs’ method for the solution of differential games, which entails dynamic programming (DP), working backward from the usable part of the target set, as opposed to obtaining the optimal trajectories using the necessary conditions for optimality provided by Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP). In this paper, the case is made for Isaacs’ method for the solution of differential games to be applied to the solution of optimal control problems by way of the juxtaposition of the PMP and DP methods.},

  abstract     = {Total least squares (TLS), also named as errors in variables in statistical analysis, is an effective method for solving linear equations with the situations, when noise is not just in observation data but also in mapping operations. Besides, the Tikhonov regularization is widely considered in plenty of ill-posed problems. Moreover, the structure of mapping operator plays a crucial role in solving the TLS problem. Tensor operators have some advantages over the characterization of models, which requires us to build the corresponding theory on the tensor TLS. This paper proposes tensor regularized TLS and structured tensor TLS methods for solving ill-conditioned and structured tensor equations, respectively, adopting a tensor-tensor-product. Properties and algorithms for the solution of these approaches are also presented and proved. Based on this method, some applications in image and video deblurring are explored. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of our methods, compared with some existing methods.},

The cost functional is the solution of the backward stochastic differential equation at the initial time.

One is the outer approximation technique, which tightens the relaxed feasible region of EP and improves the upper bound by carefully examining suitable feasible points. The other is the branch and bound technique to guarantee the global optimality of the solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm, thereby underscoring its potential for real-world applications.},

Our framework employs an analytical description of the distance from an arbitrary point to the reachable set of the plant. The proposed algorithm is always convergent and cannot be improved without losing the guarantee of its convergence to the correct solution for arbitrary Lipschitz continuous trajectories of the moving target. In practice, it is difficult to obtain an analytical description of the distance to the reachable set for the sophisticated state equation of the plant. Nevertheless, it was shown that the distance can be obtained for some widely used models, such as the Dubins car, in an explicit form. Finally, we illustrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed framework for simple motions and the Dubins model.},

Given distances between data points and a target low-dimension, the MDS problem seeks to find a configuration of these points in the low-dimensional space, such that the inter-point distances are preserved as well as possible. We focus on the most common approach to formulate the MDS problem, known as stress minimization, which results in a challenging non-smooth and non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an inertial version of the well-known SMACOF Algorithm, which we call AI-SMACOF. This algorithm is proven to be globally convergent, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first result of this kind for algorithms aiming at solving the stress MDS minimization. In addition to the theoretical findings, numerical experiments provide another evidence for the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

The method involves adding one parameter to the search direction of the memoryless self-scaling Broyden family on the manifold. Moreover, it uses a general map instead of vector transport. This idea has already been proposed within a general framework of Riemannian conjugate gradient methods where one can use vector transport, scaled vector transport, or an inverse retraction. We show that the search direction satisfies the sufficient descent condition under some assumptions on the parameters. In addition, we show global convergence of the proposed method under the Wolfe conditions. We numerically compare it with existing methods, including Riemannian conjugate gradient methods and the memoryless spectral-scaling Broyden family. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method with the BFGS formula is suitable for solving an off-diagonal cost function minimization problem on an oblique manifold.},

  abstract     = {Many problems of substantial current interest in machine learning, statistics, and data science can be formulated as sparse and low-rank optimization problems. In this paper, we present the nonconvex exterior-point optimization solver (NExOS)—a first-order algorithm tailored to sparse and low-rank optimization problems. We consider the problem of minimizing a convex function over a nonconvex constraint set, where the set can be decomposed as the intersection of a compact convex set and a nonconvex set involving sparse or low-rank constraints. Unlike the convex relaxation approaches, NExOS finds a locally optimal point of the original problem by solving a sequence of penalized problems with strictly decreasing penalty parameters by exploiting the nonconvex geometry. NExOS solves each penalized problem by applying a first-order algorithm, which converges linearly to a local minimum of the corresponding penalized formulation under regularity conditions. Furthermore, the local minima of the penalized problems converge to a local minimum of the original problem as the penalty parameter goes to zero. We then implement and test NExOS on many instances from a wide variety of sparse and low-rank optimization problems, empirically demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms specialized methods.},

Notably, it serves as a cornerstone for the extension of semidefinite programming into the domain of tensor fields, referred to as T-semidefinite programming. The analytical perturbation analysis delves into the sensitivity of T-eigenvalues for third-order tensors with square frontal slices, marking the first main part of this study. Three classical results from the matrix domain into the tensor domain are extended. Firstly, this paper presents the Gershgorin disc theorem for tensors, demonstrating the confinement of all T-eigenvalues within a union of Gershgorin discs. Afterward, generalizations of the Bauer-Fike theorem are provided, each applicable to different cases involving tensors, including those that are F-diagonalizable and those that are not. Lastly, the Kahan theorem is presented, addressing the perturbation of a Hermite tensor by any tensors. Additionally, the analysis establishes connections between the T-eigenvalue problem and various optimization problems. The second main part of the paper focuses on tensor pseudospectra theory, presenting four equivalent definitions to characterize tensor $$\varepsilon $$ -pseudospectra. Accompanied by a thorough analysis of their properties and illustrative visualizations, this section also explores the application of tensor $$\varepsilon $$ -pseudospectra in identifying more T-positive definite tensors.},

We use this reformulation to establish explicit, closed form solutions when the underlying variables are one dimensional, for a large class of output functions. For higher dimensional underlying variables, we identify conditions on the output function and marginal distributions under which solutions concentrate on graphs over the first variable and are unique, and, for general output functions, we find upper bounds on the dimension of the support of the solution. We also establish a stability result on the maximal value and maximizing joint distributions when the output function, marginal distributions and spectral function are perturbed; in addition, when the variables one dimensional, we show that the optimal value exhibits Lipschitz dependence on the marginal distributions for a certain class of output functions. Finally, we show that the equivalence to a multi-marginal optimal transport problem extends to maximal correlation measures of multi-dimensional risks; in this setting, we again establish conditions under which the solution concentrates on a graph over the first marginal.},

We derive a worst-case convergence rate of $$O(1/\sqrt{N})$$ after N iterations of the objective gradient norm for certain classes of DC problems, without assuming strong convexity in the DC decomposition and give an example which shows the convergence rate is exact. We also provide a new convergence rate of O(1/N) for the DCA with the second termination criterion.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the relaxed proximal point algorithm for solving monotone variational inequality problems, and our main contribution is the establishment of a tight ergodic sublinear convergence rate. First, the tight or exact worst-case convergence rate is computed using the performance estimation framework. It is observed that this numerical bound asymptotically coincides with the best-known existing rate, whose tightness is not clear. This implies that, without further assumptions, sublinear convergence rate is likely the best achievable rate for the relaxed proximal point algorithm. Motivated by the numerical result, a concrete example is constructed, which provides a lower bound on the exact worst-case convergence rate. This lower bound coincides with the numerical bound computed via the performance estimation framework, leading us to conjecture that the lower bound provided by the example is exactly the tight worse-case rate, which is then verified theoretically. We thus have established an ergodic sublinear complexity rate that is tight in terms of both the sublinear order and the constants involved.},

In general, such problems are non-smooth in nature (plasticity condition, unilateral condition, etc.), which makes their numerical resolution through standard Newton methods quite difficult. Their formulation as conic programs alleviates this difficulty since large-scale conic optimization problems can now be solved in a very robust and efficient manner, thanks to the development of dedicated interior-point algorithms.

  abstract     = {Multiple variable splitting is a general technique for decomposing problems by using copies of variables and additional linking constraints that equate their values. The resulting large optimization problem can be solved with a specialized interior-point method that exploits the problem structure and computes the Newton direction with a combination of direct and iterative solvers (i.e. Cholesky factorizations and preconditioned conjugate gradients for linear systems related to, respectively, subproblems and new linking constraints). The present work applies this method to solving real-world binary classification and novelty (or outlier) detection problems by means of, respectively, two-class and one-class linear support vector machines (SVMs). Unlike previous interior-point approaches for SVMs, which were practical only with low-dimensional points, the new proposal can also deal with high-dimensional data. The new method is compared with state-of-the-art solvers for SVMs that are based on either interior-point algorithms (such as SVM-OOPS) or specific algorithms developed by the machine learning community (such as LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR). The computational results show that, for two-class SVMs, the new proposal is competitive not only against previous interior-point methods—and much more efficient than they are with high-dimensional data—but also against LIBSVM, whereas LIBLINEAR generally outperformed the proposal. For one-class SVMs, the new method consistently outperformed all other approaches, in terms of either solution time or solution quality.},

We summarize the most important theoretical results and properties related to sufficient matrices. Based on these, we propose different construction rules that can be used to generate new matrices that belong to this class. A nonnegative number can be assigned to each sufficient matrix, which is called its handicap and works as a measure of sufficiency. The handicap plays a crucial role in proving convergence and complexity results for interior point algorithms for linear complementarity problems. For a particular sufficient matrix, called Csizmadia’s matrix, we give the exact value of the handicap, which is exponential in the size of the matrix. Another important topic that we address is deciding whether a matrix is sufficient. Tseng proved in 2000 that this decision problem is co-NP hard. We investigate three different algorithms for determining the sufficiency of a given matrix: Väliaho’s algorithm, a linear programming-based algorithm, and an algorithm that facilitates nonlinear programming reformulations of the definition of sufficiency. We tested the efficiency of these methods on our recently launched benchmark data set that consists of four different sets of matrices. In this paper, we give the description and most important properties of the benchmark set, which can be used in the future to compare the performance of different interior point algorithms for linear complementarity problems.},

  abstract     = {The interior-point method (IPM) has become the workhorse method for nonlinear programming. The performance of IPM is directly related to the linear solver employed to factorize the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) system at each iteration of the algorithm. When solving large-scale nonlinear problems, state-of-the art IPM solvers rely on efficient sparse linear solvers to solve the KKT system. Instead, we propose a novel reduced-space IPM algorithm that condenses the KKT system into a dense matrix whose size is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the problem. Depending on where the reduction occurs, we derive two variants of the reduced-space method: linearize-then-reduce and reduce-then-linearize. We adapt their workflow so that the vast majority of computations are accelerated on GPUs. We provide extensive numerical results on the optimal power flow problem, comparing our GPU-accelerated reduced-space IPM with Knitro and a hybrid full-space IPM algorithm. By evaluating the derivatives on the GPU and solving the KKT system on the CPU, the hybrid solution is already significantly faster than the CPU-only solutions. The two reduced-space algorithms go one step further by solving the KKT system entirely on the GPU. As expected, the performance of the two reduction algorithms depends critically on the number of available degrees of freedom: They underperform the full-space method when the problem has many degrees of freedom, but the two algorithms are up to three times faster than Knitro as soon as the relative number of degrees of freedom becomes smaller.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing has attracted significant interest in the optimization community because it potentially can solve classes of optimization problems faster than conventional supercomputers. Several researchers proposed quantum computing methods, especially quantum interior point methods (QIPMs), to solve convex conic optimization problems. Most of them have applied a quantum linear system algorithm at each iteration to compute a Newton step. However, using quantum linear solvers in QIPMs comes with many challenges, such as having ill-conditioned systems and the considerable error of quantum solvers. This paper investigates in detail the use of quantum linear solvers in QIPMs. Accordingly, an Inexact Infeasible Quantum Interior Point (II-QIPM) is developed to solve linear optimization problems. We also discuss how we can get an exact solution by iterative refinement (IR) without excessive time of quantum solvers. The proposed IR-II-QIPM shows exponential speed-up with respect to precision compared to previous II-QIPMs. Additionally, we present a quantum-inspired classical variant of the proposed IR-II-QIPM where QLSAs are replaced by conjugate gradient methods. This classic IR-II-IPM has some advantages compared to its quantum counterpart, as well as previous classic inexact infeasible IPMs. Finally, computational results with a QISKIT implementation of our QIPM using quantum simulators are presented and analyzed.},

The specific eligible kernel function is used to define an equivalent form of the central path, the proximity measure, and to obtain search directions. Full-Newton steps are adopted to avoid the line search at each iteration. It is shown that with appropriate choices of the parameters, and a certain condition on the starting point, the iterations always lie in the defined neighborhood of the central path. Assuming strict feasibility of $$P_{*}(\kappa )$$ -WLCP, it is shown that the IPM converges to the $$\varepsilon $$ -approximate solution of $$P_{*}(\kappa )$$ -WLCP in a polynomial number of iterations. Few numerical results are provided to indicate the computational performance of the algorithm.},

The new algorithm combines two important approaches from the literature: the main ideas of the long-step interior point algorithm introduced by Ai and Zhang and the algebraic equivalent transformation technique proposed by Darvay. Similar to the method of Ai and Zhang, our algorithm also works in a wide neighborhood of the central path and has the best known iteration complexity of short-step variants. However, due to the properties of the applied transforming function in Darvay’s technique, the wide neighborhood definition in the analysis depends on the value of the handicap. We implemented not only the theoretical algorithm but a greedy variant of the new method (working in a neighborhood independent of the handicap) in MATLAB and tested its efficiency on both sufficient and non-sufficient problem instances. In addition to presenting our numerical results, we also make some interesting observations regarding the analysis of Ai–Zhang type methods.},

We apply the algebraically equivalent transformation technique proposed by Darvay (Adv Model Optim 5:51–92, 2003), and we use the difference of the identity and the square root function to determine the new search directions. In each iteration, the proposed algorithm performs one predictor and one corrector step. We prove that the predictor–corrector interior-point algorithm has the same complexity bound as the best known interior-point methods for solving these types of problems.

The results in this paper further explore the convergence behavior of the forward–reflected–backward splitting algorithm with momentum terms.

We reformulate the GNEP into an unconstrained optimization problem using a complementarity function and solve it by the proposed method. It is found that the proposed numerical scheme has the global convergence property for both types of GNEPs. The strong BD-regularity assumption for the reformulated system of GNEP plays a crucial role in global convergence. In fact, the strong BD-regularity assumption and a suitable choice of a forcing sequence expedite the inexact Newton method to Q-quadratic convergence. The efficiency of the proposed numerical scheme is shown for a collection of problems, including the realistic internet switching problem, where selfish users generate traffic. A comparison of the proposed method with the existing semi-smooth Newton method II for GNEP is provided, which indicates that the proposed scheme is more efficient.},

This is clearly contrary to what it is possible to do in the real world. Surprisingly, it seems that there are not many contributions in that direction in the literature, except for a finite number of states. In this paper, for arbitrary $$\Omega $$ , we show that, in discrete-time, it is possible to evaluate the minimal super-hedging price when we restrict ourselves to integer-valued strategies. To do so, we only consider terminal claims that are continuous piecewise affine functions of the underlying asset. We formulate a dynamic programming principle that can be directly implemented on historical data and which also provides the optimal integer-valued strategy. The problem with general payoffs remains open but should be solved with the same approach.},

The main cause is the increase of carbon emissions in the atmosphere, so it is urgent to reduce carbon emissions. In order to establish the optimal pricing strategy as well as the emission reduction effort strategy for companies who produce and sell low carbon products, this paper proposes an optimal control model for low carbon products. The reduction of the carbon emission for the product is described dynamically by a differential equation, and the analytical expressions of the optimal pricing and the emission abatement strategies are derived using the Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Finally, the numerical experiments are used to explain the results obtained. The results show that companies producing and selling low-carbon products must pay more attention to the amount of carbon emission reduction in their products, and make more efforts to reduce emissions in order to make more profits. Additionally, the parametric analysis shows that expanding market size and reducing inventory depletion can be equally helpful in shortening the sales cycle and boosting profits.},

The insurer aims to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth. By utilizing the dynamic programming principle and verification theorem, we obtain the optimal reinsurance strategy and corresponding value function in closed-form from the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation under an exponential utility function. We show that the claim-dependent proportional reinsurance is optimal among all types of reinsurance under the exponential utility maximization criterion. In addition, we present several analytical properties and numerical examples of the derived optimal strategy and provide economic insights through analytical and numerical analyses.

  abstract     = {Real partially symmetric tensors arise from the strong ellipticity condition problem in solid mechanics and the entanglement problem in quantum physics. In this paper, we try to compute the smallest V-singular value of partially symmetric tensors with orders (p, q). This is a unified notion in a broad sense that, when $$(p,q)=(2,2)$$ , the V-singular value coincides with the notion of M-eigenvalue. To do that, we propose a generalized inverse power method with a shift variable to compute the smallest V-singular value and eigenvectors. Global convergence of the algorithm is established. Furthermore, it is proven that the proposed algorithm always converges to the smallest V-singular value and the associated eigenvectors. Several numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, rigid body static optimization is investigated on the Riemannian manifold of rigid body motion groups. This manifold, which is also a matrix manifold, provides a framework to formulate translational and rotational motions of the body, while considering any coupling between those motions, and uses members of the special orthogonal group $$\textsf{SO}(3)$$ to represent the rotation. Hence, it is called the special Euclidean group $$\textsf{SE}(3)$$ . Formalism of rigid body motion on $$\textsf{SE}(3)$$ does not fall victim to singularity or non-uniqueness issues associated with attitude parameterization sets. Benefiting from Riemannian matrix manifolds and their metrics, a generic framework for unconstrained static optimization and a customizable framework for constrained static optimization are proposed that build a foundation for dynamic optimization of rigid body motions on $$\textsf{SE}(3)$$ and its tangent bundle. The study of Riemannian manifolds from the perspective of rigid body motion introduced here provides an accurate tool for optimization of rigid body motions, avoiding any biases that could otherwise occur in rotational motion representation if attitude parameterization sets were used.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an improved retractable body model (IRBM) is established, which has an advantage in simulating the flexion-and-extension motion of skier’s legs during carved turning and straight gliding. The trajectory optimization problem for the nonlinear alpine skiing system is transformed into a multi-phase optimal control (MPOC) problem. Subsequently, a constrained multi-phase trajectory optimization model is developed based on the optimal control theory, where the optimization target is to minimize the total skiing time. The optimization model is discretized by using the Radau pseudospectral method (RPM), which transcribes the MPOC problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that is then solved by SNOPT solver. Through numerical simulations, the optimization results under different constraints are obtained using MATLAB. The variation characteristics of the variables and trajectories are analyzed, and four influencing factors related to the skiing time are investigated by comparative experiments. It turns out that the small turning radius can reduce the total skiing time, the flexion-and-extension motion of legs is beneficial to skier’s performance, and the large inclination angle can shorten skier’s turning time, while the control force has a slight effect on the skiing time. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed models and trajectory optimization strategies are validated by simulation and experiment results.},

  abstract     = {The concept of perfect equilibrium, formulated by Selten (Int J Game Theory 4:25–55, 1975), serves as an effective characterization of rationality in strategy perturbation. In our study, we propose a modified version of perfect equilibrium that incorporates perturbation control parameters. To match the beliefs with the equilibrium choice probabilities, the logistic quantal response equilibrium (logistic QRE) was established by McKelvey and Palfrey (Games Econ Behav 10:6–38, 1995), which is only able to select a Nash equilibrium. By introducing a linear combination between a mixed strategy profile and a given vector with positive elements, this paper develops a variant of the logistic QRE for the selection of the special version of perfect equilibrium. Expanding upon this variant, we construct an equilibrium system that incorporates an exponential function of an extra variable. Through rigorous error-bound analysis, we demonstrate that the solution set of this equilibrium system leads to a perfect equilibrium as the extra variable approaches zero. Consequently, we establish the existence of a smooth path to a perfect equilibrium and employ an exponential transformation of variables to ensure numerical stability. To make a numerical comparison, we capitalize on a variant of the square-root QRE, which yields another smooth path to a perfect equilibrium. Numerical results further verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed differentiable path-following methods.},

The Pareto front for the curves on the torus turns out to be particularly interesting: the front is disconnected and it reveals two distinct Riemannian cubics with the same boundary data, which is the first known nontrivial instance of this kind.

Desirable attributes for financial portfolios include persistence, smoothness, long memory, and higher auto-correlation. We argue that these properties can be achieved by adjusting the composition weights of the portfolio. Considering the fractal nature of typical financial time series, the fractal dimension emerges as a natural metric to gauge the smoothness of the portfolio trajectory. Specifically, the Hurst exponent is designed for measuring the persistence of time series. In this paper, we introduce an optimization method inspired by the Hurst exponent and signal processing to mitigate the irregularities in the portfolio trajectory. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach using real data from an S &amp;P100 dataset.},

Solving a sequence of strictly convex subproblems with straightforward solutions in several settings gives the proposed algorithm high computational efficiency while delivering reliable results: our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm asymptotically computes critical angles. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency of our approach, even when dealing with problems of relatively large dimensions: only a few seconds are necessary to compute critical angles between different types of cones in spaces of dimension 1000.},

The paper shows that, in a certain class of maxmin optimization problems, it is possible to associate a population game to a given maxmin problem in such a way that solutions to the optimization problem are found from Nash equilibria of the associated game. Iterative solution methods for maxmin optimization problems can then be derived from systems of differential equations whose trajectories are known to converge to Nash equilibria. In particular, we use a discrete-time version of the celebrated replicator equation of evolutionary game theory, also known in machine learning as the exponential multiplicative weights algorithm. The resulting algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method, which is well known in numerical analysis as a useful technique for solving Chebyshev function approximation problems on a finite grid. Examples are provided to show the use of the generalized IRLS method in collective investment and in decision making under model uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Difference-of-Convex (DC) decomposition for polynomials using a power-sum representation, achieved by solving a sparse linear system. We introduce the Boosted DCA with Exact Line Search ( $$\hbox {BDCA}_\text {e}$$ ) for addressing linearly constrained polynomial programs within the DC framework. Notably, we demonstrate that the exact line search equates to determining the roots of a univariate polynomial in an interval, with coefficients being computed explicitly based on the power-sum DC decompositions. The subsequential convergence of $$\hbox {BDCA}_\text {e}$$ to critical points is proven, and its convergence rate under the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property is established. To efficiently tackle the convex subproblems, we integrate the Fast Dual Proximal Gradient method by exploiting the separable block structure of the power-sum DC decompositions. We validate our approach through numerical experiments on the Mean–Variance–Skewness–Kurtosis portfolio optimization model and box-constrained polynomial optimization problems. Comparative analysis of $$\hbox {BDCA}_\text {e}$$ against DCA, BDCA with Armijo line search, UDCA, and UBDCA with projective DC decomposition, alongside standard nonlinear optimization solvers FMINCON and FILTERSD, substantiates the efficiency of our proposed approach.},

Our approach builds upon semialgebraic (definable) assumptions commonly met in practical situations and combines a nonsmooth calculus with a differential inclusion method. Additionally, we provide general conditions for the sample distribution to ensure the convergence of the objective function. Our results are general enough to justify the use of subgradient sampling in modern implementations that heuristically apply rules of differential calculus on nonsmooth functions, such as backpropagation or implicit differentiation. As for the stochastic subgradient method, our analysis highlights that subgradient sampling can make the stochastic heavy ball method converge to artificial critical points. Thanks to the semialgebraic setting, we address this concern showing that these artifacts are almost surely avoided when initializations are randomized, leading the method to converge to Clarke critical points.},

We provide numerical experiments that showcase the practical computational advantage of I-CBPG for certain fixed tolerances of approximation error and for a dynamically decreasing error tolerance regime in particular. Our experimental results indicate that cyclic methods with dynamically decreasing error tolerance regimes can actually outpace their randomized siblings with fixed error tolerance regimes. We establish a tight relationship between inexact pre-conditioned proximal map evaluations and $$\delta $$ -subgradients in our $$(\delta ,B)$$ -Second Prox theorem.

The nonconvex second-order cone can be used to reformulate nonconvex quadratic programming and nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program in conic format. The cone can also arise in real-world applications, such as facility location problems in optimization when some existing facilities are more likely to be closer to new facilities than other existing facilities. We define notions of the algebraic structure of the nonconvex second-order cone and show that its ambient space is commutative and power-associative, wherein elements always have real eigenvalues; this is remarkable because it is not the case for arbitrary Jordan algebras. We will also find that the ambient space of this nonconvex cone is rank-independent of its dimension; this is also notable because it is not the case for algebras of arbitrary convex cones. What is more noteworthy is that we prove that the nonconvex second-order cone equals the cone of squares of its ambient space; this is not the case for all non-Euclidean Jordan algebras. Finally, numerous algebraic properties that already exist in the framework of the convex second-order cone are generalized to the framework of the nonconvex second-order cone.},

Moreover, we show that this lower bound nearly matches the upper bound attained by non-adaptive search algorithms, for the commonly used squared exponential kernel and the Matérn kernel with a large smoothness parameter $$\nu $$ . This matching is up to a replacement of d/2 by d and a logarithmic term $$\log \frac{R}{\epsilon }$$ , where d is the dimension of input space, R is the upper bound for the norm of the unknown black-box function, and $$\epsilon $$ is the desired accuracy.

To this end, we define a novel inertial gradient-like dynamical system in the multiobjective setting, which trajectories converge weakly to Pareto optimal solutions. Discretization of this system yields an inertial multiobjective algorithm which generates sequences that converge weakly to Pareto optimal solutions. We employ Nesterov acceleration to define an algorithm with an improved convergence rate compared to the plain multiobjective steepest descent method (Algorithm 1). A further improvement in terms of efficiency is achieved by avoiding the solution of a quadratic subproblem to compute a common step direction for all objective functions, which is usually required in first-order methods. Using a different discretization of our inertial gradient-like dynamical system, we obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method that does not require the solution of a subproblem in each step (Algorithm 2). While this algorithm does not converge in general, it yields good results on test problems while being faster than standard steepest descent.},

Theoretical complexity guarantees under smoothness assumptions are presented. We prove linear convergence when both smoothness and the PL-condition are assumed.

In GRNM-PD, a general positive definite symmetric matrix is used to regularize the generalized Hessian, in contrast to the recently proposed GRNM, which uses the identity matrix. Our approach features global convergence and fast local convergence rate even for problems with nonisolated solutions. To this end, we introduce the p-order semismooth $${}^*$$ property which plays the same role in our analysis as Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian does in the $$C^2$$ case. Imposing only the metric q-subregularity of the gradient at a solution, we establish global convergence of the proposed algorithm as well as its local convergence rate, which can be superlinear, quadratic, or even higher than quadratic, depending on an algorithmic parameter $$\rho $$ and the regularity parameters p and q. Specifically, choosing $$\rho $$ to be one, we achieve quadratic local convergence rate under metric subregularity and the strong semismooth $${^*}$$ property. The algorithm is applied to a class of nonsmooth convex composite minimization problems through the machinery of forward–backward envelope. The greater flexibility in the choice of regularization matrices leads to notable improvement in practical performance. Numerical experiments on box-constrained quadratic programming problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider multi-objective optimization problems with a sparsity constraint on the vector of variables. For this class of problems, inspired by the homonymous necessary optimality condition for sparse single-objective optimization, we define the concept of L-stationarity and we analyze its relationships with other existing conditions and Pareto optimality concepts. We then propose two novel algorithmic approaches: the first one is an iterative hard thresholding method aiming to find a single L-stationary solution, while the second one is a two-stage algorithm designed to construct an approximation of the whole Pareto front. Both methods are characterized by theoretical properties of convergence to points satisfying necessary conditions for Pareto optimality. Moreover, we report numerical results establishing the practical effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.},

In this paper, we establish that a matrix game A, with a value of zero, is completely mixed if and only if the value of the game associated with $$A +D_i $$ is positive for all i, where $$D_i$$ represents a diagonal matrix where ith diagonal entry is 1 and else 0. Additionally, we address Kaplansky’s question from 1945 regarding whether an odd-ordered symmetric game can be completely mixed, and provide characterizations for odd-ordered skew-symmetric matrices to be completely mixed. Moreover, we demonstrate that if A is an almost skew-symmetric matrix and the game associated with A has value positive, then $$A +D_i \in Q$$ for all i, where $$D_i$$ is a diagonal matrix whose ith diagonal entry is 1 and else 0. Skew-symmetric matrices and almost skew-symmetric matrices with value positive fall under the class of $$P_0$$ and $$Q_0$$ , making them amenable to processing through Lemke’s algorithm.},

Previous works have focused on investigating its E-eigenpairs problem, and made some theoretical achievements concerning the number and the local optimality of E-eigenpairs. However, concerning local optimality of each eigenpair, the existing work only analyzed the third-order tensor case. In this paper, we further exploit this issue for any higher-order tensors by checking second-order necessary condition of the related constrained optimization model and deducing an equivalent matrix formula criterion for local optimality identification. Finally, a generalized conclusion for local optimality of eigenpairs for odeco tensors is provided, and some simulated experiments are conducted for validation.},

Due to the characteristics of AM, and in order to optimize its process, a new approach is introduced to the problem: the discretization of each layer to be printed. This involves establishing an order relation based on the sequence in which the layers should be printed. The valid orders for the execution of the process, referred to as compatible with the order relation, will be characterized. Additionally, algorithms will be provided to obtain new compatible orders from others that were already compatible, and strategies will be presented to optimally and efficiently reorder non-compatible orders, converting them into compatible ones.},

The ingredient of the augmented Lagrangian here includes the indicator function of a sparse set and a composition of the Moreau envelope of the indicator function of a second-order regular set and a twice continuously differentiable mapping. The main process depends heavily on the calculation of the second-order epi-derivative of the indicator function of sparse set which is shown to be second-order regular and also parabolically regular. The second-order sufficient conditions for the sparse nonlinear programming, the sparse inverse covariance selection problem, and the sparse second-order cone programming are obtained as special cases of our general results. We prove that the existence of augmented Lagrange multipliers ensures the exactness of penalty functions and the stability of augmented solutions under small perturbations of the corresponding augmented Lagrange multipliers.},

To this end, we extend some properties and existence results of a solution for differential inclusions on Hadamard manifolds. As a second contribution, we show how the KL inequality can be used to obtain the convergence of the gradient method for solving convex feasibility problems on Hadamard manifolds. The convergence results of the alternating projection method are also established for cyclic and random projections on Hadamard manifolds and, more generally, CAT(0) spaces.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional time-optimal paths of objects moving under the influence of an external force are discussed based on an analysis of Jacobi stability in Finsler space. When the external force on an object can be described by a function of only one variable, the deviation curvature tensor that determines the Jacobi stability of the object’s path can be obtained from the equation of the path. In such cases, the Jacobi stability of the path is represented by the trace of the deviation curvature tensor. The relationship between the Jacobi stability and the type of path is considered for a force that is described by a single-variable trigonometric function. This type of periodic external force induces a path that extends radially and a path along in a specific direction. Then, we consider the time-averaged eigenvalues of the deviation curvature tensor for each type. A large peak in these average values is observed when the type of path changes. Therefore, the Jacobi instability becomes very large at the boundaries between the path types, and the Jacobi stability analysis can be used as the basis of a classification of the path types.},

  abstract     = {The hand-eye calibration problem is an important application problem in robot research. Based on the 2-norm of dual quaternion vectors, we propose a new dual quaternion optimization method for the hand-eye calibration problem. The dual quaternion optimization problem is decomposed to two quaternion optimization subproblems. The first quaternion optimization subproblem governs the rotation of the robot hand. It can be solved efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition. If the optimal value of the first quaternion optimization subproblem is zero, then the system is rotationwise noiseless, i.e., there exists a “perfect” robot hand motion which meets all the testing poses rotationwise exactly. In this case, we apply the regularization technique for solving the second subproblem to minimize the distance of the translation. Otherwise we apply the patching technique to solve the second quaternion optimization subproblem. Then solving the second quaternion optimization subproblem turns out to be solving a quadratically constrained quadratic program. In this way, we give a complete description for the solution set of hand-eye calibration problems. This is new in the hand-eye calibration literature. The numerical results are also presented to show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Focusing mainly on the behavior of the second subderivative and subgradient proto-derivative of polyhedral functions, i.e., functions with polyhedral convex epigraphs, we demonstrate that choosing the underlying subgradient, utilized in the definitions of these concepts, from the relative interior of the subdifferential of polyhedral functions ensures stronger second-order variational properties such as strict twice epi-differentiability and strict subgradient proto-differentiability. This allows us to characterize continuous differentiability of the proximal mapping and twice continuous differentiability of the Moreau envelope of polyhedral functions.

Then, we prove the associated Fokker–Planck stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) with jumps. Next, we establish a verification theorem for impulse control problems involving conditional McKean–Vlasov jump diffusions. We obtain a Markovian system by combining the state equation with the associated Fokker–Planck SPDE for the conditional law of the state. Then we derive sufficient variational inequalities for a function to be the value function of the impulse control problem, and for an impulse control to be the optimal control. We illustrate our results by applying them to the study of an optimal stream of dividends under transaction costs. We obtain the solution explicitly by finding a function and an associated impulse control, which satisfy the verification theorem.},

In general, it is assumed that the parameters of a geometric programming problem are deterministic and accurate. However, in the real-world geometric programming problem, the parameters are frequently inaccurate and ambiguous. To tackle the ambiguity, this paper investigates the geometric programming problem in an uncertain environment, with the coefficients as triangular and trapezoidal twofold uncertain variables. In this paper, we introduce uncertain measures in a generalized version and focus on more complicated twofold uncertainties to propose triangular and trapezoidal twofold uncertain variables within the context of uncertainty theory. We develop three reduction methods to convert triangular and trapezoidal twofold uncertain variables into singlefold uncertain variables using optimistic, pessimistic, and expected value criteria. Reduction methods are used to convert the geometric programming problem with twofold uncertainty into the geometric programming problem with singlefold uncertainty. Furthermore, the chance-constrained uncertain-based framework is used to solve the reduced singlefold uncertain geometric programming problem. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedures.},

When applied to the consensus optimization problem, the GRPG-ADMM provides a superior safety protection approach to computing an optimal decision for a network of agents connected by edges in an undirected graph. To ensure convergence, we expand the parameter range used in the convex combination step. The algorithm has been implemented to solve a decentralized composite convex consensus optimization problem, resulting in a single-loop decentralized golden ratio proximal gradient algorithm. Notably, the agents do not need to communicate with their neighbors before launching the algorithm. Our algorithm guarantees convergence for both primal and dual iterates, with an ergodic convergence rate of $$\mathcal O(1/k)$$ measured by function value residual and consensus violation. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, we compare its performance with two state-of-the-art algorithms and present numerical results on the decentralized sparse group LASSO problem and the decentralized compressed sensing problem.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the problem of approximating a not necessarily bounded spectrahedral shadow, a certain convex set, by polyhedra. By identifying the set with its homogenization, the problem is reduced to the approximation of a closed convex cone. We introduce the notion of homogeneous $$\delta $$ -approximation of a convex set and show that it defines a meaningful concept in the sense that approximations converge to the original set if the approximation error $$\delta $$ diminishes. Moreover, we show that a homogeneous $$\delta $$ -approximation of the polar of a convex set is immediately available from an approximation of the set itself under mild conditions. Finally, we present an algorithm for the computation of homogeneous $$\delta $$ -approximations of spectrahedral shadows and demonstrate it on examples.},

When the space is finite-dimensional, a globally defined upper semicontinuous base-valued submap is obtained by taking the intersection of the unit sphere, which is compact, with the normal operator, which is closed. Unfortunately, this technique does not work in the infinite-dimensional case. We propose a partition of unity technique to overcome this problem in Banach spaces. An application is given to a quasiconvex quasioptimization problem through the use of a new existence result for generalized quasivariational inequalities which is based on the Schauder fixed point theorem.},

  abstract     = {Subspace minimization conjugate gradient (SMCG) methods are a class of quite efficient iterative methods for unconstrained optimization and have received increasing attention recently. The search directions of SMCG methods are generated by minimizing an approximate model with the approximate matrix $$B_k$$ over the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the current gradient $$g_k $$ and the latest step. The main drawback of SMCG methods is that the parameter $$g_k^TB_kg_k $$ in the search directions must be determined when calculating the search directions. The parameter $$g_k^TB_kg_k $$ is crucial to SMCG methods and is difficult to be determined properly. An alternative solution for this drawback might be to exploit a new way to derive SMCG methods independent of $$g_k^TB_kg_k$$ . The projection technique has been used successfully to derive conjugate gradient directions such as the Dai–Kou conjugate gradient direction (Dai and Kou in SIAM J Optim 23(1):296–320, 2013). Motivated by the above two observations, we use a projection technique to derive a new SMCG method independent of $$g_k^TB_kg_k$$ . More specifically, we project the search direction of memoryless quasi-Newton method into the above two-dimensional subspace and derive a new search direction, which is proved to be descent. Remarkably, the proposed method without any line search enjoys the finite termination property for two-dimensional strictly convex quadratic functions. An adaptive scaling factor in the search direction is exploited based on the finite termination property. The proposed method does not need to determine the parameter $$g_k^TB_kg_k$$ and can be regarded as an extension of the Dai–Kou conjugate gradient method. The global convergence of the proposed method is established under the suitable assumptions. Numerical comparisons on the 147 test functions from the CUTEst library indicate that the proposed method is very promising.},

Moreover, we establish that ACQ and GACQ are sufficient criteria for satisfaction of GGCQ. Several nontrivial numerical examples are furnished in manifold settings to demonstrate the validity of the derived results.

Here, the nonlocal spatial term is more general and we consider a control with one vanishing component. The proof of the result is based on a Carleman estimate where the main difficulty consists in handling the nonlocal spatial terms. One key point corresponds to a particular decomposition of the solution of the adjoint system that allows us to overcome regularity issues. With a similar approach, we also show the existence of insensitizing controls for the same system.},

Based on the eigenvalue study of a symmetric DL-type iteration matrix, another optimal choice of the DL parameter is obtained, which is incorporated in a five-term direction scheme. Combining this with the projection method, a new DL algorithm which converges globally is developed. To implement the algorithm, a derivative-free line search mechanism is employed. Also, by conducting some numerical experiments with the new scheme and some recent DL-type methods, the efficiency of the former in solving nonlinear monotone problems as well as the $$\ell _1-norm$$ regularized problems in compressed sensing is demonstrated.},

Unbiased stochastic rounding yields zero bias by preserving small updates with probabilities proportional to their relative magnitudes. This study provides a theoretical explanation for the stagnation of the gradient descent method in low-precision computation. Additionally, we propose two new stochastic rounding schemes that trade the zero bias property with a larger probability to preserve small gradients. Our methods yield a constant rounding bias that, on average, lies in a descent direction. For convex problems, we prove that the proposed rounding methods typically have a beneficial effect on the convergence rate of gradient descent. We validate our theoretical analysis by comparing the performances of various rounding schemes when optimizing a multinomial logistic regression model and when training a simple neural network with an 8-bit floating-point format.},

We first introduce a maximum transmission time balance problem between two trees $$T_1$$ and $$T_2$$ , where we reduce the maximum transmission time of $$T_1$$ and increase the maximum transmission time of $$T_2$$ until the maximum transmission time of the two trees become equal. We present an analytical form of the objective function of the problem and then design an $$O(n_1^2n_2)$$ algorithm, where $$n_i$$ is the number of vertices of $$T_i$$ with $$i=1, 2$$ . Furthermore, we analyze some optimality conditions of the two inverse problems, which support us to transform them into corresponding maximum transmission time balance problems. Finally, we propose two $$O(n^3)$$ algorithms, where n is the number of vertices in T.},

  abstract     = {We examine a hedonic model featuring uncertain production costs. The aim is to determine equilibrium prices and wages that facilitate the pairing of consumers with teams of producers, even when faced with the veil of uncertainty shrouding production costs. Using the framework of optimal transport theory, we identify the conditions sufficient for the existence of robust matching equilibrium. Our results show that under an additive uncertainty model for production costs, equilibrium can indeed be achieved, characterized by the expectation of the matching outcome under conditions of certainty. However, this model exhibits a twist of indeterminacy into the matching equilibrium. This departure from determinism is a distinctive feature, emphasizing the unique dynamics arising when uncertainty intersects with equilibrium-seeking mechanisms. To emphasize on this feature, we examine a special case which is related to martingale optimal transport. This case also underscores the complexity inherent in situations where uncertainty governs the equilibrium landscape. Altogether, our results offer a fresh perspective on matching scenarios marked by unpredictability in production costs.},

  abstract     = {Distributed optimization has many applications, in communication networks, sensor networks, signal processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Methods for distributed convex optimization are widely investigated, while those for non-convex objectives are not well understood. One of the first non-convex distributed optimization frameworks over an arbitrary interaction graph was proposed by Di Lorenzo and Scutari (IEEE Trans Signal Inf Process Netw 2:120–136, 2016), which iteratively applies a combination of local optimization with convex approximations and local averaging. Motivated by application problems such as the resource allocation problems in multi-cellular networks, we generalize the existing results in two ways. In the case when the decision variables are separable such that there is partial dependency in the objectives, we reduce the communication and memory complexity of the algorithm so that nodes only keep and communicate local variables instead of the whole vector of variables. In addition, we relax the assumption that the objectives’ gradients are bounded and Lipschitz by means of successive proximal approximations. The proposed algorithmic framework is shown to be more widely applicable and numerically stable.},

Toward this aim, we reformulate the problem as a box-constrained optimization problem where the roots of a set of nonlinear equations need to be determined. Then, we propose to use a projected Newton’s approach combined with a gradient descent algorithm so that every limit point of the sequence generated by the overall algorithm is a stationary point. More importantly, we suggest replacing the standard orthogonal projector with a novel operator that ensures the final solution to satisfy the box constraints while lowering the probability that the intermediate points reached at each iteration belong to the boundary of the box where the Jacobian of the objective function may be singular. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown in a practical scenario concerning a chemical reaction network modeling the signaling network of colorectal cancer cells. Specifically, in this scenario the proposed algorithm is proved to be faster and more accurate than a classical dynamical approach where the asymptotically stable states are computed as the limit points of the flux of the Cauchy problem associated with the ODE system.},

This leads to the identification of broad classes of robust DC-max problems with finitely exact SOS relaxations that are numerically tractable. They allow one to find the optimal values of these classes of DC-max problems by solving a known finite number of semi-definite programs (SDPs) for certain concrete cases of commonly used uncertainty sets in robust optimization. In particular, we derive relaxation results for a class of robust fractional programs.

This two-level multiagent system can be described either by the evolution of a probability measure—describing the instantaneous density of the crowd—or by the evolution of a set—describing the positions where there is at least one agent.

Differently from the traditional two-stage stochastic programming which involves the expected recourse function as the preference criterion and hence is risk-neutral, we take the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as the risk measure in order to model its effects on decision making problems. We mainly explore tractable reformulations for the proposed robust two-stage stochastic programming with mean-CVaR criterion by analyzing the first case where uncertainties are only in the objective function and then the second case where uncertainties are only in the constraints. We demonstrate that the first model can be exactly reformulated as a deterministic convex programming. Furthermore, it is shown that under several different support sets, the resulting convex optimization problems can be converted into computationally tractable conic programmings. Besides, the second model is generally NP-hard since checking constraint feasibility can be reduced to a norm maximization problem over a polytope. However, even with the case of uncertainty in constraints, tractable conic reformulations can be established when the extreme points of the polytope are known. Finally, we present numerical results to discuss how to control the risk for the best decisions and illustrate the computational effectiveness and superiority of the proposed models.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Submodular maximization is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem regularly used in machine learning and data mining with large-scale data sets. To quantify the running time of approximation algorithms, the query complexity and adaptive complexity are two important measures, where the adaptivity of an algorithm is the number of sequential rounds it makes when each round can execute polynomially many function evaluations in parallel. These two concepts reasonably quantify the efficiency and practicability of parallel computation. In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing a nonnegative monotone DR-submodular function over a bounded integer lattice with a cardinality constraint in a value oracle model. Prior to our work, Soma and Yoshida (Math Program 172:539–563, 2018) have studied this problem and present an approximation algorithm with almost optimal approximate ratio and the same adaptivity and query complexity. We develop two novel algorithms, called low query algorithm and low adaptivity algorithm, which have approximation ratios equal to Soma and Yoshida (2018), but reach a new record of query complexity and adaptivity. As for methods, compared with the threshold greedy in Soma and Yoshida (2018), the low query algorithm reduces the number of possible thresholds and improves both the adaptivity and query complexity. The low adaptivity algorithm further integrates a vector sequencing technique to accelerate adaptive complexity in an exponential manner while only making logarithmic sacrifices on oracle queries.},

  abstract     = {The use of approximate solution techniques for the Chemical Master Equation is a common practice for the analysis of stochastic chemical systems. Despite their widespread use, however, many such techniques rely on unverifiable assumptions and only a few provide mechanisms to control the approximation error quantitatively. Addressing this gap, Dowdy and Barton (J Chem Phys 149(7):074103, 2018) proposed an optimization-based technique for the computation of guaranteed bounds on the moment trajectories associated with stochastic chemical systems, thereby providing a general framework for rigorous uncertainty quantification. Here, we present an extension of this method. The key contribution is a new hierarchy of convex necessary moment conditions that build upon partitioning of the time domain. These conditions reflect the temporal causality that is inherent to the moment trajectories associated with stochastic processes described by the Chemical Master Equation and can be strengthened by simple refinement of the time domain partition. Analogous to the original method, these conditions generate a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that furnishes monotonically improving bounds on the trajectories of the moments and related statistics of stochastic chemical systems. Compared to its predecessor, the presented hierarchy produces bounds that are at least as tight and features new bound tightening mechanisms such as refinement of the time domain partition which often enable the computation of dramatically tighter bounds with lower computational cost. We analyze the properties of the presented hierarchy, discuss some aspects of its practical implementation and demonstrate its merits with several examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a class of possibly non-convex and non-smooth optimization problems arising in many contemporary applications such as machine learning, variable selection and image processing. To solve this class of problems, we propose a proximal gradient method with extrapolation and line search (PGels). This method is developed based on a special potential function and successfully incorporates both extrapolation and non-monotone line search, which are two simple and efficient acceleration techniques for the proximal gradient method. Thanks to the non-monotone line search, this method allows more flexibility in choosing the extrapolation parameters and updates them adaptively at each iteration if a certain criterion is not satisfied. Moreover, with proper choices of parameters, our PGels reduces to many existing algorithms. We also show that, under some mild conditions, our line search criterion is well defined and any cluster point of the sequence generated by the PGels is a stationary point of our problem. In addition, by making assumptions on the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz exponent of the objective in our problem, we further analyze the local convergence rate of two special cases of the PGels, including the widely used non-monotone proximal gradient method as one case. Finally, we conduct some preliminary numerical experiments for solving the $$\ell _1$$ regularized logistic regression problem and the $$\ell _{1{-}2}$$ regularized least squares problem. The obtained numerical results show the promising performance of the PGels and validate the potential advantage of combining two acceleration techniques.},

  abstract     = {We develop an inexact primal-dual first-order smoothing framework to solve a class of non-bilinear saddle point problems with primal strong convexity. Compared with existing methods, our framework yields a significant improvement over the primal oracle complexity, while it has competitive dual oracle complexity. In addition, we consider the situation where the primal-dual coupling term has a large number of component functions. To efficiently handle this situation, we develop a randomized version of our smoothing framework, which allows the primal and dual sub-problems in each iteration to be inexactly solved by randomized algorithms in expectation. The convergence of this framework is analyzed both in expectation and with high probability. In terms of the primal and dual oracle complexities, this framework significantly improves over its deterministic counterpart. As an important application, we adapt both frameworks for solving convex optimization problems with many functional constraints. To obtain an $$\varepsilon $$ -optimal and $$\varepsilon $$ -feasible solution, both frameworks achieve the best-known oracle complexities.},
