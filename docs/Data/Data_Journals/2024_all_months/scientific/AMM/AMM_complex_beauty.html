  abstract     = {This research study explores the possible of ceramic waste (CW) as a substitute for gravel in M30 grade concrete to enhance its mechanical properties. Concrete mixes were prepared with varying % of ceramic waste replacement (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) to explore the impact on compressive, split tensile, and flexural strengths. The compressive strength test assesses the concrete ability to withstand axial loads, while the split tensile strength test assess the worth of its resistance to tensile forces. Additionally, the flexural strength test measures the concrete&#39;s capability to resist bending stresses. The results reveal that as the percentage of ceramic waste substitution become greater, there are variations in the mechanical properties of the concrete. This study aims to give valuable insights to the construction industry regarding sustainable practices by utilizing waste materials in concrete production. The findings suggest that incorporating ceramic waste as a replacement for coarse aggregate in M30 grade concrete has the possible to improve strength characteristics while addressing environmental concerns. Overall, this research highlights the feasibility of incorporating ceramic waste in concrete mixtures to enhance sustainability and reduce the reliance on natural resources.},

It uses laboratory tests to assess the impact of stabilizer combinations on soil compaction. Particularly, the optimal combination of 15% Stabilizer content results in a maximum dry density of 1.95 g/cc and an optimum moisture content of 10%. These findings suggest that the specified proportions of stabilizers significantly enhance soil compaction properties, providing valuable insights into sustainable and efficient soil stabilization techniques. The results show significant improvements in soil density with the addition of these stabilizers. The Atterberg limits tests show a reduction in plasticity index and an decrease in liquid limit with the addition of these stabilizers.

Stabilization of such soils is crucial for any construction project, often requiring physical or chemical methods. In this study, tile powder, sourced from a tile manufacturing industry, is utilized as a chemical admixture due to its high lime content, which aids in reducing the swelling nature of expansive soil. Soil samples from three distinct locations were collected and subjected to testing to determine their index properties. Among the samples, the soil exhibiting significant swelling characteristics was selected for further analysis. This soil was treated with varying percentages of tile powder (4%, 8%, 12%, 16%, and 20%), and the associated index properties were evaluated. The results indicated a decrease in soil swelling, Atterberg limits, and specific gravity, while the strengths obtained from compaction and unconfined compressive strength tests showed improvement with higher concentrations of tile powder. Notably, 20% percentage of tile powder revealed the most substantial enhancement in soil strength.

In this paper, the thermal cooling of lithium-ion battery pack with 4 rectangular prismatic battery cells is investigated in flow simulation. The performance of battery convection is simulated within the wind tunnel. The mass flow rate is controlled at 40, 80, and 120 g/s. The temperature distribution of the battery surface and the outlet air is analyzed from three parameters: the battery cell spacing of 5, 10, and 15 mm, the battery cells arrangement in three angles of 0, 60, and 150 from the wind direction, and the discharge rates of 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 C. The results indicate that the battery cells have the lowest surface temperature at 15 mm of the battery cell spacing. The angle of the battery pack placement increases, resulting in the Wake Vortex Turbulence and heat dissipation from the battery cells. It is also suitable to design the battery base for installation. In addition, the mass flow rates and discharge rates are analyzed together. the results show that the surface of battery cells and the outlet air have the highest temperature at the discharge rate of 1.00 C, and the airflow rate of 40 g/s.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric coolers need electrical energy to create temperature differences between the hot and cold sides; however, photovoltaic systems immediately convert solar radiation into electrical energy. The study is a combined (PV-TEC)—experimental study on a thermoelectric cooler operating by the Peltier effect to analyze and develop the TEC. One TEC was used, and its dimensions were (40*40*3.4) mm. The current required by the TEC is 6A and 12V DC. The thermoelectric cooler is electrically powered by a solar system consisting of two 660W solar panels, a solar charger and two 12V batteries. The results revealed a relationship between the coefficient of performance and the input energy, as the COP showed an increase as the input energy decreased, which is an essential factor for the cooling process. The temperature difference, which was the difference between ambient and cold temperatures, is related to the COP. The COP rises as the temperature difference decreases until it becomes stable. Moreover, the consumption current is an important factor in electronic devices, so the study focused on demonstrating the effect of the cold side temperature on the current, and an empirical equation was found between them. It has been found that a decrease in the temperature of the cold side leads to a sharp reduction in the consumption current until it stabilizes. The maximum coefficient of performance was 3.7436, obtained at the current 1.4 and cold side temperature of zero degrees centigrade. This high value of the coefficient of performance resulted from using curved fins to improve heat dissipation from the hot side.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of power generation of the piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) depends on the coupling between its resonant frequency and the oscillation frequency of the vibration source. The resonant frequency of a PEH is determined by its structural design, and therefore, to improve piezoelectric energy harvester performance, the piezoelectric energy harvester must be optimally designed to achieve the resonant frequency that matches the excitation frequency of the vibration source. This paper presents the design and detailed calculation of the piezoelectric energy harvester in the form of a bimorph piezoelectric circular diaphragm (PCD) structure by finite element analysis (FEA) using the software package ANSYS. Based on analyses and calculations, the optimal structure of the piezoelectric circular diaphragm energy harvester is proposed to meet the specified resonant frequency response matching the vibration source frequency. Detailed calculations of the PEH were performed with an excitation frequency of 100 Hz. With an optimal load resistor of 10.1 k$\Omega$, an output power of 0.287 W was generated at 100 Hz (equal to the resonant frequency of the PEH) under an amplitude of harmonic excitation of 0.1mm. In addition, the research results can be used to fabricate piezoelectric circular diaphragm energy harvester operating at a resonant frequency suitable for the available vibrations.},

  abstract     = {The use of coolants for cutting process in metal cutting operations is customary. Turning causes high cutting heat in nickel base super alloy Inconel 718. Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged that although flooding techniques are commonly used in the machining of super alloys, these flood cooling methods have extremely poor efficiencies. Another alternative to increase the cooling capabilities of fluids would be an internal-cooling approach that would enable to lower machining temperatures significantly. The heat dissipation ability in the tool is also greatly influenced by the micro-channel diameter of tool which further causes a significant effect on the coolant outlet velocity. A design of an internal-cooling single point cutting tool with micro channel structures for enhanced coolant heat transfer capability and reduced machining temperature is used for turning Inconel 718 under dry, flooded cooling and internal cooling to study the effects of cooling conditions on cutting force, cutting temperature and surface quality. A regression model is built using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) methods in machine learning framework. These models were then used to forecast input parameters, such as channel diameter and inlet pressure, which made it easier to obtain output data, such as pressure and maximum velocities at different notches. Eighty percent of the data in the dataset is used to train the model and with the remaining twenty percent set aside for evaluating the model&#39;s functionality. When comparing internal-cooling technology to traditional flood cooling, there are clear benefits including increased heat transfer efficiency, which leads to lower cutting temperatures, less cutting force, and better surface quality. More specifically, in the internal-cooling configuration, a direct relationship is shown between rising coolant inlet pressure and falling cutting force and temperature over time. Further highlighting the advantages of this cooling strategy is the relationship between increased intake pressure and decreased surface roughness.},

  abstract     = {Forging dies serve as essential tools in shaping workpieces during the forging process to achieve the desired shape and geometry. In hot forging processes, wear is a significant concern due to the high temperatures involved. The repeated contact between the die and the hot workpiece can lead to abrasive and adhesive wear, where material is gradually removed from the die surface. This wear directly impacts the overall production cost. It also affects the shape, dimensions, and surface quality of the final product. The present study focuses on a comprehensive wear analysis of a hot forging die. The influence of critical process variables, including billet temperature, die temperature, friction coefficient, and percentage deformation on die wear, was examined. Employing three-dimensional finite element analysis with DEFORM software, the study utilizes the Taguchi experimental method to systematically design parametric combinations. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is then applied to determine the parameters significantly influencing die wear. The results highlight that the billet temperature and percentage deformation are critical factors affecting die wear. The optimal process settings, which lead to minimal die wear, were validated through a confirmation experiment. Additionally, empirical models were developed to establish correlations between die wear and various forging parameters.},

  abstract     = {The use of 3D printing (additive manufacturing) with metal has grown significantly in demand recently, greatly reducing the time and expense required to produce complex interconnected metal components. This method minimizes material wastage, facilitates material recycling, and eliminates the need for support materials. Among the various Metal Additive Manufacturing techniques, Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) processes stands out as the most prevalent for manufacturing parts. Within the realm of PBF, electron beam melting technique, selective laser sintering technique, and selective laser melting technique are the primary methods employed. Selective laser melting and selective laser sintering operate without the need for any special conditions, unlike EBM, which necessitates a vacuum environment. Regarding the choice of materials, laser melting/sintering processes are suitable for almost all types of metals except those which surpasses beam melting capabilities. While electron beam melting is constrained to a few materials such as titanium alloys, cobalt and chromium alloys, and nickel alloys, whereas selective laser melting and sintering allows for a broad range of materials, including iron and steel alloys. However, electron beam melting exhibit the ability to process brittle materials that would typically be challenging for melting and sintering through laser. Nevertheless, the ductility, yield testing, and ultimate testing of materials created through EBM are inferior to those processed by laser methods. Although all PBF techniques excel at creating complex structures, finishing products to have a smooth surface directly over a rough surface remains a subject of ongoing research. To attain suitable mechanical properties such as hardness, tensile strength, and endurance, critical process factors include power of laser or beam, speed for scanning, density for powder bed, thickness of laser or beam, and material characteristics. Inadequate material selection coupled with incorrect process settings can lead to issues such as porosity, slag formation, and other flaws.},

  abstract     = {Maintenance due to the replacement of damaged wheels and rails due to rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear has been found to be the major problem to rail operating companies. This problem tends to lead to unavailability of railway networks. To solve this problem, costly wear simulators are developed to predict the wear behaviour of the rails and wheels to improve the preventive maintenance in pursuit of operational efficiency. Therefore, more studies that simulate a combination of rolling and sliding wear, together with RCF, are required, specifically for the Southern African, where good and cost-effective rail wear simulators are not readily available. The problem with wear and RCF simulators is high production costs, so this work aims to solve this problem by developing a cost-effective wear test rig that is capable of simulating RCF, sliding and rolling wear as experienced by the train wheel while moving along railway tracks. For this work, it was decided that twin-disc concept would be used, since literature clearly shown that the method was able to simulate the three damage mechanisms mentioned. The developed twin-disc wear simulator was able to simulate both rolling and sliding wear and parameters including contact load and slip ratio could be changed with ease so to simulate the actual contact conditions between the wheel and rail. Outputs such as coefficient of friction and wheel disc temperature were obtained. The results showed that the severity of wear is heavily dependent on slip ratio i.e., increased with slip ratio, with both coefficient of friction and wear rate increasing with slip ratio.},

  abstract     = {Fracture mechanics has been a crucial aspect in the field of engineering science as technologies are rapidly growing nowadays. Various numerical methods have been developed to analyze fracture behaviour in different types of materials used in industries. Meanwhile, the application of polymers garners attention worldwide due to outstanding characteristics such as good strength, lightweight, and high temperature resistance, exemplified by polymers like polycarbonate (PC) and polypropylene (PP). Hence, failure aspects of such materials must be taken into consideration when conditions arise that may lead to failure, such as high-load impact, fatigue, and extreme temperatures. In this study, a bond-based Peridynamic model (PD) for the tensile behaviour, including fracture, of polymers has been developed. The PD model is constructed using the Centos software and encompasses both brittle and ductile fracture behaviours. Numerical results, including crack propagation, damage zone, and force-extension curves of notched specimens, are validated by comparison with experimental results of PC and PP. Through the validation process, PC specimens exhibit a difference percentage range for maximum load and rupture extension of 2.9% to 18.8% and 2.4% to 4.6%, respectively. PP specimens show a difference percentage range for maximum load and rupture extension of 31.2% to 43.5% and 0.9% to 30%, respectively. Consequently, the validation results indicate that the PD model for brittle specimens aligns more closely with experimental data compared to the PD model for ductile specimens.},

However, industry standards still hold conservative values for the S/N curve of bolt fatigue, and there are unclear requirements for thermal coatings, The S/N curves provided by the standards in different periods do not meet the actual processing requirements of bolts. In order to study the effect of thermal coating temperature on the fatigue performance of threads and provide a reasonable basis for the subsequent design of long blade bolt connections. Based on the actual processing technology of bolts, experiments were conducted on the S/N fatigue curves of thermal coated bolts at different temperatures. The experimental results prove that the slope of the inclined part of the low-temperature Dacromet test data and the fatigue strength under 2 million cycles are significantly higher than normal temperature Dacromet coated bolts.

AM for food 3D printing application is used to modify the process of food production in aspects of shape, color, flavor, texture, and nutrition. However, the price of food 3D printers available in the market is too high compared to the benefits they can provide. Addressing this issue, modifying the traditional fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printer can be a cheaper alternative that offers more advantages for food production process. This study provides the modification of the FDM 3D printer, such as the designing, fabricating, and setting the new extrusion mechanism to develop the food 3D printer. The modifications are mainly in the extrusion mechanism where the printing material changes from filament into semi-fluid food material. The proposed food 3D printer then tested by printing two different using semi-fluid food materials, i.e., strawberry, and peanut jam. In addition, two different shapes, three different dimensions, and two travel speeds are being selected for the printing test, i.e., 40 and 60 mm/s. As a result, the FDM 3D printer was modified and converted successfully into a food 3D printer. Based on the printing outcomes, it was showed that the strawberry jam has a better surface finish than peanut jam due to its texture consistency. Moreover, the strawberry material also has a lower percentage of error particularly when printed at slower speed. This research is expected to contribute to the development of affordable food 3D printers in Indonesia.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a comprehensive study on the damping of vibrations in a motor-pump assembly using viscoelastic and constrained layer damping treatments. The assembly&#39;s structural model, designed using SolidWorks software, is subjected to modal and harmonic analyses in ANSYS. The primary goal is to mitigate vibration amplitudes originating from the motor and pump to enhance the assembly&#39;s operational performance. Three damping treatments are investigated: Free Layer Damping (FLD), Sandwich Constrained Layer Damping (CLD), and a novel Multilayer CLD approach. The viscoelastic material is modeled using the Prony series method, and its properties are incorporated into the finite element analysis Results demonstrate that the application of damping treatments significantly reduces vibration amplitudes compared to the untreated structure. Among the treatments, the Multilayer CLD approach exhibits the highest damping efficiency, reducing the maximum amplitude by approximately 52% compared to the base structure. The study showcases the advantages of utilizing viscoelastic and constrained layer damping techniques for enhancing vibration control and operational stability in industrial assemblies. The research findings contribute to the field of structural dynamics and vibration control, offering valuable insights into the design and optimization of mechanical systems subjected to dynamic loads. This study opens avenues for further research and practical applications aimed at improving the performance and reliability of motor-pump assemblies and similar industrial equipment.},

  abstract     = {Experimental evaluation of mechanical properties of materials is often standardised by pre-defining the test specimen in terms of its geometrical features and random errors if any need to be screened out during experimentation. However, eliminating the systematic biases is a formidable task. This study presents the efforts taken to address three important systematic biases possible in the case of mechanical property evaluation of materials. For a simple tensile strength characterization, misalignment of the specimen with respect to the axis of loading, turning effect in the load application system and geometrical imperfection are considered in the test specimen. These concepts are illustrated using numerical analysis for SAE 1045 steel material. Sheet specimens as per the ASTM standards are modelled and the stress-strain behaviour of the material is bench marked with experimental results. Subsequently, pre-defined cases of (a) specimen misalignment, (b) twisting and (c) geometric imperfections are introduced to study the variations in stress-strain behaviour. It is observed that an inadvertent twisting force coupled with an axial load increases the Von-Mises stress at the mid-section of the specimen increased by about 33% and reduces its fatigue life by 96%. The study clearly brings out the implications of such inadvertent systematic biases occurring in a typical experimental or usage scenario on the component life. It also shows how the numerical computations can offer a robust methodology to assess the bounds of possible deviations.},

The purpose of this study was to find out how MSP substitution affects concrete strength. Mussel shell powder (MSP) contains important levels of calcium oxide and silicon oxide (SiO2) and used as an alternative to Portland cement (PC) to reduce the amount of PC needed to make concrete will perform. The concrete designed according to the Standard Indonesian Method (SNI) and the slump should be between 75mm and 100mm. As a prototype, he built a concrete cylinder measuring 15 cm x 30 cm. The percentage changes when replacing PC with MSP were 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%, respectively, with 0% substitute used as the control mixture. The samples evaluated for compressive and tensile strength after 7 and 28 days, respectively. As a result, in terms of compressive strength, the best replacement level for 28-day-old concrete is 6%, with a strength value of 32.46MPa. This resulted in a 21.98% increase in force compared to control. In contrast, replacing 2% PC with MSP achieved the highest shear strength after 28 days, with a strength value of about 2.584MPa, 10.48% higher than witnessed. The two samples all have slightly different chemical group bonds O-H, CH2, and C-H. The absorption range of the chemical bond of alkene is 1638.21cm-1, and group functional C=O of shell concrete of 1638.21cm-1.

A proper preliminary evaluation of groundwater hydrogeochemistry is essential for knowing the proper application and maintaining the available groundwater as a sustainable resource. Four production wells in Kinta Valley are sampled and analyzed for physicochemical parameters from 2018 to 2020. In this study, major chemical compounds, pH, total hardness (TH), and total dissolved solids (TDS) are interpreted to construct Piper’s trilinear diagram and Gibbs plot which describe the hydrochemistry of the samples. Drinking Water Quality Standard from the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) National Primary Drinking Water Regulation is used as guideline standards for water quality evaluation. Based on the results from this study, the quality of groundwater in Kinta Valley is healthy and has the potential to be used as drinking water besides using as irrigation water. The predominant hydrochemical reaction of the groundwater is found to be a bicarbonate-calcium-magnesium reaction, which shows the aquifers are in contact with the subsurface karst system as the main ions originated from the dissolution of carbonate bedrocks.},

  abstract     = {Sarawak located in Borneo is endowed with the vast availability of peat water sources, particularly for the state southern region. Several investigations have shown that electrocoagulation treatment with aluminium electrodes is feasible to treat peat water in which the quality is comparable to the National Water Quality Standard (NWQS). Even though electrocoagulation treatment is feasible to treat peat water, the characteristics of peat water electrocoagulation flocs have not been reported. As such, this study aims to investigate the characteristics of the electrocoagulation flocs from peat water derived from the Sarawak southern region by using batch electrocoagulation treatment. The objectives of this study are to conduct an experimental study analysis of and identify the minerals on the electrocoagulation flocs along with operating energy cost analysis of peat water batch electrocoagulation treatment. Consequently, this study has found that reaction time and current density affect the production of flocs in which the amount of flocs increases with the increasing reaction time and current density. The flocs produced are found to consist of a large fraction of oxygen (O), carbon (C), iron (Fe), and aluminium (Al) along with a small fraction of potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and Silicon (Si). The presence of Al observed in the flocs is due to the aluminium hydroxide generated during the electrocoagulation process. The total operating cost for peat electrocoagulation with a current density of 5A and reaction time of 20 minutes is about RM0.31 per m3. As a result, the electrocoagulation of peat water process is able to treat peat water as well as produce flocs in which earth elements and heavy metals could be recovered.},

Agisoft Photoscan software was used for producing the three-dimensional points cloud from the two-dimensional images&#39; sequences. The rock mass rating was evaluated by using Discontinuity Set Extractor (DSE) and Dips 7.0 in Rockscience software. Results from this research show that 3D digital point clouds, derived from the processing of drone-flight images, were successfully used for reliable representation of discontinuity of the tunnel. According to the results of the analysis, both Tunnel A and Tunnel B are classified as &quot;fair rock.&quot; Meanwhile, Tunnel A is failing due to geological conditions of feldspar decomposition that are classified as class I, which is &quot;very poor rock.&quot; According to Dips 7.0 analysis, the major direction of discontinuity set of Tunnel A for Window right is N300 – N310, while for Window left is N350 – N360. The most dominant discontinuity direction for Tunnel B Window right is N340 – N350, and the orientation for Window left is N10 – N20. When manual mapping and DSE analysis are compared, both orientations of the discontinuity do not give the same direction due to less data reading in the field and high accuracy from the software.},

According to the findings an increase in wet and dry cycles significantly affects the microstructures (pore spaces and microcracks). The porosity and microcracks density of sandstone increases with the number of wet and dry cycles. Furthermore, the length of microcracks increases as the weathering grade increases. As variation in rock macroscopic mechanical characteristics is directly associated with the deterioration of microstructures.

  abstract     = {In the current industrial environment, products’ life cycles have become shorter and the need for more sophisticated molds with free-form surfaces has drastically increased. However, the polishing process of a product needs the exceptional skill of an experienced master. It is difficult to increase productivity if the manually operative process is not automated. So, the main objective of this project is to reduce manpower and time consumption of the polishing process in the industry. Which leads to increases in the productivity rate. This project deals with the automation of polishing work by the use of an industrial mechanical arm with a conveyor. Since polishing work, which takes much time, requires experience, patience, and skill, it is manually performed by skilled workers. This project aims at rationalizing such difficult polishing work by introducing a mechanical arm with conveyor and CAD technology. The arm can be equipped with a polishing tool, i.e., Buffing wheels, also known as mops, are either made from cotton or wool cloth and come bleached or unbleached. In addition, the project is to achieve a robust process that results in a consistent surface finish, the roughness of which can be specified and controlled.},

The cage slip obtained by experimental work is correlated with the contact parameters of hollow and solid shaped roller bearings. The specific load acting on solid rollers at various angular positions and the corresponding bearing deflection are obtained by FEA and the bearing run out is estimated. A new methodology is developed for deriving the contact mechanics of hollow roller to predict contact pressure and contact width from the roller deflection. The effect of hollowness on these parameters is derived and the corresponding cage slip is correlated. The effect of hollowness on bending and resultant stresses is obtained by numerical and analytical methods to correlate the stability of hollow roller bearing with the percentage of hollowness.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, as the automotive industry is growing, one of the major hope for future vehicles is to meet emissions regulations. Automobiles pollute the air, and clean-air laws have made Catalytic Converters a legal requirement because they convert harmful pollutants from an engine&#39;s exhaust into cleaner emissions. The device works with the principle of a catalyst, something that causes or speeds up a chemical reaction without itself being changed. But the presence of a catalytic converter increases the exhaust back pressure which has an indirect effect on the engine efficiency ie engine efficiency decreases, thus increasing fuel consumption. The performance of a catalytic converter is substantially affected by the flow distribution inside the substrate, a uniform flow distribution can increase its efficiency, lower the pressure drop and optimize engine performance. The flow distribution in a catalytic converter assembly 15 is governed by the geometry configurations of the inlet and outlet cone section, the substrate, and exhaust gas compositions, and therefore a better design of the catalytic converter is very important. This Project deals with the fundamental understanding and study of complex processes taking place involving fluid flow, pressure, and velocity profiles in the catalytic converter using ANSYS WORKBENCH 2022 R1. The main objective of our analysis is to determine the most effective and optimum design of a Catalytic Converter},

A silo is a commonly used storage structure for the storage of bulk materials such as grain and cement. This paper deals with the design of a steel silo for the storage of pozzolana cement. A storage silo is essentially made up of a cylinder-shaped wall and a hopper bottom. Steel Silos are gaining more popularity in terms of cement storage usage. A 150-ton capacity steel silo has been designed for a seismic zone-2 [1] location in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India (therefore omitting the inclusion of seismic loads). The preliminary design of the silo structure is carried out with the help of Indian Standard code books. Indian Standard code books such as IS 9178-Parts 1,2 &amp;amp; 3 (1979) were used for the basic design. Other necessary code books were used for load calculations. The plan and elevation of the Silo have been drafted by using AutoCAD. The designed Silo is analysed using STAAD Pro.

Despite excellent wear resistance and widely used as the acetabular component of a joint prosthesis, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is among such the rarely-found filament material in the market. In this research, preliminary work to fabricate UHMWPE filament for the FFF processing is carried out by using extrusion. The influences of extrusion temperature, addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and rotational speed of the extruder’s screw on the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of the extruded UHMWPE filament were determined. The result demonstrated no change in the chemical compositions of the filament due to the processing parameters applied, as noted from the FTIR spectra. The result of the tensile test showed that the highest tensile strength of UHMWPE filaments could reach 23.5 MPa.},

In this study, the powder addition reinforcement (PAR) method had been developed by introducing reinforcing powder into the polylactic acid (PLA) as the base material during the printing process so that nozzle clogging can be avoided and powders can be placed between the layers. In this work, iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe2O3) were used as a reinforcing powder. The addition of this powder was carried out by using two methods, namely brushing and compressed air-assisted techniques. The results showed that the compressed-air assisted technique demonstrated better results in terms of mechanical properties. In this case, the tensile strength of the composite with the compressed-air assisted technique was higher by 28.95% than that of the PLA and by 5.53% - 25.2% than that of the brushing method.

  abstract     = {Robot grasping detection methods are categorized into two-dimension (2D) and three-dimension (3D) approaches. In 2D grasp detection, gripper pose prediction occurs directly on RedGreenBlue (RGB) images, limiting grasp direction. Conversely, 3D grasp detection predicts gripper pose using 3D point clouds, allowing greater grasp flexibility. However, the data volume of 3D point clouds hampers real-time detection. To address this, this paper proposes a novel grasping detection algorithm that combines 2D images and 3D point clouds. Initially, a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) network generates 2D prediction boxes on RGB images. Through enhancements to the prior box scaling, the accuracy of bounding the target object is improved. Subsequently, 2D boxes are transformed into 3D frustums, and extraneous data points are removed. By utilizing Random Sampling Consistent Segmentation (RANSAC) and Euclidean Clustering Segmentation Algorithm (ECSA), the target point clouds are isolated, and subsequently, the spatial pose of the target is represented using an Oriented Bounding Box (OBB). Processed point clouds enter an enhanced PointNet Grasp Pose Detection (PointNetGPD) algorithm, In contrast to the original approach involving extensive random sampling of grasp candidates, the enhanced PointNetGPD method enables the selective sampling of grasp candidates by incorporating pose constraints between the target and gripper. Following this, the generated grasp candidates are subjected to evaluation through a scoring process conducted by an assessment network. Ultimately, the robotic arm is guided to perform the grasp associated with the highest score. In the experimental phase, the proposed algorithm demonstrated a high success rate in capturing multiple targets, along with a reduced grasping time. These results underscore the algorithm&#39;s superior grasping quality and enhanced real-time performance when compared to similar algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Several advancements in the field of parallel manipulators have taken place in recent days as they offer many advantages over serial manipulators in terms of accuracy, agility, stiffness, speed, etc. The Parallel Kinematic Machines (PKMs) with lower Degree of Freedom (DoF) joints are being explored for a variety of industrial applications and, in particular, machining applications as these offer more accuracy, high machining capability, and more stiffness. This research work focuses on the modeling, kinematics, workspace and dexterity analyses of a 3DoF Translational PKM having coplanar rails along the Cartesian axes: -X, +X, +Y. Actuation of sliders, independently along the respective rails, offer the tool platform pure translational motion. Fixed length links are used to connect the sliders and tool platform. The PKM under study is modeled in CATIA. Inverse kinematics and workspace analysis are carried out using the performance indices, namely, Workspace Volume Index (WVI) and Global Condition Index (GCI). Attempts are also made to find the optimal dimensions of the PKM through multi-objective optimization using Genetic Algorithms in MATLAB. The methodology presented is helpful to predict the PKM&#39;s performance capability while the results obtained are helpful for the development of a physical prototype necessary for further experimental investigations.},

A pin-on-disc wear testing method was applied where normal pressure of 0.255 to 2.55 MPa and a constant sliding speed of 0.641 m/s were considered. For the assessment dry and fresh machine oil sliding environments were also conducted. The results from the experiment demonstrated that the wear rate and friction coefficient in dry sliding condition were much greater for their direct contact but lower under machine oil due to the reduced roughness by the sealing effect as oil forms a thin lubricating film between the contact surfaces. Used oil displayed some degree of higher wear rate along with friction coefficient due to heavy and harmful chemical compounds in it. Al-bronze performed the better wear properties with lower wear rate and coefficient of friction for all the environments as it achieved the strength through different intermetallic formations. In case of $\alpha$-brass, it had little effect on wear characteristics. Examined by optical microscopy and SEM analysis, worn surfaces showed that Al-bronze improved wear resistance through mild and smooth abrasive grooves filled with oxides in dry sliding conditions. In case of oil sliding environment, smooth surfaces were created by the resistance of the oil film to the direct contact between the surfaces. Used oil sliding conditions reduced the surface smoothness of the Cu and Cu-based alloys for the presence of damaging chemical compounds.},

The effects of a new time dependent viscosity parameter in the modified Winkler viscoelastic foundation is studied and analyzed. The governing equation is a fourth-order partial differential equation with pinned-pinned boundary conditions, which required a special analytical method for solution. The differential transform method was applied to obtain the solution of the governing partial differential equation for the fluid-conveying pipes on viscoelastic foundations. The time-dependent viscosity parameter in the modified Winkler viscoelastic model was implemented and simulated to determine the behavior of the viscoelastic foundation. The obtained analytical solution was validated with Runge-Kutta order four numerical method. The effects of foundation stiffness , coefficient of foundation damping and the frequency mass ratio on the governing model equation were investigated. In addition, the bending and deflection of the pipe on a viscoelastic foundation are compared with those on an elastic foundation. The analytical and the numerical solutions are in good agreement. From the study, it is observed that an increase in the foundation stiffness results in increase in the pipe inherent frequencies. Furthermore, the vibration of the pipe on a viscoelastic foundation shows better control and reduction compared with its vibration on an elastic foundation.},

Non-edible vegetable oils have proven consensus to opt as a replacement for diesel fuel due to comparable properties and less-pollutant characteristics. Using Unmixed Untreated Non-edible Vegetable Oil (UUNVO) in the CI engine matches the needs of a sustainable future and restricts the intensifying cost involved in biodiesel production. This paper aims to review the influence of various UUNVO (Karanja, Jatropha, Neem, Linseed, Mahua and Rubber Seed etc.) on the important performance parameters and emission level of diesel engine. UUNVO can be fuelled to the unmodified CI engine. However, the viscosity of UUNVO is reasonably higher compare to diesel fuel at room temperature, which deteriorates the engine performance and exhaust emission. Minor changes in the injection line for preheating the UUNVO and operating parameters are the way to improve it. It can clearly understand here that preheated UUNVOs typically increase NOx emissions and decrease PM, HC, and CO emissions level compared to standard diesel. UUNVO can substitute diesel fuel completely for short-duration operation. With the long-duration operation, UUNVO produces problems like poor engine performance, injector chocking, and erosion of piston crown, rings, cylinder liner, and other internal parts, and degradation of the lubricant. Problems raised due to durability can be minimized by controlling operational parameters.},

The study enabled the elaboration of the composite based on concrete with different contents of recycled expanded polystyrene (EPS) added (0.20; 0.10 and 0.05%, in % weight/weight). The use of this material allowed the partial replacement of standard sand in the composite aggregate, obtaining an environmentally sustainable material, with low specific mass, thermal resistance with insulating, hydrophobic properties that allow low water absorption, with a low impact manufacturing process. This addition of EPS to the fresh concrete mixture showed a reduction in water penetration, making the construction material more hydrophobic, minimizing infiltration problems, reducing the physical process of absorption. The specimens for the concentration of 0.10% (weight/weight) showed better axial mechanical performance, with an average of 11.4 kgf, 52% in gain of reinforcement effect, in relation to the concentration of 0.20% (weight/weight). For this concentration of 0.20 (weight/weight), the EPS beads obtained greater homogeneity in the dispersion in the cementitious matrix, promoting better impact absorption during mechanical efforts.

It is estimated that an ordinary WTP produces over 10,000 tonnes of WTS per day, which has become a major concern in the management of WTS. Numerous previous studies have been accomplished to determine a safe disposal method and the potential reuse of WTS. In most investigations, material characterisation was the adopted method. It is known that each WTP produces different chemical composition of WTS according to raw water intake and the treatment process. The aim of this paper is to examine the chemical composition of WTS in the WTP at Melaka. The WTS sample is collected from WTP after the pressing process, where large amounts of water have been removed. The sample is tested using the Scanning Electron Microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The SEM-EDX results revealed that by weight percentage (%), WTS contains zirconium (Zr) (28 to 46%), oxygen (28 to 40%) and carbon (7 to 26%). Aluminium and silicon have weight percentages ranging from 7 to 8%. The outcomes are then confirmed by XRD, which showed the high intensity of Zr and $\alpha$-Zr at approximately 35.3 and 36.1. of 2$\texttheta$. Based on these findings, the suitable and potential reuse of WTS would be the extraction of Zr. However, further research is required to verify the consistency of Zr in WTS.},

  abstract     = {The acetylene market is anticipated to be driven by the growing applications across numerous industries particularly chemical synthesis, oxy-acetylene welding, and metal cutting. Attributable to wide-range uses, acetylene witnesses stable growth in the global market. However, the production of acetylene results in increasing generation of carbide lime waste that is classified as a scheduled waste under Malaysian Environmental Quality Act: EQA 1974 (SW427) due to its high alkalinity. The rising amount of the waste has warranted the need for repurposing its usage to avert handling and disposal difficulties. In overcoming this crucial environmental issue, the carbide lime waste was transformed into a more marketable product so-called precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) via feasible carbonation, promoted using natural sucrose solution. During the carbonation process, stirring rate was manipulated (i.e 300, 500, 700 and 1000 rpm) in investigating its effects on the PCC formation. Increasing the mechanical disturbance resulted in significant time reduction from 28 minutes to only 9 minutes and particle refinement. The production of PCC with purity above 98% suggested that the carbide lime waste was successfully transformed into high-grade PCC, which not only may help in preserving environmental sustainability yet can also offer profitable return to industry.},

  abstract     = {Cenospheres are valuable material contained inside the fly ash. Its low weight, low density, and high strength made it very versatile and can be used in various fields. The way of separating the cenosphere from the fly ash consists of two categories, wet and dry separation. For wet separation, it involves submerging the fly ash inside a mixture made either by pure acetone, pure water, or a mixture of water and acetone with different mixing ratios before stirring the mixture. The cenospheres, floating on top of the mix due to low density, can be collected and dried. The dry separation technique involves putting the fly ash into a cyclone separator at a constant velocity. The fly ash will then move into the bottom of the cyclone. Particles can also be separated by diameter sizes by sieving. By manipulating various parameters, cenosphere yield may differ. This paper is written to help gain more understanding on cenosphere properties and its separation method.},

Hastelloy is one such superalloy that is extensively utilized in the aerospace sector because of its good corrosion and heat resistance among the other nickel-based superalloys. In this work, the investigation is conducted to understand the effects of input process parameters such as voltage, pulse off time (Toff), and pulse on time (Ton) on the response variables, namely Material removal rate (MRR), Tool wear rate (TWR), Overcut (OC), and Taper Ratio (TR) during micro-EDM of Hastelloy C276. For micro drilling the Hastelloy C276 material, a copper electrode with a diameter of 0.5 mm is utilized. To investigate the connections between the input and output characteristics, a technique known as the Response Surface Methodology (RSM), which is a collection of mathematical and statistical methodologies, is applied. The experimental runs are carried out with the help of the RSM-based Box-Behnken design (BBD). The experimental outcomes were computed, and ANOVA was used to identify the most influential variables. In addition, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was utilized to optimize the results, which were compared to the Response surface methodology approach. The outcomes of the PSO-optimized results revealed a strong correlation between expected and experimental outcomes over the RSM approach.},

In order to study and achieve a better rate of material removal and a lower rate of electrode wear, the Taguchi L18 experimental matrix representing the four variables, current, duty cycle, capacitance level, and gap voltage was examined. Regular tap water served as the dielectric fluid to uphold the sustainability concept of the machining experiments and an integrated hybrid approach incorporating CRITIC (criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation) weight determination method and MOORA (multi-objective optimization by the ratio analysis) was applied for decision making. The weight fractions (significance) for MRR and EWR were found to be 0.5532 and 0.4467, respectively and the MOORA method converted multiple objective parameters into a single objective function with weight fractions assigned to each of them. An ideal parameter combination highlighting the dominant significance of duty cycle, pulse current, capacitance level and gap voltage with corresponding values of 70%-18A-1-34V was obtained and the results were substantiated with relevant confirmation experiments. The highest MRR achieved is 10.0961 mm³/min and the lowest EWR is found to be 3.9640 mm³/min. Moreover, the electrode tip regions, the micro holes, and the surrounding workpiece surfaces were also thoughtfully scrutinized and contrasted using scanning electron micrographs (SEM), which validates the worth and significance of cryogenically frozen electrodes in successful micro-drilling of SS316L material.},

Material Removal Rate (MRR) and surface roughness are the response parameters used to characterize the dielectric nature of the machined surface in EDM process. Addition of ingredients in the dielectric fluid improves the properties of fluid for better machining of the samples. The dielectric fluid medium plays a key role in controlling the electrical discharge and heat absorption, thereby removes the debris and cools the work piece during the machining process. In the current study, comprehensive work is done by investigating the effect of different dielectric fluid medium on machining parameters of EDM process with the addition of different powders in the dielectric fluid, which results in high precise and better topography in the machined part surface. Addition of powders such as Titanium (Ti), Silicon (Si), Graphite (Gr), Copper (Cu) and Aluminium Oxide (Al2O3) in dielectric fluid increases the convection property in the work piece tool interaction with increase in the micro-hardness of material. This work analyses the performance study of Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) of Monel 400 alloys, which can be improved by adding metallic powder into the dielectric medium. Material Removal Rate (MRR) is measured in the samples machined out of EDM process. In addition, Taguchi L27 Orthogonal Array is formulated for conducting machining in a sequential order to understand the implications of machined process parameters on the material removal rate over different dielectric mediums. It is found that the Aluminium oxide, graphite powder mix with EDM oil gives better material removal rate and less machining time. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu powders in the dielectric fluid provides better machinability response parameters. But it is preferable to parts with high slenderness ratio especially holes.},

Hence with the high temperature is potential to heat recovery in the form of combustion air pre-heating using a regenerator to increase the efficiency in Glass Furnace. This phenomenon gave rise to an idea to create a modelling mathematic to know the optimum process in Glass Furnace. Many studies on Glass furnace regenerator have been carried out but only for one cyclic of heat transfer in regenerator. Therefore, in this study, dynamic modeling of the regenerator will be made, namely a mathematical model that describes quantitatively the dynamic behavior during the process of reversing the direction between the regenerators, which will later explain the effect of air flow rate and the selection of the optimal transition time value for the demonstration, regenerator work and regenerator heat stability, by observing the dynamic behavior of the regenerator temperature profile using the FlexPDE software version 7. The simulation results show that the longer the switching time of regenerator is linier to inclining temperature in the regenerator with the optimum switching time (ST) at 10 minutes.

Several variables were studied such as the effect of pressure, cycle time, and temperature to determine the level of product purity. The simulation shows that the increase in oxygen concentration is caused by an increase in operating pressure and total cycle time to obtain maximum results. Meanwhile, large pressures can reduce the efficiency of the adsorbent. The maximum oxygen concentration that can be obtained up to 99%. However, the temperature variation has no significant change.

The RSM model was created by Design-Expert software whereas MATLAB created the ANFIS model with 80% of data used for the model training and 20% of the data for model testing. The models&#39; performances were compared in terms of statistical errors (AAPE, RMSE, R2, STD, minimum error, and maximum error). It was found the ANFIS model has performed better in predicting the outlet flowrate with R2 value of 0.99 RSM model with the value of 0.97. The inlet flow rate was an insignificant parameter affecting the outlet flow rate of the passive treatment column.

  abstract     = {The extensive use of pesticides can result in overexposure and soil, water, and produce residues. For instance, residues of malathion were found on some vegetables. Molecularly-imprinted polymers (MIP) have been recently developed for sensing of pesticide residues. This study prepared malathion-imprinted polymers via precipitation polymerization and deposited on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) electrodes. FTIR spectroscopy proved the incorporation and removal of malathion in the matrix of MIP. SEM images revealed that MIP particles are larger than the non-imprinted polymer (NIP) particles due to the incorporation of malathion. Binding experiments were done using standard malathion solutions of 10 to 60 ppm. The MIP-QCM sensor had a greater response than the NIP-QCM sensor. This is due to the specific binding sites in the MIP matrix. On the other hand, the response of NIP-QCM sensor is attributed to the non-specific adsorption sites in its matrix. A sensitivity and detection limit of 1.62 Hz·L/mg and 5.67 ppm, respectively were determined for the MIP-QCM sensor. Lastly, the MIP-QCM sensor is stable and reusable up to three (3) cycles.},

  abstract     = {Heavy metal elements are elements with comparatively high density and are dangerous even in a minimal quantity as they can persist in the environment. The electrochemical sensor can play an essential role in detecting heavy metals. However, the electrochemical sensor has drawbacks, such as low sensitivity and a high detection limit. Bismuth nanoparticles (BiNPs) can improve the sensitivity and lower the detection limit of an electrochemical sensor by modifying the working electrode. In this study, BiNPs produced by the hydrothermal method were drop-casted on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated with polyethene terephthalate (PET) film (BiNPs/ITO-PET). The effect of the hydrothermal reaction was studied by varying the hydrothermal reaction period (5, 6, 7, and 8 h). X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the phase presence, and the morphology of BiNPs was characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The BiNPs/ITO-PET electrode was subjected to electrochemical characterization using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the detection of Pb(II) using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). The BiNPs/ITO-PET electrode showed good electrochemical performance in detecting Pb(II).},

This study is based on real-time testing to determine battery utilization when different electrical loads for office use are combined. The workload profile during peak hours of use, which correspond to the peak time of sunshine, is used to evaluate the system. The collected findings show that the degree of effectiveness of this hybrid power plant fulfills the power simulation. During the peak irradiation time, the maximum power is 2100 watts, whereas the needed power simulation, which is 1900 watts in this case, so the power efficiency percentage is 110.52%. It means that PV can satisfy the charged power while also supplying extra power to the battery for usage at low periods.

Monitoring can be done by observing electrical parameters, are cell voltage and battery temperature. The results of the simulation and modeling of BMS and Lithium-ion Battery show that the flat-zone voltage on the LFP UNS battery is in the 10-90% SoC range (generally SoC 20-80%), and the characteristics of lithium battery are current affects the battery voltage curve (high current causes a high voltage drop), while temperature affects the internal resistance (low temperature causes an increase in internal resistance). The BMS hardware monitoring test shows the accuracy and precision of the voltage sensor at 99.7064% and 99.9998%, while the temperature sensor performs the accuracy and precision of 95.4909% and 100%, respectively.

Battery packs monitoring by Battery Management System in electric vehicles require accurate monitoring. The inaccuracy of monitoring such property can lead to low safety, low efficiency and battery’s life reduction. Estimating state of charge (SoC) to prevent battery damage from overcharging and over discharging. Some of the methods used to estimate SoC such as Coulomb Counting have errors during the charge and discharge process. This research proposes a counting method for measuring SoC with the artificial neural networks (ANN) to provide more precise estimation. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) is an ANN model that can give an accurate estimation of SoC by learning data of the charge-discharge process performed on sample batteries. The sample batteries are tested with a battery analyzer to get its charging-discharging data consisting of variables such as voltage, current, capacity, and time with C-Rate variations. These variables data are then learned by the modeled FFNN to predict SoC value. The FFNN model consisted of 16 neurons in the first layer, 8 neurons in the second layer, and 4 neurons in the third layer. The predicted SoC value from FFNN has a similar value with its real SoC value. The relationship between SoC and battery voltage is plotted in a curve and shows an identical characteristic with how the SoC-Voltage curve of a battery should be and have a low mae value. This FFNN model can be applied further such as in electric vehicles to maintain its safety and for longer use.},

  abstract     = {Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer has allowed the integrated circuit (IC) industry to create superior, high-performance solutions. In addition, doping techniques are vital in the silicon sector due to the need to regulate the material electrical properties. The spin on dopant (SOD) approach is an alternative method that involves spinning a solution containing dopant onto SOI wafers. This research aims to determine the impact of thermal diffusion temperature and soaking time on sheet resistance of doped SOI wafer using SOD approach. Additionally, the homogeneity of doping was studied by utilizing mapping techniques. Three inches boron-doped SOI wafers were cut and cleaned according to Radio Corporation of America (RCA) standards. N-type dopants of Filmtronics SOD P509 were deposited on SOI wafer by using a spin coater, for 40 seconds at 4,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The thermal diffusion temperature and soaking time were set between 700°C to 1000°C for 30 to 120 minutes. After thermal diffusion, hydrofluoric acids (HF) were diluted and used to etch samples. All materials were evaluated using a four-point probe, Hall Effect and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The results show that when the thermal diffusion soaking time increases, sheet resistance decreases until activated dopants are saturated. When sheet resistance decreases, dopant concentration rises. Temperature and soaking time increase carrier density and surface roughness, while decreasing Hall mobility. From mapping techniques, it shows low non-uniformity value which less than 10% suggests good thermal diffusion control.},

Three significant operational parameters of the spiral concentrator, namely feed rate (t/h), solid feed (wt.%), and splitter position (cm), were investigated to observe their effects on the SiO2 grade (%) and recovery of SiO2 (%) in the middlings using Design of Experiments (DOE). The raw sample was sieved to prepare the feed sample in the size range of -600+75µm, which was the suitable particle size range for the glassmaking process. The SiO2 grade (%) of each middling fraction from 33 test runs was determined from XRF analysis. The analysis determined that the feed rate and weight of the solid feed (wt.%) significantly affected the separation, while the splitter position in the investigated range (4.5-5.5cm) showed a negligible effect on the percentage and recovery of SiO2 in the middling fraction. It was observed that a maximum SiO2 grade of 94.98% was achieved at a solid feed of 25%, feed rate of 0.63 t/h, and splitter position of 5.5cm. The highest SiO2 recovery of 89.74% was achieved at the solid feed of 15%, feed rate of 0.45t/h, and splitter position of 5.0cm. A trade-off between the optimized results for SiO2 Grade (%) and recovery of SiO2 (%) responses using overlaid contour plots suggested a feed rate of 0.58 t/h of feed rate and 25 wt. % solid feed regardless of the splitter position. The customized range of parameters is expected to produce 94.51% SiO2 grade (%) and 80.11% recovery of SiO2 in the middling fraction.},

Trials and proposed methods were adopted to investigate blasting geometry results. Results obtained showed that the trials method of 1.2 m by 1.2 m and proposed blasts method of 2.0 m by 2.0 m burden and spacing at 9m depth, covered areas were 80.64 m2 and 99.36 m2 respectively, while at 12 m depth with same blasting geometry covered 224 m2 and 276 m2 respectively. The first trial and proposed blasts methods using burden and spacing of 1.2 m by 1.2 m produced 2,583.71 tons and 2,387.62 tons respectively. Hence, with the use of 2.0 m by 2.0 m burden and spacing, the blasts operations produced 7,176.96 tons and 6,632.28 tons respectively. Meanwhile, the results revealed that, short burden (≤ 1.2 m by 1.2 m) threatens safety in which flyrocks are spawned and it’s dangerous to equipment and personnel, at the same time, the areas covered, quantity produced (i.e. volume) and the tonnage were small compared to the engineering control methods.

Thus, in this paper, the main factors are listed and defined. They are divided into two main categories: the positives and the negatives. The positives are the longevity of the minerals&#39; mining, the index of the annual met need, the environmental-social condition of the resources, and the condition of the resources in friend countries. Also, the negative ones are the harmful chemicals released, the energy required per ton of minerals, annual CO2 emitted per ton, and recyclability. Accordingly, the factors can be used to make a strategic plan for the future of the minerals supply of a country.

  abstract     = {Sand casting is a metal casting process to make a component by pouring molten metal into the sand mold. The casting process, the sand is the fundamental material used for mold making. The sand used is generally silica sand, river sand, mountain sand, and beach sand. The sand for molding must have requirements such as having formability, suitable permeability, good distribution of sand grain size, resistance to high temperatures, suitable binder composition, and sand must be cheap. This study investigated to determine the potential of Krueng Mane river sand in Aceh Indonesia for its possible use for metal casting. The important properties studied are moisture content, total clay content, grain fineness number, and grain shape. Tests are carried out following the standards and procedures defined by the American Foundrymen’s Society (AFS). Results obtained revealed that the river sand has average moisture content of 7.78 %, clay content of 3.20%, and grain fineness number (GFN) of 46. Krueng Mane river sand will be suitable for casting of casting of light steel, heavy grey steel, medium grey iron, and non-ferrous metals, with the addition of binding agent in suitable proportion.},

  abstract     = {Metal injection molding (MIM) feedstock is composed of Cu powder and a complex binder system that consists of PA6, MgSt, and GMS with various solid loading (43-53vol%). Cu powders used are fabricated by gas and water atomization. Powder particle shapes used have spherical and dendritic shapes. Sphericity of particles can be identified by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). A rheology test is used to ensure the optimum solid loading and investigate the influence of particle shape. The pseudo-plastic behavior of all the feedstock is exhibited by decreasing viscosity along with increasing shear rate for all working temperatures. In this study, rheological test result such as viscosity, flow activation energy, and flow behavior index of feedstock indicates that the optimum solid loading was selected as 43 vol%. Both gas and water atomized powders are desirable for MIM feedstock. According to the rheology behavior test, gas-atomized powders with spherical shape has better rheology stability than water-atomized powders with dendritic shape. The proper MIM feedstock was selected to solid loading 43 vol% with gas-atomized powders.},

Tensile test results show that 6.25% pre-deformation given on the steel increases of yield strength. In contrast, the ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation decrease. The FCG rate (da/dN) of AISI 1020 steel without pre-deformation determined at stage II is 6.12´10-11$\Delta$K2.94 m/cycle and steel with 6.25% pre-deformation is 8.03´10-10$\Delta$K2.02 m/cycle. According to microstructural observation for the pre-deformation steel, plastic deformation formed on the steel in the axial direction affects the FCG rate of the steel, leads to crack retardation for certain period of time. SEM fractographic observation on the fracture surface of the steel shows that a transgrannular crack length of 12 mm for 42,000 cycles occurs at ferrite grains. The steel failed when the crack length reached ~18.1 mm within 43,500 cycles and continuing up to 43,549 cyles, the steel experienced static failure.},

  abstract     = {Direct chill (DC) casting has been considered as one of the promising casting methods that can be used to produce aluminum alloys billet. The process is conducted by pouring aluminum metal into a water-cooled mold. The billet shell begins to form when molten aluminum contact directly with the mold (this is also known as primary cooling). Afterward, the starting block is pulled downwards at a specified casting speed to achieve desired aluminum billet. The start-up phase during the DC casting process is considered a crucial step since it may determine the formation of defects in the casting products. This research aims to investigate the casting defects on the aluminum alloy that were formed during the start-up process of DC casting. The results show that the billet failed to form following the downward movement of starting block. Meanwhile, the billet tended to stick to the mold wall due to several factors, such as too low a pouring temperature, a less-round mold shape, the poor quality of the hot top and graphite ring, and the water that entered the mold during the casting process. It also noted several markers of the casting defects that occurred during the DC casting process such as liquation or bleeding, cold folding, billet stuck in the mold, butt structure, and rough billet surface.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive understanding of powder flow is essential, particularly in the synthesis of additives in the solid free-forming process and dosage dispensing in pharmaceutical industries. The vibration method is the most widely used for inducing powder flow. In this method, a hopper containing powder is vibrated by a piezoelectric system to allow powder flow. However, there are several drawbacks in this method, particularly in the degree of consistency of the resulting flow. This occurs because the vibration characteristics created have a single axis direction, resulting in which can lead to powder compaction. To resolve this problem, this research is conducted to determine the flow properties of titanium powder dispensed by 2-axis vibration. The titanium (Ti) powder having a size of less than 74 $\mu$m in the powder hopper was vibrated for 15 min by a DC motor and the weight of the dispensed powder was measured to evaluate the consistency of the resulting powder flow. The result shows that the powder flow generated by the DC motor was consistent during the period of dispensing. However, the powder flow rate dropped up to 8.6% during 5-10 min of dispensing at a speed of 1800 rpm. In conclusion, the 2-axis vibration by using a DC motor could prevent the powder compacting phenomenon and ensure a consistent flow of micro-sized powders during the dispensing process.},
