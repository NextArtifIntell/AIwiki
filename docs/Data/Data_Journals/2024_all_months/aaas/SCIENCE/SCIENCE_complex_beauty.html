  abstract     = {In lymphoid tissue associated with the gut, interactions between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells regulate how the immune system responds to food. Campos Canesso et al . found that APCs presenting food antigens largely belong to the cDC1 subset and have an intrinsic capacity to promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Infection with the parasitic worm Strongyloides venezuelensis decreased the frequency of cDC1s presenting food antigens, increased the relative proportion of APCs with a proinflammatory phenotype, and limited their capacity to present food antigens. This change was associated with impaired tolerance to food and connected to a reduction in food-specific Treg cells, but without the development of food-specific proinflammatory T cells. —Sarah H. Ross The intestinal immune system must concomitantly tolerate food and commensals and protect against pathogens. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to CD4 + T cells and inducing their differentiation into regulatory (peripheral regulatory T cell) or inflammatory [T helper (Th) cell] subsets. We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs—including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Rorγt + APCs—and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s. These inflammatory cDC2s expanded by helminth infection did not present dietary antigens, thus avoiding diet-specific Th2 responses.},

  abstract     = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is essential for all domains of life, and its central role makes it an ideal target for antiviral defense. Li et al . describe an immune strategy mediated by a type III CRISPR-Cas–associated adenosine deaminase (CAAD) and a Nudix hydrolase that deplete ATP in response to the detection of nucleic acids. Using cryo–electron microscopy structures and biochemical analyses, the authors found that cyclic oligoadenylate secondary messengers produced by type III CRISPR-Cas activate CAAD to specifically deaminate ATP. These findings reveal a mechanism by which CRISPR-Cas regulates an ATP depletion strategy as an antiviral defense. —Di Jiang Prokaryotes have evolved diverse defense strategies against viral infection, including foreign nucleic acid degradation by CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA and RNA synthesis inhibition through nucleotide pool depletion. Here, we report an antiviral mechanism of type III CRISPR-Cas–regulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion in which ATP is converted into inosine triphosphate (ITP) by CRISPR-Cas–associated adenosine deaminase (CAAD) upon activation by either cA 4 or cA 6 , followed by hydrolysis into inosine monophosphate (IMP) by Nudix hydrolase, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest. The cryo–electron microscopy structures of CAAD in its apo and activated forms, together with biochemical evidence, revealed how cA 4 or cA 6 binds to the CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain and abrogates CAAD autoinhibition, inducing substantial conformational changes that reshape the structure of CAAD and induce its deaminase activity. Our results reveal the mechanism of a CRISPR-Cas–regulated ATP depletion antiviral strategy.},

  abstract     = {Exhaustion describes diminished functional states that may arise when T cells respond to chronic viral infection or tumors. Ma et al . examined how histone acetylation in exhausted T cells was influenced by metabolic enzymes that generate acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) through different nutrients. ATP-citrate lyase colocalized with the histone acetyltransferase KAT2A and promoted histone acetylations at loci associated with terminal exhaustion through glucose-derived citrate. Acetyl–CoA synthetase 2, which generates acetyl-CoA from acetate, associated with a different histone acetyltransferase called p300 and controlled patterns of histone modification associated with an exhausted state that facilitates self-renewal of T cells with some effector function. Increasing the activity of acetyl–CoA synthetase 2 relative to ATP–citrate lyase could limit terminal T cell dysfunction. —Sarah H. Ross Exhausted T cells (TEX) in cancer and chronic viral infections undergo metabolic and epigenetic remodeling, impairing their protective capabilities. However, the impact of nutrient metabolism on epigenetic modifications that control TEX differentiation remains unclear. We showed that TEX cells shifted from acetate to citrate metabolism by down-regulating acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) while maintaining ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) activity. This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses. These findings unveiled a nutrient-instructed histone code governing CD8 + T cell differentiation, with implications for metabolic- and epigenetic-based T cell therapies.},

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic genomes are organized into chromatin, in which a strand of DNA is wrapped compactly around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes can be chemically modified by epigenetic marks to regulate gene expression. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) is critical for active transcription, splicing, and genomic stability. Using cryo–electron microscopy, Markert et al . determined the mechanism by which the enzyme SETD2 deposits H3K36me3 by recognizing and binding to nucleosomes partially unwrapped by the transcription machinery. This finding provides a structural basis for how some histone modifications are established co-transcriptionally. —Di Jiang During transcription, RNA polymerase II traverses through chromatin, and posttranslational modifications including histone methylations mark regions of active transcription. Histone protein H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), which is established by the histone methyltransferase SET domain containing 2 (SETD2), suppresses cryptic transcription, regulates splicing, and serves as a binding site for transcription elongation factors. The mechanism by which the transcription machinery coordinates the deposition of H3K36me3 is not well understood. Here we provide cryo–electron microscopy structures of mammalian RNA polymerase II–DSIF-SPT6-PAF1c-TFIIS-IWS1-SETD2-nucleosome elongation complexes, revealing that the transcription machinery regulates H3K36me3 deposition by SETD2 on downstream and upstream nucleosomes. SPT6 binds the exposed H2A-H2B dimer during transcription, and the SPT6 death-like domain mediates an interaction with SETD2 bound to a nucleosome upstream of RNA polymerase II.},

  abstract     = {Fidgetin-like 1 ( Fignl1 ) is an essential gene in mice, and mutations have been found in various cancers and genetic disorders. FIGNL1 plays critical roles in maintaining genome stability by modulating RAD51 recombinase, a key component in the DNA repair processes. Carver et al . revealed that FIGNL1 prevents RAD51 chromatin association, and this behavior is responsible for its essential activity in cell viability. A cryo–electron microscopy structure and comprehensive in vitro and in vivo data uncover a mechanistic model for RAD51 dissociation where FIGNL1, a protein belonging to the AAA+ ATPase protein family, encloses and pulls the RAD51 N terminus in its hexamer pore, leading to RAD51 remodeling and dissociation from chromatin. —Di Jiang Maintaining genome integrity is an essential and challenging process. RAD51 recombinase, the central component of several crucial processes in repairing DNA and protecting genome integrity, forms filaments on DNA, which are tightly regulated. One of these RAD51 regulators is FIGNL1 (fidgetin-like 1), which prevents RAD51 genotoxic chromatin association in normal cells and persistent RAD51 foci upon DNA damage. The cryogenic electron microscopy–imaged structure of FIGNL1 in complex with RAD51 reveals that FIGNL1 forms a nonplanar hexamer and encloses RAD51 N terminus in the FIGNL1 hexamer pore. Mutations in pore loop or catalytic residues of FIGNL1 render it defective in filament disassembly and are lethal in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our study reveals a distinct mechanism for removing RAD51 from bound substrates and provides the molecular basis for FIGNL1 in maintaining genome stability.},

  abstract     = {Antibodies, which are produced by B cells known as plasma cells, play a central role in adaptive immunity. MacLean et al . used mouse models to understand the cellular processes underpinning how cells producing high-affinity antibodies against a pathogen dominate the plasma cell population. After immunization, B cells capable of producing high-affinity antibodies proliferated more than those that would produce low-affinity antibodies. The proliferation was associated with the extent of help received from T follicular helper cells, but it was not dependent on sustained cell-cell interactions. Rather, plasma cells could retain their proliferative advantage outside of germinal center structures, with signals from the cytokine interleukin-21 promoting cell division. —Sarah H. Ross Increased antibody affinity over time after vaccination, known as affinity maturation, is a prototypical feature of immune responses. Recent studies have shown that a diverse collection of B cells, producing antibodies with a wide spectrum of different affinities, is selected into the plasma cell (PC) pathway. How affinity-permissive selection enables PC affinity maturation remains unknown. We found that PC precursors (prePCs) expressing high-affinity antibodies received higher levels of T follicular helper cell (T FH cell)–derived help and divided at higher rates compared with their lower-affinity counterparts once they left the germinal center. Our findings indicate that differential cell division by selected prePCs accounts for how diverse precursors develop into a PC compartment that mediates serological affinity maturation.},

Jiang et al . developed a computational approach called EVOLVEpro that uses recently developed protein language models within the framework of a top-layer regression model. A small number of experimental observations can guide protein evolution toward the desired functional outcomes and avoid stable, but nonfunctional, deadends. The authors demonstrate the capabilities of the method for evolving desired functions in six different example cases relevant to current molecular biology challenges, including evolving a miniature CRISPR nuclease, optimized antibodies, and an improved T7 RNA polymerase. —Michael A. Funk Directed protein evolution is central to biomedical applications but faces challenges such as experimental complexity, inefficient multiproperty optimization, and local maxima traps. Although in silico methods that use protein language models (PLMs) can provide modeled fitness landscape guidance, they struggle to generalize across diverse protein families and map to protein activity. We present EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework that combines PLMs and regression models to rapidly improve protein activity. EVOLVEpro surpasses current methods, yielding up to 100-fold improvements in desired properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness across six proteins in RNA production, genome editing, and antibody binding applications. These results highlight the advantages of few-shot active learning with minimal experimental data over zero-shot predictions.

Two groups now report the identification of a cellulose synthase–like protein named GAME15 that directs the biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites. Jozwiak et al . found that GAME15 functions both as a cholesterol glucuronosyltransferase and as a scaffolding protein in a metabolon that controls cholesterol and steroidal glycoalkaloid intermediates. Boccia et al . identified the same protein and showed that deletion of the corresponding gene in Solanum nigrum produced plants lacking both steroidal alkaloids and saponins. Identification of GAME15 will pave the way to engineering the production of chemical defense molecules in heterologous plant hosts, and may aid our understanding of the balance between chemical defense and self-toxicity. —Ankit Walia Decades of research on the infamous antinutritional steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in Solanaceae plants have provided deep insights into their metabolism and roles. However, engineering SGAs in heterologous hosts has remained a challenge. We discovered that a protein evolved from the machinery involved in building plant cell walls is the crucial link in the biosynthesis of SGAs. We show that cellulose synthase–like M [GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM15 (GAME15)] functions both as a cholesterol glucuronosyltransferase and a scaffold protein. Silencing GAME15 depletes SGAs, which makes plants more vulnerable to pests.

  abstract     = {Aging is associated with impairments in mitochondrial functions. However, how aging affects mitochondria in neurons remains to be fully elucidated. Li et al . examined the role of mitochondrial transcription in learning and memory in the hippocampus of young and aged mice and identified a strong coupling between excitation and mitochondrial transcription (see the Perspective by Bingul and Owen). This process appears to be compromised in aging brains, and increasing its effectiveness counteracted age-dependent cognitive decline in rodents, suggesting a potential target for fighting the cognitive decline associated with aging. —Mattia Maroso Deciphering the complex interplay between neuronal activity and mitochondrial function is pivotal in understanding brain aging, a multifaceted process marked by declines in synaptic function and mitochondrial performance. Here, we identified an age-dependent coupling between neuronal and synaptic excitation and mitochondrial DNA transcription (E-TC mito ), which operates differently compared to classic excitation-transcription coupling in the nucleus (E-TC nuc ). We demonstrated that E-TC mito repurposes molecules traditionally associated with E-TC nuc to regulate mitochondrial DNA expression in areas closely linked to synaptic activation. The effectiveness of E-TC mito weakens with age, contributing to age-related neurological deficits in mice. Boosting brain E-TC mito in aged animals ameliorated these impairments, offering a potential target to counteract age-related cognitive decline.},

  abstract     = {Fossil data from the Phanerozoic eon provide insight into long-term changes in global biodiversity and how it has been shaped by evolution, environmental change, and species interactions. Insights from the earlier Proterozoic eon are relatively lacking because of historic gaps and inconsistencies in data. Using recent advances in data and analytical methods, Tang et al . produced updated estimates of eukaryote diversity across the Proterozoic. They found a gradual increase in species richness during the “Boring Billion” pre-Cryogenian period, which is distinct from the higher diversity and dynamics of the later Ediacaran. Cryogenian glaciations appear to define this shift toward greater extinction and diversification rates. —Bianca Lopez The global diversity of Proterozoic eukaryote fossils is poorly quantified despite its fundamental importance to the understanding of macroevolutionary patterns and dynamics on the early Earth. Here we report a new construction of fossil eukaryote diversity from the Paleoproterozoic to early Cambrian based on a comprehensive data compilation and quantitative analyses. The resulting taxonomic richness curve verifies Cryogenian glaciations as a major divide that separates the “Boring Billion” and Ediacaran periods, with the former characterized by a prolonged stasis, and the latter by greater diversity, more-rapid turnover, and multiple radiations and extinctions. These contrasting evolutionary patterns and dynamics provide a framework to test competing hypotheses on biosphere and geosphere coevolution in the Proterozoic Eon.},

  abstract     = {RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are sensors that detect viral RNA in animal cells. RLRs signal to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) adaptor protein to stimulate the formation of a signaling complex that triggers the activation of transcription factors and antiviral gene programs. Gokhale et al . found that an unstructured region within MAVS interacts with the 3′ untranslated regions of cellular RNA, rather than viral RNA, and this was not dependent on RLRs (see the Perspective by Best and Hage). Cellular RNAs influenced the interaction between MAVS and other proteins. Depletion of several proteins that were not previously known to regulate MAVS, but that interacted with MAVS in a cellular RNA–dependent manner, inhibited RLR-dependent antiviral responses. —Sarah H. Ross Antiviral signaling downstream of RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs) proceeds through a multi-protein complex organized around the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules that provide allosteric regulation or act as molecular guides or scaffolds. We hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. We found that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacted with the 3′ untranslated regions of cellular messenger RNAs. Elimination of RNA by ribonuclease treatment disrupted the MAVS signalosome, including RNA-modulated MAVS interactors that regulate RLR signaling and viral restriction, and inhibited phosphorylation of transcription factors that induce interferons. This work uncovered a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights generalizable principles of RNA regulatory control of immune signaling complexes.},

  abstract     = {5-Aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) functions in mitochondria as the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biogenesis. Lee et al . uncovered a link between ALAS1 and microRNA regulation. Using genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches, they found that ALAS1 limits microRNA accumulation by inhibiting the assembly of the mature Argonaute effector complexes that are responsible for messenger RNA degradation. This role of ALAS1 is independent of its canonical role in heme production and is mediated by cytoplasmic ALAS1. The authors provide proof-of-concept in mice that Alas1 suppression enhances the silencing activity of synthetic small interfering RNAs, suggesting its potential as a general adjuvant for RNA interference therapies. —Di Jiang microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are 21- to 22-nucleotide RNAs that guide Argonaute-class effectors to targets for repression. In this work, we uncover 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), the initiating enzyme for heme biosynthesis, as a general repressor of miRNA accumulation. Although heme is known to be a positive cofactor for the nuclear miRNA processing machinery, ALAS1—but not other heme biosynthesis enzymes—limits the assembly and activity of Argonaute complexes under heme-replete conditions. This involves a cytoplasmic role for ALAS1, previously considered inactive outside of mitochondria. Moreover, conditional depletion of ALAS activity from mouse hepatocytes increases miRNAs and enhances siRNA-mediated knockdown. Notably, because ALAS1 is the target of a Food and Drug Administration–approved siRNA drug, agents that suppress ALAS may serve as adjuvants for siRNA therapies.},

Recent efforts to extend target compounds into the third dimension therefore necessitate distinct methods. He et al . showcase a versatile two-stage protocol for modifying piperidines, the saturated, three-dimensional analogs of pyridines, by successive enzymatic hydroxylation and nickel electrocatalytic cross-coupling. The resulting products would previously have required more circuitous customized routes to obtain. —Jake S. Yeston Modern medicinal chemists are targeting more complex molecules to address challenging biological targets, which leads to synthesizing structures with higher sp 3 character (Fsp 3 ) to enhance specificity as well as physiochemical properties. Although traditional flat, high-fraction sp 2 molecules, such as pyridine, can be decorated through electrophilic aromatic substitution and palladium (Pd)–based cross-couplings, general strategies to derivatize three-dimensional (3D) saturated molecules are far less developed. In this work, we present an approach for the rapid, modular, enantiospecific, and diastereoselective functionalization of piperidine (saturated analog of pyridine), combining robust biocatalytic carbon-hydrogen oxidation with radical cross-coupling. This combination is directly analogous to electrophilic aromatic substitution followed by Pd-couplings for flat molecules, streamlining synthesis of 3D molecules. This study offers a generalizable strategy for accessing complex architectures, appealing to both medicinal and process chemists.},

Lu et al . found that unlike other chiral emitters, these blackbody emitters have no vibronic state limitations and can achieve high brightness (see the Perspective by Bharadwaj and Jacob). The spectral characteristics were modeled with a mechanism that reconciled Planck’s law and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Ceramic composites allowed the electrically heated emitters to achieve long lifetimes. —Phil Szuromi Planck’s law ignores but does not prohibit black-body radiation (BBR) from being circularly polarized. BBR from nanostructured filaments with twisted geometry from nanocarbon or metal has strong ellipticity from 500 to 3000 nanometers. The submicrometer-scale chirality of these filaments satisfies the dimensionality requirements imposed by fluctuation-dissipation theorem and requires symmetry breaking in absorptivity and emissivity according to Kirchhoff’s law. The resulting BBR shows emission anisotropy and brightness exceeding those of conventional chiral photon emitters by factors of 10 to 100. The helical structure of these filaments enables precise spectral tuning of the chiral emission, which can be modeled using electromagnetic principles and chirality metrics. Encapsulating nanocarbon filaments in refractive ceramics produces highly efficient, adjustable, and durable chiral emitters capable of functioning at extreme temperatures previously considered unattainable.},

In mouse models and a human organoid system, delivering antigens from four distinct influenza strains in a format in which they were coupled together through a scaffold increased the production of antibodies toward each strain. Broader responses were correlated with increased diversity of helper T cells that support B cells to make antibodies. —Sarah H. Ross The seasonal influenza vaccine contains strains of viruses from distinct subtypes that are grown independently and then combined. However, most individuals exhibit a more robust response to one of these strains and thus are vulnerable to infection by others. By studying a monozygotic twin cohort, we found that although prior exposure is a factor, host genetics are a stronger driver of subtype bias to influenza viral strains. We found that covalent coupling of heterologous hemagglutinin (HA) from different viral strains could largely eliminate subtype bias in an animal model and in a human tonsil organoid system. We proposed that coupling of heterologous antigens improves antibody responses across influenza strains by broadening T cell help, and we found that using this approach substantially improved the antibody response to avian influenza HA.},

By increasing the optomechanical couplings, the system transitions from individual to collective motion, characterized by a N enhancement of cavity-collective mode coupling, akin to superradiance of atomic ensembles. Using sideband cooling, we prepare the collective mode in the quantum ground state and measure its quantum sideband asymmetry, with zero-point motion distributed across distant oscillators.

Hydrodynamic vorticities at fixed locations played the role of lattice sites in each fluid layer. The authors experimentally visualized these moiré superlattices by observing their characteristic temperature fields and noted substantial delocalization and localization in the transport of physical quantities. Their observations show how moiré flat bands can be created in hydrodynamic metamaterials. —Brent Grocholski The structural periodicity in photonic crystals guarantees the crystal’s effective energy band structure, which is the fundamental cornerstone of topological and moiré physics. However, the shear modulus in most fluids is close to zero, which makes it challenging for fluids to maintain spatial periodicity akin to photonic crystals. We realized periodic vortices in hydrodynamic metamaterials and created a bilayer moiré superlattice by stacking and twisting two such vortex fluids. We observed energy delocalization and localization when the twist angles, respectively, result in the Pythagorean and non-Pythagorean triples in the fluidic moiré superlattice. Anomalous localization was found even in commensurate moiré fluids with large lattice constants that satisfy Pythagorean triples. Our work reports the moiré phenomena in fluids and opens an unexpected door to controlling the energy transfer, mass transport, and particle navigation through the elaborate dynamics of vortices in fluidic moiré superlattices.},

  abstract     = {The deuterium and carbon-13 content in methane extracted from the ground are expected to provide evidence as to whether it was created by microbial methanogenesis from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which enriches light isotopes, or through thermogenic or other biological processes. Mayumi et al . found that under subsurface conditions of low hydrogen and high hydrostatic pressure, hydrogen-consuming methanogen cultures in fact equilibrate the isotopes to near-equilibrium values. Carbon cycling within the deep biosphere may thus be more complicated than previously thought, and the authors argue for reevaluation of conclusions about the origin of subsurface methane based on isotope effects. —Michael A. Funk Methane, a greenhouse gas and energy source, is commonly studied using stable isotope signals as proxies for its formation processes. In subsurface environments, methane often exhibits equilibrium isotopic signals, but the equilibration process has never been demonstrated in the laboratory. We cocultured a hydrogenotrophic methanogen with an H 2 -producing bacterium under conditions (55°C, 10 megapascals) simulating a methane-bearing subsurface. This resulted in near-complete reversibility of methanogenesis, leading to equilibria for both hydrogen and carbon isotopes. The methanogen not only equilibrated kinetic isotope signals of initially produced methane but also modified the isotope signals of amended thermogenic methane. These findings suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis can overwrite the isotope signals of subsurface methane, distorting proxies for its origin and formation temperature—insights crucial for natural gas exploration.},

In the aging mammalian brain, mitochondrial metabolism begins to break down, with widespread consequences for neuronal and circuit function. Degradation of the OXPHOS pathway can drive oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage during aging ( 1 ). Yet the process by which OXPHOS activity becomes degraded and impairs mitochondrial efficiency has remained unclear. On page 1363 of this issue, Li et al ( 2 ) demonstrate that neuronal excitation increases mitochondrial gene transcription, a process that diminishes with age in mice. Remarkably, restoration of excitation-transcription coupling in mitochondria improves memory function, identifying a potential route to reverse age-related cognitive decline.},

However, dysregulated expression of IFN-I can exacerbate inflammatory responses in the context of viral infection and otherwise promote autoimmunity ( 2 ).

TIR domains across different kingdoms have NADase activities and can produce phosphoribosyl adenosine monophosphate/diphosphate (pRib-AMP/ADP) or cyclic ADPR (cADPR) isomers. The lipase-like proteins EDS1 and PAD4 transduce immune signals from sensor TIR-NLRs to a helper NLR called ADR1, which executes immune function. We report the structure and function of an Arabidopsis EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 (EPA) heterotrimer in complex with pRib-AMP/ADP activated by plant or bacterial TIR signaling. 2′cADPR can be hydrolyzed into pRib-AMP and thus activate EPA signaling. Bacterial TIR domains producing 2′cADPR also activate EPA function. Our findings suggest that 2′cADPR may be the storage form of the unstable signaling molecule pRib-AMP.},

By screening suppressors of rod1 mutants, we show that ROD1 governs immune homeostasis by surveilling the activation of a canonical immune pathway. Mutations in OsTIR ( TIR-only protein ), OsEDS1 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 1 ), OsPAD4 ( phytoalexin deficient 4 ), and OsADR1 ( activated disease resistance 1 ) all abolish enhanced disease resistance of rod1 plants. OsTIR catalyzes the production of second messengers 2′-(5″-phosphoribosyl)-5′-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP), which trigger formation of an OsEDS1-OsPAD4-OsADR1 (EPA) immune complex. ROD1 interacts with OsTIR and inhibits its enzymatic activity, whereas mutation of ROD1 leads to constitutive activation of the EPA complex.

The basalt contains a low abundance of elements that produce radioactive heat, which is insufficient to explain the eruption. The authors suggest that the thin crust below the impact basin allowed volcanism to persist in that region. They also discuss implications for remotely dating lunar surfaces. —Keith T. Smith Remote sensing observations have shown that the far side of the Moon (lunar farside) has different geology and rock composition to those of the nearside, including the abundances of potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus (collectively known as KREEP). The Chang’e-6 (CE-6) spacecraft collected samples from the South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin on the farside and brought them to Earth. We used lead-lead and rubidium-strontium isotope systems to date low-titanium basalt in a CE-6 sample, finding a consistent age of 2830 (±5) million years. We interpret this as the date of volcanism in SPA and incorporate it into lunar crater chronology. Strontium, neodymium, and lead isotopes indicate that the volcanic magma was from a lunar mantle source depleted in incompatible elements and containing almost no KREEP component.},

  abstract     = {Steroid-based natural products produced in Solanum species act as chemical defense molecules against pests and pathogens, and some also have antinutritional properties for humans. Two groups now report the identification of a cellulose synthase–like protein named GAME15 that directs the biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites. Jozwiak et al . found that GAME15 functions both as a cholesterol glucuronosyltransferase and as a scaffolding protein in a metabolon that controls cholesterol and steroidal glycoalkaloid intermediates. Boccia et al . identified the same protein and showed that deletion of the corresponding gene in Solanum nigrum produced plants lacking both steroidal alkaloids and saponins. Identification of GAME15 will pave the way to engineering the production of chemical defense molecules in heterologous plant hosts, and may aid our understanding of the balance between chemical defense and self-toxicity. —Ankit Walia Solanaceae plants produce two major classes of valuable sterol-derived natural products—steroidal glycoalkaloids and steroidal saponins—from a common cholesterol precursor. Attempts to heterologously produce these molecules have consistently failed, although the genes responsible for each biosynthetic step have been identified. Here we identify a cellulose synthase–like protein, an unexpected biosynthetic component that interacts with the early pathway enzymes, enabling steroidal scaffolds production in plants. Moreover, knockout of this gene in black nightshade, Solanum nigrum , resulted in plants lacking both steroidal alkaloids and saponins. Unexpectedly, these knockout plants also revealed that steroidal saponins deter serious agricultural insect pests. This discovery provides the missing link to engineer these high-value steroidal molecules and also pinpoints the ecological role for steroidal saponins.},

However, many questions remain about how selection has acted on introgressed variants as well as the diversity of hominin individuals who contributed to this admixture. Iasi et al . identified Neanderthal ancestry in genomic data from 59 ancient and 275 present-day human samples. They found that gene flow likely happened over a period of about 6000 years, and that positive and negative selection acted within about 100 generations on these introgressed segments. Surprisingly, the authors didn’t find evidence for a second pulse of introgression into East Eurasians despite the increased levels of introgression found in modern individuals. —Corinne Simonti Gene flow from Neanderthals has shaped genetic and phenotypic variation in modern humans. We generated a catalog of Neanderthal ancestry segments in more than 300 genomes spanning the past 50,000 years. We examined how Neanderthal ancestry is shared among individuals over time. Our analysis revealed that the vast majority of Neanderthal gene flow is attributable to a single, shared extended period of gene flow that occurred between 50,500 to 43,500 years ago, as evidenced by ancestry correlation, colocalization of Neanderthal segments across individuals, and divergence from the sequenced Neanderthals. Most natural selection—positive and negative—on Neanderthal variants occurred rapidly after the gene flow. Our findings provide new insights into how contact with Neanderthals shaped modern human origins and adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Organs such as the lungs are complex structures with multiple tissue compartments, each governed by its own stem cell population. The individual compartments can act differently upon injury or in disease, making it difficult to identify which cells to target therapeutically. Jones et al . report that alveolar fibroblasts direct the response of the lung to acute injury, promoting the competition of airway epithelial stem cells over alveolar epithelial stem cells. Alterations in this competitive balance are also observed in human lung diseases that result from acute injury. The data from these studies highlight important pathways that promote the proper regeneration of respiratory function in the lungs and may suggest targets for future therapies. —Stella M. Hurtley Severe lung injury causes airway basal stem cells to migrate and outcompete alveolar stem cells, resulting in dysplastic repair. We found that this “stem cell collision” generates an injury-induced tissue niche containing keratin 5 + epithelial cells and plastic Pdgfra + mesenchymal cells. Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling. Thus, we have identified an injury-induced niche in the lung with the ability to discriminate human lung disease phenotypes.},

Kim et al . reviewed strategies for developing better interconnects by focusing on the carrier mean free path and cohesive energies of materials. —Phil Szuromi The advancement in semiconductor technology through the integration of more devices on a chip has reached a point where device scaling alone is no longer an efficient way to improve the device performance. One issue lies in the interconnects connecting the transistors, in which the resistivity of metals increases exponentially as their dimensions are scaled down to match those of the transistors. As a result, the total signal processing delay is dominated by the resistance-capacitance (RC) delay from the interconnects rather than the delay from the transistors’ switching speed. This bottleneck has spurred efforts both in academia and industry to explore alternative materials and disruptive device structures. Therefore, we suggest strategies to overcome the RC delay of the interconnects in both material and device aspects.},

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone.

This organization enables the rapid spread of resistance genes between bacterial species through transfer of the plasmid. Taking inspiration from these systems, Xie et al . developed a CRISPR-Cas–based system to move large fragments of genetic material from bacterial chromosomes to plasmids within the same cell. This switch allows for the replication and cloning of biosynthetic genes from microbes that may be challenging to work with. Enhanced expression of gene clusters either in the native organism or in a heterologous system allowed for the identification of four previously uncharacterized groups of natural products. —Michael A. Funk The transmission of antibiotic-resistance genes, comprising mobilization and relocation events, orchestrates the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Inspired by this evolutionarily successful paradigm, we developed ACTIMOT, a CRISPR-Cas9–based approach to unlock the vast chemical diversity concealed within bacterial genomes. ACTIMOT enables the efficient mobilization and relocation of large DNA fragments from the chromosome to replicative plasmids within the same bacterial cell. ACTIMOT circumvents the limitations of traditional molecular cloning methods involving handling and replicating large pieces of genomic DNA. Using ACTIMOT, we mobilized and activated four cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters from Streptomyces , leading to the discovery of 39 compounds across four distinct classes. This work highlights the potential of ACTIMOT for accelerating the exploration of biosynthetic pathways and the discovery of natural products.},

Feng and Gleason mapped daily streamflow in 2.9 million rivers globally to determine how their flow characteristics may have changed over the past several decades. They found that average flow volumes increased in headwaters and decreased in basin outlets since 1984. Among other consequences, these changes increased the frequency of 100-year flood occurrence in headwaters, whereas the flooding potential of downstream regions did not change. —H. Jesse Smith We mapped daily streamflow from 1984 to 2018 in approximately 2.9 million rivers to assess recent changes to global river systems. We found that river outlets were dominated by significant decreases in flow, whereas headwaters were 1.7 times more likely to have significantly increased flow than decreased. These changes result in a significant upstream shift in streamflow experienced by about 29% of the global land surface. We found the most changes in the smallest steams in our study: increases in erosion potential (approximately 5% increase in stream power), flood frequency (approximately 42% increase in 100-year floods), and likely nutrient dynamics (altered seasonal flow regimes). We revealed these changes using “detail at scale” by mapping millions of individual rivers. Widely adopting this approach could reveal other changes to the hydrosphere.},

It is unclear whether the Sun can produce more intense flares than that or how often they might occur. Vasilyev et al . investigated brightness measurements of 56,000 Sun-like stars observed by the Kepler space telescope. They identified almost 3000 bright stellar flares with energies of about 10 34 to 10 35 erg, which are called superflares. The occurrence rate is about one superflare per star per century. If the Sun behaves like the stars in this sample, then it could produce superflares at a similar rate. —Keith T. Smith Stellar superflares are energetic outbursts of electromagnetic radiation that are similar to solar flares but release more energy, up to 10 36 erg on main-sequence stars. It is unknown whether the Sun can generate superflares and, if so, how often they might occur. We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies &gt;10 34 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun’s flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.},

In this study, we discovered that phage diversity consistently outstripped the diversity of their bacterial hosts under simple experimental conditions.

In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species.

The immediate-early response gene neuronal PAS domain protein 4 ( Npas4 ) increases its expression after emotional experiences and affects behavior. Akiki et al . discovered a Npas4 long noncoding enhancer RNA (lnc-eRNA) that was able to bind to DNA in the proximal Npas4 promoter. This binding event creates an RNA/DNA hybrid R loop structure that forms a three-dimensional chromatin loop between the enhancer and proximal promoter, ultimately resulting in a rapid Npas4 gene expression (see the Perspective by Czarnecki and Heller). Npas4 lnc-eRNA was required for the behavioral changes induced by chronic stress or cocaine exposure. These results identify an important regulatory mechanism linking emotional experiences to behavioral changes. —Mattia Maroso Emotional experiences often evoke neural plasticity that supports adaptive changes in behavior, including maladaptive plasticity associated with mood and substance use disorders. These adaptations are supported in part by experience-dependent activation of immediate-early response genes, such as Npas4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4). Here we show that a conserved long noncoding enhancer RNA (lnc-eRNA), transcribed from an activity-sensitive enhancer, produces DNA:RNA hybrid R-loop structures that support three-dimensional chromatin looping between enhancer and proximal promoter and rapid Npas4 gene induction. Furthermore, in mouse models, Npas4 lnc-eRNA and its R-loop are required for the development of behavioral adaptations produced by chronic psychosocial stress or cocaine exposure, revealing a potential role for this regulatory mechanism in the transmission of emotional experiences.},

Another claimed benefit of MPAs, however, is a “spillover” of fish into areas open for fishing. Whether this occurs for migratory fishes has been an open question given their movement across regions. Lynham et al . show that even for highly mobile species, specifically economically important tunas in the Pacific and Indian oceans, there is a spillover benefit of MPAs. Such results clearly underline that MPAs are essential for protecting both species and fisheries. —Sacha Vignieri Global tuna fisheries are valued at more than $40 billion, with the majority of this value derived from purse seine fisheries. Recently created large-scale marine protected areas are potentially big enough to protect highly migratory species such as tuna, possibly leading to increases in abundance (a conservation benefit) and consequent spillover near protected area boundaries (an economic benefit). Using publicly available data from nine large-scale marine protected areas across the Pacific and Indian oceans, we find that catch-per-unit-effort in tuna purse seine fisheries has increased by an average of 12 to 18% near protected area boundaries, and this increase declines with distance from the boundaries. The increase is larger for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) than for skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ), in line with fisheries science simulation models.},

We have seen that these events take a toll on marine species, from producers to predators, but it is unclear whether their impacts are persistent once water temperatures decline to normal levels. Renner et al . report that more than half of Alaska’s population of common murres died during a marine heatwave event between 2014 and 2016, with an estimated loss of 4 million birds. Recent population abundance estimates since then have found no evidence of recovery, suggesting that the heatwave may have led to an ecosystem shift. —Sacha Vignieri Recent marine heatwaves have had pervasive effects on marine ecosystems, from declines in primary production to die-offs of top predators. Seabird mortalities are often observed in association with heatwaves, but population impacts are not well understood. In this work, we report the rapid mortality of approximately half of Alaska’s common murre ( Uria aalge ) population in response to an extreme marine heatwave. Between the 7-year period before (2008–2014) and after (2016–2022) the heatwave, murre numbers plummeted 52 to 78% at 13 colonies across two large marine ecosystems. We calculated a loss of 4.00 million common murres, the largest documented wildlife mortality event in the modern era. No evidence of recovery has yet been observed, suggesting that these ecosystems may no longer support historic numbers of seabird top predators.},

  abstract     = {Finding thermoelectric devices that are flexible for harvesting things such as body heat has been challenging. Chen et al . improved thermoelectric inks for screen printing large-scale, flexible sheets by combining nanoplatelets of bismuth-telluride with tellurium nanorods. Screen printing and sintering this ink improved the thermoelectric properties, allowing for the construction of devices showing a promising amount of energy harvesting. This strategy should work for other materials and provides a way to produce large-scale, flexible thermoelectrics. —Brent Grocholski Limited flexibility, complex manufacturing processes, high costs, and insufficient performance are major factors restricting the scalability and commercialization of flexible inorganic thermoelectrics for wearable electronics and other high-end cooling applications. We developed an innovative, cost-effective technology that integrates solvothermal, screen-printing, and sintering techniques to produce an inorganic flexible thermoelectric film. Our printable film, comprising Bi 2 Te 3 -based nanoplates as highly orientated grains and Te nanorods as “nanobinders,” shows excellent thermoelectric performance for printable films, good flexibility, large-scale manufacturability, and low cost. We constructed a flexible thermoelectric device assembled by printable n-type Bi 2 Te 3 -based and p-type Bi 0.4 Sb 1.6 Te 3 films, which achieved a normalized power density of &gt;3 μW cm −2 K −2 , ranking among the highest in screen-printed devices. Moreover, this technology can be extended to other inorganic thermoelectric film systems, such as Ag 2 Se, showing broad applicability.},

Wu et al . synthesized libraries of conjugated organics molecules through Suzuki coupling to create large datasets and evaluated these molecules as hole transporters. A Bayesian model was trained on device performance and used to synthesize new candidates based on molecular descriptors. The optimal molecule achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.2% versus 24.6% for a state-of-the-art reference hole transporter. —Phil Szuromi The inverse design of tailored organic molecules for specific optoelectronic devices of high complexity holds an enormous potential but has not yet been realized. Current models rely on large data sets that generally do not exist for specialized research fields. We demonstrate a closed-loop workflow that combines high-throughput synthesis of organic semiconductors to create large datasets and Bayesian optimization to discover new hole-transporting materials with tailored properties for solar cell applications. The predictive models were based on molecular descriptors that allowed us to link the structure of these materials to their performance. A series of high-performance molecules were identified from minimal suggestions and achieved up to 26.2% (certified 25.9%) power conversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells.},

Yu et al . used radar altimetry observations from just 1 year of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission to develop a high-resolution global seafloor map (see the Perspective by Hwang and Yu). The new satellite observations have a resolution about twice that of the older observations, presenting an opportunity to better understand the geological features of the seafloor. —Brent Grocholski The global ocean covers 71% of Earth’s surface, yet the seafloor is poorly charted compared with land, the Moon, Mars, and Venus. Traditional ocean mapping uses ship-based soundings and nadir satellite radar altimetry—one limited in spatial coverage and the other in spatial resolution. The joint NASA–CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission uses phase-coherent, wide-swath radar altimetry to measure ocean surface heights at high precision. We show that 1 year of SWOT data offers more detailed information than 30 years of satellite nadir altimetry in marine gravity, enabling the detection of intricate seafloor structures at 8-kilometer spatial resolution. With the mission still ongoing, SWOT promises critical insights for bathymetric charting, tectonic plate reconstruction, underwater navigation, and deep ocean mixing.},

  abstract     = {Cells engineered to contain biological circuitry are potentially powerful diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Chen et al . designed a protein-based neural network that allows for comparison of amounts of multiple inputs and provides a “winner takes all” output. The system uses designed proteins that are programmed to form heterodimers upon binding a target molecule (see the Perspective by Galloway and Johnstone). The dimerization reconstitutes the activity of a viral protease, which allows for mutual inhibition between output nodes and a single “winner” output. The output could be linked to a functional change in the cell such as the induction of apoptosis. The results show that it is feasible to construct classification networks and design tunable decision control in living cells. —L. Bryan Ray Artificial neural networks provide a powerful paradigm for nonbiological information processing. To understand whether similar principles could enable computation within living cells, we combined de novo–designed protein heterodimers and engineered viral proteases to implement a synthetic protein circuit that performs winner-take-all neural network classification. This “perceptein” circuit combines weighted input summation through reversible binding interactions with self-activation and mutual inhibition through irreversible proteolytic cleavage. These interactions collectively generate a large repertoire of distinct protein species stemming from up to eight coexpressed starting protein species. The complete system achieves multi-output signal classification with tunable decision boundaries in mammalian cells and can be used to conditionally control cell death. These results demonstrate how engineered protein-based networks can enable programmable signal classification in living cells.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs are highly susceptible to heat stress, which causes coral bleaching and death. In the longer term, heat stress can lead to deterioration of coral reef structure, loss of coastal protection, and loss of globally important fisheries. Lachs et al . modeled the range of conditions that one especially sensitive coral taxon can tolerate if more heat-tolerant lineages have the time to be selected or are introduced by human interventions. Data were gathered for the key species of Acropora corals from remote Palau to estimate whether coral adaptation might be able to keep pace under a range of global climate change scenarios. The projections are not completely bleak, but whatever scenario ensues, the only way to maximize the chances of coral reefs surviving is to immediately reduce anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. —Caroline Ash Marine heatwaves are intensifying under climate change, exposing populations of reef-building corals to mass mortality and intense selective pressure. It remains unknown whether adaptation can keep pace with warming and maintain reef functioning. We have developed an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model for Acropora , an ecologically important yet thermally sensitive coral taxon. We found that, although corals have some adaptation capacity, they will suffer severe heatwave-induced declines over the coming decades. For a future in which emissions lead to ~3°C of global warming, natural selection could allow populations to persist, albeit in severely depleted states with elevated extinction risk and potential loss of ecosystem functioning. Yet, for thermally sensitive coral populations to thrive beyond 2050, there must be rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that limit global warming to 2°C.},

  abstract     = {After publication of the Research Article “How do social media feed algorithms affect attitudes and behavior in an election campaign?” (28 July 2023, p. 398), the authors identified an issue with the variables that measure exposure to and engagement with untrustworthy sources on Instagram. In some cases, participants may have seen data from accounts during the study period but those accounts had been deleted by the time the participant dataset was created in 2022. Because of a processing error, such data were retroactively excluded from the metrics. Participant platform data have now been permanently delinked from the user identifiers in this study, so this error cannot be fixed. The authors estimate that it should have a limited impact on the results reported in the paper, given that these deleted accounts only represent 6.8% of views received by all accounts identified as untrustworthy sources. The estimate of the proportion of participants’ Instagram feeds from untrustworthy sources in the control group (Fig. 2) is likely to be 0.014 rather than 0.013, as originally reported (Fig. 2 has not been revised). In addition, because this issue occurred independently from treatment assignment, the treatment effect estimates were likely unaffected. This issue affects other results reported in the supplementary materials: table S28, exposure to content from untrustworthy accounts as proportion of total views on Instagram, by connection type; table S44, engagement metrics with content from untrustworthy accounts on Instagram, by connection type; figures S16 and S17 and tables S68 and S69, treatment effect on proportion of feed from untrustworthy sources on Instagram; and figures S42 and S51, heterogeneous treatment effect results for proportion of feed from untrustworthy sources on Instagram. These tables and figures have not been revised. None of the results for Facebook were affected by this issue. The description of untrustworthy sources in section S7.2 in the supplementary materials, p. 129, has been updated to note this error.},

In this Review, we examine how wound healing might act to ignite disease. Wound healing works well when we are younger, repairing damage from accidents, environmental assaults, and battles with pathogens. Yet, with age and accumulation of mutations and tissue damage, the repair process can devolve, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and neoplastic signaling. We discuss healthy wound responses and how our bodies might misappropriate these pathways in disease.

  abstract     = {Thanks largely to Hollywood portrayals, many people view sharks as a dangerous threat or a tough, voracious predator. Sharks and other elasmobranchs in fact fill many different niches and play important ecological roles across ecosystems. Furthermore, although they are tough in many ways, they have mostly not been able to hold up to intense pressure from humans. Dulvy et al . looked across 50 years of data and found that total shark and ray abundance has declined by half since 1970, and these declines have led to a loss of key ecological functions across marine ecosystems. —Sacha Vignieri The true state of ocean biodiversity is difficult to assess, and there are few global indicators to track the primary threat of overfishing. We calculated a 50-year Red List Index of extinction risk and ecological function for 1199 sharks and rays and found that since 1970, overfishing has halved their populations and their Red List Index has worsened by 19%. Overfishing the largest species in nearshore and pelagic habitats risks loss of ecomorphotypes and a 5 to 22% erosion of functional diversity. Extinction risk is higher in countries with large human coastal populations but lower in nations with stronger governance, larger economies, and greater beneficial fisheries subsidies. Restricting fishing (including incidental catch) and trade to sustainable levels combined with prohibiting retention of highly threatened species can avert further depletion, widespread loss of population connectivity, and top-down predator control.},

To design cells potentially useful for local immune suppression, we engineered conventional CD4 + T cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors driving antigen-triggered production of anti-inflammatory payloads. Screening a diverse library of suppression programs, we observed the strongest suppression of cytotoxic T cell attack by the production of both anti-inflammatory factors (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor–β1, programmed death ligand 1) and sinks for proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-2 receptor subunit CD25). Engineered cells with bespoke regulatory programs protected tissues from immune attack without systemic suppression. Synthetic suppressor T cells protected transplanted beta cell organoids from cytotoxic T cells. They also protected specific tissues from unwanted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell cross-reaction.

  abstract     = {Hatching of young animals from eggs is often timed to occur under favorable conditions. However, the brain mechanisms underlying the integration of sensory inputs used to determine hatching time and the neuronal circuits involved in hatching remain elusive. Gajbhiye et al . studied hatching in teleosts, showing that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh) is the neuroendocrine factor responsible for triggering hatching (see the Perspective by Argenton and Gothilf). Trh released in the blood stream from the hypothalamus of fish embryos directly triggered the release of the proteases necessary for chorion dissolution from the hatching gland so that the larva can escape the egg. These results elucidate the neuronal mechanism controlling one of the most critical events in oviparous species. —Mattia Maroso Hatching is a critical event in the life history of oviparous species. The decision to hatch is often carefully timed to coincide with favorable conditions that will improve survival through early life stages. However, how the relevant cues are relayed to trigger hatching remains unknown. In this work, we show that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh) is the neuroendocrine activator of hatching in zebrafish. To elicit hatching, Trh neurons form a transient circuit that deposits the peptide into the embryo’s circulation. Trh also activates hatching in a distantly related fish species that separated more than 200 million years ago. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved neuroendocrine circuit that controls a major life event in oviparous fish species.},

  abstract     = {Designing structures capable of multiple deformations in response to a single stimulus requires some combination of hybrid material constructs, complex and precise geometric architectures, and multiple stimuli. Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) can undergo large shape changes when driven through their isotropic-nematic transition, the change is typically unidirectional. Yao et al . designed and synthesized LCEs using two monomers that individually only show nematic-to-isotropic transitions. However, when combined, they display two liquid crystal phase transitions: isotropic to smectic A and smectic A to smectic C, thus allowing for ambidirectional deformability driven only by changes in temperature. As a result, two shape changes can be observed at the two transitions. —Marc S. Lavine Ambidirectionality, which is the ability of structural elements to move beyond a reference state in two opposite directions, is common in nature. However, conventional soft materials are typically limited to a single, unidirectional deformation unless complex hybrid constructs are used. We exploited the combination of mesogen self-assembly, polymer chain elasticity, and polymerization-induced stress to design liquid crystalline elastomers that exhibit two mesophases: chevron smectic C (cSmC) and smectic A (SmA). Inducing the cSmC-SmA–isotropic phase transition led to an unusual inversion of the strain field in the microstructure, resulting in opposite deformation modes (e.g., consecutive shrinkage or expansion and right-handed or left-handed twisting and tilting in opposite directions) and high-frequency nonmonotonic oscillations. This ambidirectional movement is scalable and can be used to generate Gaussian transformations at the macroscale.},

  abstract     = {There are now several approaches for the de novo design of protein-binding proteins, but controlling specificity and achieving high affinities through computational design remains a major challenge. Glögl et al . used RFdiffusion, a RosettaFold-based design program that optimizes designs starting with random noise, to design binders for the tumor necrosis factor receptor, a challenging target protein. The authors achieved low picomolar affinity for a monomeric binder using a partial diffusion step after the initial design generation. They also established the exquisite specificity of designs produced with this method and showed that they could retarget designs to other receptor family members. These results demonstrate the capacity of current protein design tools to generate specific and high-affinity protein-binding proteins for use in biology and, potentially, as therapeutics. —Michael A. Funk Despite progress in designing protein-binding proteins, the shape matching of designs to targets is lower than in many native protein complexes, and design efforts have failed for the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and other protein targets with relatively flat and polar surfaces. We hypothesized that free diffusion from random noise could generate shape-matched binders for challenging targets and tested this approach on TNFR1. We obtain designs with low picomolar affinity whose specificity can be completely switched to other family members using partial diffusion. Designs function as antagonists or as superagonists when presented at higher valency for OX40 and 4-1BB. The ability to design high-affinity and high-specificity antagonists and agonists for pharmacologically important targets in silico presages a coming era in protein design in which binders are made by computation rather than immunization or random screening approaches.},

  abstract     = {Reagentless biosensing, which is typically based on affinity receptors such as antibodies or aptamers, has the intrinsic challenge of slow dissociation of protein analytes, especially for the high-affinity interactions needed to achieve high sensitivity. This challenge has impeded the ability to do continuous sensing. Zargartalebi et al . used high-frequency oscillation of positive voltage onto sensing electrodes to substantially accelerate the dissociation of protein analytes (see the Perspective by Wang). The main advantages include simple implementation and potentially universal applicability on different sensor designs. The authors implemented their electrodes onto a microneedle device and showed that they could track cytokine levels related to diabetes in a mouse model. —Marc S. Lavine Continuous measurement of proteins in vivo is important for real-time disease management and prevention. Implantable sensors for monitoring small molecules such as glucose have been available for more than a decade. However, analysis of proteins remains an unmet need because the lower physiological levels require that sensors have high affinities, which are linked to long complexation half-lives ( t 1/2 ~20 hours) and slow equilibration when concentrations decrease. We report active-reset sensors by use of high-frequency oscillations to accelerate dissociation, which enables regeneration of the unbound form of the sensor within 1 minute. When implemented within implanted devices, these sensors allow for real-time, in vivo monitoring of proteins within interstitial fluid. Active-reset protein sensors track biomarker levels on a physiological timescale for inflammation monitoring in living animals.},

The authors effectively assembled short arms of mouse chromosomes, hallmarked by large gaps caused by telomere and centromeric repeats being very close together. This more complete reference genome allows for the characterization of ribosomal DNA, as well as previously uncharacterized genes, and will provide an important resource to researchers working in mouse genetics. —Corinne Simonti The current reference genome of Mus musculus , GRCm39, has major gaps in both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions associated with repetitive sequences. In this work, we have sequenced and assembled the telomere-to-telomere genome of mouse haploid embryonic stem cells. The results reveal more than 7.7% of previously uncovered sequences of the mouse genome, including ribosomal DNA arrays and pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions, as well as an additional 140 genes predicted to be protein-coding.

  abstract     = {Wing coloration patterns have been widely studied across butterflies and moths, with the gene cortex often being implicated as a recurrent target of selection. However, molecular studies disrupting cortex have had inconsistent results. Tian et al . used CRISPR to identify mir-193 , a microRNA (miRNA) nearby to cortex , as likely being responsible for the effects of this locus on pigmentation. The miRNA derives from a long noncoding RNA named ivory and affects wing development in addition to pigmentation. Through careful molecular analyses, this study reveals the mechanism underlying this classic locus’s role in pigmentation. —Corinne Simonti In Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), the genomic region around the gene cortex is a “hotspot” locus, repeatedly implicated in generating intraspecific melanic wing color polymorphisms across 100 million years of evolution. However, the identity of the effector gene regulating melanic wing color within this locus remains unknown. We show that none of the four candidate protein-coding genes within this locus, including cortex , serve as major effectors. Instead, a microRNA (miRNA), mir-193 , serves as the major effector across three deeply diverged lineages of butterflies, and its role is conserved in Drosophila . In Lepidoptera, mir-193 is derived from a gigantic primary long noncoding RNA, ivory , and it functions by directly repressing multiple pigmentation genes. We show that a miRNA can drive repeated instances of adaptive evolution in animals.},

In 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b virus spread widely in dairy cattle in the US, causing a few mild human cases, but retaining specificity for avian receptors. Historically, this virus has caused up to 30% fatality in humans, so Lin et al . performed a genetic and structural analysis of the mutations necessary to fully switch host receptor recognition. A single glutamic acid to leucine mutation at residue 226 of the virus hemagglutinin was sufficient to enact the change from avian to human specificity. In nature, the occurrence of this single mutation could be an indicator of human pandemic risk. —Caroline Ash In 2024, several human infections with highly pathogenic clade 2.3.4.4b bovine influenza H5N1 viruses in the United States raised concerns about their capability for bovine-to-human or even human-to-human transmission. In this study, analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) from the first-reported human-infecting bovine H5N1 virus (A/Texas/37/2024, Texas) revealed avian-type receptor binding preference. Notably, a Gln 226 Leu substitution switched Texas HA binding specificity to human-type receptors, which was enhanced when combined with an Asn 224 Lys mutation. Crystal structures of the Texas HA with avian receptor analog LSTa and its Gln 226 Leu mutant with human receptor analog LSTc elucidated the structural basis for this preferential receptor recognition. These findings highlight the need for continuous surveillance of emerging mutations in avian and bovine clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses.},

  abstract     = {Because it is clear that human activities are altering the global climate, researchers have been studying potential effects and predicting declines and extinctions. Understanding the consequences globally requires the synthesis of many studies. Following up on an initial effort nearly 10 years ago, Urban found that we can expect, with increased certainty, that rising temperatures will lead to an increasing number of extinctions, with the highest emission scenario leading to extinction of nearly a third of the Earth’s species, especially those from particular vulnerable taxa or regions. —Sacha Vignieri Climate change is expected to cause irreversible changes to biodiversity, but predicting those risks remains uncertain. I synthesized 485 studies and more than 5 million projections to produce a quantitative global assessment of climate change extinctions. With increased certainty, this meta-analysis suggests that extinctions will accelerate rapidly if global temperatures exceed 1.5°C. The highest-emission scenario would threaten approximately one-third of species, globally. Amphibians; species from mountain, island, and freshwater ecosystems; and species inhabiting South America, Australia, and New Zealand face the greatest threats. In line with predictions, climate change has contributed to an increasing proportion of observed global extinctions since 1970. Besides limiting greenhouse gases, pinpointing which species to protect first will be critical for preserving biodiversity until anthropogenic climate change is halted and reversed.},

  abstract     = {The benign organisms constituting a microbiota have mechanisms for recognizing an appropriate host. Although homing into niches is better understood for pathogens than for quotidian commensals, Gutiérrez-García et al . looked for signs of “symbiosis” islands in the microbiome of the fruit fly gut (see the Perspective by Smith and Guillemin). The authors used live imaging to track the specificity of niche localization of the commensal bacterium Lactiplantibacillus plantarum to the fly foregut during passage in vitro. They identified a linear plasmid with a gene cluster that they refer to as a colonization island that contained many open reading frames for serine-rich repeat protein adhesins and auxiliary genes. Colonization islands seem to be broadly conserved among gut Firmicute bacteria and indicate a common mechanism for niche recognition. —Caroline Ash Animals selectively acquire specific symbiotic gut bacteria from their environments that aid host fitness. To colonize, a symbiont must locate its niche and sustain growth within the gut. Adhesins are bacterial cell surface proteins that facilitate attachment to host tissues and are often virulence factors for opportunistic pathogens. However, the attachments are often transient and nonspecific, and additional mechanisms are required to sustain infection. In this work, we use live imaging of individual symbiotic bacterial cells colonizing the gut of living Drosophila melanogaster to show that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum specifically recognizes the fruit fly foregut as a distinct physical niche. L. plantarum establishes stably within its niche through host-specific adhesins encoded by genes carried on a colonization island. The adhesin binding domains are conserved throughout the Lactobacillales, and the island also encodes a secretion system widely conserved among commensal and pathogenic bacteria.},

The defects generate a number of different microstructures in single-crystal bismuth telluride responsible for the improved properties. The strategy should be more broadly useful in other brittle semiconductors. —Brent Grocholski The recently discovered metal-like room-temperature plasticity in inorganic semiconductors reshapes our knowledge of the physical properties of materials, giving birth to a series of new-concept functional materials. However, current room-temperature plastic inorganic semiconductors are still very rare, and their performance is inferior to that of classic brittle semiconductors. Taking classic bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )–based thermoelectric semiconductors as an example, we show that antisite defects can lead to high-density, diverse microstructures that substantially affect mechanical properties and thus successfully transform these bulk semiconductors from brittle to plastic, leading to a high figure of merit of up to 1.05 at 300 kelvin compared with other plastic semiconductors, similar to the best brittle semiconductors.

Wearable and implantable sensors that directly measure protein concentrations in real time could advance both fundamental research and disease monitoring ( 1 ). Given the low amounts of proteins in bodily fluids, which often range between nanomolar and picomolar concentrations, biosensors with high sensitivity are desired ( 2 ). However, such sensors have struggled with the slow dissociation of a bound target. This has hindered continuous detection of proteins that have changing concentrations. On page 1146 of this issue, Zargartalebi et al. ( 3 ) report an “active-reset” mechanism that substantially reduces dissociation times through a high-frequency oscillating voltage. This strategy could be broadly applied to an array of biosensors with different sensing mechanisms, binding affinities, and targets.},

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh) produced in neurons of the hypothalamus in the fish brain travels to the hatching gland via the circulatory system, triggering the release of enzymes that dissolve the protective egg envelope that encapsulates the embryo.

  abstract     = {Plastic production is increasing, as are concerns about the effects of plastic pollution on human and environmental health. Policies to reduce these negative effects could cap new plastic production, require recycling, reduce single-use plastics, or invest in waste management or recycling infrastructure to reduce mismanagement. Pottinger et al . built a machine-learning model to project trends in plastic production, trade, and waste management to 2050 and simulated the effects of eight plausible policy interventions. In the business-as-usual scenario, plastic use is expected to increase by 37% by 2050, with a decrease in the proportion of plastic that is recycled and a doubling of mismanaged plastic (neither recycled nor landfilled nor incinerated). Combining policy interventions could reduce mismanaged plastic by 91%. —Bianca Lopez Plastic production and plastic pollution have a negative effect on our environment, environmental justice, and climate change. Using detailed global and regional plastics datasets coupled with socioeconomic data, we employ machine learning to predict that, without intervention, annual mismanaged plastic waste will nearly double to 121 million metric tonnes (Mt) [100 to 139 Mt 95% confidence interval] by 2050. Annual greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic system are projected to grow by 37% to 3.35 billion tonnes CO 2 equivalent (3.09 to 3.54) over the same period. The United Nations plastic pollution treaty presents an opportunity to reshape these outcomes. We simulate eight candidate treaty policies and find that just four could together reduce mismanaged plastic waste by 91% (86 to 98%) and gross plastic–related greenhouse gas emissions by one-third.},

This method was able to quantify charge transfer and nuclear quantum effects in liquid water, which could not be directly accessed using conventional vibrational spectroscopic methods. The presented technique can provide direct and easy access to molecular coupling for each vibrational mode and, in principle, could be used to elucidate many interesting molecular-level details of liquid-phase systems. —Yury Suleymanov The molecular structure of water is dynamic, with intermolecular hydrogen (H) bond interactions being modified by both electronic charge transfer and nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Electronic charge transfer and NQEs potentially change under acidic or basic conditions, but such details have not been measured. In this work, we developed correlated vibrational spectroscopy, a symmetry-based method that separates interacting from noninteracting molecules in self- and cross-correlation spectra, giving access to previously inaccessible information. We found that hydroxide (OH − ) donated ~8% more negative charge to the H bond network of water, and hydronium (H 3 O + ) accepted ~4% less negative charge from the H bond network of water. Deuterium oxide (D 2 O) had ~9% more H bonds compared with water (H 2 O), and acidic solutions displayed more dominant NQEs than basic ones.},

In bacteria, transcription and translation occur simultaneously, and this enables RNA polymerase and the ribosome to cooperate with each other. Using cryo–electron microscopy, Webster et al . visualized the early encounter between a transcribing RNA polymerase and a ribosome, which initiates translation on the nascent mRNA. Supported by single-molecule experiments and in-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry, this study shows how the different elements of the two machineries cooperate to recruit a ribosome to a nascent mRNA. —Di Jiang Protein synthesis begins with the formation of a ribosome-messenger RNA (mRNA) complex. In bacteria, the small ribosomal subunit (30 S ) is recruited to many mRNAs through base pairing with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and RNA binding by ribosomal protein bS1. Translation can initiate on nascent mRNAs, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) can promote the recruitment of the pioneering 30 S . Here, we examined 30 S recruitment to nascent mRNAs using cryo–electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence colocalization, and in-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry. We show that bS1 delivers the mRNA to the ribosome for SD duplex formation and 30 S activation. Additionally, bS1 and RNAP stimulate translation initiation. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for how the SD duplex, ribosomal proteins, and RNAP cooperate in 30 S recruitment to mRNAs and establish transcription-translation coupling.},

  abstract     = {The genomes of the malaria parasite are highly variable, making predictions for evolving drug resistance challenging. Moreover, technical and logistic complexity means that field surveillance for drug resistance is difficult. Luth et al . closely examined the genomes of Plasmodium falciparum clones known to be resistant to a range of antimalarial compounds and identified higher-probability variants in a set of 128 genes. In addition to known targets, new resistance genes and alleles were identified, as well as the characteristics of the genome and encoded proteins that are associated with multidrug resistance. The variants were more likely to be missense or frameshift mutations involving bulky amino acid changes and to occur in conserved protein domains. The prevalence of such molecular markers might offer early warning signals for drug development studies and for adapting regional malaria control policies. —Caroline Ash Surveillance of drug resistance and the discovery of novel targets—key objectives in the fight against malaria—rely on identifying resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium parasites. Current approaches, while successful, require laborious experimentation or large sample sizes. To elucidate shared determinants of antimalarial resistance that can empower in silico inference, we examined the genomes of 724 Plasmodium falciparum clones, each selected in vitro for resistance to one of 118 compounds. We identified 1448 variants in 128 recurrently mutated genes, including drivers of antimalarial multidrug resistance. In contrast to naturally occurring variants, those selected in vitro are more likely to be missense or frameshift, involve bulky substitutions, and occur in conserved, ordered protein domains. Collectively, our dataset reveals mutation features that predict drug resistance in eukaryotic pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Demyelination, a process observed in aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders, has shown sex biases in both incidence and severity. Lopez-Lee et al . studied the mechanisms underpinning these sex-based differences in mice using single-nuclei transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and functional analyses. The X-linked gene Tlr7 determined sex differences in demyelination, and its depletion or inhibition reduced sex differences and protected against demyelination in a mouse model of tau-mediated demyelination. These results contribute to elucidating the mechanisms mediating sex differences in neurological disorders. —Mattia Maroso Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other age-related disorders associated with demyelination exhibit sex differences. In this work, we used single-nuclei transcriptomics to dissect the contributions of sex chromosomes and gonads in demyelination and AD. In a mouse model of demyelination, we identified the roles of sex chromosomes and gonads in modifying microglia and oligodendrocyte responses before and after myelin loss. In an AD-related mouse model expressing APOE4, XY sex chromosomes heightened interferon (IFN) response and tau-induced demyelination. The X-linked gene, Toll-like receptor 7 ( Tlr7 ), regulated sex-specific IFN response to myelin. Deletion of Tlr7 dampened sex differences while protecting against demyelination. Administering TLR7 inhibitor mitigated tau-induced motor impairment and demyelination in male mice, indicating that Tlr7 plays a role in the male-biased type I Interferon IFN response in aging- and AD-related demyelination.},

  abstract     = {Stem cells in the gut constantly adapt to their environment influenced by chemical signals and physical forces. Baghdadi et al . focused on PIEZO-mechanosensitive ion channels that help stem cells detect and respond to physical changes. Genetic in vivo models and mini-guts grown in vitro on bioengineered substrates revealed that PIEZO channels are crucial for stem cell function and survival. Intestinal stem cells tend to reside at the bottom of intestinal crypts that have a relatively stiff extracellular matrix. Intestinal stem cell PIEZO channels sense changes in stiffness and stretching, which controls stem cell behavior, thereby helping to maintain intestinal function. —Stella M. Hurtley Stem cells perceive and respond to biochemical and physical signals to maintain homeostasis. Yet, it remains unclear how stem cells sense mechanical signals from their niche in vivo. In this work, we investigated the roles of PIEZO mechanosensitive channels in the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche. We used mouse genetics and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to assess the requirement for PIEZO channels in ISC maintenance. In vivo measurement of basement membrane stiffness showed that ISCs reside in a more rigid microenvironment at the bottom of the crypt. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional organoid systems combined with bioengineered substrates and a stretching device revealed that PIEZO channels sense extracellular mechanical stimuli to modulate ISC function. This study delineates the mechanistic cascade of PIEZO activation that coordinates ISC fate decision and maintenance.},

The researchers used a quantum microscope to follow the dynamics of these particles as they underwent quantum walks, observing their characteristic quantum statistics. —Jelena Stajic Low-dimensional quantum systems can host anyons, particles with exchange statistics that are neither bosonic nor fermionic. However, the physics of anyons in one dimension remains largely unexplored. In this work, we realize Abelian anyons in one dimension with arbitrary exchange statistics using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, where we engineer the statistical phase through a density-dependent Peierls phase. We explore the dynamical behavior of two anyons undergoing quantum walks and observe the anyonic Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect as well as the formation of bound states without on-site interactions. Once interactions are introduced, we observe spatially asymmetric transport in contrast to the symmetric dynamics of bosons and fermions.

  abstract     = {Anyone who exercises regularly knows what it is like to feel intensely thirsty. This powerful drive for water is common within mammals and ensures that our physiological need for water is met. In animals that hibernate, however, drinking and thirst are suppressed for months. Junkins et al . looked at this phenomenon in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, a well-studied hibernating rodent, and found that their months-long suppression of thirst comes even in the face of physiological indicators of fluid deficit. This suppression is mediated by reduced activity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which experience reduced function in winter. —Sacha Vignieri Water deprivation is a life-threatening condition that engages a protective physiological response to couple osmolyte retention with potentiation of thirst. This response, typical for most mammals, safeguards against short-term water deprivation but fails in the long term. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) use the short-term response during summer, whereas during winter, they lack thirst and survive without water for months. In this work, we show that long-term thirst suppression occurs despite hormonal and behavioral signs of a substantial fluid deficit and originates from hypoactivity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which exhibit marked functional suppression during winter that blunts their sensitivity to thirst cues. Our work reveals a notable capacity of the evolutionarily conserved brain regions that control fluid homeostasis in mammals to enable long-term survival without water.},

The authors demonstrated the utility of these membranes by separating the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons in naphtha. —Marc S. Lavine Aromatic - aliphatic hydrocarbon separation is a challenging but important industrial process. Pervaporation membrane technology has the potential for separating these mixtures. We developed an oriented monolayer polyhedral (OMP) membrane that consists of a monolayer of ordered polyhedral particles and is anchored by hyperbranched polymers. It contains a high density of straight, selective nanochannels, enabling the preferential transport of aromatic molecules. Compared with traditional mixed-matrix membranes with random orientations, the OMP membrane improves the pervaporation separation index for aromatic-aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures with C 6 and C 7 compounds, surpassing the performance of existing membranes by 3 to 10 times. This high performance demonstrates the potential of OMP membranes for hydrocarbon molecular separation and their application in the value-added separation of naphtha feedstocks.},

However, current iontronic devices primarily use solid-state technology, relying on micro- or nanofluidic systems with electrolytes confined within solid channels. The miniaturization of these systems is challenging, and their biocompatibility is insufficient. Zhang et al . reported a set of freestanding, microscale, soft iontronic modules called “dropletronics,” which are made by the self-assembly of surfactant-supported, nanoliter, silk hydrogel droplets (see the Perspective by Baret). The proposed platform has several distinctive properties that may open new possibilities for miniature iontronic systems. —Yury Suleymanov Hydrogel iontronic devices can emulate biological functions and communicate with living matter. But the fabrication of miniature, soft iontronic devices according to modular designs has not been achieved. In this work, we report the use of surfactant-supported assembly of freestanding microscale hydrogel droplets to construct various iontronic modules, circuits, and biointerfaces. Chemical modifications of silk fibroin produced a pair of oppositely charged hydrogels. Microscale assembly of various combinations of hydrogel droplets produced iontronic diodes, npn- and pnp-type transistors, and diverse reconfigurable logic gates. Through the incorporation of poly(amino acid)s, we have demonstrated a droplet-based synthetic synapse with ionic polymer–mediated long-term plasticity. Further, our iontronic transistor can serve as a biocompatible sensor to record electrophysiological signals from sheets of human cardiomyocytes, paving a way to the building of miniature bioiontronic systems.},

Marine life may not be able to survive in ODZs, so how these zones may be affected by the warmer temperatures that climate change will cause is a question of vital importance. Duprey et al . present a record of nitrogen isotopes in coral skeletons from the Eastern Tropical North Pacific showing that oxygen levels there vary in phase with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). These results indicate that the future of the Pacific ODZ, the world’s largest, will depend on how global warming influences the amplitude of the decadal changes of the PDO. —Jesse Smith The impact of global warming on the ocean’s oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) is uncertain, partly because of a lack of data on past changes. We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton–bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-δ 15 N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability. ODZ evolution over the next century will depend on how global warming interacts with the decadal oscillations.},

BCL11A plays a major role in the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch in red blood cells, and gene therapies targeting BCL11A have shown promise for treating inherited hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. However, the complexity of gene therapy approaches may preclude accessibility to those individuals in low-and middle-income countries. Zheng et al . explored the structural and biochemical features of BCL11A regulation and discovered that BCL11A functions as a tetramer, a feature that is required for the production of steady-state protein. Moreover, the tetramer appears to operate independently in its function as a repressor of the fetal globin promoter. These insights may assist in the design of future drugs to treat hemoglobin disorders. —Priscilla N. Kelly Down-regulation of BCL11A protein reverses the fetal (HbF, α 2 γ 2 ) to adult (HbA, α 2 β 2 ) hemoglobin switch and is exploited in gene-based therapy for hemoglobin disorders. Because of reliance on ex vivo cell manipulation and marrow transplant, such therapies cannot lessen disease burden. To develop new small-molecule approaches, we investigated the state of BCL11A protein in erythroid cells. We report that tetramer formation mediated by a single zinc finger (ZnF0) is required for production of steady-state protein. Beyond its role in protein stability, the tetramer state is necessary for γ-globin gene repression, because an engineered monomer fails to engage a critical co-repressor complex. These aspects of BCL11A protein production identify tetramer formation as a vulnerability for HbF silencing and provide opportunities for drug discovery.},

Analyses showed that the footprints were made by individuals with different gaits and stances, and the authors hypothesize these to be Homo erectus and Paranthropus boilei . Although fossils of both species occur in the area, these footprints show that they coexisted and likely interacted. —Sacha Vignieri For much of the Pliocene and Pleistocene, multiple hominin species coexisted in the same regions of eastern and southern Africa. Due to the limitations of the skeletal fossil record, questions regarding their interspecific interactions remain unanswered. We report the discovery of footprints (~1.5 million years old) from Koobi Fora, Kenya, that provide the first evidence of two different patterns of Pleistocene hominin bipedalism appearing on the same footprint surface. New analyses show that this is observed repeatedly across multiple contemporaneous sites in the eastern Turkana Basin.

  abstract     = {In eukaryotic cells, nascent secretory and membrane proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the signal recognition particle (SRP). Wang and Hegde have shown that TMEM208 helps to dislodge these cargoes from the SRP upon arrival at the ER membrane. Nascent proteins that do not release from the SRP cannot engage the translocation machinery needed for their maturation. TMEM208 proved especially important for membrane proteins because they typically bind the SRP more tightly and quickly lose insertion competence. Discovery of this long-overlooked step in the SRP-targeting pathway helps to explain how the SRP releases its cargoes at the right time and place. —Stella M. Hurtley The eukaryotic signal recognition particle (SRP) cotranslationally recognizes the first hydrophobic segment of nascent secretory and membrane proteins and delivers them to a receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How substrates are released from SRP at the ER to subsequently access translocation factors is not well understood. We found that TMEM208 can engage the substrate binding domain of SRP to accelerate release of its bound cargo. Without TMEM208, slow cargo release resulted in excessive synthesis of downstream polypeptide before engaging translocation factors. Delayed access to translocation machinery caused progressive loss of insertion competence, particularly for multipass membrane proteins, resulting in their impaired biogenesis. Thus, TMEM208 facilitates prompt cargo handover from the targeting to translocation machinery to minimize biogenesis errors and maintain protein homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Misinformation remains a major threat to US democratic integrity, national security, and public health. However, social media platforms struggle to curtail the spread of the harmful but engaging content. Across platforms, McLoughlin et al . examined the role of emotions, specifically moral outrage (a mixture of disgust and anger), in the diffusion of misinformation. Compared with trustworthy news sources, posts from misinformation sources evoked more angry reactions and outrage than happy or sad sentiments. Users were motivated to reshare content that evoked outrage and shared it without reading it first to discern accuracy. Interventions that solely emphasize sharing accurately may fail to curb misinformation because users may share outrageous, inaccurate content to signal their moral positions or loyalty to political groups. —Ekeoma Uzogara We tested a hypothesis that misinformation exploits outrage to spread online, examining generalizability across multiple platforms, time periods, and classifications of misinformation. Outrage is highly engaging and need not be accurate to achieve its communicative goals, making it an attractive signal to embed in misinformation. In eight studies that used US data from Facebook (1,063,298 links) and Twitter (44,529 tweets, 24,007 users) and two behavioral experiments (1475 participants), we show that (i) misinformation sources evoke more outrage than do trustworthy sources; (ii) outrage facilitates the sharing of misinformation at least as strongly as sharing of trustworthy news; and (iii) users are more willing to share outrage-evoking misinformation without reading it first. Consequently, outrage-evoking misinformation may be difficult to mitigate with interventions that assume users want to share accurate information.},

By considering how neurons in the evolved brain efficiently perform operations to move information, adapt to stimuli, and reconfigure neural networks, the “computing power” of biological systems has inspired the pursuit of powerful computers. Unlike solid-state materials, however, soft matters that make up a living organism do not make use of electron transports to perform computational tasks but instead rely in part on ion transports to perform computing tasks. These systems are often very complex, and thus, reconstructing them in human-made technology is challenging. On page 1024 of this issue, Zhang et al . ( 1 ) report soft devices composed of charged, hydrogel droplets that perform basic logical functions. This is an important step toward building complex microprocessors at the interface with living systems.},

Remarkably preserved and dated to 3.2 million years ago (Ma), “Lucy” confirmed that the ability to walk on two legs (bipedalism), not large brains or small teeth, was one of the first major hominin adaptations. In the ensuing 50 years, the number of accepted hominin species tripled, and several studies revealed different types of bipedalism in hominins. However, whether such distinct types of locomotion occurred simultaneously and in the same location remained unclear. On page 1004 of this issue, Hatala et al . ( 2 ) describe 1.5- Ma footprints from two hominin species at the site of Koobi Fora, Kenya, that indicate different types of bipedalism at the same time and place. The findings help to elucidate the complex evolutionary history of hominin locomotion and suggest that different hominins may have interacted across habitats.},

Creating materials with such adaptive response has been a far-reaching goal for fundamental and applied sciences ( 2 ). Metamaterials—artificial materials with structure-dependent properties—have been particularly successful toward this goal. However, modulating multiple functionalities in such materials has remained largely unexplored. On page 1031 of this issue, Smart et al.

  abstract     = {It is generally accepted that early-life nutrition affects later-life metabolic health, but it is difficult to tease apart the impacts of specific nutrient types, which rarely occur in isolation. Gracner et al . took advantage of a natural experiment resulting from the abrupt release of sugar rationing associated with World War II in the UK. Other food groups were also rationed and then released at different times, but sugar was the only one to rapidly increase in consumption after the end of rationing. Using UK Biobank data on people who were or were not exposed to sugar rationing in utero and early in life, the authors demonstrated a protective effect of this rationing against the later development of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich We examined the impact of exposure to sugar restrictions within 1000 days after conception on type 2 diabetes and hypertension, leveraging quasi-experimental variation from the end of the United Kingdom’s sugar rationing in September 1953. Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, and consumption nearly doubled immediately after rationing ended. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively. Protection was evident with in utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after 6 months, when eating of solid foods likely began. In utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one-third of the risk reduction.},

  abstract     = {The rate of mRNA degradation is a critical determinant of the amount of protein produced from each message. During translation, each codon is read by transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that deliver amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. Zhu et al . discovered that tRNAs also play an important role in regulating mRNA degradation during translation. Cryo–electron microscopy and tRNA mutagenesis revealed that specific tRNAs that decode arginine codons directly recruit the CCR4-NOT complex to translating ribosomes, thereby promoting mRNA turnover. Conversely, several tRNAs have structural features that prevent the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex. These findings expand the known functions of tRNAs beyond their canonical role in decoding and uncover a new mechanism that regulates mRNA stability in mammalian cells. —Di Jiang The CCR4-NOT complex is a major regulator of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. Slow decoding during translation promotes association of CCR4-NOT with ribosomes, accelerating mRNA degradation. We applied selective ribosome profiling to further investigate the determinants of CCR4-NOT recruitment to ribosomes in mammalian cells. This revealed that specific arginine codons in the P-site are strong signals for ribosomal recruitment of human CNOT3, a CCR4-NOT subunit. Cryo–electron microscopy and transfer RNA (tRNA) mutagenesis demonstrated that the D-arms of select arginine tRNAs interact with CNOT3 and promote its recruitment whereas other tRNA D-arms sterically clash with CNOT3. These effects link codon content to mRNA stability. Thus, in addition to their canonical decoding function, tRNAs directly engage regulatory complexes during translation, a mechanism we term P-site tRNA-mediated mRNA decay.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous catalysts, in which metal nanoparticles are dispersed on a support material, can undergo many changes after activation and subsequent reaction conditions. Tao and Salmeron reviewed fundamental studies of metal nanoparticles changing size, shape, and surface composition in response to different environmental conditions and how these nanoparticles interact with metal-oxide supports. These insights can help to predict how an as-synthesized catalyst will change its reactivity under reaction conditions.—Phil Szuromi Heterogeneous catalysts, which often consist of metal nanoparticles loaded on supports such as metal oxides, can undergo several types of restructuring under reaction and catalytic conditions. Advanced characterizations now allow the surface structure of a catalyst in a gas phase to be determined to some extent. Metal nanoparticles may experience changes in shape, surface structure and composition, and atomic packing in response to the pressure of a reactant or product gas, temperature, and reaction between the catalyst surface and gas. Metal oxide supports can partially or fully encapsulate metal nanoparticles, altering their electronic structure and reactivity. Restructuring is a main approach to creating active catalytic sites. The rational design of catalysts must anticipate that such restructurings can occur under reaction or catalytic conditions and gain knowledge of how they occur. It is expected that computational studies can predict such restructurings and that advanced synthesis may be used to prepare pristine catalysts with enhanced resistance to restructurings.},

  abstract     = {The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains numerous immunosuppressive cells, including regulatory T cells (T regs ). Within the TME, T regs skew toward a T helper 1 (T H 1)–type subset of cells known as T H 1-T regs . However, the mechanisms underlying T H 1-T reg generation in the TME are not well understood. Kuratani et al . report that tumor-associated macrophages secrete the chemokine Platelet Factor 4 (PF4), driving the polarization of T regs into T H 1-T regs (see the Perspective by Savage). Genetic deletion or monoclonal antibody–mediated neutralization of PF4 in tumor-bearing mice decreased T H 1-T regs in the TME, enhanced antitumor immunity, and suppressed tumor growth. This molecular pathway may open new avenues for cancer immunotherapy targeting tumor-associated macrophages and T regs within the TME. —Priscilla N. Kelly The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains a number of immune-suppressive cells such as T helper 1–polarized regulatory T cells (T H 1-T reg cells). However, little is known about the mechanism behind the abundant presence of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. We demonstrate that selective depletion of arginase I (Arg1)–expressing tumor-associated macrophages (Arg1 + TAMs) inhibits tumor growth and concurrently reduces the ratio of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. Arg1 + TAMs secrete the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4), which reinforces interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–induced T reg cell polarization into T H 1-T reg cells in a manner dependent on CXCR3 and the IFN-γ receptor. Both genetic PF4 inactivation and PF4 neutralization hinder T H 1-T reg cell accumulation in the TME and reduce tumor growth. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of Arg1 + TAM–produced PF4 for high T H 1-T reg cell levels in the TME to suppress antitumor immunity.},

Liu and Dernburg devised a chemically induced proximity approach based on a plant hormone–sensing pathway. They then used this method to demonstrate the role of polo-like kinase 2 in a mechanism that monitors the proper formation of synaptonemal complexes between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Signaling from the prolonged presence of this kinase changed the physical properties of the nuclear envelope, and a mechanosensitive piezo ion channel was required to induce apoptosis in response to synapsis defects. —L. Bryan Ray Sexual reproduction relies on robust quality control during meiosis. Assembly of the synaptonemal complex between homologous chromosomes (synapsis) regulates meiotic recombination and is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation in most eukaryotes. Synapsis defects can trigger cell cycle delays and, in some cases, apoptosis. We developed and deployed a chemically induced proximity system to identify key elements of this quality control pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans . Persistence of the polo-like kinase PLK-2 at pairing centers—specialized chromosome regions that interact with the nuclear envelope—induced apoptosis of oocytes in response to phosphorylation and destabilization of the nuclear lamina. Unexpectedly, the Piezo1/PEZO-1 channel localized to the nuclear envelope and was required to transduce this signal to promote apoptosis in maturing oocytes.},

  abstract     = {Hidden state inference is the ability to form an understanding of the underlying environmental mechanisms that produce observable outcomes, but the neural basis of this process remains unclear. Mishchanchuk et al . discovered that the activity of neurons in the mouse ventral CA1 area of the hippocampus plays a critical role in hidden state inference. Animals without a functioning hippocampus were unable to use a hidden state inference strategy to solve decision-making problems and instead reverted to outcome-focused strategies. How hippocampal neurons represent the abstract variables required for hidden state inference is highly similar to the way that they represent spatial location. This work indicates that there is a generalized mechanism in the hippocampal circuit for the representation of both spatial and more abstract nonspatial problems. —Peter Stern The ability to use subjective, latent contextual representations to influence decision-making is crucial for everyday life. The hippocampus is hypothesized to bind together otherwise abstract combinations of stimuli to represent such latent contexts, to support the process of hidden state inference. Yet evidence for a role of the hippocampus in hidden state inference remains limited. We found that the ventral hippocampus is required for mice to perform hidden state inference during a two-armed bandit task. Hippocampal neurons differentiate the two abstract contexts required for this strategy in a manner similar to the differentiation of spatial locations, and their activity is essential for appropriate dopamine dynamics. These findings offer insight into how latent contextual information is used to optimize decisions, and they emphasize a key role for the hippocampus in hidden state inference.},

Understanding how this behavior developed can provide insight into how our own, now extinct, ancestors may have similarly developed culture over time, leading to our highly cultural species. Gunasekaram et al . looked at decades of data on genetic connectivity and cultural similarity among chimp populations. They found that migration among different populations allowed for the development, and then the divergence, of complex tools over time (see the Perspective by Richerson and Boyd). Simple tools or foraging strategies showed no such relationship, suggesting that they emerged separately in each population. —Sacha Vignieri Although cumulative culture is a hallmark of hominin evolution, its origins can be traced back to our common ancestor with chimpanzees. Here, we investigated the evolutionary origins of chimpanzee cumulative culture and why it remained incipient. To trace cultural transmission among the four chimpanzee subspecies, we compared population networks based on genetic markers of recent migration and shared cultural traits. We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo , resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification.},

  abstract     = {Spatial transcriptomics is a powerful method that measures the localization of mRNA molecules. When applying this approach in tissues, analysis is typically limited to thin sections rather than full volumes. Kanatani et al . developed a brain tissue–clearing method called TRISCO that enables three-dimensional in situ hybridization on the whole brain, allowing the visualization of specific mRNAs in the complete brain at cellular resolution. Using TRISCO, the authors monitored the expression of immediate early genes after administration of the antiobesity drug semaglutide in mice, finding increased expression in brain regions associated with obesity. TRISCO thus enables the study of intricate gene expression patterns spanning the whole brain at single-cell resolution. —Mattia Maroso Recent advances in RNA analysis have deepened our understanding of cellular states in biological tissues. However, a substantial gap remains in integrating RNA expression data with spatial context across organs, primarily owing to the challenges associated with RNA detection within intact tissue volumes. Here, we developed Tris buffer–mediated retention of in situ hybridization chain reaction signal in cleared organs (TRISCO), an effective tissue-clearing method designed for whole-brain spatial three-dimensional (3D) RNA imaging. TRISCO resolved several crucial issues, including the preservation of RNA integrity, achieving uniform RNA labeling, and enhancing tissue transparency. We tested TRISCO using a broad range of cell-identity markers, noncoding and activity-dependent RNAs, within diverse organs of varying sizes and species. TRISCO thus emerges as a powerful tool for single-cell, whole-brain, 3D imaging that enables comprehensive transcriptional spatial analysis across the entire brain.},

By simultaneously recording single-unit neuronal activity in several areas of the monkey brain, Kharas et al . found that sleep improved performance in a perceptual task and was followed by an increase in firing rates and a decrease in synchronization of activity. The positive effects of sleep could be replicated by low-frequency intracortical electrical stimulation. Computational modeling suggested that the experimental observations can be accounted for by an asymmetric decrease in synaptic conductances that is more prominent in inhibitory synapses. —Peter Stern Sleep improves cognitive performance, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms of this improvement. We performed multielectrode recording in macaque visual and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while animals performed a visual discrimination task before and after non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Although sleep induces synchronized fluctuations in population activity across cortical areas, the post-sleep population activity became more desynchronized relative to the pre-sleep state. The changes after sleep were correlated with an increase in information encoded in population activity in each area and improved behavioral performance. Electrically stimulating visual cortex at 4 hertz emulated the beneficial effects of sleep on network and perceptual performance.

  abstract     = {A strong, glassy supramolecular polymer has been shown to prevent the formation of marine microplastics by slowly dissolving in salt water into metabolizable compounds. Cheng et al . show that salt bridging between sodium hexametaphosphate or sulfated polysaccharides and guanidinium sulfates expels sodium sulfate to create a cross-linked network that is stable until the electrolytes are added back. The dried material is a moldable and recyclable thermoplastic that can be water stabilized with hydrophobic coatings. —Phil Szuromi Plastics that can metabolize in oceans are highly sought for a sustainable future. In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.},

  abstract     = {Most whaling ended more than 20 years ago, but human activities, including direct collisions between whales and ships, continue to negatively affect whale populations. Nisi et al . mapped whale movement for four globally distributed species based on 435,000 locations and then related this to global shipping activity. They found that active shipping occurs across the vast majority of whale ranges and movement pathways. Protections designed to prevent collisions are present in fewer than 10% of whale movement hotspots. The authors argue that expanding management is essential to protecting whales in an ocean increasingly full of ships. —Sacha Vignieri After the near-complete cessation of commercial whaling, ship collisions have emerged as a primary threat to large whales, but knowledge of collision risk is lacking across most of the world’s oceans. We compiled a dataset of 435,000 whale locations to generate global distribution models for four globally ranging species. We then combined &gt;35 billion positions from 176,000 ships to produce a global estimate of whale-ship collision risk. Shipping occurs across 92% of whale ranges, and &lt;7% of risk hotspots contain management strategies to reduce collisions. Full coverage of hotspots could be achieved by expanding management over only 2.6% of the ocean’s surface. These inferences support the continued recovery of large whales against the backdrop of a rapidly growing shipping industry.},

Analyzing a near-census of &gt;34 million bachelor’s degrees awarded in the US from 2002 to 2022, supplemented with two nationally representative datasets, we provide the first comprehensive study of the gender gap in PECS across higher-education institutions. Institutions serving students with higher math SAT scores have made greater strides in closing PECS gender gaps—both in initial recruitment and retention—whereas those serving students with lower math SAT scores are increasingly struggling. Our findings highlight institutions as strategic leverage points for targeted interventions, particularly to benefit women of color who remain underrepresented even where gender balance is improving.},

This group of chemical compounds has weaker disinfection capability than chlorine ( 1 ) but produces lower concentrations of harmful halogenated disinfection by-products ( 2 ). However, chloramines, unlike chlorine, spontaneously decompose over timescales relevant to water distribution systems. For decades, one of the chloramine decomposition products remained uncharacterized ( 3 ), referred to simply as an “unidentified product” that had eluded the best efforts of chemists until now.

However, defining how immune cells and tumor cells interact and identifying nodes of communication that can be targeted remain challenging. On page 866 of this issue, Kuratani et al.

It is interesting to compare these systems with human culture to see whether they obey some general principles and to explain why they differ. On page 920 of this issue, Gunasekaram et al . report that chimpanzees—the closest living relative to humans—exhibit cumulative culture ( 2 ). By combining population genetics with observations of tool use, their study suggests an association between population interchanges and the emergence and sharing of complex tool sets among chimpanzees.

  abstract     = {Amylase is a critical enzyme for breaking down starch into sugar. Expansions of amylase genes have been seen across human populations, often correlated with starch intake and the rise of agriculture. However, the exact timing of these expansions has been difficult to determine due to the highly repetitive nature of the genomic region. Yilmaz et al . used optical genome mapping to catalog the haplotypes found in modern human populations and archaic hominins. They found that expansions in salivary amylase copy number occurred before the rise of agriculture, allowing selection to act on standing variation, and that different types of break repair likely contributed to structural variation across this locus. —Corinne Simonti Previous studies suggested that the copy number of the human salivary amylase gene, AMY1 , correlates with starch-rich diets. However, evolutionary analyses are hampered by the absence of accurate, sequence-resolved haplotype variation maps. We identified 30 structurally distinct haplotypes at nucleotide resolution among 98 present-day humans, revealing that the coding sequences of AMY1 copies are evolving under negative selection. Genomic analyses of these haplotypes in archaic hominins and ancient human genomes suggest that a common three-copy haplotype, dating as far back as 800,000 years ago, has seeded rapidly evolving rearrangements through recurrent nonallelic homologous recombination. Additionally, haplotypes with more than three AMY1 copies have significantly increased in frequency among European farmers over the past 4000 years, potentially as an adaptive response to increased starch digestion.},

Nguyen et al . present Evo, a multimodal artificial intelligence model that can interpret and generate genomic sequences at a vast scale. The Evo architecture leverages deep learning techniques, enabling it to process long sequences efficiently. By analyzing millions of microbial genomes, Evo has developed a comprehensive understanding of life’s complex genetic code, from individual DNA bases to entire genomes. This enables the model to predict how small DNA changes affect an organism’s fitness, generate realistic genome-length sequences, and design new biological systems, including laboratory validation of synthetic CRISPR systems and IS200/IS605 transposons. Evo represents a major advancement in our capacity to comprehend and engineer biology across multiple modalities and multiple scales of complexity (see the Perspective by Theodoris). —Di Jiang The genome is a sequence that encodes the DNA, RNA, and proteins that orchestrate an organism’s function. We present Evo, a long-context genomic foundation model with a frontier architecture trained on millions of prokaryotic and phage genomes, and report scaling laws on DNA to complement observations in language and vision. Evo generalizes across DNA, RNA, and proteins, enabling zero-shot function prediction competitive with domain-specific language models and the generation of functional CRISPR-Cas and transposon systems, representing the first examples of protein-RNA and protein-DNA codesign with a language model. Evo also learns how small mutations affect whole-organism fitness and generates megabase-scale sequences with plausible genomic architecture. These prediction and generation capabilities span molecular to genomic scales of complexity, advancing our understanding and control of biology.},

Activation of SPL13 expression led to orientated cell divisions and cell proliferation in the root apical meristem that showed distinct juvenile and adult phases. This mechanism of control of cell proliferation was observed in both Arabidopsis and rice, thus providing molecular insights into the age-dependent morphological changes in the root meristem during phase change. —Ankit Walia Oriented cell divisions are crucial for determining the overall morphology and size of plants, but what controls the onset and duration of this process remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a small molecule that activates root apical meristem (RAM) expression of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE13 (SPL13) a known player in the shoot’s juvenile-to-adult transition. This expression leads to oriented cell divisions in the RAM through SHORT ROOT (SHR) and cell cycle regulators. We further show that the RAM has distinct juvenile and adult phases typed by morphological and molecular characteristics and that SPL factors are crucially required for this transition in Arabidopsis and rice ( Oryza sativa ). In summary, we provide molecular insights into the age-dependent morphological changes occurring in the RAM during phase change.},

  abstract     = {A healthy human body is thought to make millions of red blood cells per second. To better understand how erythropoietic cells accomplish this feat, Lyu et al . characterized the transcriptional and metabolic profiles of erythroid precursor cells from mouse bone marrow. The cells showed enhanced production of the enzyme glutamine synthetase. Biochemical synthesis of heme to make hemoglobin causes the accumulation of ammonium, which causes oxidative stress. The authors propose that enhanced glutamine synthetase activity helps to consume the excess ammonium and prevents cell damage. Loss of glutamine synthetase in mice caused metabolic changes similar to those in erythrocytes from mice with beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder that causes anemia. Defective erythropoiesis in beta-thalassemia was ameliorated by antioxidants or expression of glutamine synthetase. —L. Bryan Ray Metabolic requirements vary during development, and our understanding of how metabolic activity influences cell specialization is incomplete. Here, we describe a switch from glutamine catabolism to synthesis required for erythroid cell maturation. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the oldest functioning genes in evolution, is activated during erythroid maturation to detoxify ammonium generated from heme biosynthesis, which is up-regulated to support hemoglobin production. Loss of GS in mouse erythroid precursors caused ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress, impairing erythroid maturation and recovery from anemia. In β-thalassemia, GS activity is inhibited by protein oxidation, leading to glutamate and ammonium accumulation, whereas enhancing GS activity alleviates the metabolic and pathological defects. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved metabolic adaptation that could potentially be leveraged to treat common red blood cell disorders.},

Rohde et al . found that zinc hydride sites in a metal-organic framework enabled the rapid capture of CO 2 from high-temperature power generation and industrial processes (see the Perspective by Li and Zhao). Adsorption of CO 2 to form zinc formate occurs reversibly through insertion into terminal zinc hydride sites. This process is slow at ambient temperatures but efficient at temperatures between 200°C and 400°C.—Phil Szuromi Carbon capture can mitigate point-source carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, but hurdles remain that impede the widespread adoption of amine-based technologies. Capturing CO 2 at temperatures closer to those of many industrial exhaust streams (&gt;200°C) is of interest, although metal oxide absorbents that operate at these temperatures typically exhibit sluggish CO 2 absorption kinetics and instability to cycling. Here, we report a porous metal–organic framework featuring terminal zinc hydride sites that reversibly bind CO 2 at temperatures above 200°C—conditions that are unprecedented for intrinsically porous materials. Gas adsorption, structural, spectroscopic, and computational analyses elucidate the rapid, reversible nature of this transformation. Extended cycling and breakthrough analyses reveal that the material is capable of deep carbon capture at low CO 2 concentrations and high temperatures relevant to postcombustion capture.},

When optogenetically reactivated, these neurons reproduced the anxiolytic effect of DOI without causing symptoms associated with hallucinogenic-like events in mice. These results suggest that the therapeutic and hallucinogenic effects of psychedelics can be dissociated, paving the way for the development of more specific drugs. —Mattia Maroso Psychedelics hold promise as alternate treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the neural mechanisms by which they drive adaptive behavioral effects remain unclear. We isolated the specific neurons modulated by a psychedelic to determine their role in driving behavior. Using a light- and calcium-dependent activity integrator, we genetically tagged psychedelic-responsive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that the psychedelic drove network-level activation of multiple cell types beyond just those expressing 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors. We labeled psychedelic-responsive mPFC neurons with an excitatory channelrhodopsin to enable their targeted manipulation. We found that reactivation of these cells recapitulated the anxiolytic effects of the psychedelic without driving its hallucinogenic-like effects.

Planting areas of forest (“tree islands ”) can provide seeds and microclimates favorable to the natural regeneration of native trees. Paterno et al . planted tree islands of different sizes and levels of diversity to determine how these management factors affected natural regeneration success. Larger and more diverse plantings led to greater recruited tree diversity in terms of, not just species, but also functional traits and lineages. These local factors played a greater role than the distance to forest patches or density of native trees in the landscape. —Bianca Lopez In monoculture-dominated landscapes, recovering biodiversity is a priority, but effective restoration strategies have yet to be identified. In this study, we experimentally tested passive and active restoration strategies to recover taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of woody plants within 52 tree islands established in an oil palm landscape. Large tree islands and higher initial planted diversity catalyzed diversity recovery, particularly functional diversity at the landscape level. At the local scale, results demonstrated that greater initial planting diversity begets greater diversity of native recruits, overcoming limitations of natural recruitment in highly modified landscapes. Establishing large and diverse tree islands is crucial for safeguarding rare, endemic, and forest-associated species in oil palm landscapes.},

This process produces subambient temperatures, but usually requires the material to be sky-facing. Xie et al . now demonstrate a vertical passive radiative cooling material that is capable of pushing the temperature to 2.5°C below the ambient temperature. The material design requires hewing to a tight set of parameters to eject enough infrared radiation into space while avoiding exchanging thermal energy with the ground that would counteract the passive cooling effect. —Brent Grocholski Subambient daytime radiative cooling enables temperatures to passively reach below ambient temperature, even under direct sunlight, by emitting thermal radiation toward outer space. This technology holds promise for numerous exciting applications. However, previous demonstrations of subambient daytime radiative cooling require surfaces that directly face the sky, and these cannot be applied to vertical surfaces that are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios such as buildings and vehicles. Here, we demonstrate subambient daytime radiative cooling of vertical surfaces under peak sunlight using a hierarchically designed, angularly asymmetric, spectrally selective thermal emitter. Under peak sunlight of about 920 watts per square meter, our emitter reaches a temperature that is about 2.5°C below ambient temperature, corresponding to a temperature reduction of about 4.3° and 8.9°C compared with a silica-polymer hybrid radiative cooler and commercial white paint, respectively.},

By coupling a bulk acoustic wave resonator to a superconducting qubit, the authors engineered a parameter regime in which a mechanical mode of the resonator inherits the nonlinear features of the superconducting qubit necessary for strong phonon-phonon interactions. They then demonstrated a full set of single-qubit operations on their mechanical qubit. The longer lifetime of mechanical quantum states should prove useful in establishing quantum acoustics as a platform for enhanced quantum technologies. —Ian S. Osborne Although strong nonlinear interactions between quantized excitations are an important resource for quantum technologies based on bosonic oscillator modes, most electromagnetic and mechanical nonlinearities are far too weak to allow for nonlinear effects to be observed at the single-quantum level. This limitation has been overcome in electromagnetic resonators by coupling them to other strongly nonlinear quantum systems such as atoms and superconducting qubits. We demonstrate the realization of the single-phonon nonlinear regime in a solid-state mechanical system. The single-phonon anharmonicity in our system exceeds the decoherence rate by a factor of 6.8, allowing us to use it as a mechanical qubit and demonstrate initialization, readout, and single-qubit gates.

Coupling the two then selectively delivers the unsymmetrical urea. —Jake S. Yeston Unsymmetrical ureas are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. However, devising strategies to introduce two distinct amines selectively in the construction of unsymmetrical ureas remains a challenge. In this work, we use a synchronous recognition strategy that takes advantage of radical and nucleophilic activation to discriminate between secondary and primary amines. Specifically, a copper catalyst preferentially oxidizes secondary amines to radical species, whereas a cobalt catalyst carbonylates primary amines to produce cobalt amides. Coupling these fragments by cooperative catalysis produces unsymmetrical ureas with high selectivity, as showcased by the modification of 41 biologically active compounds and six drugs.},

Enhancing protein degradation systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy mitigated the harmful effects of cryptic splicing. Modulating protein degradation pathways could thus provide a viable therapeutic strategy for spliceosome-associated diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa. —Stella M.

Impaired splicing has been associated with diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this work, we report that deficiency of ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) in human cell lines, zebrafish larvae, and mice led to impaired spliceosome assembly and a cytotoxic splicing profile characterized by the use of cryptic 5′ splice sites. Disruptive cryptic variants evaded messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathways and were translated into misfolded proteins, which caused proteotoxic aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and, ultimately, cell death. The detrimental consequence of splicing-induced proteotoxicity could be mitigated by up-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system and selective autophagy.

  abstract     = {Adeno-associated virus (AAV)–based gene therapies can be effective for treating human genetic disease, yet for those diseases caused by mutations in genes too large to be packaged into a single AAV particle, including certain muscular dystrophies, treatment remains a challenge. Lindley et al . developed a scarless RNA trans-ligation technology named StitchR, in which small catalytic RNA sequences called ribozymes can be used to reconstitute a single protein-coding mRNA from two independent AAVs. Using StitchR, the authors were able to restore large therapeutic muscle proteins, including dysferlin and dystrophin, to endogenous levels, thus correcting disease pathology in mice. —Di Jiang Ribozymes are small catalytic RNA sequences capable of nucleotide-specific self-cleavage found widespread in nature. Ribozyme cleavage generates distinct 2′,3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termini that resemble substrates for recently characterized RNA repair pathways in cells. We report that ribozyme cleavage of two separate mRNAs activated their scarless trans-ligation and translation into full-length protein in eukaryotic cells, a process that we named StitchR (for Stitch RNA). Optimization of StitchR activity in mammalian cells resulted in a ~900-fold increase in protein expression that approached levels observed for genes expressed from single vectors. We demonstrate that StitchR can be harnessed for effective dual adeno-associated virus gene therapies to correct muscular dystrophies by restoring large functional muscle proteins to endogenous levels in vivo.},

  abstract     = {The formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets has large effects on the radiative properties of those clouds and therefore on climate. Does anthropogenic air pollution have any impact on that process? Toll et al . have shown that it does. The authors present observations of enhanced cloud-ice formation near metallurgical and cement industries, coal-fired power plants, and oil refineries. The affected clouds back-scattered less solar radiation to space due to the combination of a reduction in cloud cover and an accompanying reduction in cloud optical thickness. This process also caused considerable induced snowfall. —Jesse Smith The ability of anthropogenic aerosols to freeze supercooled cloud droplets remains debated. In this work, we present observational evidence for the glaciation of supercooled liquid-water clouds at industrial aerosol hot spots at temperatures between −10° and −24°C. Compared with the nearby liquid-water clouds, shortwave reflectance was reduced by 14% and longwave radiance was increased by 4% in the glaciation-affected regions. There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness. Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles. However, rare glaciation events downwind of nuclear power plants indicate that factors other than aerosol emissions may also play a role in the observed glaciation events.},

Most discussions so far have focused on the largest category of plastics: packaging and single-use products (2). However, effective strategies must also address the second-largest global plastic category: building and construction materials, which accounted for 17% of plastic use in 2019 (3). Without intervention, demands for plastic building materials are projected to nearly double by 2050 to 150 million metric tonnes, a quantity that would surpass the 2019 level of plastic packaging production (4).

Mechanical systems such as resonators can provide long lifetimes compared with quantum systems that are used for qubits. Resonators change shape in response to perturbations and can be coupled with a variety of external signals to create devices such as sensors and transducers, but at the quantum level, their direct manipulation is challenging. On page 783 of this issue, Yang et al . ( 1 ) report a bulk acoustic resonator coupled with a superconducting qubit that can be directly manipulated.

Sorbents—porous materials that capture a specific liquid or gas—play a role in achieving this. However, the existing technology only adsorbs CO 2 at low temperatures and is not suitable for removing CO 2 from hot gas streams emitted by industrial plants. Given that industrial processes produce more than 50% of the total global CO 2 emissions ( 2 ), it is critical to develop sorbents that separate carbon at high temperatures. On page 814 of this issue, Rohde et al . ( 3 ) report a metal-organic framework (MOF)–based solid sorbent that reversibly captures CO 2 at low concentrations and at temperatures up to 300°C.

Advances in biology, engineering, and artificial intelligence have created new opportunities to improve our ability to assess safety, quality, and effectiveness of many consumer products. However, multiple steps are required to translate these new technologies into regulatory use and maintain the same standards of safety, quality, and effectiveness.

Wenzel et al . combined laboratory experiments and radioastronomy to search for 1-cyanopyrene, a four-ring PAH (pyrene) with an attached −CN group. The authors detected the 1-cyanopyrene molecule in an interstellar gas cloud and measured its abundance. From the results, they estimated how much of the related molecule pyrene was also present, as well as its contribution to the total carbon content of the interstellar medium. —Keith T. Smith Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules containing adjacent aromatic rings. Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detected 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1, using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ∼ 1 .52×10 12 cm −2 , from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.},

The detection of PFAS in groundwater is particularly concerning, especially for drinking water sources. Tokranov et al . compiled a large database of US groundwater observations as the basis for a model to estimate the probability of PFAS contamination based on well depth. The data come from a range of well types, including those for observation, domestic tap water, and public water supply. The model highlights that about 80 million people in the conterminous US rely on groundwater with detectable amounts of PFAS before treatment. —Brent Grocholski Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known colloquially as “forever chemicals,” have been associated with adverse human health effects and have contaminated drinking water supplies across the United States owing to their long-term and widespread use. People in the United States may unknowingly be drinking water that contains PFAS because of a lack of systematic analysis, particularly in domestic water supplies. We present an extreme gradient–boosting model for predicting the occurrence of PFAS in groundwater at the depths of drinking water supply for the conterminous United States. Our model results indicate that 71 million to 95 million people in the conterminous United States potentially rely on groundwater with detectable concentrations of PFAS for their drinking water supplies before any treatment.},

  abstract     = {Inorganic phosphate is an essential ion for all cells, and its transport and homeostasis are regulated in part by efflux from cells in response to an increase in polyphosphorylated inositol signaling molecules. Lu et al . determined the structures of the only known inorganic phosphate exporter in human cells, XPR1. These structures illustrate how binding of ligands controls conformational changes associated with gating. Two molecules can bind to the dimeric transporter at sites near the dimer interface and stabilize a putative phosphate translocation pathway. Electrophysiology experiments indicated rapid gating events, suggesting channel-like behavior for this transporter. —Michael A. Funk Precise regulation of intracellular phosphate (Pi) is critical for cellular function, with xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1) serving as the sole Pi exporter in humans. The mechanism of Pi efflux, activated by inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs), has remained unclear. This study presents cryo–electron microscopy structures of XPR1 in multiple conformations, revealing a transmembrane pathway for Pi export and a dual-binding activation pattern for PP-IPs. A canonical binding site is located at the dimeric interface of Syg1/Pho81/XPR1 (SPX) domains, and a second site, biased toward PP-IPs, is found between the transmembrane and SPX domains. By integrating structural studies with electrophysiological analyses, we characterized XPR1 as an inositol phosphates (IPs)/PP-IPs–activated phosphate channel. The interplay among its transmembrane domains, SPX domains, and IPs/PP-IPs orchestrates the conformational transition between its closed and open states.},

Chen et al . used phylodynamics analysis on a combination of molecular, epidemiological, and travel data to find out what happened to influenza during the pandemic (see the Perspective by Rohani and Bahl). Influenza-positive samples declined sharply, but influenza A persisted in South Asia and influenza B/Victoria emerged from West Asia, where tropical conditions and fewer pandemic-related restrictions applied. By March 2023, as air travel recovered, the circulation of influenza lineages resumed intensity, coinciding with waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron. Therefore, global influenza circulation is robust to prolonged disruption, an effect that might apply to other respiratory infections. —Caroline Ash The global dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses inform the design of surveillance, intervention, and vaccination strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic’s onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.},

Of the three major commissural projections, the anterior commissure is thought to have critical functions in the brain. However, the physiological significance of these cross-hemispheric structures, particularly the anterior commissure, is largely unknown. Using anatomical tract tracing, selective lesions, optogenetics, photometry, and calcium imaging combined with behavioral assays, Tian et al . investigated the contributions to behavior of the projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the contralateral nucleus accumbens (NAc). They found that in the mouse, contralateral BLA-NAc projections promoted avoidance behaviors triggered by aversive stimuli. Ipsilateral BLA-NAc projections, however, promoted appetitive behaviors triggered by reward stimuli. —Peter Stern The structurally symmetric mammalian brain hemispheres are interconnected by commissural axons across the midline. However, the functions of interhemispheric connectivity remain largely unknown. We found that in mice, transection of the anterior commissure (AC), which connects the rostroventral forebrain, impaired avoidant behaviors. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the mouse projects to the contralateral nucleus accumbens (NAc) through the AC, independent of its ipsilateral projections. Aversive stimuli activated contralateral BLA-NAc projections. Positive stimuli, however, activated ipsilateral projections. Selective activation of contralateral BLA-NAc projections activated D2-positive medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs), reduced NAc dopamine levels, and caused aversion, whereas selective activation of ipsilateral BLA-NAc projections activated D1-MSNs, increased NAc dopamine levels, and induced reward. The contralateral BLA-AC-NAc pathway is crucial for encoding negative valence, demonstrating distinct functions of intra- and interhemispheric circuits in brain physiology.},

Rix et al . developed a high-error-rate orthogonal replication (OrthoRep) system that compresses extensive gene divergence into laboratory time frames at scale. They used OrthoRep to evolve a maladapted enzyme into thousands of diverse homologs, uncovering both known and unexpected factors influencing the enzyme’s in vivo function and adaptation in the process. Their approach affords new opportunities to reveal protein design principles, accelerate biomolecular engineering, and prospectively study gene evolution. —Di Jiang When nature evolves a gene over eons at scale, it produces a diversity of homologous sequences with patterns of conservation and change that contain rich structural, functional, and historical information about the gene. However, natural gene diversity accumulates slowly and likely excludes large regions of functional sequence space, limiting the information that is encoded and extractable. We introduce upgraded orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) systems that radically accelerate the evolution of chosen genes under selection in yeast. When applied to a maladapted biosynthetic enzyme, we obtained collections of extensively diverged sequences with patterns that revealed structural and environmental constraints shaping the enzyme’s activity. Our upgraded OrthoRep systems should support the discovery of factors influencing gene evolution, uncover previously unknown regions of fitness landscapes, and find broad applications in biomolecular engineering.},

However, the mechanism triggering WDS remains to be fully elucidated. Using optogenetics and behavioral protocols, Zhang et al . showed in mice that WDS are triggered by Piezo2-mediated activation of unmyelinated C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors synaptically coupled with spinoparabrachial neurons. The identification of this pathway shines a light on a common shared behavior in hairy animals. —Mattia Maroso Many hairy mammals perform rapid oscillations of their body, called wet dog shakes, to remove water and irritants from their back hairy skin. The somatosensory mechanisms that underlie this behavior are unclear. We report that Piezo2-dependent mechanosensation mediates wet dog shakes evoked by water or oil droplets applied to back hairy skin of mice. Unmyelinated C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were activated by oil droplets, and their optogenetic activation elicited wet dog shakes. Ablation of C-LTMRs attenuated this behavior. Moreover, C-LTMRs synaptically couple to spinoparabrachial neurons, and optogenetically inhibiting spinoparabrachial neuron synapses and excitatory neurons in the parabrachial nucleus impaired both oil droplet– and C-LTMR–evoked wet dog shakes. Thus, a C-LTMR–spinoparabrachial pathway promotes wet dog shakes for removal of water and mechanical irritants from back hairy skin.},

  abstract     = {The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT), approximately 1.25 to 0.85 million years ago, was a period during which the glacial cycle changed from 41,000 years to 100,000 years in duration. It is widely believed that the cause of the MPT was a slowdown of deep ocean circulation punctuated by a collapse at about 0.90 million years ago. Hines et al . found no evidence of a dramatic change in deep ocean circulation over the MPT, only modest ocean circulation adjustments. Their data also illustrate how the deep ocean is able to sequester carbon dioxide without substantial changes in circulation geometry. —Jesse Smith The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) [~1.25 to 0.85 million years ago (Ma)] marks a shift in the character of glacial-interglacial climate ( 1 , 2 ). One prevailing hypothesis for the origin of the MPT is that glacial deep ocean circulation fundamentally changed, marked by a circulation “crisis” at ~0.90 Ma (marine isotope stages 24 to 22) ( 3 ). Using high-resolution paired neodymium, carbon, and oxygen isotope data from the South Atlantic Ocean (Cape Basin) across the MPT, we find no evidence of a substantial change in deep ocean circulation. Before and during the early MPT (~1.30 to 1.12 Ma), the glacial deep ocean variability closely resembled that of the most recent glacial cycle. The carbon storage facilitated by developing deep ocean stratification across the MPT required only modest circulation adjustments.},

  abstract     = {Species vary in their ability to defend against pathogens despite the clear implications of infection for fitness. Researchers hypothesize that this variation is driven by a trade-off between energy allocation to growth versus defense, but measuring the physiological costs of defense is challenging, and evidence for a growth-defense trade-off has been mixed. Giolai and Laine approached this problem using existing data on nearly 200 plant species. They looked at relationships between specific leaf area, a trait related to growth rates, and genes coding for immune receptors that provide broad pathogen resistance, finding evidence for a growth-defense trade-off in wild species but not agricultural plants. —Bianca Lopez Given the negative fitness effects that pathogens impose on their hosts, the benefits of resistance should be universal. However, there is marked variation across plant species in the number of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors, which form a cornerstone of defense. The growth–defense trade-off hypothesis predicts costs associated with defense investment to generate variation in these traits. Our analysis comparing features of the intracellular immune-receptor repertoires with trait data of 187 species shows that in wild plants, the size of the molecular defense repertoire correlates negatively with growth. By contrast, we do not find evidence for a growth–defense trade-off in agricultural plants. Our cross-species approach highlights the central role of defense investment in shaping ecological trait variation and its sensitivity to domestication.},

  abstract     = {Control of feeding and metabolism depends on regulatory mechanisms and circadian rhythms in multiple tissues. Woodie et al . explored how alterations in circadian function in mouse liver are coordinated with brain control of feeding behavior (see the Perspective by Martinez Sanchez and Ray). Disruption of circadian function in the liver altered signaling through the hepatic vagal afferent nerve and disrupted coordination of feeding and activity rhythms in the mice. Consumption of a high-fat diet caused a similar disruption of liver rhythms and feeding control in the mice, and preventing feedback from the liver by surgically severing the vagus nerve limited weight gain. Adjusting such communication and circadian coordination between the liver and brain could offer strategies to improve metabolic control and prevent obesity. —L. Bryan Ray Circadian desynchrony induced by shiftwork or jet lag is detrimental to metabolic health, but how synchronous or desynchronous signals are transmitted among tissues is unknown. We report that liver molecular clock dysfunction is signaled to the brain through the hepatic vagal afferent nerve (HVAN), leading to altered food intake patterns that are corrected by ablation of the HVAN. Hepatic branch vagotomy also prevents food intake disruptions induced by high-fat diet feeding and reduces body weight gain. Our findings reveal a homeostatic feedback signal that relies on communication between the liver and the brain to control circadian food intake patterns. This identifies the hepatic vagus nerve as a potential therapeutic target for obesity in the setting of chronodisruption.},

  abstract     = {Thousands of secreted and membrane proteins are modified on asparagine residues by sugars during their insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pervasive modification, called N-glycosylation, has a housekeeping function in protein folding and quality control. Ma et al . showed that N-glycosylation can also function as modulated degradative signal analogous to phosphorylation or ubiquitination. The authors identified a network of proteins in the ER that control the glycosylation and stability of HSP90B1, a chaperone that promotes the folding and cell surface trafficking of many signaling receptors. This ER pathway regulates cell and tissue sensitivity to developmental, growth, and inflammatory signals. —Stella M. Hurtley One-fifth of human proteins are N-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by two oligosaccharyltransferases, OST-A and OST-B. Contrary to the prevailing view of N-glycosylation as a housekeeping function, we identified an ER pathway that modulates the activity of OST-A. Genetic analyses linked OST-A to HSP90B1, an ER chaperone for membrane receptors, and CCDC134, an ER luminal protein. During its translocation into the ER, an N-terminal peptide in HSP90B1 templates the assembly of a translocon complex containing CCDC134 and OST-A that protects HSP90B1 during folding, preventing its hyperglycosylation and degradation. Disruption of this pathway impairs WNT and IGF1R signaling and causes the bone developmental disorder osteogenesis imperfecta. Thus, N-glycosylation can be regulated by specificity factors in the ER to control cell surface receptor signaling and tissue development.},

Simpler two-component MOFs can be described with edge-transitive nets. Jiang et al . mapped node-net relations among 53 of these basic nets, and the shared features allowed the researchers to identify 353 more complex merged nets with multiple nodes and linkers. They used this design approach to synthesize four classes of materials based on merging three-periodic nets. —Phil Szuromi Rational design of intricate multicomponent reticular structures is often hindered by the lack of suitable blueprint nets. We established the merged-net approach, proffering optimal balance between designability and complexity, as a systematic solution for the rational assembly of multicomponent structures. In this work, by methodically mapping node-net relationships among 53 basic edge-transitive nets, we conceived a signature net map to identify merging net pairs, resulting in the enumeration of 53 merged nets. We developed a practical design algorithm and proposed more than 100 multicomponent metal-organic framework platforms. The effectiveness of this approach is commended by the successful synthesis of four classes of materials, which is based on merging three-periodic nets with the four possible net periodicities. The construction of multicomponent materials based on derived nets of merged nets highlights the potential of the merged-net approach in accelerating the discovery of intricate reticular materials.},

  abstract     = {Surfactants can stabilize oil and water in an emulsion, and this property is useful in a range of industrial processes and in oil recovery from spills. However, this means that the surfactants then make it challenging to separate the oil and water when needed, especially if there is a desire to recover both components while trying to achieve near-zero waste discharge streams. Guo et al . stacked a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic membrane one in front of the other to form a square channel between them, with a size that can be varied between 4 and 125 millimeters. As an emulsion of oil and water is forced to circulate through the slit, water passes through the hydrophilic membrane, and the increased concentration of oil in the emulsion creates increases the rate of oil permeation through the hydrophobic membrane (see the Perspective by Yang and Jandaghian). —Marc S. Lavine Existing separation technologies struggle to recover oil and water concurrently from surfactant-stabilized emulsions to achieve the goal of near-zero liquid discharge. We present a Janus channel of membranes (JCM) that features a confined architecture constructed of a pair of hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, which allows for concurrent, highly efficient recovery of oil and water from surfactant-stabilized emulsions. The confined Janus channel can amplify the interplay of the membrane pair through a feedback loop that involves enrichment and demulsification. Our JCM achieves exceptional oil and water recoveries of up to 97 and 75%, respectively, with near 99.9% purities. Moreover, its versatility in handling diverse emulsions may enable near-zero liquid discharge for a range of separations.},

  abstract     = {Vascular cambium tissue contains a layer of bifacial stem cells that generate xylem and phloem tissue on the opposite sides. How developmental patterning and cell fate decisions position these bifacial stem cells has remained elusive. Eswaran et al . identified a family of transcription factors as stem cell factors of cambium in the model plant Arabidopsis . A sequestration-based model is proposed to demonstrate how strong binding of the peptide TDIF to the receptor PXY halts TDIF movement at the edge of the auxin-PXY gradient, thus allowing a narrow domain of transcription factor expression to define stem cells. Like animals, plants use opposing morphogen gradients through sequestration-based feedback to precisely control positioning and cell fate decisions. —Ankit Walia Wood constitutes the largest reservoir of terrestrial biomass. Composed of xylem, it arises from one side of the vascular cambium, a bifacial stem cell niche that also produces phloem on the opposing side. It is currently unknown which molecular factors endow cambium stem cell identity. Here we show that TRACHEARY ELEMENT DIFFERENTIATION INHIBITORY FACTOR (TDIF) ligand–activated PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY) receptors promote the expression of CAMBIUM-EXPRESSED AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE (CAIL) transcription factors to define cambium stem cell identity in the Arabidopsis root. By sequestrating the phloem-originated TDIF, xylem-expressed PXY confines the TDIF signaling front, resulting in the activation of CAIL expression and stem cell identity in only a narrow domain. Our findings show how signals emanating from cells on opposing sides ensure robust yet dynamically adjustable positioning of a bifacial stem cell layer.},

Bosse et al . now showcase some of these advances in an asymmetric synthesis of the natural product (−)-cylindrocyclophane A, specifically relying on rhodium and palladium catalysis to achieve 10 C−H functionalization reactions for the formation of C−C and C−O bonds. —Jake S. Yeston (−)-Cylindrocyclophane A is a 22-membered C 2 -symmetric [7.7]paracyclophane that bears bis-resorcinol functionality and six stereocenters. We report a synthetic strategy for (−)-cylindrocyclophane A that uses 10 C−H functionalization reactions, resulting in a streamlined route with high enantioselectivity and efficiency (17 steps). The use of chiral dirhodium tetracarboxylate catalysis enabled the C–H functionalization of primary and secondary positions, which was complemented by palladium-catalyzed C(sp 2 )–C(sp 2 ) cross-couplings, resulting in the rapid formation of the macrocyclic core and all stereocenters with high regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. The use of a late-stage palladium-catalyzed fourfold C(sp 2 )–H acetoxylation installed the bis-resorcinol moieties.

US guidelines for managing H5N1 infections differ widely between poultry and cattle. To ensure the reduction of spillover risk of a zoonotic virus with pandemic potential, jurisdictions with infected animals should adopt effective, ethical policies and apply them consistently to all farmed species.},

However, other cells, tissues, and organs in the body have their own circadian clocks. For example, the liver has a molecular clock that can be entrained by feeding-fasting cycles. Desynchrony between the lightentrained suprachiasmatic nucleus and the food-entrained liver carries adverse health consequences, including increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases or type 2 diabetes; yet, how these clocks become misaligned remains unknown.

However, traditional membrane technologies are often limited to filtering only one component from a mixture, leaving the remaining liquid highly concentrated with residues such as salts and organic matter ( 1 ). This not only makes further separation challenging by increasing the thermodynamic stability of the materials left behind in the solution but also creates potential disposal hazards. On page 654 of this issue, Guo et al . ( 2 ) report the ingenious design of a membrane system that can simultaneously separate oil and water in a single stream from a surfactant-stabilized mixture.

Looking at two situations of erythropoietic stress caused by an increased demand to produce red bloods, Phan et al . found that the transcripts of genetic elements known as retrotransposons increased in HSCs. Blocking reverse transcription or genetic deletion of the cellular machinery used to sense and respond to nucleic acids in HSCs decreased blood cell numbers in pregnant mice, but not in nonpregnant mice. This work suggests that retrotransposon transcripts use these innate immune molecules to promote hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis in situations of stress rather than homeostasis, and similar mechanisms might exist in humans. —Sarah H. Ross Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and erythropoiesis are activated during pregnancy and after bleeding by the derepression of retrotransposons, including endogenous retroviruses and long interspersed nuclear elements. Retrotransposon transcription activates the innate immune sensors cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate–adenosine 5′-monophosphate synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), which induce IFN and IFN-regulated genes in HSCs, increasing HSC division and erythropoiesis. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase or deficiency for cGAS or STING had little or no effect on hematopoiesis in nonpregnant mice but depleted HSCs and erythroid progenitors in pregnant mice, reducing red blood cell counts. Retrotransposons and IFN-regulated genes were also induced in mouse HSCs after serial bleeding and, in human HSCs, during pregnancy. Reverse transcriptase inhibitor use was associated with anemia in pregnant but not in nonpregnant people, suggesting conservation of these mechanisms from mice to humans.},

Using deep learning methods, we have detected and classified every domain in the AFDB, producing The Encyclopedia of Domains. We detected nearly 365 million domains, over 100 million more than can be found by sequence methods, covering more than 1 million taxa. Reassuringly, 77% of the nonredundant domains are similar to known superfamilies, greatly expanding representation of their domain space.

  abstract     = {One hundred years ago, Julius Bredt published an observation that certain molecules that constrained several adjacent carbon centers in a particular nonplanar arrangement could not form double bonds between them. These hypothetical double bonds became known as “anti-Bredt” olefins, and the doctrine that they were inaccessible remains widespread even with the occasional hint to the contrary. McDermott et al . now report a general strategy to prepare these olefins as fleeting intermediates that can be captured in cycloaddition reactions. The protocol relies on the driving force of silicon-fluorine bond formation from a precursor, which is akin to approaches used to access strained aromatics. —Jake S. Yeston The π-bonds in unsaturated organic molecules are typically associated with having well-defined geometries that are conserved across diverse structural contexts. Nonetheless, these geometries can be distorted, leading to heightened reactivity of the π-bond. Although π-bond–containing compounds with bent geometries are well utilized in synthetic chemistry, the corresponding leveraging of π-bond–containing compounds that display twisting or pyramidalization remains underdeveloped. We report a study of perhaps the most notorious class of geometrically distorted molecules that contain π-bonds: anti-Bredt olefins (ABOs). ABOs have been known since 1924, and conventional wisdom maintains that ABOs are difficult or impossible to access. We provide a solution to this long-standing problem. Our study also highlights the strategic manipulation of compounds that display considerable distortion arising from the presence of geometrically constrained π-bonds.},

Arbore et al . used gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and genome-wide association studies to identify the genetic underpinning of red and yellow coloration in the dusky lory. The authors identified a putative causal variant near an enzyme involved in fatty aldehyde oxidation and tested this gene in yeast to confirm its ability to produce a pigment change. The extensive biochemical and genetics work in this study aids in our understanding of coloration in a nonmodel organism, opening the door for future studies into parrot and other avian pigmentation. —Corinne Simonti Parrots produce stunning plumage colors through unique pigments called psittacofulvins. However, the mechanism underlying their ability to generate a spectrum of vibrant yellows, reds, and greens remains enigmatic. We uncover a unifying chemical basis for a wide range of parrot plumage colors, which result from the selective deposition of red aldehyde- and yellow carboxyl-containing psittacofulvin molecules in developing feathers. Through genetic mapping, biochemical assays, and single-cell genomics, we identified a critical player in this process, the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 , which oxidizes aldehyde psittacofulvins into carboxyl forms in late-differentiating keratinocytes during feather development. The simplicity of the underlying molecular mechanism, in which a single enzyme influences the balance of red and yellow pigments, offers an explanation for the exceptional evolutionary lability of parrot coloration.},

Wang et al . report that the Arabidopsis DECAPPING 5 (DCP5) protein functions as an osmosensor for extracellular hyperosmolarity. This function is achieved through molecular crowding–triggered phase separation in which the DCP5 protein undergoes a conformational change to drive phase separation. DCP5 reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules upon hyperosmolarity and sequesters mRNA and regulatory proteins. These findings describe a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism that could allow plants to rapidly adjust cellular homeostasis under osmotic stress. —Ankit Walia Plants are frequently challenged by osmotic stresses. How plant cells sense environmental osmolarity changes is not fully understood. We report that Arabidopsis Decapping 5 (DCP5) functions as a multifunctional cytoplasmic osmosensor that senses and responds to extracellular hyperosmolarity. DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation. Our findings uncover a cytoplasmic osmosensing mechanism mediated by DCP5 with plant-specific molecular crowding sensitivity and suggest a stress sensory function for hyperosmotically induced stress granules.},

  abstract     = {In addition to providing protection against invading pathogens, innate immune cells contribute to tissue homeostasis. Barron et al . found that group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were required for the formation of inhibitory synapses in the mouse brain (see the Perspective by Green and Foster). During a period of postnatal synapse formation, ILC2s that localized to the meninges produced the cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13). Mice lacking ILC2s or IL-13 signaling formed fewer inhibitory synapses in the cerebral cortex during postnatal development and exhibited decreased social behavior as adults. Therefore, the IL-13 produced by ILC2s could act on neurons directly and influence neurodevelopment. —Sarah H. Ross The innate immune system shapes brain development and is implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases. It is critical to define the relevant immune cells and signals and their impact on brain circuits. In this work, we found that group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and their cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaled directly to inhibitory interneurons to increase inhibitory synapse density in the developing mouse brain. ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses. Conversely, ILC2s and IL-13 were sufficient to increase inhibitory synapses. Loss of this signaling pathway led to selective impairments in social interaction. These data define a type 2 neuroimmune circuit in early life that shapes inhibitory synapse development and behavior.},

  abstract     = {The β-lactam class of antibiotics are the most prescribed drugs worldwide. These molecules kill bacteria by inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), a group of enzymes responsible for cross-linking bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has acquired resistance to β-lactams through the mecA gene encoding PBP2a, a non-native PBP with low affinity to β-lactams. Adedeji-Olulana et al . have been exploring the molecular pathways that enable potentiating mutations that profoundly increase antibiotic resistance (see the Perspective by Harrison). The authors used atomic force microscopy to determine how antibiotics change the nanoscale architecture of cell wall peptidoglycan at septal rings, which prevents cell replication. Further analysis revealed that resistant mutants display an alternative type of cell wall synthesis at the site of cell division and do not require septal rings. —Caroline Ash Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), in which acquisition of mecA [which encodes the cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis component penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a)] confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, is of major clinical concern. We show that, in the presence of antibiotics, MRSA adopts an alternative mode of cell division and shows an altered peptidoglycan architecture at the division septum. PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture. Successful division without PBP1 activity requires the alternative division mode and is enabled by several possible chromosomal potentiator ( pot ) mutations. MRSA resensitizing agents differentially interfere with the two codependent mechanisms required for high-level antibiotic resistance, which provides opportunities for new interventions.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires in many regions of the world, with devastating consequences. Mariani et al . suggest that another human activity, colonization, has contributed to increasing high-intensity fires in Australia. The authors used multiple paleoecological proxy datasets to compare vegetation structure between time periods reaching back to the last interglacial (over 100,000 years ago). Shrub cover, which fuels fires and spreads them into the forest canopy, was lower during the Middle to Late Holocene, when indigenous Australians were managing the landscape with burning, than it was during other time periods. Shrub cover has increased substantially since British colonization and the forced removal of indigenous burning practices that came with it. Restoring cultural burning may thus help to prevent megafires. —Bianca Lopez Wildfires in forests globally have become more frequent and intense because of changes in climate and human management. Shrub layer fuels allow fire to spread vertically to forest canopy, creating high-intensity fires. Our research provides a deep-time perspective on shrub fuel loads in fire-prone southeastern Australia. Comparing 2833 records for vegetation cover, past climate, biomass burning, and human population size across different phases of human occupation, we demonstrated that Indigenous population expansion and cultural fire use resulted in a 50% reduction in shrub cover, from approximately 30% from the early to mid-Holocene (12 to 6 thousand years ago) to 15% during the late to mid-Holocene (6 to 1 thousand years ago). Since the start of British colonization to the present, shrub cover has increased to the highest ever recorded (mean of 35% land cover), increasing the risk of high-intensity fires.},

The authors found that the bats could still navigate across kilometer scales using only echolocation. Thus, echolocation may not only allow for local navigation, but might also translate into an acoustic cognitive map of the environment that the animals can use to navigate over long distances. —Sacha Vignieri Bats are known for their ability to use echolocation for obstacle avoidance and orientation. However, the extent to which bats utilize their highly local and directional echolocation for kilometer-scale navigation is unknown. In this study, we translocated wild Kuhl’s pipistrelle bats and tracked their homing abilities while manipulating their visual, magnetic, and olfactory sensing and accurately tracked them using a new reverse GPS system. We show that bats can identify their location after translocation and conduct several-kilometer map-based navigation using solely echolocation. This proposition was further supported by a large-scale echolocation model disclosing how bats use environmental acoustic information to perform acoustic cognitive map–based navigation. We also demonstrate that navigation is improved when using both echolocation and vision.},

After individually lowering the expression of more than 300 genes encoding components of the intron-removing machinery, Rogalska et al . analyzed the effects on alternative RNA splicing and inferred functional similarities and mutual influences. The spliceosome’s intricate complexity provides multiple built-in regulatory mechanisms, and these results offer a resource with which to determine their operation in physiology and disease. —Di Jiang The spliceosome is the complex molecular machinery that sequentially assembles on eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors to remove introns (pre-mRNA splicing), a physiologically regulated process altered in numerous pathologies. We report transcriptome-wide analyses upon systematic knock down of 305 spliceosome components and regulators in human cancer cells and the reconstruction of functional splicing factor networks that govern different classes of alternative splicing decisions. The results disentangle intricate circuits of splicing factor cross-regulation, reveal that the precise architecture of late-assembling U4/U6.U5 tri–small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes regulates splice site pairing, and discover an unprecedented division of labor among protein components of U1 snRNP for regulating exon definition and alternative 5′ splice site selection.

Precise trafficking of molecules between cells is critical for cellular growth and development. However, how these cell wall channels are formed is poorly understood. Studying the small mustard plant Arabidopsis , Li et al . found that plasmodesmata bridges are formed through endoplasmic reticulum–driven incomplete cytokinesis. A combination of genetics, high-resolution microscopy, and modeling identified how uninterrupted endoplasmic reticulum connections obstruct local abscission events and create energy barriers within contracting cell plate fenestrae. These cellular events prevent the full closure of cell plate fenestrae, leading to incomplete cytokinesis and plasmodesmata formation. —Ankit Walia Diverging from conventional cell division models, plant cells undergo incomplete division to generate plasmodesmata communication bridges between daughter cells. Although fundamental for plant multicellularity, the molecular events leading to bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. Using electron tomography, we mapped the transition from cell plate fenestrae to plasmodesmata. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER’s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation. Our findings reveal how plants undergo incomplete division to promote intercellular communication.},

This separation reduces the optical activity, thus rendering them optically dark. Using 90° twisted layers of black phosphorous, Huang et al . demonstrate a new species of exciton that carries a permanent dipole (see the Perspective by Milošević and Covasi). As a result of the layer-hybridized conduction band and the layer-polarized valence band, the interlayer excitons with a net dipole moment are optically bright. This discovery, as well as the ability to tune the properties of this exciton through geometry, will provide a useful platform for optoelectronic applications. —Ian S. Osborne Bright dipolar excitons, which contain electrical dipoles and have high oscillator strength, are an ideal platform for studying correlated quantum phenomena. They usually rely on carrier tunneling between two quantum wells or two layers to hybridize with nondipolar excitons to gain oscillator strength. In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90°-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.},

Kraft et al . performed genome sequencing in individuals with brain malformation and identified mutations in subunits of the core protein-folding machine TRiC (see the Perspective by Sharma). In multiple models, these mutations induced defects in neuronal proliferation and development, as well as a variety of defects in intracellular structures and pathways involving actin, microtubules, and mitochondria. These results reveal a critical role for protein folding in brain development and suggest that TRiC mutations might define a group of brain malformations. —Mattia Maroso Malformations of the brain are common and vary in severity, from negligible to potentially fatal. Their causes have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report pathogenic variants in the core protein-folding machinery TRiC/CCT in individuals with brain malformations, intellectual disability, and seizures. The chaperonin TRiC is an obligate hetero-oligomer, and we identify variants in seven of its eight subunits, all of which impair function or assembly through different mechanisms. Transcriptome and proteome analyses of patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrate the various consequences of TRiC impairment.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen oxidation to form water on a palladium surface proceeds through cooperative binding of at least three oxygen atoms at step sites to form an active configuration. Velocity-resolved kinetics measurements by Schwarzer et al . revealed a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density. Density functional and transition-state theory showed that reactivity increased greatly after two unreactive adsorbate oxygen atoms were able to recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site. —Phil Szuromi Atomic-scale structures that account for the acceleration of reactivity by heterogeneous catalysts often form only under reaction conditions of high temperatures and pressures, making them impossible to observe with low-temperature, ultra-high-vacuum methods. We present velocity-resolved kinetics measurements for catalytic hydrogen oxidation on palladium over a wide range of surface concentrations and at high temperatures. The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory–based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms. Thus, hydrogen oxidation on palladium provides a clear example of how reactivity can be enhanced on a working catalyst.},

In addition to hosting an intricate lymphatic system that connects to the brain, the meninges serve as an immune niche that harbors a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells ( 2 – 4 ). Even in the absence of inflammatory conditions or brain insult, meningeal immune cells serve a homeostatic role, surveilling the central nervous system (CNS) border and communicating with the brain to influence neurodevelopment.

Several chaperones, including TCP-1 ring complex/chaperonin containing TCP-1 (TRiC/CCT), assist with protein folding and unfolding to sustain proteostasis. On page 516 of this issue, Kraft et al. ( 2 ) present evidence that multiple TRiC variants are associated with brain disorders in humans and characterize the effect of these disease-linked mutations on TRiC function across several model species.

Shortly after penicillin came into clinical use to treat Staphylococcus aureus —a pathogen that can cause mild to fatal infections—strains resistant to the drug emerged. In 1959, the antibiotic methicillin was introduced to treat penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus . Methicillin is a member of the β-lactam family of antibiotics that are broadly effective against many types of bacteria. However, by 1960, infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) had been reported ( 1 ). Given the importance of β-lactams for treating S. aureus infections, researchers have sought to understand the mechanism and evolutionary origins of this resistance. On page 573 of this issue, Adedeji-Olulana et al . ( 2 ) report that high-level resistance to methicillin requires S. aureus to use a distinct form of cell division to ensure its survival.},

The main driver is often lack of public support at baseline (“ex ante”). Yet, there is evidence that when voters hold biased beliefs ex ante about a given policy, experiencing the policy first-hand may lead them to correct their beliefs and increase public support ( 1 ). If it was widely documented that opposition to sound policies in part dissipates when voters experience a given policy, then more policy-makers may be inclined to experiment with policies that scientists recommend but that are unpopular ex ante. Systematically combining policy evaluation with causal analysis of public support would allow scholars to create a body of knowledge on the conditions under which policies become more (or less) popular after implementation and what are the drivers of changes in beliefs and public support.},

  abstract     = {The gut microbiota generate diverse bioactive compounds that can potentially affect host physiology. During bouts of malnutrition, the microbiota also become depleted, which can compound the harm to the host, especially in childhood. Cheng et al . have identified an organism producing a suite of metabolites that associate with increased weight of recovering malnourished Bangladeshi children on a designed diet; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is abundant in the guts of children on this diet. This bacterial strain has an analog of a bidirectional fatty acid amide hydrolase with broad substrate specificity that hydrolyzes N -acylethanolamines and synthesizes N -acylamides into active products at the gut mucosa. This versatility indicates a specific bacterial capacity to regulate signaling in the human gut, affecting immunity, appetite, and growth. —Caroline Ash Undernutrition in Bangladeshi children is associated with disruption of postnatal gut microbiota assembly; compared with standard therapy, a microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) substantially improved their ponderal and linear growth. Here, we characterize a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) from a growth-associated intestinal strain of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii cultured from these children. This enzyme, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, hydrolyzes a variety of N -acylamides, including oleoylethanolamide (OEA), neurotransmitters, and quorum sensing N -acyl homoserine lactones; it also synthesizes a range of N -acylamides, notably N -acyl amino acids. Treating germ-free mice with N -oleoylarginine and N -oleolyhistidine, major products of FAAH OEA metabolism, markedly affected expression of intestinal immune function pathways. Administering MDCF to Bangladeshi children considerably reduced fecal OEA, a satiety factor whose levels were negatively correlated with abundance and expression of their F. prausnitzii FAAH. This enzyme, structurally and catalytically distinct from mammalian FAAH, is positioned to regulate levels of a variety of bioactive molecules.},

  abstract     = {Tardigrades are small invertebrates renowned for their resistance to harsh environmental conditions, including ionizing radiation that would kill many organisms. Li et al . now describe a previously unknown species of tardigrade, Hypsibius henanensis , and investigate how these organisms respond to radiation treatment using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses. The mechanisms include induction of biosynthesis of betalain pigments and up-regulation of both tardigrade-specific and more widely distributed pathways for stress response and DNA damage repair. —Michael A. Funk Tardigrades are captivating organisms known for their resilience in extreme environments, including ultra-high-dose radiation, but the underlying mechanisms of this resilience remain largely unknown. Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis of Hypsibius henanensis sp. nov. , we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 ( DODA1 ), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains—a type of plant pigment with free radical–scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)–mediated DNA damage repair. These three observations expand our understanding of mechanisms of tardigrade radiotolerance.},

  abstract     = {In light of emerging evidence that antioxidants can have cancer-promoting effects, Swamynathan et al . tested potential pro-oxidant interventions (see the Perspective by Pannia and Dowling). In particular, the authors focused on menadione sodium bisulfite, a water-soluble precursor of vitamin K. As the authors anticipated, this menadione derivative suppressed prostate cancer growth. The researchers then examined its mechanism of action and identified the kinase VPS34 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3) as its target. Fortuitously, they realized that a fatal genetic muscle disease called X-linked myotubular myopathy is also linked to a relative excess of VPS34 activity owing to the loss of its antagonist, and dietary supplementation with menadione proved beneficial in a mouse model of this genetic disorder. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Men taking antioxidant vitamin E supplements have increased prostate cancer (PC) risk. However, whether pro-oxidants protect from PC remained unclear. In this work, we show that a pro-oxidant vitamin K precursor [menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)] suppresses PC progression in mice, killing cells through an oxidative cell death: MSB antagonizes the essential class III phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase VPS34—the regulator of endosome identity and sorting—through oxidation of key cysteines, pointing to a redox checkpoint in sorting. Testing MSB in a myotubular myopathy model that is driven by loss of MTM1 —the phosphatase antagonist of VPS34—we show that dietary MSB improved muscle histology and function and extended life span. These findings enhance our understanding of pro-oxidant selectivity and show how definition of the pathways they impinge on can give rise to unexpected therapeutic opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Since Kettlewell’s work in the mid-20th century, insects have presented clear examples of rapid color morph adaptation in response to human-induced change. Ni et al . showed not only that such adaptations occur within a single species response to change but also that such change can affect tightly linked species interactions (see the Perspective by Nosil). They found that a stonefly that mimics a related, toxic species repeatedly changed color in response to forest loss and shifts in predation pressure in these more bird depauperate regions. Shifts were evident both in a color-controlling genetic locus and in the external phenotype. —Sacha Vignieri Rapid adaptation is thought to be critical for the survival of species under global change, but our understanding of human-induced evolution in the wild remains limited. We show that widespread deforestation has underpinned repeated color shifts in wild insect populations. Specifically, loss of forest has led to color changes across lineages that mimic the warning coloration of a toxic forest stonefly. Predation experiments suggest that the relative fitness of color phenotypes varies between forested and deforested habitats. Genomic and coloration analyses of 1200 specimens show repeated selection at the ebony locus controlling color polymorphism across lineages. These findings represent an example of human-driven evolution linked to altered species interactions, highlighting the possibility for populations to adapt rapidly in the wake of sudden environmental change.},

  abstract     = {Modern insect populations are exposed to a soup of agrochemicals composed of pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides, among others. Although many of these compounds have been tested singly, and for lethality, they neither occur in nature alone nor only affect animals through mortality. Gandara et al . screened more than 1000 agrochemicals in a fruit fly model and found that a majority of these molecules had behavioral effects at sublethal levels and even more compromised survival after acute exposure. When they combined agrochemicals at field-realistic levels, the authors observed widespread changes to larval development, behavior, and reproduction. These results suggest that agrochemical exposure, even at sublethal levels, is affecting insect populations. —Sacha Vignieri Insect biomass is declining globally, likely driven by climate change and pesticide use, yet systematic studies on the effects of various chemicals remain limited. In this work, we used a chemical library of 1024 molecules—covering insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors—to assess the impact of sublethal pesticide doses on insects. In Drosophila melanogaster , 57% of chemicals affected larval behavior, and a higher proportion compromised long-term survivability. Exposure to sublethal doses also induced widespread changes in the phosphoproteome and changes in development and reproduction. The negative effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the temperature was increased. We observed similar behavioral changes across multiple insect species, including mosquitoes and butterflies. These findings suggest that widespread sublethal pesticide exposure can alter insect behavior and physiology, threatening long-term population survival.},

  abstract     = {Protein design methods have made rapid progress in recent years with the introduction of machine learning–based generative models. Frank et al . now debut an alternative method called relaxed sequence optimization that enables efficient and robust convergence toward optimal structures on the basis of iterative sequence evolution using gradient descent–based hallucination. The authors generated de novo protein designs ranging from 100 to 1000 amino acids that are structurally diverse and can be biased toward desired properties in a flexible manner. Thorough experimental characterization confirmed a high success rate and close correspondence of the design to protein structure. The design approach allowed for production of hetero- and homodimeric proteins and will be adaptable to other complex design tasks. —Michael A. Funk Machine learning (ML)–based design approaches have advanced the field of de novo protein design, with diffusion-based generative methods increasingly dominating protein design pipelines. Here, we report a “hallucination”-based protein design approach that functions in relaxed sequence space, enabling the efficient design of high-quality protein backbones over multiple scales and with broad scope of application without the need for any form of retraining. We experimentally produced and characterized more than 100 proteins. Three high-resolution crystal structures and two cryo–electron microscopy density maps of designed single-chain proteins comprising up to 1000 amino acids validate the accuracy of the method. Our pipeline can also be used to design synthetic protein-protein interactions, as validated experimentally by a set of protein heterodimers. Relaxed sequence optimization offers attractive performance with respect to designability, scope of applicability for different design problems, and scalability across protein sizes.},

  abstract     = {Water-laden hydrogels are increasingly finding use in biomedical applications because of their inherent softness, which matches that of biological tissue, and their ability to maintain hydration and oxygen permeation. However, it is difficult to give them semiconducting functionality, as most polymer semiconductors are not soluble in water. Dai et al . report the design, synthesis, characterization, and applications of hydrogel–semiconducting polymer composites through a process of solvent exchange. They combined the polymer semiconductor p(g2T-T) with the hydrogel-forming monomer acrylic acid in dimethyl sulfoxide to form a double-network structure upon cross-linking with ultraviolet light. After solvent exchange with water, the semiconducting hydrogel had a low modulus while maintaining high charge carrier transport properties, as well as organ conformability and reduced foreign body response. —Marc S. Lavine Hydrogels, known for their mechanical and chemical similarity to biological tissues, are widely used in biotechnologies, whereas semiconductors provide advanced electronic and optoelectronic functionalities such as signal amplification, sensing, and photomodulation. Combining semiconducting properties with hydrogel designs can enhance biointeractive functions and intimacy at biointerfaces, but this is challenging owing to the low hydrophilicity of polymer semiconductors. We developed a solvent affinity–induced assembly method that incorporates water-insoluble polymer semiconductors into double-network hydrogels. These semiconductors exhibited tissue-level moduli as soft as 81 kilopascals, stretchability of 150% strain, and charge-carrier mobility up to 1.4 square centimeters per volt per second. When they are interfaced with biological tissues, their tissue-level modulus enables alleviated immune reactions. The hydrogel’s high porosity enhances molecular interactions at semiconductor-biofluid interfaces, resulting in photomodulation with higher response and volumetric biosensing with higher sensitivity.},

The authors found that the iron in the grain boundary is accommodated by the formation of cages with fivefold symmetry. This prevents the formation of ordered phases and is reminiscent of quasi-crystals or glass. Simulations were able to reproduce this unexpected structure, which creates a method for engineering grain boundary structure for other alloy compositions. —Brent Grocholski Engineering the structure of grain boundaries (GBs) by solute segregation is a promising strategy to tailor the properties of polycrystalline materials. Solute segregation triggering phase transitions at GBs has been suggested theoretically to offer different pathways to design interfaces, but an understanding of their intrinsic atomistic nature is missing. We combined atomic resolution electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to discover that iron segregation to GBs in titanium stabilizes icosahedral units (“cages”) that form robust building blocks of distinct GB phases. Owing to their five-fold symmetry, the iron cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterized by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units. Our advanced GB structure prediction algorithms and atomistic simulations validate the stability of these observed phases and the high excess of iron at the GB that is accommodated by the phase transitions.},

  abstract     = {Gut bacteria have many mechanisms for positive and negative interactions, and the trade among them is vigorous. Abundant Bacteroides species in the gut use conjugation with DNA transfer and a weaponized injection system called the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to pump effector toxins into competing cells. T6SS loci called genetic architecture 1 (GA1), GA2, and GA3 occur on large integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), and their genes are some of the most commonly traded among the Bacteroidales. Sheahan et al . conducted transcriptomic analyses that revealed that GA3 is inhibited by an ICE bearing GA1 genes. Inhibition was mediated by a transcription regulator, also encoded by the ICE, that shuts off expression of the GA3 T6SS injection mechanism. Immunity proteins may also be involved. Competition experiments in germ-free mice hint that the interactions among GAs and ICEs regulate the abundances of different populations of Bacteroidales. —Caroline Ash DNA transfer is ubiquitous in the human gut microbiota, especially among species of the order Bacteroidales. In silico analyses have revealed hundreds of mobile genetic elements shared between these species, yet little is known about the phenotypes they encode, their effects on fitness, or pleiotropic consequences for the recipient’s genome. In this work, we show that acquisition of a ubiquitous integrative conjugative element (ICE) encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS) shuts down the native T6SS of Bacteroides fragilis . Despite inactivating this T6SS, ICE acquisition increases the fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with the new T6SS. DNA transfer causes the strain to change allegiances so that it no longer targets ecosystem members with the same element yet is armed for communal defense.},

Xiao et al . propose a unified approach, which they investigated by looking at lithium (Li) storage in titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) films of varying thicknesses with different substrates across a range of Li activity. Using these thickness-dependence measurements, they showed that TiO 2 stores Li in its bulk by means of an insertion mechanism as well as at its interface through a supercapacitive mechanism. The authors relate the position-dependent Li storage mechanism to charge carrier defect chemistry. Thus, not only does the mixed conducting electrode itself need to be considered but also the neighboring current collecting phase. By revising thinking about charge storage, the authors provide a different perspective to optimize between high power and high energy density storage. —Marc S. Lavine Insertion storage in battery electrodes and supercapacitive storage are typically considered to be independent phenomena and thus are dealt with in separate scientific communities. Using tailored experiments on titanium oxide thin films of various thicknesses, we demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of both processes. For the interpretation of the entire storage profile encompassing both contributions, the (free) energies of the charge carriers in the mixed conductor and the neighboring phase are the only materials parameters required. The experimental results enable no less than a unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage, the first being dominant for thick films, the latter for thin films or negligible electronic conductivity. Therefore, the size of the storage medium and the nature of the current collecting phases can be used to tune power density versus energy density.},

  abstract     = {Members of the III-V semiconductor family, ranging from binary species such as gallium phosphide (GaP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) up to pentanary compositions, can now be grown as monodisperse nanoparticles in eutectic melts of inorganic salts. Ondry et al . found that a wider range of semiconductors could be made if, instead of Ga(III), a weaker oxidizing species, Ga[GaI 4 ], was used in the redox reactions. This approach allowed higher reaction temperatures that enabled synthesis of GaAs nanoparticles that showed band-edge photoluminescence. —Phil Szuromi Colloidal quantum dots, with their size-tunable optoelectronic properties and scalable synthesis, enable applications in which inexpensive high-performance semiconductors are needed. Synthesis science breakthroughs have been key to the realization of quantum dot technologies, but important group III–group V semiconductors, including colloidal gallium arsenide (GaAs), still cannot be synthesized with existing approaches. The high-temperature molten salt colloidal synthesis introduced in this work enables the preparation of previously intractable colloidal materials. We directly nucleated and grew colloidal quantum dots in molten inorganic salts by harnessing molten salt redox chemistry and using surfactant additives for nanocrystal shape control. Synthesis temperatures above 425°C are critical for realizing photoluminescent GaAs quantum dots, which emphasizes the importance of high temperatures enabled by molten salt solvents. We generalize the methodology and demonstrate nearly a dozen III-V solid-solution nanocrystal compositions that have not been previously reported.},

Grain boundaries (GBs) form between two grains and control various properties. Adsorption of impurities or alloying elements at these interfaces can substantially alter a material’s properties, such as strength and toughness. GB adsorption, also called segregation, can transform the structures and properties of an interface. Despite the importance of GB transitions in engineering materials, they are not well understood because of the challenges in characterizing structural transformations at the atomic level. On page 420 of this issue, Devulapalli et al. ( 1 ) report a detailed description of a GB transition in titanium that is induced by iron adsorption. It allows the formation of icosahedral structures that are forbidden in bulk crystals. The observation suggests new types of distinct interfacial structures and properties.},

In the early 1900s, a darkly colored form of the peppered moth appeared on the increasingly soot-covered tree trunks of England. Over the subsequent decades, rapid increases in the frequency of this camouflaged melanic form occurred, followed by decreases in frequency as pollution declined. Thus, “industrial melanism” emerged as a textbook example of evolution in action ( 2 ). Since then, other cases of putatively human-induced evolution have been reported ( 1 , 3 ). However, many lack spatial replication or ambiguities remain concerning the mechanisms of evolution and the role of genetics versus phenotypic plasticity. On page 453 of this issue, Ni et al. ( 4 ) report a particularly convincing example of rapid, replicated, and human-induced evolution in wild insect populations. Moreover, the authors provide evidence that the mechanism of evolution is altered bird predation due to deforestation.},

  abstract     = {Aging of the immune system is a key factor for cancer outcome. Park et al . performed immune profiling to explore how the immune system becomes less able to combat cancer with age. Through experimental lung cancer models, aging was associated with a more rapid recruitment of myeloid immune cells into tumors and enhanced tumor growth in older mice. Production of the cytokine interleukin-1α (IL-1α) by myeloid cells provided signals to hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow, which created a mechanism to further promote the recruitment of an immunosuppressive myeloid population. The enzyme DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A), involved in age-associated DNA methylation, was down-regulated with age and correlated with the production of IL-1. Blocking of the IL-1 receptor was found to reduce lung cancer progression in aged mice. —Priscilla N. Kelly Age is a major risk factor for cancer, but how aging impacts tumor control remains unclear. In this study, we establish that aging of the immune system, regardless of the age of the stroma and tumor, drives lung cancer progression. Hematopoietic aging enhances emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in the local accumulation of myeloid progenitor–like cells in lung tumors. These cells are a major source of interleukin (IL)–1⍺, which drives the enhanced myeloid response. The age-associated decline of DNA methyltransferase 3A enhances IL-1⍺ production, and disrupting IL-1 receptor 1 signaling early during tumor development normalized myelopoiesis and slowed the growth of lung, colonic, and pancreatic tumors. In human tumors, we identified an enrichment for IL-1⍺–expressing monocyte-derived macrophages linked to age, poorer survival, and recurrence, unraveling how aging promotes cancer and offering actionable therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {Twenty years after the term “microplastics” was first used, what do we know about their presence in the environment? Thompson et al . review what we have learned over that interval, including what microplastics are, their sources and sinks, their ecological impacts and risks, the dangers they pose to human health, advances in detection and identification, and prospects for managing and regulating them. The environmental burden of microplastics continues to grow, so a combination of scientific, economic, and social interventions will be necessary to curb that growth. —Jesse Smith Twenty years after the first publication that used the term microplastic, we review current understanding, refine definitions, and consider future prospects. Microplastics arise from multiple sources, including tires, textiles, cosmetics, paint, and the fragmentation of larger items. They are widely distributed throughout the natural environment, with evidence of harm at multiple levels of biological organization. They are pervasive in food and drink and have been detected throughout the human body, with emerging evidence of negative effects. Environmental contamination could double by 2040, and wide-scale harm has been predicted. Public concern is increasing, and diverse measures to address microplastic pollution are being considered in international negotiations. Clear evidence on the efficacy of potential solutions is now needed to address the issue and to minimize the risks of unintended consequences.},

  abstract     = {Infertility is a common health problem worldwide, and for many patients, we cannot yet pinpoint the cause of their fertility problems. The mammalian testis contains one of the most complex transcriptomes of any tissue as well as abundant RNA binding proteins. To provide insight into the biology of male fertility, Li et al . examined mouse male germ cells at different stages of development to generate an atlas of RNA binding proteins and their roles in sperm development. Using the findings from their atlas, the authors identified major evolutionarily conserved RNA binding proteins and regulatory elements and demonstrated their roles in mouse spermatogenesis. Finally, they collected data from hundreds of human males being treated for infertility and demonstrated the relevance of the mouse findings to human health. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Despite continuous expansion of the RNA binding protein (RBP) world, there is a lack of systematic understanding of RBPs in the mammalian testis, which harbors one of the most complex tissue transcriptomes. We adapted RNA interactome capture to mouse male germ cells, building an RBP atlas characterized by multiple layers of dynamics along spermatogenesis. Trapping of RNA–cross-linked peptides showed that the glutamic acid–arginine (ER) patch, a residue-coevolved polyampholytic element present in coiled coils, enhances RNA binding of its host RBPs. Deletion of this element in NONO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) led to a defective mitosis-to-meiosis transition due to compromised NONO-RNA interactions. Whole-exome sequencing of over 1000 infertile men revealed a prominent role of RBPs in the human genetic architecture of male infertility and identified risk ER patch variants.},

Tessler et al . investigated whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help groups reach a consensus during democratic debate (see the Policy Forum by Nyhan and Titiunik). The authors trained a large language model called the Habermas Machine to serve as an AI mediator that helped small UK groups find common ground while discussing divisive political issues such as Brexit, immigration, the minimum wage, climate change, and universal childcare. Compared with human mediators, AI mediators produced more palatable statements that generated wide agreement and left groups less divided. The AI’s statements were more clear, logical, and informative without alienating minority perspectives. This work carries policy implications for AI’s potential to unify deeply divided groups. —Ekeoma Uzogara Finding agreement through a free exchange of views is often difficult. Collective deliberation can be slow, difficult to scale, and unequally attentive to different voices. In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation. Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants ( N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population.},

Qin et al . present an overview of recent developments in this field, driven in part by the discovery of tin selenide, a narrow-gap semiconductor that was not an obvious choice as a thermoelectric material. However, a decade ago, tin selenide was shown to have a high thermoelectric efficiency. That discovery and further refinement of this compound have been important for developing a new generation of thermoelectric materials and devices. —Brent Grocholski Thermoelectric technology experienced rapid development over the past 20 years, with the most promising applications being in both power generation and active cooling. Among existing thermoelectrics, tin selenide (SnSe) has had particularly rapid development owing to the unexpectedly high thermoelectric efficiency that has been continuously established over the past decade. Several transport mechanisms and strategies used to interpret and improve the thermoelectric performance of SnSe have been important for understanding and developing other material systems with SnSe-like characteristics. Similar to other thermoelectrics, building commercially viable SnSe-based devices requires advances in device efficiency and service stability. Further optimization across all material systems should enable thermoelectric technology to play a critical role in the future global energy landscape.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial communities have complex ecologies that require a range of interactions, whether to keep competitors at bay or to enter potential hosts or for predation. For these purposes, bacteria contain families of secretion systems that often work with contractile injection-like mechanisms to move effectors such as toxins or adhesins out of the cell and into specific target cells. Using cryo–electron microscopy structures and genetic analyses, Lien et al . found that an aquatic filamentous bacterium goes hunting armed with heptamers of a type 9 secretion system that act as grappling hooks to grab the flagella of prey and a type 6 secretion system effector that then stabs and kills it (see the Perspective by Caulton and Lovering). Similar machinery may also be important in bacterial interactions closer to home, such as in the gut ecosystem. —Caroline Ash Ixotrophy is a contact-dependent predatory strategy of filamentous bacteria in aquatic environments for which the molecular mechanism remains unknown. We show that predator-prey contact can be established by gliding motility or extracellular assemblages we call “grappling hooks.” Cryo–electron microscopy identified the grappling hooks as heptamers of a type IX secretion system substrate. After close predator-prey contact is established, cryo–electron tomography and functional assays showed that puncturing by a type VI secretion system mediated killing. Single-cell analyses with stable isotope–labeled prey revealed that prey components are taken up by the attacker. Depending on nutrient availability, insertion sequence elements toggle the activity of ixotrophy. A marine metagenomic time series shows coupled dynamics of ixotrophic bacteria and prey. We found that the mechanism of ixotrophy involves multiple cellular machineries, is conserved, and may shape microbial populations in the environment.},

We use machine learning to systematically group forest ecoregions into 12 global forest pyromes, with each showing distinct sensitivities to climatic, human, and vegetation controls. This delineation revealed that rapidly increasing forest fire emissions in extratropical pyromes, linked to climate change, offset declining emissions in tropical pyromes during 2001 to 2023. Annual emissions tripled in one extratropical pyrome due to increases in fire-favorable weather, compounded by increased forest cover and productivity. This contributed to a 60% increase in forest fire carbon emissions from forest ecoregions globally. Our results highlight the increasing vulnerability of forests and their carbon stocks to fire disturbance under climate change.},

We conducted a megastudy ( n = 32,059 participants) testing 25 treatments designed by academics and practitioners to reduce Americans’ partisan animosity and antidemocratic attitudes. We find that many treatments reduced partisan animosity, most strongly by highlighting relatable sympathetic individuals with different political beliefs or by emphasizing common identities shared by rival partisans. We also identify several treatments that reduced support for undemocratic practices—most strongly by correcting misperceptions of rival partisans’ views or highlighting the threat of democratic collapse—which shows that antidemocratic attitudes are not intractable.

These cells are relatively rare, and they vary in their locations and the types of hormones they secrete, making it difficult to fully characterize their subtypes and biological functions. To address this difficulty, Beumer et al . developed a method of culturing organoids composed of human gastric cells. The authors then studied organoids derived from the stomach, small intestine, and colon cells of human patients with or without targeted mutations inactivating specific receptors to delineate the functions of various metabolite sensors and to identify potential pharmacological targets. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are gut epithelial cells that respond to intestinal contents by secreting hormones, including the incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory protein (GIP), which regulate multiple physiological processes. Hormone release is controlled through metabolite-sensing proteins. Low expression, interspecies differences, and the existence of multiple EEC subtypes have posed challenges to the study of these sensors. We describe differentiation of stomach EECs to complement existing intestinal organoid protocols. CD200 emerged as a pan-EEC surface marker, allowing deep transcriptomic profiling from primary human tissue along the stomach-intestinal tract. We generated loss-of-function mutations in 22 receptors and subjected organoids to ligand-induced secretion experiments. We delineate the role of individual human EEC sensors in the secretion of hormones, including GLP-1.

We relate insect and spider richness to biomass and PUFA-mass from stream and terrestrial communities encompassing nine land uses. PUFA-mass and biomass relate positively to biodiversity across ecosystems. In terrestrial systems, human-dominated areas have lower biomass and PUFA-mass than more natural areas, even at equivalent levels of richness.

However, additional deformation occurs far from the fault over a longer timescale as the crust adjusts to the changes in stress. Ergintav et al . showed that this far-field deformation was much larger after the 6 February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence than expected. The large amount of far-field deformation has broad implications for the seismic hazard assessment of the region and may require rethinking the mechanics of some types of earthquakes. —Brent Grocholski The spatiotemporal pattern of surface displacements from large earthquakes provides crucial insights about the deformation of Earth’s crust at various scales and the interactions among tectonic plates. However, the lack of extensive and large-scale geodetic networks near such seismic events hinders our thorough understanding of the large-scale crustal deformation resulting from earthquakes. Using Türkiye’s extensive and continuous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) network during the moment magnitude 7.8 and 7.6 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes on 6 February 2023, we show that large earthquakes can induce far-field crustal deformations (&gt;700 kilometers), exceeding current predictions from elastic dislocation models. They can lead to the mobilization of tectonic plates and the triggering of far-field earthquakes, which carries profound implications for seismic hazard assessments and necessitates a new perspective on crustal deformation and earthquake mechanics.},

Lavine In the quest for high-capacity battery electrodes, addressing capacity loss attributed to isolated active materials remains a challenge.

Using a 5-second pulse, we achieved &gt;30% of capacity recovery in both Li-Si and Si–lithium iron phosphate (Si-LFP) batteries. The recovered capacity sustains and replicates through multiple pulses, providing a constant capacity advantage. We validated the recovery mechanism as the movement of the neutral isolated Li x Si particles under a localized nonuniform electric field, a phenomenon known as dielectrophoresis.},

Jeon et al . engineered a system with a number of nanoscopic Hall bars positioned along the track. The researchers used these electrical sensors to simultaneously detect the positions of multiple domain walls with a spatial resolution about 25 times higher than that previously achieved using optical methods. —Jelena Stajic The manipulation and detection of mobile domain walls in nanoscopic magnetic wires underlies the development of multibit memories. The studies of such domain walls have focused on macroscopic wires that allow for optical detection by using magneto-optic effects. In this study, we demonstrated the electrical tracking with a spatial resolution of better than 40 nm of multiple mobile domain walls in nanoscopic racetracks, using a set of anomalous Hall detectors integrated into the racetracks. Electrical time-series signals from the Hall detectors allow for the static and dynamic phase space visualization of the dynamics of a domain wall or multiple domain walls that can be described by a multicore memristor model. The domain wall dynamics and stochasticity can be controlled in racetracks even to deep submicron dimensions.},

Chemicals attributed to industry and consumer goods were the major drivers of the neurotoxic effects in mixtures. This work demonstrates the power of comprehensive monitoring to inform human chemical exposure and help guide risk assessment. —Michael A. Funk and Iyinoluwa Sofowora Human biomonitoring studies typically capture only a small and unknown fraction of the entire chemical universe. We combined chemical analysis with a high-throughput in vitro assay for neurotoxicity to capture complex mixtures of organic chemicals in blood. Plasma samples of 624 pregnant women from the German LiNA cohort were extracted with a nonselective extraction method for organic chemicals. 294 of &gt;1000 target analytes were detected and quantified. Many of the detected chemicals as well as the whole extracts interfered with neurite development. Experimental testing of simulated complex mixtures of detected chemicals in the neurotoxicity assay confirmed additive mixture effects at concentrations less than individual chemicals’ effect thresholds. The use of high-throughput target screening combined with bioassays has the potential to improve human biomonitoring and provide a new approach to including mixture effects in epidemiological studies.},

However, not all such problems are equally challenging with current techniques.

In this work, we introduce a metric of variational accuracy, the V-score, obtained from the variational energy and its variance. We provide an extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy and future algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy.

  abstract     = {Most people around the world desire democratic governance, but is there a global consensus on what constitutes a democracy? To defend and strengthen democracy, citizens must share a common understanding of democracy’s distinguishing features. Chu et al . examined what people considered the most important attributes of a democracy in six distinct countries that are considered well-functioning democracies (Italy and Japan), deteriorating or backsliding democracies (US and India), and nondemocracies (Egypt and Thailand) (see the Policy Forum by Nyhan and Titiunik). Across and within countries, people consistently ranked free and fair elections and protection of civil liberties such as free speech as being most important. Gender equality was ranked the third most important attribute everywhere except the US and Egypt. Economic equality was ranked fourth overall. —Ekeoma Uzogara How do people around the world define democracy? Answering this question is critical as countries face democratic backsliding and authoritarian governments promote alternative notions of democracy. Indeed, some scholars argue that people from different backgrounds understand democracy differently. By contrast, we discovered very consistent views about what constitutes a “democratic” country from conjoint survey experiments conducted in Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, Thailand, and the United States. Across countries ( N = 6150) and diverse subgroups within countries, people similarly emphasized free and fair elections and civil liberties as being the key determinants of democracy. Countries that produce desirable social and economic outcomes are also considered more democratic, but these and other factors exert a smaller and less consistent effect than elections and civil liberties.},

Repeated cycles of charging and discharging cause a substantial volumetric change in the electrodes, which leads to their severe structural deformation and pulverization ( 1 ). This problem is worse for highcapacity electrode materials that store a large amount of energy, such as lithium and silicon. Active material constituents of such electrodes can detach over cycling time, thereby losing electrical connection to the rest of the battery components. These isolated and electrochemically inactivated components, called isolated active materials, are also often referred to as “dead” supply and contribute to capacity loss ( 2 ). On page 322 of this issue, Yang et al. ( 3 ) report an approach to recover isolated active materials by applying short electric pulses to the battery.

This includes capturing proteins from tumor cells and presenting them to T cells, which are subsequently activated and become tumor-killing cells ( 1 ). Therefore, manipulating DCs is a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. One subclass of DCs—type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s)—is particularly important for initiating tumor-eliminating immune responses, but cDC1-based immunotherapies have not yet been deployed in the clinic mainly because of the sparseness of cDC1s in tumors ( 2 ). On page 286 of this issue, Ascic et al . ( 3 ) report that cancer cells can be reprogrammed in vivo into immunogenic cDC1-like antigenpresenting cells that can activate T cells and promote antitumor immunity. This approach overcomes the limitations of cDC1 quantity in the TME and paves the way for future DC-based immunotherapies.},

  abstract     = {The success of cancer immunotherapy can be limited by mechanisms that tumors develop to evade destruction by the immune system. Tumors can block the activation and obstruct the ability of immune cells (dendritic cells and T lymphocytes) to destroy the tumor, thereby creating an environment that is beneficial for cancer growth. Ascic et al . developed an approach to directly reprogram cancer cells into dendritic cells in vivo by delivering the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 with an adenoviral vector (see the Perspective by Zhou and Wu). The transcription factors promoted dendritic cell–like functions and enabled the engineered tumor cells to present antigens and mount cancer-specific T cell immune responses. The tumor-to-immune cell “reprogramming” reshaped the tumor microenvironment, triggering tumor regressions and systemic immunity. —Priscilla N. Kelly Immunotherapy can lead to long-term survival for some cancer patients, yet generalized success has been hampered by insufficient antigen presentation and exclusion of immunogenic cells from the tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed an approach to reprogram tumor cells in vivo by adenoviral delivery of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3, which enabled them to present antigens as type 1 conventional dendritic cells. Reprogrammed tumor cells remodeled their tumor microenvironment, recruited, and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic T cells; induced tumor regressions; and established long-term systemic immunity in multiple mouse melanoma models. In human tumor spheroids and xenografts, reprogramming to immunogenic dendritic-like cells progressed independently of immunosuppression, which usually limits immunotherapy. Our study paves the way for human clinical trials of in vivo immune cell reprogramming for cancer immunotherapy.},

The authors found the lava to be from multiple homogeneous but separate magma bodies. Their observations suggest a complex midcrustal magma domain, a finding that has implications for the duration and extent of the sequence of eruptions. —Brent Grocholski Mid-crustal magma domains are the source of many basaltic eruptions. Lavas from individual eruptions are often chemically homogeneous, suggesting that they derive from single, well-mixed magma reservoirs. The 2023 to 2024 eruptions at Sundhnúksgígar in the Svartsengi volcanic system in Iceland provide an opportunity to observe the behavior of a mid-crustal magma domain at high spatial and temporal resolution by detailed sampling and geochemical characterization. We observed substantial mantle-derived geochemical variability in the products erupted in the first hours of the December 2023 and January, February, and March to May 2024 eruptions, indicating that the eruptions derived from multiple magma reservoirs, which mineral-melt equilibration pressures place in the mid crust. The unusual presence of geochemical heterogeneity in the mid-crustal magma domain provides insights into how dynamic and complex mid-crustal magma domains can be.},

Chen et al . present a new tool for long-range mutagenesis that can be targeted to any genomic locus. Helicase-assisted continuous editing (HACE) uses a nickase–Cas9–single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to recruit a helicase-deaminase fusion enzyme, which then travels more than 1000 base pairs, incurring mutations across the region. The authors multiplexed HACE with sgRNAs to diversify coding and noncoding sequences, thereby identifying single mutations that confer drug resistance, perturb RNA splicing, or modulate expression of an inducible immune gene. HACE provides a powerful tool for the mutagenesis of endogenous loci and has the potential to explore new sequence space through directed evolution in mammalian cells. —Di Jiang Deciphering the context-specific relationship between sequence and function is a major challenge in genomics. Existing tools for inducing locus-specific hypermutation and evolution in the native genome context are limited. Here we present a programmable platform for long-range, locus-specific hypermutation called helicase-assisted continuous editing (HACE). HACE leverages CRISPR-Cas9 to target a processive helicase-deaminase fusion that incurs mutations across large (&gt;1000–base pair) genomic intervals. We applied HACE to identify mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) that confer kinase inhibitor resistance, to dissect the impact of individual variants in splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1)–dependent missplicing, and to evaluate noncoding variants in a stimulation-dependent immune enhancer of CD69.

A mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon is obscured by the biological richness of these aggregates and a lack of direct observation of their sedimentation physics. Utilizing a scale-free vertical tracking microscopy in a field setting, we present microhydrodynamic measurements of freshly collected marine snow aggregates from sediment traps. Our observations reveal hitherto-unknown comet-like morphology arising from fluid-structure interactions of transparent exopolymer halos around sinking aggregates. These invisible comet tails slow down individual particles, greatly increasing their residence time. Based on these findings, we constructed a reduced-order model for the Stokesian sedimentation of these mucus-embedded two-phase particles, paving the way toward a predictive understanding of marine snow.},

Kang et al . undertook a reverse-translation approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the durability of T cell responsiveness to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Tsui and Kallies). Inspired by clinical observations from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome, the epigenetic regulators (Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1) associated with clonal hematopoiesis were identified using experimental models of T cell exhaustion. Epigenetic disruption of the polycomb group repressive deubiquitinase complex resulted in preservation of a stem cell–like T cell population that was responsive to immunotherapy. Extending this mechanism to cancer adoptive cell therapy, Asxl1 disruption was found to endow T cells with superior therapeutic efficacy and an ability to synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy —Priscilla N. Kelly Epigenetic reinforcement of T cell exhaustion is known to be a major barrier limiting T cell responses during immunotherapy. However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients.},

Ice loss will affect culture, economy, water quality, fisheries, and biodiversity, as well as weather and climate. —Jesse Smith Climate change is reducing winter ice cover on lakes; yet, the full societal and environmental consequences of this ice loss are poorly understood. The socioeconomic implications of declining ice include diminished access to ice-based cultural activities, safety concerns in traversing ice, changes in fisheries, increases in shoreline erosion, and declines in water storage. Longer ice-free seasons allow more time and capacity for water to warm, threatening water quality and biodiversity. Food webs likely will reorganize, with constrained availability of ice-associated and cold-water niches, and ice loss will affect the nature, magnitude, and timing of greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite the inherent stochastic dynamics, the embryos achieve robust forms and functions. Fabrèges et al . explored how temporal variability and cell mechanics influence the robustness of embryonic development in mouse, rabbit, and monkey embryos. They found that cell desynchronization increased in a stochastic and cell-autonomous way, whereas spatial variability between embryos decreased during the eight-cell stage, driven by compaction and topological transitions toward specific configurations. Computer simulations supported these findings. Manipulating cleavage timing demonstrated its impact on cell-fate patterning, highlighting the role of temporal variability in ensuring robust morphogenesis. —Stella M. Hurtley How living systems achieve precision in form and function despite their intrinsic stochasticity is a fundamental yet ongoing question in biology. We generated morphomaps of preimplantation embryogenesis in mouse, rabbit, and monkey embryos, and these morphomaps revealed that although blastomere divisions desynchronized passively, 8-cell embryos converged toward robust three-dimensional shapes. Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo. Synchronized division reduced embryo packing and generated substantially more misallocated cells and fewer inner-cell–mass cells. These findings suggest that stochasticity in division timing contributes to robust patterning.},

For the most part, these catalysts rely on binding sites with oxygen or nitrogen atoms; pure hydrocarbons lacking such sites are much harder to bias spatially as the reaction ensues. Raut et al . now report that a class of chiral acids, imidodiphosphorimidates, can envelop symmetrical cyclopropanes and catalyze their ring-opening rearrangement to deliver chiral olefinic compounds with high enantioselectivity. —Jake S. Yeston The stereoselective activation of alkanes constitutes a long-standing and grand challenge for chemistry. Although metal-containing enzymes oxidize alkanes with remarkable ease and selectivity, chemical approaches have largely been limited to transition metal–based catalytic carbon–hydrogen functionalizations. Alkanes can be protonated to form pentacoordinated carbonium ions and fragmented into smaller hydrocarbons in the presence of strong Brønsted acids. However, catalytic stereocontrol over such reactions has not previously been accomplished. We show here that strong and confined acids catalyze highly enantioselective fragmentations of a variety of cyclopropanes into the corresponding alkenes, expanding the boundaries of catalytic selective alkane activation.

Maury et al . performed deep whole-genome sequencing in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from donors with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ), identifying somatic mutations inferred to have occurred before the end of neurogenesis (see the Perspective by An and Kim). Their results showed a higher rate of somatic single-nucleotide variants in the vicinity of transcription factor–binding sites in SZ tissue compared with control tissue. Some of these variants are related to known SZ risk genes, suggesting that somatic mutations during neurogenesis might contribute to determining overall risk of developing SZ later in life. —Mattia Maroso Germline mutations modulate the risk of developing schizophrenia (SCZ). Much less is known about the role of mosaic somatic mutations in the context of SCZ. Deep (239×) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of brain neurons from 61 SCZ cases and 25 controls postmortem identified mutations occurring during prenatal neurogenesis. SCZ cases showed increased somatic variants in open chromatin, with increased mosaic CpG transversions (CpG&gt;GpG) and T&gt;G mutations at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) overlapping open chromatin, a result not seen in controls. Some of these variants alter gene expression, including SCZ risk genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment. Although these mutational processes can reflect a difference in factors indirectly involved in disease, increased somatic mutations at developmental TFBSs could also potentially contribute to SCZ.},

  abstract     = {When we think of a species adapting to environmental change, we mostly think about one trait. However, changes in one trait will likely affect others. In Galápagos finches, it has been shown that drought can lead to a change in bill size and shape in response to shifts in seed resources. However, birds do not just eat with their bills, they also sing with them. Podos and Schroeder predicted how bill size would change in response to a series of droughts and forecasted the songs that they would produce. They found that, after a series of simulated droughts, the songs differed enough that territorial male birds no longer recognized them. —Sacha Vignieri The theory of ecological speciation posits that adaptive divergence among incipient species raises incidental barriers to reproduction, thus catalyzing the emergence of new species. In this study, we conducted an experimental test of this theory in Galápagos finches, a clade in which beaks and mating songs are mechanistically linked. We forecasted the acoustic structure of songs for a set of possible evolutionary futures (successive droughts spurring increasingly large beaks) and, in a field assay, presented resulting song simulations to territorial males. We found that responses to songs dropped off after six simulated drought events, to degrees roughly comparable to drops in response to songs that diverged through cultural drift and acoustic adaptation. Our results support, in Darwin’s finches, the feasibility and mechanistic bases of an ecological speciation hypothesis.},

Habitat loss and environmental change are known to threaten many plant and animal species, but the effects of population declines on the potential for seed dispersal are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, Mendes et al . synthesized data on plant-animal seed dispersal interactions for the whole of Europe and characterized each species interaction as being of low, high, or very high concern based on the species’ conservation statuses and population trajectories. Almost one-third of all species interactions were found to be of high or very high concern, potentially further threatening plant species’ persistence. However, data gaps are substantial, and this finding requires further study and evaluation. —Bianca Lopez Seed dispersal is crucial for ecosystem persistence, especially in fragmented landscapes, such as those common in Europe. Ongoing defaunation might compromise effective seed dispersal, but the conservation status of pairwise interactions remains unknown. With a literature review, we reconstructed the first European-wide seed dispersal network and evaluated the conservation status of interactions by assessing each interacting partner’s IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) conservation status and population trends. We found that a third of the disperser species and interactions face potential extinction and that 30% of the plant species have most of their dispersers threatened or declining. Our study reveals a developing seed dispersal crisis in Europe and highlights large knowledge gaps regarding the dispersers and conservation status of zoochorous plants, urging further scrutiny and action to conserve the seed dispersal service.},

We reveal the emergence of in-plane topological vortices within the periodic moiré patterns for both commensurate structures at small twist angles and the incommensurate quasicrystal structure that occurs at a 30° twist. The large-angle twist leads to mosaic chiral vortex patterns with tunable characteristics. A twisted quasicrystal bilayer, characterized by its 12-fold rotational symmetry, hosts complex vortex patterns and can be manipulated by picometer-scale interlayer displacement.

  abstract     = {Many studies have documented plant species moving toward the poles or to higher elevations as the climate warms. Other global changes, such as nitrogen deposition, may also drive species to shift their geographic ranges, but these are less commonly observed. Sanczuk et al . used data from nearly 3000 resampled European temperate forest vegetation plots to determine how understory plant species have shifted their ranges over multiple decades of environmental change. Rather than moving north to track climate change, species more commonly shifted west or east. East-west shifts were correlated with nitrogen deposition, and species that experienced higher nitrogen deposition across their ranges showed more local extinctions and less establishment in new habitats. —Bianca Lopez Climate change is commonly assumed to induce species’ range shifts toward the poles. Yet, other environmental changes may affect the geographical distribution of species in unexpected ways. Here, we quantify multidecadal shifts in the distribution of European forest plants and link these shifts to key drivers of forest biodiversity change: climate change, atmospheric deposition (nitrogen and sulfur), and forest canopy dynamics. Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements. Biodiversity redistribution patterns appear complex and are more likely driven by the interplay among several environmental changes than due to the exclusive effects of climate change alone.},

Sahl et al . refined an optical approach called MINFLUX such that they could measure precise intramolecular distances in the 1- to 10-nanometer range and below 1 nanometer for molecules with a tilt. Using a polyproline ruler, the authors demonstrate resolution of fluorophores with known single-digit nanometer spacing. They applied this approach to inter- and intramacromolecular measurements of proteins labeled with photoactivatable dyes, including distances too short for current indirect methods. Imaging experiments demonstrated the potential of this technique to study protein-protein interactions in cells. —Michael A. Funk Optical investigations of nanometer distances between proteins, their subunits, or other biomolecules have been the exclusive prerogative of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy for decades. In this work, we show that MINFLUX fluorescence nanoscopy measures intramolecular distances down to 1 nanometer—and in planar projections down to 1 angstrom—directly, linearly, and with angstrom precision. Our method was validated by quantifying well-characterized 1- to 10-nanometer distances in polypeptides and proteins. Moreover, we visualized the orientations of immunoglobulin subunits, applied the method in human cells, and revealed specific configurations of a histidine kinase PAS domain dimer.

  abstract     = {Multiple strains of respiratory syncytial virus co-circulate, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strains tend to replace each other. To try to explain such heterogeneities, Park et al . developed a method to quantify immunological niches and fitness differences among competing pathogens in humans. This theory formalizes the phenomenon that during an epidemic, susceptible individuals become so rare that another strain cannot immediately invade. It takes time before a population of susceptible individuals emerges, which depends on a combination of the strength and duration of immunity engendered by that pathogen, as well as any transmission advantage an invading variant may have. Thus, weak immunity tends to allow the coexistence of circulating strains, and strong immunity leads to serial replacement. —Caroline Ash Observations of pathogen community structure provide evidence for both the coexistence and replacement of related strains. Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.},

Ng et al . now report a copper-catalyzed method to prenylate unsaturated ketones and thereby access PPAPs with high enantioselectivity.

Here, we present a scalable, regio-, site-, and enantioselective catalytic method for synthesis of cyclic β-prenyl ketones, compounds that can be used for efficient syntheses of many PPAPs in high enantiomeric purity. The transformation is prenyl conjugate addition to cyclic β-ketoesters promoted by a readily accessible chiral copper catalyst and involving an easy-to-prepare and isolable organoborate reagent. Reactions reach completion in just a few minutes at room temperature. The importance of this advance is highlighted by the enantioselective preparation of intermediates previously used to generate racemic PPAPs. We also present the enantioselective synthesis of nemorosonol (14 steps, 20% yield) and its one-step conversion to another PPAP, garcibracteatone (52% yield).},

  abstract     = {Foundation models (e.g., GPT-4 and Llama 3.1) are at the epicenter of artificial intelligence (AI), driving technological innovation and billions of dollars in investment. This has sparked widespread demands for regulation. Central to the debate about how to regulate foundation models is the process by which foundation models are released ( 1 )—whether they are made available only to the model developers, fully open to the public, or somewhere in between. Open foundation models can benefit society by promoting competition, accelerating innovation, and distributing power. However, an emerging concern is whether open foundation models pose distinct risks to society ( 2 ). In general, although most policy proposals and regulations do not mention open foundation models by name, they may have an uneven impact on open and closed foundation models. We illustrate tensions that surface—and that policy-makers should consider—regarding different policy proposals that may disproportionately damage the innovation ecosystem around open foundation models.},

Neurons accumulate hundreds to thousands of somatic mutations throughout development, with distinct mutational processes and rates occurring at various developmental stages ( 2 ). Whole-genome sequencing studies characterizing somatic mosaicism in early human brain development indicate that the mutation rate is relatively low during early pregastrulation (the first 2 weeks after fertilization) but increases substantially during late neurogenesis in the prenatal period (starting at 22 weeks of gestation), primarily owing to oxidative damage ( 3 ). On page 217 of this issue, Maury et al . ( 4 ) report that somatic mutations in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia occurred during neogenesis .

  abstract     = {Most drugs targeting kinases are designed to inhibit these enzymes, but there are certain situations in which it would be better to increase or retarget kinase activity instead. Sarott et al . designed a molecule to activate the transcription of key genes that are normally repressed in a particular human B cell lymphoma. In the cancer cells, transcription of these genes was inhibited by overactivity of the transcription factor BCL6 and its epigenetic co-repressors. The authors used a molecule linking an inhibitor of protein kinase CDK9 with a ligand of BCL6 to guide CDK9 and BCL6 into proximity at target genes. CDK9 was apparently released from the inhibitor complex sufficiently to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II and enhance transcriptional elongation. In a mouse model, this occurred with specificity for B cells responding abnormally to BCL6 without changing the overall activity of CDK9. Thus, repurposing protein kinase inhibitors to be part of such proximity inducers could have therapeutic potential. —L. Bryan Ray Kinases are critical regulators of cellular function that are commonly implicated in the mechanisms underlying disease. Most drugs that target kinases are molecules that inhibit their catalytic activity, but here we used chemically induced proximity to convert kinase inhibitors into activators of therapeutic genes. We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These molecules relocalized CDK9 to BCL6-bound DNA and directed phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. The resulting expression of pro-apoptotic, BCL6-target genes caused killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells and specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response. Genomics and proteomics corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism in which global kinase activity was not inhibited but rather redirected. Thus, kinase inhibitors can be used to context-specifically activate transcription.},

  abstract     = {After fertilization, mammalian embryos rapidly activate gene expression to specify the cell types that support implantation and form all of the tissues in the body. The factors preparing the cells in a mouse embryo to take on different lineages are not well understood. Festuccia et al . showed that the orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 performs successive roles in this process. First, NR5A2 participates in activating the embryonic genome. Then, in the eight-cell morula stage, NR5A2 performs its main role, coordinating the expression of factors responsible for specifying distinct lineages and genes ensuring housekeeping functions. This role is essential, and in the absence of NR5A2, development derails. —Di Jiang Early embryogenesis is driven by transcription factors (TFs) that first activate the zygotic genome and then specify the lineages constituting the blastocyst. Although the TFs specifying the blastocyst’s lineages are well characterized, those playing earlier roles remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of the TF Nr5a2 , we show that Nr5a2 −/− embryos arrest at the early morula stage and exhibit altered lineage specification, frequent mitotic failure, and substantial chromosome segregation defects. Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair. We conclude that NR5A2 coordinates proliferation, genome stability, and lineage specification to ensure correct morula development.},

  abstract     = {γδ T cells are a unique population of immune cells that can recognize and kill tumors. They comprise an evolutionarily conserved T cell lineage that holds promise for next-generation immunotherapies aimed at reaching more diverse patient groups, possibly with fewer adverse events. Combining innate-like traits such as enrichment within tissues and rapid responsiveness, γδ T cells have broader reactivities than the αβ T cell subset. Furthermore, because γδ cells are not restricted by an individual’s major histocompatibility complex molecules, “off-the-shelf” biobanks of well-characterized therapeutic γδ cells have the capacity to be generated from healthy donors. Hayday et al . discuss current research efforts focused on how γδ cells naturally discriminate cancers from healthy tissues, explore the advantages of γδ T cell immunotherapy, and consider the progress and prospects of several γδ T cell–based clinical trials and applications. —Priscilla N. Kelly The premise of cancer immunotherapy is that cancers are specifically visible to an immune system tolerized to healthy self. The promise of cancer immunotherapy is that immune effector mechanisms and immunological memory can jointly eradicate cancers and inoperable metastases and de facto vaccinate against recurrence. For some patients with hitherto incurable diseases, including metastatic melanoma, this promise is being realized by game-changing immunotherapies based on αβ T cells. Today’s challenges are to bring benefit to greater numbers of patients of diverse ethnicities, target more cancer types, and achieve a cure while incurring fewer adverse events. In meeting those challenges, specific benefits may be offered by γδ T cells, which compose a second T cell lineage with distinct recognition capabilities and functional traits that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. γδ T cell–based clinical trials, including off-the-shelf adoptive cell therapy and agonist antibodies, are yielding promising results, although identifiable problems remain. In addressing those problems, we advocate that immunotherapies be guided by the distinctive biology of γδ T cells, as elucidated by ongoing research.},

  abstract     = {Humans have developed extensive agricultural relationships with many other species, including both plants and animals, but we are not the only species to do so. Ants are known to cultivate many lineages of fungus for their own consumption, a relationship that takes different forms. Schulz et al . characterized the coevolution between these groups, identifying several key transitions that have led to the complexity of their modern relationship, including its emergence after the end-Cretaceous extinction. —Sacha Vignieri Fungus-farming ants cultivate multiple lineages of fungi for food, but, because fungal cultivar relationships are largely unresolved, the history of fungus-ant coevolution remains poorly known. We designed probes targeting &gt;2000 gene regions to generate a dated evolutionary tree for 475 fungi and combined it with a similarly generated tree for 276 ants. We found that fungus-ant agriculture originated ~66 million years ago when the end-of-Cretaceous asteroid impact temporarily interrupted photosynthesis, causing global mass extinctions but favoring the proliferation of fungi. Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest–dwelling conspecifics. By revealing these and other major transitions in fungus-ant coevolution, our results clarify the historical processes that shaped a model system for nonhuman agriculture.},

  abstract     = {Chemists have recently introduced a flurry of editing methods to excise individual atoms from molecular frameworks and, in some cases, replace them with alternate functionality. Kim et al . further this trend by executing an O for N swap, specifically, replacing the O in furan rings with the N in a primary amine, thereby generating pyrroles (see the Perspective by Plachinski and Yoon). This method relies on photoredox catalysis to oxidize the furans and render them more susceptible to the amine addition, and it is applicable to a wide variety of pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds. —Jake S. Yeston The identity of a heteroatom within an aromatic ring influences the chemical properties of that heterocyclic compound. Systematically evaluating the effect of a single atom, however, poses synthetic challenges, primarily as a result of thermodynamic mismatches in atomic exchange processes. We present a photocatalytic strategy that swaps an oxygen atom of furan with a nitrogen group, directly converting the furan into a pyrrole analog in a single intermolecular reaction. High compatibility was observed with various furan derivatives and nitrogen nucleophiles commonly used in drug discovery, and the late-stage functionalization furnished otherwise difficult-to-access pyrroles from naturally occurring furans of high molecular complexity. Mechanistic analysis suggested that polarity inversion through single electron transfer initiates the redox-neutral atom exchange processes at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {The maximum size, growth rate, and lifespan of trees determines the rate of forest carbon accumulation. These life history traits are thought to be correlated, but studies have been limited to local scales in tropical systems. Bialic-Murphy et al . used data on tree size and status from over 1000 species across North, Central, and South America to show that these relationships are more complex. Unexpectedly, they found weak positive correlations between measures of size, lifespan, and growth rate. However, species clustered into four types: one fast-growing species and three groups of slow-growing species that varied from small and long-lived to large and short-lived. Species in cold regions tended to grow more slowly and live longer, but these traits were largely independent. —Bianca Lopez Tree growth and longevity trade-offs fundamentally shape the terrestrial carbon balance. Yet, we lack a unified understanding of how such trade-offs vary across the world’s forests. By mapping life history traits for a wide range of species across the Americas, we reveal considerable variation in life expectancies from 10 centimeters in diameter (ranging from 1.3 to 3195 years) and show that the pace of life for trees can be accurately classified into four demographic functional types. We found emergent patterns in the strength of trade-offs between growth and longevity across a temperature gradient. Furthermore, we show that the diversity of life history traits varies predictably across forest biomes, giving rise to a positive relationship between trait diversity and productivity. Our pan-latitudinal assessment provides new insights into the demographic mechanisms that govern the carbon turnover rate across forest biomes.},

  abstract     = {A single mutation may have very different effects on fitness depending on the genetic and environmental context. Understanding how this occurs more broadly has been historically difficult to study given the requisite high dimensionality of testing many variables. Ardell et al . looked at the effects of 99 mutations on growth rate across 42 yeast strains in six laboratory conditions. They found that no mutation was universally beneficial or deleterious across strains and environments, and the less fit the strain, the more likely any new mutation was to be beneficial. This study gives insight into the complicated dynamics of epistasis. —Corinne Simonti Predicting how new mutations alter phenotypes is difficult because mutational effects vary across genotypes and environments. Recently discovered global epistasis, in which the fitness effects of mutations scale with the fitness of the background genotype, can improve predictions, but how the environment modulates this scaling is unknown. We measured the fitness effects of ~100 insertion mutations in 42 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in six laboratory environments and found that the global epistasis scaling is nearly invariant across environments. Instead, the environment tunes one global parameter, the background fitness at which most mutations switch sign. As a consequence, the distribution of mutational effects is predictable across genotypes and environments. Our results suggest that the effective dimensionality of genotype-to-phenotype maps across environments is surprisingly low.},

  abstract     = {Weather conditions in one region can affect those in another, distant location through what is commonly called an atmospheric “teleconnection.” For example, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurring in the Pacific can influence conditions in the Atlantic through its effect on the extratropical jet stream. Scaife et al . now show that ENSO can have a delayed effect as well: The Arctic Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation have an opposite response delayed by 1 year. The authors explain this behavior as being the result of migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies. —Jesse Smith We demonstrate a 1-year lagged extratropical response to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in observational analyses and climate models. The response maps onto the Arctic Oscillation and is strongest in the North Atlantic, where it resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is opposite in sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Niño is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Niña is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response. Our results have implications for understanding ENSO teleconnections, explaining observed extratropical climate variability and interpreting seasonal to interannual climate predictions.},

  abstract     = {The Sun’s corona is its upper atmosphere, which contains low-density plasma and magnetic fields. Globally mapping the magnetic field in this region is difficult, so it has only been performed on a few limited occasions. Yang et al . demonstrate a method to regularly measure the coronal magnetic field, implementing it roughly every other day for a period of 8 months. The authors found variations in the magnetic field as the Sun rotates and as active regions (related to sunspots) emerge onto the surface. Comparison with model calculations showed that the observational method is more informative than models, especially in high-latitude regions and on small scales. —Keith T. Smith The magnetic field in the Sun’s corona stores energy that can be released to heat plasma and drive solar eruptions. Measurements of the global coronal magnetic field have been limited to several snapshots. In this work, we present observations, using the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter, that provide 114 magnetograms of the global corona above the solar limb spanning ~8 months. We determined the magnetic field distribution with altitude in the corona and monitored the evolution at different latitudes over multiple solar rotations. The field strength between 1.05 and 1.60 solar radii varies from &lt;1 to ~20 gauss. A signature of active longitudes appears in the coronal magnetic field measurements. Coronal models are generally consistent with our observations, though they have larger discrepancies in high-latitude regions.},

The vaccine was designed to target an enzyme found in diverse strains of this bacterium that processes several surface factors required for gut colonization and virulence. In animal models of infection, the vaccine induced robust, long-lived T cell, anti-toxin immunoglobulin G, and mucosal antibody responses to vegetative cells and spores of C. difficile , endowing full survival to mice without measurably disrupting the resident microbiota. —Caroline Ash Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an urgent public health threat with limited preventative options.

This multivalent vaccine elicited robust and long-lived systemic and mucosal antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across animal models, independent of changes to the intestinal microbiota. Vaccination protected mice from lethal CDI in both primary and recurrent infection models, and inclusion of non-toxin cellular and spore antigens improved decolonization of toxigenic C. difficile from the gastrointestinal tract.

Matthews et al . investigated how extinctions have affected global bird diversity, specifically in terms of birds’ traits and evolutionary history (see the Perspective by Kemp). About 5% of known bird species have gone extinct over the past 130,000 years, and these species are more distinct in terms of their traits and lineages then would be expected by chance, especially those that went extinct before 1500 CE. Species, functional, and phylogenetic diversity losses are greatest on islands. Projected future extinctions are predicted to cause even more severe effects on avian functional and phylogenetic diversity, emphasizing a need for conservation efforts, especially on islands. —Bianca Lopez Humans have been driving a global erosion of species richness for millennia, but the consequences of past extinctions for other dimensions of biodiversity—functional and phylogenetic diversity—are poorly understood. In this work, we show that, since the Late Pleistocene, the extinction of 610 bird species has caused a disproportionate loss of the global avian functional space along with ~3 billion years of unique evolutionary history. For island endemics, proportional losses have been even greater. Projected future extinctions of more than 1000 species over the next two centuries will incur further substantial reductions in functional and phylogenetic diversity.

Tian et al . used four-dimensional transmission electron microscopy to study the mechanism behind nanograin rotation in a platinum thin film. The authors identified a primary mechanism for rotation, along with a correlation between rotation and grain growth or shrinkage. These observations should help us better understand the mechanical properties of a wide range of materials. —Brent Grocholski Near-rigid-body grain rotation is commonly observed during grain growth, recrystallization, and plastic deformation in nanocrystalline materials. Despite decades of research, the dominant mechanisms underlying grain rotation remain enigmatic. We present direct evidence that grain rotation occurs through the motion of disconnections (line defects with step and dislocation character) along grain boundaries in platinum thin films. State-of-the-art in situ four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) observations reveal the statistical correlation between grain rotation and grain growth or shrinkage. This correlation arises from shear-coupled grain boundary migration, which occurs through the motion of disconnections, as demonstrated by in situ high-angle annular dark-field STEM observations and the atomistic simulation–aided analysis.

Lahdenperä et al . report a metal-free method to transform symmetrical diols selectively into one of two possible mirror-image isomers. Specifically, they used a photoredox dye to activate a chiral amine catalyst, which then abstracts a hydrogen atom preferentially from one of the two diol carbons. Unselective quenching from a thiol then funnels the product stream over the course of the reaction toward the desired product. —Jake S. Yeston Hydrogen atom abstraction is an important elementary chemical process but is very difficult to carry out enantioselectively. We have developed catalysts, readily derived from the Cinchona alkaloid family of natural products, which can achieve this by virtue of their chiral amine structure. The catalyst, following single-electron oxidation, desymmetrizes meso -diols by selectively abstracting a hydrogen atom from one carbon center, which then regains a hydrogen atom by abstraction from a thiol. This results in an enantioselective epimerization process, forming the chiral diastereomer with high enantiomeric excess. Cyclic and acyclic 1,2-diols are compatible, as are acyclic 1,3-diols. Additionally, we demonstrate the viability of combining our approach with carbon-carbon bond formation in Giese addition. Given the increasing number of synthetic methods involving hydrogen atom transfer steps, we anticipate that this work will have a broad impact in the field of enantioselective radical chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Tackling climate change and biodiversity loss will require government policies to reverse environmental destruction and align economic activity with sustainability goals. Subsidy-based policies feature prominently in current national and international policy discussions about ways to address these challenges. Given this, now is a critical moment to reassess the role of subsidies to ensure that not only their benefits but also their potential drawbacks are at the forefront of discussions about their use and design. We suggest that subsidies can play an important role in protecting people and the planet. However, because subsidies can have considerable drawbacks, we also suggest that subsidies should be used cautiously to ensure that they are, on net, beneficial to society and the planet in the short and long run. Avoiding “lock-in” is paramount and can be achieved through initial design features such as time limits to sunset subsidies.},

Evaluating single-atom analogs for new therapeutic potential thus often requires laborious independent syntheses of each target structure. On page 99 of this issue, Kim et al .

On page 55 of this issue, Matthews et al .

The results advance understanding of how human impacts have already eroded the functional capacities and evolutionary histories of ecosystems worldwide, foreshadow a continued era of biodiversity loss, and underscore the urgent need to quantify the ecological services provided by birds worldwide.},

  abstract     = {Sequence sorting, the mental manipulation of multiple items with different ordinal ranks in working memory, is essential for everyday activities such as planning, navigation, and speech. Although the prefrontal cortex has been proposed to be involved in these manipulations, the neural mechanisms of sequence sorting are unknown. Tian et al . recorded from thousands of neurons in the frontal cortex of two macaques while they performed a visuospatial sequence-sorting task. The monkeys used separate neural work subspaces to temporarily store and then manipulate information. These computations were multistepped and occurred both in serial and in parallel. This was possible because the neurons showed mixed selectivity and responded to multiple cue features. These findings are an important step in understanding the neural mechanisms of reasoning and planning. —Peter Stern How the brain mentally sorts a series of items in a specific order within working memory (WM) remains largely unknown. We investigated mental sorting using high-throughput electrophysiological recordings in the frontal cortex of macaque monkeys, who memorized and sorted spatial sequences in forward or backward orders according to visual cues. We discovered that items at each ordinal rank in WM were encoded in separate rank-WM subspaces and then, depending on cues, were maintained or reordered between the subspaces, accompanied by two extra temporary subspaces in two operation steps. Furthermore, the cue activity served as an indexical signal to trigger sorting processes. Thus, we propose a complete conceptual framework, where the neural landscape transitions in frontal neural states underlie the symbolic system for mental programming of sequence WM.},

  abstract     = {The cerebellum plays a major role in coordinating body movements, and damage to this area leads to impairments in fine movements, motor learning, and posture. Complete knowledge of the cerebellar architecture and its evolution is paramount for elucidating its organization and functions. Hao et al . performed spatial transcriptomics of the entire cerebellar cortex in two primates and one rodent species and produced a three-dimensional reconstruction of the cerebellar cytoarchitecture at single-cell resolution. They described similarities and differences between rodents and primates, providing valuable knowledge regarding cerebellar evolution. Moreover, the spatial expression was found to be correlated with intracerebellar functional connectivity. These results provide a solid foundation for our understanding of cerebellar function among species. —Mattia Maroso The molecular and cellular organization of the primate cerebellum remains poorly characterized. We obtained single-cell spatial transcriptomic atlases of macaque, marmoset, and mouse cerebella and identified primate-specific cell subtypes, including Purkinje cells and molecular-layer interneurons, that show different expression of the glutamate ionotropic receptor Delta type subunit 2 ( GRID2 ) gene. Distinct gene expression profiles were found in anterior, posterior, and vestibular regions in all species, whereas region-selective gene expression was predominantly observed in the granular layer of primates and in the Purkinje layer of mice. Gene expression gradients in the cerebellar cortex matched well with functional connectivity gradients revealed with awake functional magnetic resonance imaging, with more lobule-specific differences between primates and mice than between two primate species. These comprehensive atlases and comparative analyses provide the basis for understanding cerebellar evolution and function.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of control efforts, malaria still exacts a severe toll on vulnerable populations. A few years of respite brought on by a vaccine or drug is typically followed by disease resurgence as the parasite escapes repression until the next control measure arrives. Chahine et al . have been working on an isocyanoterpene natural product analog to add to the antimalarial drug pipeline. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, pull-down, and thermal shift experiments yielded results consistent with action against the apicoplast, a parasite organelle required for host cell invasion. Although a specific target has not yet been identified, the drug appears to inhibit lipid synthesis and trafficking. Resistance could be selected for by a mutation in part of the secretory machine. Overall, the candidate drug was safe in a humanized mouse model of malaria. —Caroline Ash We report the discovery of MED6-189, an analog of the kalihinol family of isocyanoterpene natural products that is effective against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains, blocking both asexual replication and sexual differentiation. In vivo studies using a humanized mouse model of malaria confirm strong efficacy of the compound in animals with no apparent hemolytic activity or toxicity. Complementary chemical, molecular, and genomics analyses revealed that MED6-189 targets the parasite apicoplast and acts by inhibiting lipid biogenesis and cellular trafficking. Genetic analyses revealed that a mutation in PfSec13 , which encodes a component of the parasite secretory machinery, reduced susceptibility to the drug. Its high potency, excellent therapeutic profile, and distinctive mode of action make MED6-189 an excellent addition to the antimalarial drug pipeline.},

  abstract     = {The era of the microbiome has been opened by next-generation sequencing, and this tool has offered hints of multiple therapeutic targets for human diseases. However, it remains a challenge to pinpoint the cause of a clinical problem to any one species or consortium of microorganism. Using a screen to identify immunoglobulin A–degrading bacteria, Lu et al . have identified a previously unknown genus and species called Tomasiella immunophila (see the Perspective by Slack). This organism specifically stimulates self-recognizing kappa–light chain immunoglobulin secretion. Outer membrane vesicles from the organism containing a rich array of proteases degraded these host proteins. Thus, T. immunophila appears to be able to stimulate a supply of host origin nutrients for its own consumption while potentially immunocompromising the host sufficiently to cause disease while also selecting for resistant immunoglobulin subclasses. —Caroline Ash Harnessing the microbiome to benefit human health requires an initial step in determining the identity and function of causative microorganisms that affect specific host physiological functions. We show a functional screen of the bacterial microbiota from mice with low intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels; we identified a Gram-negative bacterium, proposed as Tomasiella immunophila , that induces and degrades IgA in the mouse intestine. Mice harboring T. immunophila are susceptible to infections and show poor mucosal repair. T. immunophila is auxotrophic for the bacterial cell wall amino sugar N-acetylmuramic acid. It delivers immunoglobulin-degrading proteases into outer membrane vesicles that preferentially degrade rodent antibodies with kappa but not lambda light chains. This work indicates a role for symbionts in immunodeficiency, which might be applicable to human disease.},

To mitigate the destruction wrought by this ocean plastic debris, various cleanup programs have been established, though to our knowledge the benefits of such efforts to marine species and ecosystems have not yet been empirically demonstrated. We examined more than 40 years of Hawaiian monk seal marine debris entanglement records before and after large-scale marine debris removal efforts were initiated in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, demonstrating a substantial reduction in entanglement rates where debris removal effort was most concentrated.

  abstract     = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause severe disease in the very young, the elderly, or the immunocompromised. Vaccines use the RSV fusion (F) protein as an immunogen, but the protein is flexible and locking it in its “prefusion” conformation allows the immune system to build a response that is most beneficial for neutralizing RSV infection. Liang et al . used computational approaches to identify localized flexible regions within the F protein that move during overall transformations in protein shape. Mutating amino acids within one of these regions helped keep the protein in the prefusion state. Combining these mutations with others that stabilize the F protein trimer generated a form of the protein that, when injected into mice or cotton rats in a formulation that included an adjuvant, elicited antibody responses and provided protection from disease. —Sarah H. Ross The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) glycoprotein is highly immunogenic in its prefusion (pre-F) conformation. However, the protein is unstable, and its conformation must be stabilized for it to function effectively as an immunogen in vaccines. We present a mutagenesis strategy to arrest the RSV F protein in its pre-F state by blocking localized changes in protein structure that accompany large-scale conformational rearrangements. We generated a series of mutants and screened them in vitro to assess their potential for forming a stable pre-F. In animals, the immunogenicity of a representative mutant F protein, with a conformation confirmed by cryo–electron microscopy, elicited levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against RSV-induced lung damage that were comparable to those of DS-Cav1, a pre-F used in a licensed vaccine.},

To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word “she,” to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves.

  abstract     = {Carboxylic acids represent a versatile and widely available feedstock for the preparation of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, their direct photochemical reactivity is underexploited, in part due to their absorption edge in the far ultraviolet. Peng et al . report that conversion of the acids to acyl phosphonates shifts the absorption to the near-ultraviolet/visible regime and also confers greater selectivity in the ensuing photochemistry. The authors demonstrate a variety of hydrogen atom transfer and cyclization sequences, as well as ring expansion and contraction. —Jake S. Yeston The excitation of carbonyl compounds by light to generate radical intermediates has historically been restricted to ketones and aldehydes; carboxylic acids have been overlooked because of high energy requirements and low quantum efficiency. A successful activation strategy would necessitate a bathochromic shift in the absorbance profile, an increase in triplet diradical lifetime, and ease of further functionalization. We present a single-flask transformation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphonates that can access synthetically useful triplet diradicals under visible light or near-ultraviolet irradiation. The use of phosphorus circumvents unproductive Norrish type I processes, promoting selectivity that enables hydrogen-atom transfer reactivity. Use of this strategy promotes the efficient scaffold remodeling of carboxylic acids through various annulation, contraction, and expansion manifolds.},

  abstract     = {Human heart rates vary depending on conditions such as stress, fever, and activity. Nevertheless, they remain within a narrow range, and an overly rapid heart rate is not tolerated because it does not leave enough time for the heart to fill with blood between contractions during diastole. However, some animals such as bats and shrews have heart rates that are more than 10 times higher than that of humans but cause no ill effects. Joyce et al . analyzed the gene sequences of cardiac troponin, a key protein involved in cardiac contraction, across a variety of species including humans and mice, as well as animals with much higher heart rates (see the Perspective by Landim-Vieira and Pinto). The authors identified a key mutation responsible for this biological difference and the way that it improves diastolic filling. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Mammalian cardiac troponin I (cTnI) contains a highly conserved amino-terminal extension harboring protein kinase A targets [serine-23 and -24 (Ser 23/24 )] that are phosphorylated during β-adrenergic stimulation to defend diastolic filling by means of an increased cardiomyocyte relaxation rate. In this work, we show that the Ser 23/24 -encoding exon 3 of TNNI3 was pseudoexonized multiple times in shrews and moles to mimic Ser 23/24 phosphorylation without adrenergic stimulation, facilitating the evolution of exceptionally high resting heart rates (~1000 beats per minute). We further reveal alternative exon 3 splicing in distantly related bat families and confirm that both cTnI splice variants are incorporated into cardiac myofibrils. Because exon 3 of human TNNI3 exhibits a relatively low splice strength score, our findings offer an evolutionarily informed strategy to excise this exon to improve diastolic function during heart failure.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between synaptic dynamics and sleep need is still unclear. In a mathematical model, Sawada et al . showed how enhanced synaptic strength can promote neuronal hyperpolarization and thus increase electroencephalography (EEG) delta power. Using a multielectrode recording system, the authors experimentally confirmed that strengthening synapses increased delta power. Applying a molecular tool for long-term potentiation (LTP) induction to prefrontal cortex excitatory neurons increased both the amount and EEG delta power of non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep even when daily sleep need was minimal. This tool caused an increase in spine size (structural LTP) within a physiological range. Such effects were absent in inhibitory or visual cortex neurons. Pharmacologically enhancing synaptic transmission or inhibiting long-term depression also increased both the amount and EEG delta power of NREM sleep. —Peter Stern Sleep is regulated by homeostatic processes, yet the biological basis of sleep pressure that accumulates during wakefulness, triggers sleep, and dissipates during sleep remains elusive. We explored a causal relationship between cellular synaptic strength and electroencephalography delta power indicating macro-level sleep pressure by developing a theoretical framework and a molecular tool to manipulate synaptic strength. The mathematical model predicted that increased synaptic strength promotes the neuronal “down state” and raises the delta power. Our molecular tool (synapse-targeted chemically induced translocation of Kalirin-7, SYNCit-K), which induces dendritic spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation through chemically induced translocation of protein Kalirin-7, demonstrated that synaptic potentiation of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) increases nonrapid eye movement sleep amounts and delta power. Thus, synaptic strength of PFC excitatory neurons dictates sleep pressure in mammals.},

  abstract     = {Trees and plants capture plenty of carbon dioxide as they grow, but most of it is released relatively quickly as foliage and wood decay. Zeng et al . explored entombing trees in clay, creating a wood vault that may prevent degradation for hundreds or even thousands of years (see the Perspective by Yao). Supporting this approach is the discovery of a tree buried in clay about 3800 years ago that the authors analyzed, showing that it has degraded very little over that time. This work suggests that it is possible to create environments that vault away biomass semipermanently. The cost of doing this appears to be lower than other methods of carbon sequestration such as direct air or ocean capture. —Brent Grocholski Six-times more carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is removed each year by terrestrial photosynthesis than fossil fuel emissions. However, the carbon is mostly returned to the atmosphere by decomposition. We found a 3775-year-old ancient wood log buried 2 meters belowground that was preserved far beyond its expected lifetime. The wood had near-perfect preservation, with carbon loss less than 5% compared to a modern sample. The lack of decay is likely due to the low permeability of the compact clay soil at the burial site. Our observation suggests a hybrid nature-engineering approach for carbon removal by burying woody biomass in similar anoxic environments. We estimate a global sequestration potential of up to 10 gigatonnes CO 2 per year with existing technology at a low cost of $30 to $100 per tonne after optimization.},

  abstract     = {The US Clean Water Act is a key environmental protection that has undergone many changes, most recently the Sackett v. EPA Supreme Court ruling of 2023, which required that federally protected wetlands have a “continuous surface connection” to federally protected waters. Gold used data on flooding frequency to assess the area of wetlands that would lose protections under varying interpretations of the Sackett v. EPA rulings (see the Policy Forum by Owen). Depending on whether wetlands must be flooded permanently, seasonally, or temporarily, between 19 and 91% of nontidal wetlands are predicted to lose protections. State-level protections can help, but these are largely absent in the Southeast and Great Plains states, where a large proportion of wetlands will lose their US Clean Water Act protected status. —Bianca Lopez In 2023, the US Supreme Court’s majority ruled in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency that only wetlands that are “indistinguishable” from federally protected waters “due to a continuous surface connection” are federally protected. This study estimates the potential impact of interpretations of the ruling on federal wetlands protections, using a qualitative measure of wetland “wetness” as a proxy for the new requirement. An estimated area ranging from ~17 million acres (19%) to nearly all 90 million acres of nontidal wetlands in the conterminous United States could be without federal protections, and variability in state protections creates hotspots of risk. The high-level estimates provided here represent a first step toward understanding the long-term impacts of Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency on federal wetlands protections and highlight the uncertainty introduced by the ruling.},

Yeston and Marc S. Lavine Lithium mining is energy intensive and environmentally costly. This is because lithium ions are typically present in brines as a minor component mixed with physiochemically similar cations that are difficult to separate. Inspired by nature’s ability to selectively extract species in transpiration, we report a solar transpiration–powered lithium extraction and storage (STLES) device that can extract and store lithium from brines using natural sunlight. Specifically, the device uses a hierarchically structured solar transpirational evaporator to create a pressure gradient, which allows for the extraction of lithium from brines through a membrane and its storage in a vascular storage layer. Long-term experiments, various membrane tests, and different size assessments demonstrate the stability, compatibility, and scalability of STLES. This solar-powered mining technology provides an alternative developing pathway toward the sustainable extraction of critical resources.},

Yeston and Marc S. Lavine The sustainability of lithium-based energy storage or conversion systems, e.g., lithium-ion batteries, can be enhanced by establishing methods of efficient lithium extraction from harsh brines. In this work, we describe a decoupled membrane-free electrochemical cell that cycles lithium ions between iron-phosphate electrodes and features cathode (brine) and anode (fresh water) compartments that are isolated from each other yet electrochemically connected through a pair of silver/silver-halide redox electrodes. This design is compatible with harsh brines having magnesium/lithium molar ratios of up to 3258 and lithium concentrations down to 0.15 millimolar, enabling the production of battery-grade (&gt;99.95% pure) lithium carbonate. Energy savings of up to ~21.5% were realized by efficiently harvesting the osmotic energy of the brines. A pilot-scale cell with an electrode surface area of 33.75 square meters was used to realize lithium extraction from Dead Sea brine with a recovery rate of 84.0%.},

Tremendous attention focuses on lithium, which is primarily sourced from either hard rock called spodumene or natural brines—solutions containing lithium and other salts found in continental deposits, for example. However, mining lithium often involves energy-intensive, laborious processes. On pages 1438 and 1444 of this issue, Li et al . ( 4 ) and Song et al .

  abstract     = {Cardiomyopathies, heart muscle disorders that cause the heart to lose its ability to pump blood effectively, can lead to more serious medical conditions, including irregular heartbeats and cardiac arrest. Sarcomeric proteins are one of the structural components of heart muscle and are essential for contraction and relaxation. These proteins have become an attractive target for new drugs to treat cardiomyopathies, including so-called myosin modulators that can enhance or attenuate heart muscle contraction ( 1 – 3 ). Despite this progress, therapeutic strategies that target the cardiac thin filament—which works in concert with myosin-based thick filaments in healthy heart muscle—have yet to reach clinical application. On page 1466 of this issue, Joyce et al . ( 4 ) point to a new approach to potentially enhance cardiac muscle relaxation, shifting from direct modulators to an evolutionary strategy focused on editing the TNNI3 gene, which encodes the thin-filament protein cardiac troponin I (cTnI).},

This target, established by the Paris Agreement, aims to avoid severe impacts of climate change by keeping the global average temperature increase within this limit ( 1 ). Achieving net-zero necessitates approaches that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, known as carbon dioxide removal (CDR) ( 2 ).

Allosteric modulator drugs that influence the calcium-sensing receptor’s activation or inactivation are used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease, but adverse effects related to hypocalcemia are a serious issue. Using computational docking, Liu et al . demonstrate the value of large library screens in identifying allosteric ligands for the calcium-sensing receptor. Optimization of several hits yielded leads with nanomolar efficacy, two of which were captured bound to the receptor in cryo–electron microscopy structures. Experiments in mice suggested that these leads may circumvent some of the negative effects of current drugs and expand their use. —Michael A. Funk Positive allosteric modulator (PAM) drugs enhance the activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Unfortunately, these hyperparathyroidism-treating drugs can induce hypocalcemia and arrhythmias. Seeking improved modulators, we docked libraries of 2.7 million and 1.2 billion molecules against the CaSR structure. The billion-molecule docking found PAMs with a 2.7-fold higher hit rate than the million-molecule library, with hits up to 37-fold more potent. Structure-based optimization led to nanomolar leads. In ex vivo organ assays, one of these PAMs was 100-fold more potent than the standard of care, cinacalcet, and reduced serum PTH levels in mice without the hypocalcemia typical of CaSR drugs. As determined from cryo–electron microscopy structures, the PAMs identified here promote CaSR conformations that more closely resemble the activated state than those induced by the established drugs.},

Judd et al . present a record of GMST over the past 485 million years that they constructed by combining proxy data with climate modeling (see the Perspective by Mills). They found that GMST varied over a range from 11° to 36°C, with an “apparent” climate sensitivity of ∼8°C, about two to three times what it is today. —Jesse Smith A long-term record of global mean surface temperature (GMST) provides critical insight into the dynamical limits of Earth’s climate and the complex feedbacks between temperature and the broader Earth system. Here, we present PhanDA, a reconstruction of GMST over the past 485 million years, generated by statistically integrating proxy data with climate model simulations. PhanDA exhibits a large range of GMST, spanning 11° to 36°C. Partitioning the reconstruction into climate states indicates that more time was spent in warmer rather than colder climates and reveals consistent latitudinal temperature gradients within each state. There is a strong correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and GMST, identifying CO 2 as the dominant control on variations in Phanerozoic global climate and suggesting an apparent Earth system sensitivity of ~8°C.},

This phase was found to be closely associated with antiferromagnetic spin correlations and to connect to the ground-state stripe phase calculated at zero temperature. —Jelena Stajic The relationship between the pseudogap and underlying ground-state phases has not yet been rigorously established. We investigated the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model at finite temperature using controlled diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations, allowing for the computation of spectral properties in the infinite-size limit and with arbitrary momentum resolution. We found three distinct regimes as a function of doping and interaction strength: a weakly correlated metal, a correlated metal with strong interaction effects, and a pseudogap regime at low doping. We show that the pseudogap forms both at weak coupling, when the magnetic correlation length is large, and at strong coupling, when it is shorter. As the temperature goes to zero, the pseudogap regime extrapolates precisely to the ordered stripe phase found by ground-state methods.},

Ham et al . identified patients with variants in the GNAI2 gene who exhibited susceptibility to infection, which is indicative of impaired immune responses, yet also had indications of inflammation and autoimmunity, which are associated with elevated immune cell activity. These contradictory phenotypes were resolved by determining that the protein encoded by GNAI2 , the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gα i2 , regulated multiple signaling pathways. In T cells, dysregulation of chemokine signaling by mutant Gα i2 decreased T cell migration, but an interaction between Gα i2 and the protein RASA2 augmented T cell receptor signaling. —Sarah H.

We investigated germline mutations in GNAI2 , which encodes G αi2 , a key component in heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction usually thought to regulate adenylyl cyclase–mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Patients with activating G αi2 mutations had clinical presentations that included impaired immunity. Mutant G αi2 impaired cell migration and augmented responses to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. We found that mutant G αi2 influenced TCR signaling by sequestering the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein RASA2, thereby promoting RAS activation and increasing downstream extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT S6 signaling to drive cellular growth and proliferation.},

  abstract     = {Kinetochores are macromolecular complexes built on centromeric DNA that drive chromosome segregation during cell division. Asai et al . constructed artificial kinetochore beads by tethering the outer kinetochore heterodimer NDC80-NUF2 to their surface, and showed that these beads align in the spindle equator as efficiently as chromosomes. The aligned beads established a biorientation-like state with stable bipolar microtubule attachment independently of inner kinetochore or centromere proteins or DNA. Larger beads aligned more efficiently, suggesting a size-dependent biorientation mechanism. The artificial kinetochore beads may provide a basis for the development of synthetic DNA segregation. —Di Jiang Faithful chromosome segregation requires biorientation, where the pair of kinetochores on the chromosome establish bipolar microtubule attachment. The integrity of the kinetochore, a macromolecular complex built on centromeric DNA, is required for biorientation, but components sufficient for biorientation remain unknown. Here, we show that tethering the outer kinetochore heterodimer NDC80-NUF2 to the surface of apolar microbeads establishes their biorientation-like state in mouse cells. NDC80-NUF2 microbeads align at the spindle equator and self-correct alignment errors. The alignment is associated with stable bipolar microtubule attachment and is independent of the outer kinetochore proteins SPC24-SPC25, KNL1, the Mis12 complex, inner kinetochore proteins, and Aurora. Larger microbeads align more rapidly, suggesting a size-dependent biorientation mechanism. This study demonstrates a biohybrid kinetochore design for synthetic biorientation of microscale particles in cells.},

  abstract     = {Greenland has been experiencing accelerating glacier mass loss in recent years. McPherson et al . have found that melting of the 79 North Glacier, which discharges into the ocean, has been slowed somewhat in recent years. Observations at the site of ice discharge show that from 2018 to 2021, water temperatures below the ice tongue cooled. The reduction in ocean heat transport was attributed to a slowdown in ocean circulation around the Nordic seas and a cooling of the Atlantic Intermediate Water. This slowdown was driven by European atmospheric blocking that brought in cold Arctic air through the Fram Strait. —Jesse Smith Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet has contributed to global sea-level rise over the past 20 years. Yet direct observations from the 79 North Glacier (79NG) calving front reveal decreasing Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW) temperatures below the ice tongue from 2018 to 2021, leading to reduced ocean heat transport. This is linked to a concurrent decrease in basal melt and thinning rates at the grounding line. The origin of this AIW cooling is traced to a slowdown of the large-scale ocean circulation in the Nordic Seas, driven by European atmospheric blocking that strengthens cold air advection from the central Arctic through the Fram Strait. Blocking has driven major ocean cooling events over the last 50 years and will remain crucial in affecting Northeast Greenland’s glaciers.},

  abstract     = {Click chemistry refers to a growing class of coupling reactions that proceed rapidly to high conversion under mild conditions while avoiding competing pathways and generating relatively little waste. The main drawback to this technique is that the strong driving force underlying these favorable properties tends to prevent reversibility. Zhao et al . report an oxidative coupling between amines and phenothiazines that manifests click-like efficiency at room temperature. However, the resulting sulfur-nitrogen bond can be reductively cleaved with similar efficiency by irradiation in the near-ultraviolet range. —Jake S. Yeston Click reactions, which are characterized by rapid, high-yielding, and highly selective coupling of two reaction partners, are powerful tools in synthesis but are rarely reversible. Innovative strategies that reverse such couplings in a precise and on-demand manner, enabling a click-clip sequence, would greatly expand the technique’s versatility. Herein, a click and clip reaction pair is demonstrated by manipulation of a sulfilimine linkage. Phenothiazines and amines are rapidly and quantitatively coupled through oxidative sulfilimine bond formation with N-bromosuccinimide, and the resulting sulfilimine bromides then undergo quantitative reversion to the phenothiazines and amines through photoreduction at 380 nanometers. This protocol enables fabrication of depolymerizable macromolecules and reversible modification of aminosaccharides, demonstrating high selectivity and efficiency for manipulating sulfilimine linkages in complex systems.},

  abstract     = {Dosage compensation of sex chromosomes can be mediated either by overexpressing genes in the heterogametic sex or by silencing one copy in the homogametic. These processes are complex but are usually mediated by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs); however, they are difficult to study because they are not often shared broadly across species. Tenorio et al . examined the green anole and found that genes on the X chromosome are overexpressed in males. This gene expression pattern appeared to be mediated by a lncRNA that they call MAYEX . This lncRNA may be shared beyond anoles to some other species of lizards, thus contributing to our understanding of dosage compensation across animals. —Corinne Simonti Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential regulatory elements of sex chromosomes that act to equalize gene expression levels between males and females. XIST , RSX , and roX2 regulate X chromosomes in placental mammals, marsupials, and Drosophila , respectively. Because the green anole ( Anolis carolinensis ) shows complete dosage compensation of its X chromosome, we tested whether a lncRNA was involved. We found an ancient lncRNA, MAYEX , that gained male-specific expression more than 89 million years ago. MAYEX evolved a notable association with the acetylated histone 4 lysine 16 (H4K16ac) epigenetic mark and the ability to loop its locus to the totality of the X chromosome to increase expression levels. MAYEX is the first lncRNA in reptiles linked to a dosage compensation mechanism that balances the expression of sex chromosomes.},

  abstract     = {Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) is a frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer. Targeting KRAS function is a high priority for cancer drug development, and in recent years, drugs that inhibit the KRAS glycine 12–to–cysteine (G12C) mutation have been developed. However, additional KRAS tumor mutations occur with high prevalence, and there are currently no drugs available to inhibit them. Popow et al . designed a strategy to target the remaining oncogenic KRAS mutations by developing drugs called bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders (see the Perspective by Cox and Der). Starting from noncovalent ligands for KRAS and the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), chemical optimization guided by co-crystal structures of KRAS:PROTAC:VHL ternary complexes led to a small molecule that selectively degraded 13 of 17 of the most common mutants. KRAS degradation was more efficacious than inhibition and induced tumor regression in experimental models. —Priscilla N. Kelly Mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) protein are highly prevalent in cancer. However, small-molecule concepts that address oncogenic KRAS alleles remain elusive beyond replacing glycine at position 12 with cysteine (G12C), which is clinically drugged through covalent inhibitors. Guided by biophysical and structural studies of ternary complexes, we designed a heterobifunctional small molecule that potently degrades 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles. Compared with inhibition, KRAS degradation results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines, killing cancer cells while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations. Pharmacological degradation of oncogenic KRAS was tolerated and led to tumor regression in vivo. Together, these findings unveil a new path toward addressing KRAS-driven cancers with small-molecule degraders.},

  abstract     = {The abundance of both natural and synthetic carboxylic acids has motivated multiple recent breakthroughs in decarboxylative methods for cross-coupling reactions. In other words, some combination of activating reagents and catalysts slice off carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), leaving behind the alkyl component to form a carbon-carbon bond with a coupling partner. However, these approaches rely on radical mechanisms that can be unselective. Huang et al . present an alternative, nonradical activating paradigm in which a nickel catalyst cleaves the carbon-oxygen bond of an ester and then excises carbon monoxide (CO) rather than CO 2 . Subtle ligand optimization was key to favoring this pathway. —Jake S. Yeston The myriad nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions rely on the formation of an organonickel intermediate, but limitations in forming monoalkylnickel species have limited options for C(sp 3 ) cross-coupling. The formation of monoalkylnickel(II) species from abundant carboxylic acid esters would be valuable, but carboxylic acid derivatives are primarily decarboxylated to form alkyl radicals that lack the correct reactivity. In this work, we disclose a facile oxidative addition and decarbonylation sequence that forms monoalkylnickel(II) intermediates through a nonradical process. The key ligand, bis(4-methylpyrazole)pyridine, accelerates decarbonylation, stabilizes the alkylnickel(II) intermediate, and destabilizes off-cycle nickel(0) carbonyl species. The utility of this new reactivity in C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ) bond formation is demonstrated in a reaction that is challenging by purely radical methods—the selective cross-coupling of primary carboxylic acid esters with primary alkyl iodides.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement and the teleportation of a quantum state across the processor are key ingredients in quantum computing. The fragility of the quantum states, however, requires error correction codes to ensure their faithful processing. Using a trapped-ion platform consisting of up to 30 trapped ions, the Quantinuum H2 quantum processor, Ryan-Anderson et al . demonstrate the fault-tolerant teleportation of quantum states. The implemented error-correcting color code effectively stabilizes the qubits, allowing quantum teleportation to be carried out in a fault-tolerant manner. The results are promising for trapped-ion–based quantum computing platforms. —Ian S. Osborne Quantum state teleportation is commonly used in designs for large-scale quantum computers. Using Quantinuum’s H2 trapped-ion quantum processor, we demonstrate fault-tolerant state teleportation circuits for a quantum error correction code—specifically the Steane code. The circuits use up to 30 qubits at the physical level and employ real-time quantum error correction. We conducted experiments on several variations of logical teleportation circuits using both transversal gates and lattice surgery. We measured the logical process fidelity to be 0.975 ± 0.002 for the transversal teleportation implementation and 0.851 ± 0.009 for the lattice surgery teleportation implementation as well as 0.989 ± 0.002 for an implementation of Knill-style quantum error correction.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational wave detectors use kilometers-long interferometers to measure tiny expansions and contractions of spacetime. The precision of those measurements is limited due to quantum mechanics. Theoretically, that quantum limit could be surpassed by using squeezed states of light, and a suitable filter cavity could extend the advantage over a wide frequency range (see the Perspective by Aso). Jia et al . measured the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) after it was upgraded with a squeezed light and filter cavity system. The authors demonstrate that the upgrades improved the sensitivity of the detector over a wide range of frequencies. Over a smaller range, it surpassed the quantum limit. —Keith T. Smith The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision, giving rise to an apparent limitation known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Gravitational-wave detectors use photons to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors and so are affected by the SQL. We investigated the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) after the experimental realization of frequency-dependent squeezing designed to surpass the SQL. For the LIGO Livingston detector, we found that the upgrade reduces quantum noise below the SQL by a maximum of three decibels between 35 and 75 hertz while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, increasing the overall detector sensitivity during astrophysical observations.},

Recent research has demonstrated that rats are a highly cooperative species and are motivated by others’ distress to prosocial actions, such as opening a door or pulling a chain to release trapped conspecifics. Studies of rat affect, cognition, and neural function provide compelling evidence that rats have some capacity to represent others’ needs, to instrumentally act to improve their well-being, and are thus capable of forms of targeted helping.

  abstract     = {The brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) occupies nearly every terrestrial habitat with a human presence and is one of our most important model organisms. Despite this prevalence, gaps remain in understanding the evolution of brown rat commensalism, their global dispersal, and mechanisms underlying contemporary adaptations to diverse environments. In this Review, we explore recent advances in the evolutionary history of brown rats and discuss key challenges, including finding and accurately dating historical specimens, disentangling histories of multiple domestication events, and synthesizing functional variation in wild rat populations with the development of laboratory strains. Advances in zooarchaeology and population genomics will usher in a new golden age of research on the evolutionary biology of brown rats, with positive feedbacks on their use as biomedical models.},

Indeed, kilometer-scale detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), have provided insights into energetic astronomical events, including the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. It is remarkable that the sensitivity of such large detectors is limited by quantum-mechanical fluctuations, which usually become relevant only in microscopic systems like atoms. On page 1318 of this issue, Jia et al. ( 1 ) report that an upgrade to LIGO reduces quantum noise across a wide range of frequencies. This improved sensitivity should extend the reach of GW observatories and invigorate the broader quest to understand the quantum underpinnings of the Universe.},

Once considered “undruggable,” KRAS is now the target of two approved drugs, sotorasib and adagrasib ( 1 , 2 ), that block activity of one specific mutant, KRAS G12C (glycine at position 12 is replaced by cysteine). The discovery of a previously unknown yet druggable pocket in KRAS ( 3 ) made development of these drugs possible and stimulated efforts to generate additional inhibitors of KRAS mutants that are more prevalent in cancer. On page 1138 of this issue, Popow et al. ( 4 ) describe the design of a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that degrades multiple KRAS mutants. This single molecule degrades and inactivates 13 of the 17 most common KRAS mutants—including the most prevalent one in cancer, KRAS G12D (D, aspartate)—and may help to determine whether it is better therapeutically to inhibit or degrade KRAS.},

Consequently, caring about mice and rats—relative to more charismatic species, such as cats or dogs—is less commonly a focus of public concern. Yet, in discussions around rodents in research, questions of care are prominent. This prompts the question, who cares about rodents in research? To answer this, we draw on recent research from across the humanities and social sciences that seeks to better understand the social aspects of laboratory animal science and welfare. Care comes in and out of focus in complicated ways. We unpack some of these below, first introducing the background and relevance of work in the humanities and social sciences to laboratory animal research, followed by an exploration of how care operates in policy, in practice, and in relation to different publics.},

  abstract     = {Breaking down plastic into its original building blocks is an ideal recycling strategy in principle. Unfortunately, in practice, this approach isn’t possible for the two most common plastics currently in use, polyethylene and polypropylene, because the reaction is too energetically unfavorable. Very recently, several groups of researchers showed that introducing fresh ethylene with the right catalyst can transform polyolefins into propylene, but the precious metals used for the catalysis are prohibitively expensive. Conk et al . now report that the process works using a more Earth-abundant combination of tungsten oxide and sodium. —Jake S. Yeston The selective conversion of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and mixtures of these two polymers to form products with high volume demand is urgently needed because current methods suffer from low selectivity, produce large quantities of greenhouse gases, or rely on expensive, single-use catalysts. The isomerizing ethenolysis of unsaturated polyolefins could be an energetically and environmentally viable route to propylene and isobutylene; however, noble-metal homogeneous catalysts and an unsaturated polyolefin are currently required and the process has been limited to PE. We show that the simple combination of tungsten oxide on silica and sodium on gamma-alumina transforms PE, PP, or a mixture of the two, including postconsumer forms of these materials, to propylene or a mixture of propylene and isobutylene in greater than 90% yield at 320°C without the need for dehydrogenation of the starting polyolefins.},

  abstract     = {Beliefs in conspiracies that a US election was stolen incited an attempted insurrection on 6 January 2021. Another conspiracy alleging that Germany’s COVID-19 restrictions were motivated by nefarious intentions sparked violent protests at Berlin’s Reichstag parliament building in August 2020. Amid growing threats to democracy, Costello et al . investigated whether dialogs with a generative artificial intelligence (AI) interface could convince people to abandon their conspiratorial beliefs (see the Perspective by Bago and Bonnefon). Human participants described a conspiracy theory that they subscribed to, and the AI then engaged in persuasive arguments with them that refuted their beliefs with evidence. The AI chatbot’s ability to sustain tailored counterarguments and personalized in-depth conversations reduced their beliefs in conspiracies for months, challenging research suggesting that such beliefs are impervious to change. This intervention illustrates how deploying AI may mitigate conflicts and serve society. —Ekeoma Uzogara Conspiracy theory beliefs are notoriously persistent. Influential hypotheses propose that they fulfill important psychological needs, thus resisting counterevidence. Yet previous failures in correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and tailored. To evaluate this possibility, we leveraged developments in generative artificial intelligence and engaged 2190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based dialogues with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced conspiracy belief by ~20%. The effect remained 2 months later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories, and occurred even among participants with deeply entrenched beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated conspiracies and shifted conspiracy-related behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence.},

  abstract     = {The most widely known application of ultrasound is for diagnosis, such as in prenatal care, but that is far from the only possible use for this versatile technology. An important feature of ultrasound is that it can be focused for precise application of mechanical waves to a small volume of carefully selected tissue. Depending on the specifics of the tissue and how the ultrasound is delivered, such an approach can generate heat and/or mechanical effects at the site. O’Reilly reviewed recent advances in the clinical applications of focused ultrasound for purposes as varied as drug delivery, immune activation, neuromodulation, and others. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Focused ultrasound is a platform technology capable of eliciting a wide range of biological responses with high spatial precision deep within the body. Although focused ultrasound is already in clinical use for focal thermal ablation of tissue, there has been a recent growth in development and translation of ultrasound-mediated nonthermal therapies. These approaches exploit the physical forces of ultrasound to produce a range of biological responses dependent on exposure conditions. This review discusses recent advances in four application areas that have seen particular growth and have immense clinical potential: brain drug delivery, neuromodulation, focal tissue destruction, and endogenous immune system activation. Owing to the maturation of transcranial ultrasound technology, the brain is a major target organ; however, clinical indications outside the brain are also discussed.},

The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al . used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality.},

Some RBPs, such as TRA2β, amplify their own protein abundance by removing, or skipping, ultraconserved poison exon (PE) elements from their gene transcripts. Karginov et al . found that high-affinity ligands for the T cell receptor (TCR) stimulated PE skipping in the TRA2β transcript in CD8 T cells. TRA2β protein bound to mRNAs encoding proteins involved in TCR signaling and was implicated in splicing events that augmented T cell effector function. Enforcing PE skipping in TRA2β promoted the initial activation of naïve T cells to form effector cells and enhanced responses to low-affinity antigen. Reinclusion of the PE was correlated with termination of the immune response. —Sarah H. Ross T cell receptor (TCR) sensitivity to peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) dictates T cell fate. Canonical models of TCR sensitivity cannot be fully explained by transcriptional regulation. In this work, we identify a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of TCR sensitivity that guides alternative splicing of TCR signaling transcripts through an evolutionarily ultraconserved poison exon (PE) in the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TRA2β in mouse and human. TRA2 β - PE splicing, seen during cancer and infection, was required for TCR-induced effector T cell expansion and function. Tra2 β-PE skipping enhanced T cell response to antigen by increasing TCR sensitivity. As antigen levels decreased, Tra2 β-PE reinclusion allowed T cell survival. Finally, we found that TRA2 β-PE was first included in the genome of jawed vertebrates that were capable of TCR gene rearrangements. We propose that TRA2 β - PE splicing acts as a gatekeeper of TCR sensitivity to shape T cell fate.},

  abstract     = {Carbon export into the ocean is vital to understand because of its role in mediating climate change. Much carbon export in this environment is driven by microbial activity, but little is known about how lipids contribute to the carbon pump. Behrendt et al . investigated the biotic degradation of lipids in the oceans by following the degradation of lipid droplets isolated from the marine alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown in nitrogen-limited media with a range of combinations of marine bacteria (see the Perspective by Schubotz). The authors found that the occurrence of suites of genes in organisms, rather than any specific bacterial taxon, drove the dynamics of lipid degradation. They were able to observe this process by measuring autofluorescence. Using the experimental data, a mathematical model was developed to explore how microbial consumption controls the attenuation of vertical lipid flux with depth in the ocean. —Caroline Ash Lipids comprise a significant fraction of sinking organic matter in the ocean and play a crucial role in the carbon cycle. Despite this, our understanding of the processes that control lipid degradation is limited. We combined nanolipidomics and imaging to study the bacterial degradation of diverse algal lipid droplets and found that bacteria isolated from marine particles exhibited distinct dietary preferences, ranging from selective to promiscuous degraders. Dietary preference was associated with a distinct set of lipid degradation genes rather than with taxonomic origin. Using synthetic communities composed of isolates with distinct dietary preferences, we showed that lipid degradation is modulated by microbial interactions. A particle export model incorporating these dynamics indicates that metabolic specialization and community dynamics may influence lipid transport efficiency in the ocean’s mesopelagic zone.},

To reduce emissions, some governments have banned food waste disposal in landfills. Anglou et al . evaluated the effectiveness of bans that applied to commercial waste producers in five US states. They found that such policies can succeed, but this has not been the norm. The states with bans showed almost no change in organic waste disposal into landfills compared with controls derived from states without bans. The exception to this was the state of Massachusetts. Simplicity of regulation, sufficient infrastructure, low cost of compliance, and/or strong enforcement may have contributed to Massachusetts’ success. —Bianca Lopez Diverting food waste from landfills is crucial to reduce emissions and meet Paris Agreement targets. Between 2014 and 2024, nine US states banned commercial waste generators—such as grocery chains—from landfilling food waste, expecting a 10 to 15% waste reduction. However, no evaluation of these bans exists. We compile a comprehensive waste dataset covering 36 US states between 1996 and 2019 to evaluate the first five implemented state-level bans. Contrary to policy-makers’ expectations, we can reject aggregate waste reductions higher than 3.2%, and we cannot reject a zero-null aggregate effect. Moreover, we cannot reject a zero-null effect for any other state except Massachusetts, which gradually achieved a 13.2% reduction. Our findings reveal the need to reassess food waste bans using Massachusetts as a benchmark for success.},

Wan et al . used a series of experimental surface characterization methods and theoretical calculations on representative high-nickel-content cathodes to investigate the mechanism by which nickel at the surface is reduced compared with the bulk. They observed that the self-discharge was caused by the insertion of protons into the charged cathode, which was triggered by the decomposition of the electrolyte. This mechanism, based on a surface hydrogenation reaction, differs from the widely accepted model that is based on lithium diffusion from the electrolyte into the cathode. —Marc S. Lavine Self-discharge and chemically induced mechanical effects degrade calendar and cycle life in intercalation-based electrochromic and electrochemical energy storage devices. In rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, self-discharge in cathodes causes voltage and capacity loss over time. The prevailing self-discharge model centers on the diffusion of lithium ions from the electrolyte into the cathode. We demonstrate an alternative pathway, where hydrogenation of layered transition metal oxide cathodes induces self-discharge through hydrogen transfer from carbonate solvents to delithiated oxides. In self-discharged cathodes, we further observe opposing proton and lithium ion concentration gradients, which contribute to chemical and structural heterogeneities within delithiated cathodes, accelerating degradation.

Volatiles produced by pine seedlings in response to underground feeding by weevils and their resulting SOAs induced responses in neighboring seedlings, including heightened defenses, less herbivore damage, and higher photosynthesis. The relevance of SOAs for plant-plant interactions has thus been underestimated. —Bianca Lopez Biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) can be formed from the oxidation of plant volatiles in the atmosphere. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can elicit plant defenses, but whether such ecological functions persist after they form SOAs was previously unknown. Here we show that Scots pine seedlings damaged by large pine weevils feeding on their roots release HIPVs that trigger defenses in neighboring conspecific plants. The biological activity persisted after HIPVs had been oxidized to form SOAs, which was indicated by receivers displaying enhanced photosynthesis, primed volatile defenses, and reduced weevil damage.

Salicylic acid (SA) is known to be required for SAR, but the mobile signal and the mechanism by which SA is produced in distal parts of a plant in response to a local infection have remained elusive. Cao et al . found that the mobile signal is hydrogen peroxide produced by NADPH oxidase. In a concentration-dependent manner, the peroxide is sufficient to oxidize a cysteine residue in the transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE). Sulfenylation of CHE allows the transcription factor to bind to the promoter of the SA-biosynthesis gene. CHE mutants lacking the cysteine are compromised in SAR. —Ankit Walia In plants, a local infection can lead to systemic acquired resistance (SAR) through increased production of salicylic acid (SA). For many years, the identity of the mobile signal and its direct transduction mechanism for systemic SA synthesis in initiating SAR have been debated. We found that in Arabidopsis thaliana , after a local infection, the conserved cysteine residue of the transcription factor CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) undergoes sulfenylation in systemic tissues, which enhances its binding to the promoter of the SA-synthesis gene ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 ( ICS1 ) and increases SA production. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced through NADPH oxidases is the mobile signal that sulfenylates CHE in a concentration-dependent manner. Accumulation of SA and the previously reported signal molecules, such as N -hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP), then form a signal amplification loop to establish SAR.},

  abstract     = {Although stacking electronic components makes it possible to shrink devices, two problems that arise are the heat accumulation and the need to prevent electromagnetic cross talk. Typically, materials that show better electromagnetic interference shielding have worse thermal properties and vice versa. Zhou et al . developed a composite using liquid metal particles embedded in a silicone polymer matrix. The advantage of using the liquid metal is that it forms larger, phase-separated particles but without forming a percolating network that would reduce the shielding efficiency. The composite material can be used as a direct potting compound and can thus be placed in tight spaces and crevices, unlike typically used rigid shielding materials. —Marc S. Lavine Traditional electromagnetic interference–shielding materials are predominantly electrically conductive, posing short-circuit risks when applied in highly integrated electronics. To overcome this dilemma, we propose a microcapacitor-structure model comprising conductive fillers as polar plates and intermediate polymer as a dielectric layer to develop insulating electromagnetic interference–shielding polymer composites. The electron oscillation in plates and dipole polarization in dielectric layers contribute to the reflection and absorption of electromagnetic waves. Guided by this, the synergistic nonpercolation densification and dielectric enhancement enable our composite to combine high resistivity, shielding performance, and thermal conductivity. Its insulating feature allows for direct potting into the crevices among assembled components to address electromagnetic compatibility and heat-accumulation issues.},

  abstract     = {A large rockslide occurred in Greenland on 16 September 2023 that generated a local tsunami. The event was energetic enough to generate a global signal that resonated for 9 days. Svennevig et al . used a range of geophysical tools to detail the sequence of events that occurred and then determined the origin of the global signal. The authors found that the signal was generated by standing waves in the Dickson fjord due to the rockslide. Climate change drives feedback among the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and mass wasting events, and signals such as the one the authors observed may provide a different way of understanding these interactions. —Brent Grocholski Climate change is increasingly predisposing polar regions to large landslides. Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in Greenland ( Kalaallit Nunaat ), but none have been reported from the eastern fjords. In September 2023, we detected the start of a 9-day-long, global 10.88-millihertz (92-second) monochromatic very-long-period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. In this study, we demonstrate how this event started with a glacial thinning–induced rock-ice avalanche of 25 × 10 6 cubic meters plunging into Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 7-meter-high long-duration seiche with a frequency (11.45 millihertz) and slow amplitude decay that were nearly identical to the seismic signal. An oscillating, fjord-transverse single force with a maximum amplitude of 5 × 10 11 newtons reproduced the seismic amplitudes and their radiation pattern relative to the fjord, demonstrating how a seiche directly caused the 9-day-long seismic signal. Our findings highlight how climate change is causing cascading, hazardous feedbacks between the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.},

  abstract     = {Only a few of the many volcanism-driven hyperthermals during the Phanerozoic caused mass extinctions, and none of them approached the level of global species loss seen at the end of the Permian. Why was the end-Permian so different? Sun et al . found that a combination of extreme El Niño events and mean state warming led to deforestation, reef demise, and a plankton crisis, all of which resulted in a positive feedback cycle that led to an even warmer mean climate and still stronger El Niño events. —Jesse Smith The ultimate driver of the end-Permian mass extinction is a topic of much debate. Here, we used a multiproxy and paleoclimate modeling approach to establish a unifying theory elucidating the heightened susceptibility of the Pangean world to the prolonged and intensified El Niño events leading to an extinction state. As atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide doubled from about 410 to about 860 ppm (parts per million) in the latest Permian, the meridional overturning circulation collapsed, the Hadley cell contracted, and El Niños intensified. The resultant deforestation, reef demise, and plankton crisis marked the start of a cascading environmental disaster. Reduced carbon sequestration initiated positive feedback, producing a warmer hothouse and, consequently, stronger El Niños. The compounding effects of elevated climate variability and mean state warming led to catastrophic but diachronous terrestrial and marine losses.},

  abstract     = {As reaction partners form a chemical bond, they often engage in a short-lived, weak interaction before forging the stronger linkage. Liu and Gabbaï report an unusual compound in which steric and electronic constraints stabilize both the weak and strong bonding motifs in equilibrium (see the Perspective by Jupp). The bonds in question bridge carbon and phosphorus centers with an oxygen. Two distinct isomers could be crystallized, bearing, respectively C···O=P and C–O–P geometries, the former with a stronger O–P interaction at the expense of the C–O bond. —Jake S. Yeston The entrance channel of bimolecular reactions sometimes involves the formation of outer complexes as weakly bound, fleeting intermediates. Here, we characterize such an outer complex in a system that models the bimolecular, C-O bond–forming reaction of a phosphine oxide Lewis base with a carbenium Lewis acid. Crystallographic studies show that the C-O distance in the outer form exceeds that of the final or inner adduct by 1.1 angstroms. As the system samples the two forms of the complex, which correspond to minima on the corresponding potential energy surface, the C-O linkage switches from a secondary interaction in the outer complex to a dative bond in the inner complex. This phenomenon is harnessed as a functional feature to stabilize xanthylium-based photoredox catalysts.},

Curbing these negative effects of agriculture while feeding a growing global population is already a massive challenge and one that will likely be exacerbated by climate change. Yang et al . reviewed the research on interactions between climate change and agriculture’s environmental impacts and found that most of this work suggests even greater challenges to come. —Bianca Lopez Agriculture’s global environmental impacts are widely expected to continue expanding, driven by population and economic growth and dietary changes. This Review highlights climate change as an additional amplifier of agriculture’s environmental impacts, by reducing agricultural productivity, reducing the efficacy of agrochemicals, increasing soil erosion, accelerating the growth and expanding the range of crop diseases and pests, and increasing land clearing. We identify multiple pathways through which climate change intensifies agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, creating a potentially powerful climate change–reinforcing feedback loop. The challenges raised by climate change underscore the urgent need to transition to sustainable, climate-resilient agricultural systems. This requires investments that both accelerate adoption of proven solutions that provide multiple benefits, and that discover and scale new beneficial processes and food products.},

Ou et al . addressed this problem through an approach that at first may seem counterintuitive: the introduction of highly absorbing molecules (see the Perspective by Rowlands and Gorecki). The authors show that the addition of common dye molecules that absorb in the near ultraviolet and blue regions improve optical transparency in nearby longer wavelengths. In essence, by causing sharp absorption in the blue region, the refractive index in the red part of the spectrum is increased without increasing absorption. The addition of tartrazine was able to make the skin of a live rodent temporarily transparent. —Marc S. Lavine Optical imaging plays a central role in biology and medicine but is hindered by light scattering in live tissue. We report the counterintuitive observation that strongly absorbing molecules can achieve optical transparency in live animals. We explored the physics behind this observation and found that when strongly absorbing molecules dissolve in water, they can modify the refractive index of the aqueous medium through the Kramers-Kronig relations to match that of high-index tissue components such as lipids. We have demonstrated that our straightforward approach can reversibly render a live mouse body transparent to allow visualization of a wide range of deep-seated structures and activities.

  abstract     = {Cancer is caused by mutations in DNA that often accompany profound changes to the nucleoprotein structure of the genome (the epigenome) that governs gene expression. Sundaram et al . mapped active regions of regulatory DNA from single cells in diverse human cancer types. Their analysis revealed distinct patterns of open chromatin in different types and genetic subclones of cancer and immune cells in tumors. The data further provide insight into the regulatory phenotypes of breast cancer subtypes and enable the training of cancer-specific neural network models that can interpret the impact of noncoding mutations on the open chromatin landscape. The deep learning models suggest that inherited or cancer-specific mutations can affect important gene-regulatory elements adjacent to, and possibly regulating, key cancer-causing genes. —Priscilla N. Kelly To identify cancer-associated gene regulatory changes, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes across eight tumor types as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Tumor chromatin accessibility is strongly influenced by copy number alterations that can be used to identify subclones, yet underlying cis-regulatory landscapes retain cancer type–specific features. Using organ-matched healthy tissues, we identified the “nearest healthy” cell types in diverse cancers, demonstrating that the chromatin signature of basal-like–subtype breast cancer is most similar to secretory-type luminal epithelial cells. Neural network models trained to learn regulatory programs in cancer revealed enrichment of model-prioritized somatic noncoding mutations near cancer-associated genes, suggesting that dispersed, nonrecurrent, noncoding mutations in cancer are functional. Overall, these data and interpretable gene regulatory models for cancer and healthy tissue provide a framework for understanding cancer-specific gene regulation.},

For amputees, however, whose limb stumps are covered with nonvolar skin, damage can result from prosthetic use. Lee et al . compared the biological properties of volar and nonvolar fibroblasts to understand what drives their physical differences (see the Perspective by Watt). They also performed a human trial, obtaining volar and nonvolar fibroblasts from human volunteers, expanding them in culture, and injecting them into the subjects’ own nonvolar skin. Injection of volar fibroblasts promoted the development of volar-like features in the injected skin, suggesting that this may be a viable approach for preventing skin pressure–induced damage in nonvolar sites. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Skin identity is controlled by intrinsic features of the epidermis and dermis and their interactions. Modifying skin identity has clinical potential, such as the conversion of residual limb and stump (nonvolar) skin of amputees to pressure-responsive palmoplantar (volar) skin to enhance prosthesis use and minimize skin breakdown. Greater keratin 9 ( KRT9 ) expression, higher epidermal thickness, keratinocyte cytoplasmic size, collagen length, and elastin are markers of volar skin and likely contribute to volar skin resiliency. Given fibroblasts’ capacity to modify keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that volar fibroblasts influence these features. Bioprinted skin constructs confirmed the capacity of volar fibroblasts to induce volar keratinocyte features. A clinical trial of healthy volunteers demonstrated that injecting volar fibroblasts into nonvolar skin increased volar features that lasted up to 5 months, highlighting a potential cellular therapy.},

Because bats typically prey on agricultural insect pests, this decline can be treated as a natural experiment to quantify the costs associated with the loss of an important ecosystem service. Frank used quasi-experimental methods to investigate how insecticide use can compensate for the loss of natural pest control from bats by considering both the economic and health costs of insecticides (see the Policy Forum by Larsen et al .). County-level insecticide use and infant mortality due to internal causes both increased after the emergence of white-nose syndrome, whereas farms’ crop revenue decreased. This study provides an example of how biodiversity loss affects human well-being and presents observational methods for quantifying those costs. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity loss is accelerating, yet we know little about how these ecosystem disruptions affect human well-being. Ecologists have documented both the importance of bats as natural predators of insects as well as their population declines after the emergence of a wildlife disease, resulting in a potential decline in biological pest control. In this work, I study how species interactions can extend beyond an ecosystem and affect agriculture and human health. I find that farmers compensated for bat decline by increasing their insecticide use by 31.1%. The compensatory increase in insecticide use by farmers adversely affected health—human infant mortality increased by 7.9% in the counties that experienced bat die-offs. These findings provide empirical validation to previous theoretical predictions about how ecosystem disruptions can have meaningful social costs.},

  abstract     = {Memories are continually added against a background of earlier experiences accumulated across the lifespan. How does the brain balance contradictory memory functions, in particular, the switch between encoding robust memories and behavioral flexibility? Gava et al . designed a two-memory paradigm and used graph theory to investigate the activity patterns formed by large-scale combinations of coactive neurons in the mouse hippocampus. Food-context learning induced a population representation rigidity that prevented the acquisition of novel related memories. This effect was primarily mediated by a subpopulation of superficial sublayer CA1 pyramidal cells. Inhibiting these cells at the appropriate time points prevented the development of heightened network correlations and rescued the previously impaired acquisition of object-location learning in the same context. —Peter Stern New memories are integrated into prior knowledge of the world. But what if consecutive memories exert opposing demands on the host brain network? We report that acquiring a robust (food-context) memory constrains the mouse hippocampus within a population activity space of highly correlated spike trains that prevents subsequent computation of a flexible (object-location) memory. This densely correlated firing structure developed over repeated mnemonic experience, gradually coupling neurons in the superficial sublayer of the CA1 stratum pyramidale to whole-population activity. Applying hippocampal theta-driven closed-loop optogenetic suppression to mitigate this neuronal recruitment during (food-context) memory formation relaxed the topological constraint on hippocampal coactivity and restored subsequent flexible (object-location) memory. These findings uncover an organizational principle for the peer-to-peer coactivity structure of the hippocampal cell population to meet memory demands.},

Inspired by osmolytes found in hyperthermophiles, we developed α-aminoketone–linked covalent organic framework (COF) ionomers, interwoven with Nafion, to act as “breathable” proton conductors. This approach leverages synergistic hydrogen bonding to retain water, enhancing hydration and proton transport while reducing oxygen transport resistance. For commercial Pt/C, the MT PEMFCs achieved peak and rated power densities of 18.1 and 9.5 Watts per milligram of Pt at the cathode at 105°C fueled with H 2 and air, marking increases of 101 and 187%, respectively, compared with cells lacking the COF.},

To characterize cognitive skills, they deployed a feeding apparatus that coordinated individual bird identity with food reward, thus requiring each bird to memorize the particular door that rewarded them. Birds with better spatial memory, in this case, those that made fewer mistakes before going to their “own” door, lived longer, thus facilitating potential increased reproductive output and fitness. —Sacha Vignieri Cognitive abilities are hypothesized to affect survival and life span in nonhuman animals. However, most tests of this hypothesis have relied on interspecific comparisons of indirect measures of cognitive ability, such as brain size. We present direct evidence that individual variation in cognitive abilities is associated with differences in life span in a wild food caching bird. We measured the spatial cognitive abilities and tracked the life span of 227 mountain chickadees ( Poecile gambeli ) in their natural environment and found that individuals with better spatial learning and memory abilities involved in food caching lived longer. These results confirm that enhanced cognitive abilities can be associated with longer life in wild animals and that selection on cognitive abilities can lead to increased life span.},

  abstract     = {Long-lived plants and animals clearly regulate their physiology according to seasonal changes in day length to appropriately adjust their physiology. Jabbur et al . found that cyanobacteria can do the same even though individuals only live for a few hours, a time shorter than a single daily photoperiod. Exposure to short photoperiods characteristic of winter stimulated these cyanobacteria to adjust their membrane lipids and gene expression to accommodate cold conditions. These responses required a functional circadian clock. Thus, population-based sensing of photoperiod appears to have evolved early, perhaps as a refinement of stress pathways. —L. Bryan Ray Photoperiodic time measurement is the ability of plants and animals to measure differences in day versus night length (photoperiod) and use that information to anticipate critical seasonal transformations, such as annual temperature cycles. This timekeeping phenomenon triggers adaptive responses in higher organisms, such as gonadal stimulation, flowering, and hibernation. Unexpectedly, we observed this capability in cyanobacteria—unicellular prokaryotes with generation times as short as 5 to 6 hours. Cyanobacteria exposed to short, winter-like days developed enhanced resistance to cold mediated by desaturation of membrane lipids and differential programs of gene transcription, including stress response pathways. As in eukaryotes, this photoperiodic timekeeping required an intact circadian clockwork and developed over multiple cycles of photoperiod. Therefore, photoperiodic timekeeping evolved in much simpler organisms than previously appreciated and enabled genetic responses to stresses that recur seasonally.},

PLK-1 has intricate interactions with proteins at the centromere, first phosphorylating associated proteins and then itself binding to those sites, causing conformational changes that promote the recruitment of the histone H3–like protein CENP-A and its chaperone protein HJURP. These results help to explain how the protein complex at the centromere is deposited and regulated to form in a timely manner once each cell cycle. —L. Bryan Ray Accurate chromosome segregation requires the attachment of microtubules to centromeres, epigenetically defined by the enrichment of CENP-A nucleosomes. During DNA replication, CENP-A nucleosomes undergo dilution. To preserve centromere identity, correct amounts of CENP-A must be restored in a cell cycle–controlled manner orchestrated by the Mis18 complex (Mis18α-Mis18β-Mis18BP1). We demonstrate here that PLK1 interacts with the Mis18 complex by recognizing self-primed phosphorylations of Mis18α (Ser 54 ) and Mis18BP1 (Thr 78 and Ser 93 ) through its Polo-box domain. Disrupting these phosphorylations perturbed both centromere recruitment of the CENP-A chaperone HJURP and new CENP-A loading. Biochemical and functional analyses showed that phosphorylation of Mis18α and PLK1 binding were required to activate Mis18α-Mis18β and promote Mis18 complex-HJURP interaction. Thus, our study reveals key molecular events underpinning the licensing role of PLK1 in ensuring accurate centromere inheritance.},

  abstract     = {Successful cell division requires precise separation of chromosomes with near perfect fidelity to the daughter cells. Central to this essential process is attachment of the chromosomal centromeres to microtubules of the mitotic spindle. After DNA replication, properly timed regeneration of the centromere and its associated protein complex is essential. Conti et al . and Parashara et al . reveal how Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) coordinates this process at the end of mitosis. PLK-1 has intricate interactions with proteins at the centromere, first phosphorylating associated proteins and then itself binding to those sites, causing conformational changes that promote the recruitment of the histone H3–like protein CENP-A and its chaperone protein HJURP. These results help to explain how the protein complex at the centromere is deposited and regulated to form in a timely manner once each cell cycle. —L. Bryan Ray The centromere, a chromosome locus defined by the histone H3–like protein centromeric protein A (CENP-A), promotes assembly of the kinetochore to bind microtubules during cell division. Centromere maintenance requires CENP-A to be actively replenished by dedicated protein machinery in the early G 1 phase of the cell cycle to compensate for its dilution after DNA replication. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) limit CENP-A deposition to once per cell cycle and function as negative regulators outside of early G 1 . Antithetically, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) promotes CENP-A deposition in early G 1 , but the molecular details of this process are still unknown. We reveal here a phosphorylation network that recruits PLK1 to the deposition machinery to control a conformational switch required for licensing the CENP-A deposition reaction. Our findings clarify how PLK1 contributes to the epigenetic maintenance of centromeres.},

  abstract     = {Determining high-resolution protein structures often requires in vitro manipulations or purification steps that can obscure cellular context and arrest dynamics. Using cryo–electron tomography, Dietrich et al . investigated the structure and function of the F-type ATP synthase within the unicellular alga Polytomella , which was flash-frozen under active growth conditions. Within the mitochondria of these cells, ATP synthase is primarily found as a dimer, which forms supramolecular helical arrays that generate strong membrane curvature in the disk-like cristae. The authors generated subtomogram averages and were able to identify six distinct states of the central stalk and 21 substates, some of which were not seen in previous structures of the purified protein. This work provides insight into the energy landscape of active ATP synthase complexes and is an important demonstration of the emerging power of structural biology to capture dynamic complexes in situ. —Michael A. Funk and Iyinoluwa Sofowora Cells depend on a continuous supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy currency. In mitochondria, ATP is produced by a series of redox reactions, whereby an electrochemical gradient is established across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ATP synthase harnesses the energy of the gradient to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. We determined the structure of ATP synthase within mitochondria of the unicellular flagellate Polytomella by electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging at up to 4.2-angstrom resolution, revealing six rotary positions of the central stalk, subclassified into 21 substates of the F 1 head. The Polytomella ATP synthase forms helical arrays with multiple adjacent rows defining the cristae ridges. The structure of ATP synthase under native operating conditions in the presence of a membrane potential represents a pivotal step toward the analysis of membrane protein complexes in situ.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of humans and rodents to cope with adversity offers a strategy to reduce trauma vulnerability, but how to promote this resilience remains a challenge. Theory and experimental psychology support the notion that titrating trauma intensity can make individuals more successful in coping with upcoming adversities. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely obscure. Using an emotional contagion task in mice wherein bystander animals harmlessly witness a conspecific in adverse conditions before a traumatic experience, Mondoloni et al . identified a model permissive for resilience (see the Perspective by Metzger and Donato). The expression of the resilient phenotype by the bystanders required increased serotonin release in the lateral habenula. Both serotonin and negative emotional contagion reduced habenular neuronal bursting, suggesting a causal mechanism for resilience. —Peter Stern Negative emotional contagion—witnessing others in distress—affects an individual’s emotional responsivity. However, whether it shapes coping strategies when facing future threats remains unknown. We found that mice that briefly observe a conspecific being harmed become resilient, withstanding behavioral despair after an adverse experience. Photometric recordings during negative emotional contagion revealed increased serotonin (5-HT) release in the lateral habenula. Whereas 5-HT and emotional contagion reduced habenular burst firing, limiting 5-HT synthesis prevented burst plasticity. Enhancing raphe-to-habenula 5-HT was sufficient to recapitulate resilience. In contrast, reducing 5-HT release in the habenula made witnessing a conspecific in distress ineffective to promote the resilient phenotype after adversity. These findings reveal that 5-HT supports vicarious emotions and leads to resilience by tuning definite patterns of habenular neuronal activity.},

  abstract     = {Igneous rocks on the Moon demonstrate that it experienced extensive volcanism, with the most recent precisely dated volcanic lunar rocks being 2 billion years old. Some types of volcanic eruption produce microscopic glass beads, but so do impacts. Wang et al . examined thousands of glass beads taken from a lunar sample collected by the Chang’e-5 spacecraft (see the Perspective by Amelin and Yin). They used compositional and isotopic measurements to distinguish volcanic- and impact-related beads, identifying three beads of volcanic origin. Radiometric dating of those volcanic beads showed that they formed 120 million years ago and were subsequently transported to the Chang’e-5 landing site. The results indicate recent lunar volcanism that is not predicted by thermal models. —Keith T. Smith There is extensive geologic evidence of ancient volcanic activity on the Moon, but it is unclear how long that volcanism persisted. Magma fountains produce volcanic glasses, which have previously been found in samples of the Moon’s surface. We investigated ~3000 glass beads in lunar soil samples collected by the Chang’e-5 mission and identified three as having a volcanic origin on the basis of their textures, chemical compositions, and sulfur isotopes. Uranium-lead dating of the three volcanic glass beads shows that they formed 123 ± 15 million years ago. We measured high abundances of rare earth elements and thorium in these volcanic glass beads, which could indicate that such recent volcanism was related to local enrichment of heat-generating elements in the mantle sources of the magma.},

  abstract     = {Chemists still frequently forge the carbon-oxygen bonds in ethers using a nucleophilic displacement reaction dating back to Williamson’s work in the mid-19th century. A major drawback to this reaction is that it is largely restricted to unhindered carbon centers. Kaster et al . report a broadly versatile alternative involving palladium-catalyzed oxidative coupling of olefins with alcohols. Simulations helped to optimize the ligand design to best orient the alcohol for reaction through hydrogen bonding to a phosphate counterion. —Jake S. Yeston Transition metal–catalyzed cross-couplings have great potential to furnish complex ethers; however, challenges in the C(sp 3 )–O functionalization step have precluded general methods. Here, we describe computationally guided transition metal–ligand design that positions a hydrogen-bond acceptor anion at the reactive site to promote functionalization. A general cross-coupling of primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic alcohols with terminal olefins to furnish &gt;130 ethers is achieved. The mild conditions tolerate functionality that is prone to substitution, elimination, and epimerization and achieve site selectivity in polyol settings. Mechanistic studies support the hypothesis that the ligand’s geometry and electronics direct positioning of the phosphate anion at the π-allyl-palladium terminus, facilitating the phosphate’s hydrogen-bond acceptor role toward the alcohol. Ligand-directed counteranion positioning in cationic transition metal catalysis has the potential to be a general strategy for promoting challenging bimolecular reactivity.},

  abstract     = {Excited states of a many-body system are typically short-lived, but some systems have high-energy excitations known as quantum many-body scars that are much more resilient to thermalization. However, probing the scars is tricky. Yang et al . used a one-dimensional gas of dysprosium atoms to create quantum scars that are sufficiently stable for their nonlinear response to be probed. The researchers found that compressing the gas abruptly caused its kinetic energy to seemingly—and unexpectedly—decrease. A comparison with calculations revealed that the missing “phantom” energy, accounting for the difference between expectations and observations, is carried by high-momentum states that escape experimental detection. —Jelena Stajic Quantum many-body scars are notable as nonthermal, low-entanglement states that exist at high energies. In this study, we used attractively interacting dysprosium gases to create scar states that are stable enough to be driven into a strongly nonlinear regime while retaining their character. We measured how the kinetic and total energies evolve after quenching the confining potential. Although the bare interactions are attractive, the atoms behave as if they repel each other: Their kinetic energy paradoxically decreases as the gas is compressed. The missing “phantom” energy is quantified by benchmarking our experimental results against generalized hydrodynamics calculations. We present evidence that the missing kinetic energy is carried by undetected, very high momentum atoms.},

  abstract     = {Cellular stress responses exist to preserve the status quo when malfunctions occur. When proteins misfold within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, a key response is global repression of protein translation, which is mediated by protein kinase RNA–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). This reaction benefits the overloaded ER, but what about proteins needed for vital functions in other organelles? Brar et al . discovered that translational repression is not in fact universal throughout the cell during ER stress. They found that the mitochondrial protein ATAD3A binds PERK during stress, allowing key mitochondrial proteins to escape repression. This mechanism provides a “safe haven” for the protection of mitochondria during ER stress. —Stella M. Hurtley Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces the repression of protein synthesis throughout the cell. Attempts to understand how localized stress leads to widespread repression have been limited by difficulties in resolving translation rates at the subcellular level. Here, using live-cell imaging of reporter mRNA translation, we unexpectedly found that during ER stress, active translation at mitochondria was significantly protected. The mitochondrial protein ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3A (ATAD3A) interacted with protein kinase RNA–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and mediated this effect on localized translation by competing for binding with PERK’s target, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). PERK-ATAD3A interactions increased during ER stress, forming mitochondria-ER contact sites. Furthermore, ATAD3A binding attenuated local PERK signaling and rescued the expression of some mitochondrial proteins. Thus, PERK-ATAD3A interactions can control translational repression at a subcellular level, mitigating the impact of ER stress on the cell.},

The most common genetic modifications to crops provide resistance to herbicides or insect pests, which can lead to changes in pesticide use and other agricultural practices such as tillage and crop rotation. These changes have downstream effects on human health, carbon cycling, and biodiversity. Increased crop yields may reduce the need for converting additional land to agriculture, but increasing crop prices may encourage agricultural expansion. More research is needed to assess the effects of GMO crop adoption on deforestation and biodiversity. —Bianca Lopez Genetically modified (GM) crops have been adopted by some of the world’s leading agricultural nations, but the full extent of their environmental impact remains largely unknown. Although concerns regarding the direct environmental effects of GM crops have declined, GM crops have led to indirect changes in agricultural practices, including pesticide use, agricultural expansion, and cropping patterns, with profound environmental implications. Recent studies paint a nuanced picture of these environmental impacts, with mixed effects of GM crop adoption on biodiversity, deforestation, and human health that vary with the GM trait and geographic scale. New GM or gene-edited crops with different traits would likely have different environmental and human health impacts.},

Through the application of mouse genetics and the manipulation of neuron activity with engineered viruses, Fatt et al . discovered that a single type of excitatory neuron located in this brain region confers morphine antinociception (see the Perspective by De Preter and Heinricher). These neurons project to the spinal cord, where, through monosynaptic connectivity, they activate a defined inhibitory spinal neuron type that gates pain signaling in the ascending pain pathway. Inhibition of either the excitatory neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla or the inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord was found to abolish all of the analgesic effects of systemically administered morphine. —Peter Stern Opioids are widely used, effective analgesics to manage severe acute and chronic pain, although they have recently come under scrutiny because of epidemic levels of abuse. While these compounds act on numerous central and peripheral pain pathways, the neuroanatomical substrate for opioid analgesia is not fully understood. By means of single-cell transcriptomics and manipulation of morphine-responsive neurons, we have identified an ensemble of neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) that regulates mechanical nociception in mice. Among these, forced activation or silencing of excitatory RVM BDNF projection neurons mimicked or completely reversed morphine-induced mechanical antinociception, respectively, via a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)–dependent mechanism and activation of inhibitory spinal galanin-positive neurons. Our results reveal a specific RVM-spinal circuit that scales mechanical nociception whose function confers the antinociceptive properties of morphine.},

Micronuclear rupture catalyzes chromosomal rearrangements, epigenetic abnormalities, and inflammation, yet mechanisms safeguarding micronuclear integrity are poorly understood. In this study, we found that mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt micronuclei by promoting a noncanonical function of charged multivesicular body protein 7 (CHMP7), a scaffolding protein for the membrane repair complex known as endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III). ROS retained CHMP7 in micronuclei while disrupting its interaction with other ESCRT-III components. ROS-induced cysteine oxidation stimulated CHMP7 oligomerization and binding to the nuclear membrane protein LEMD2, disrupting micronuclear envelopes. Furthermore, this ROS-CHMP7 pathological axis engendered chromosome shattering known to result from micronuclear rupture. It also mediated micronuclear disintegrity under hypoxic conditions, linking tumor hypoxia with downstream processes driving cancer progression.},

Mechanistically, proximity of micronuclei to mitochondria led to oxidation-driven homo-oligomerization of p62, limiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)–dependent micronuclear envelope repair by triggering autophagic degradation.

However, in the nonaggregate form, the same proteins play important physiological roles. Benn et al . developed a strategy to target intracellular protein aggregates while sparing the monomeric form. Exploiting the clustering-dependent activation of TRIM21, the authors generated degraders combining the RING domain of TRIM21 with a target-specific nanobody. As proof of principle, they targeted tau aggregates in vitro and in vivo. In a tau-transgenic mouse model, the degraders, which were delivered through AAV vectors, reduced tau pathology, suggesting that this approach might be effective for selectively and safely removing protein aggregates. —Mattia Maroso Selective degradation of pathological protein aggregates while sparing monomeric forms is of major therapeutic interest. The E3 ligase tripartite motif–containing protein 21 (TRIM21) degrades antibody-bound proteins in an assembly state–specific manner due to the requirement of TRIM21 RING domain clustering for activation, yet effective targeting of intracellular assemblies remains challenging. Here, we fused the RING domain of TRIM21 to a target-specific nanobody to create intracellularly expressed constructs capable of selectively degrading assembled proteins. We evaluated this approach against green fluorescent protein–tagged histone 2B (H2B-GFP) and tau, a protein that undergoes pathological aggregation in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. RING-nanobody degraders prevented or reversed tau aggregation in culture and in vivo, with minimal impact on monomeric tau. This approach may have therapeutic potential for the many disorders driven by intracellular protein aggregation.},

Oren et al . applied machine learning tools and real-time playback experiments to analyze naturally occurring “phee-call” dialogues between pairs of marmoset monkeys. Marmosets used these vocalizations to label their conspecifics. They also perceived and responded correctly to calls that were specifically directed at them. Monkeys from the same family group used similar calls to vocally label others, and they learned from other family members to vocally label other individuals. —Peter Stern Humans, dolphins, and elephants are the only known species that vocally label their conspecifics. It remains unclear whether nonhuman primates share this ability. We recorded spontaneous “phee-call” dialogues between pairs of marmoset monkeys. We discovered that marmosets use these calls to vocally label their conspecifics. Moreover, they respond more consistently and correctly to calls that are specifically directed at them. Analysis of calls from multiple monkeys revealed that family members use similar calls and acoustic features to label others and perform vocal learning. These findings shed light on the complexities of social vocalizations among nonhuman primates and suggest that marmoset vocalizations may provide a model for understanding aspects of human language, thereby offering new insights into the evolution of social communication.},

  abstract     = {Broad classes of fluorocarbon compounds are provoking growing concerns over their combination of toxicity and environmental persistence. Fluorinated substituents nonetheless continue to play a critical role in pharmaceuticals. It is therefore increasingly important to incorporate these substituents with maximal efficiency and minimal residual fluorinated waste. Spennacchio et al . report a flow technique in which chlorocarbon precursors react rapidly with a simple cesium fluoride salt to generate CF 3 –N, CF 3 –S, and CF 3 –O motifs in complex molecules. —Jake S. Yeston The trifluoromethyl group (CF 3 ) is a key functionality in pharmaceutical and agrochemical development, greatly enhancing the efficacy and properties of resulting compounds. However, attaching the CF 3 group to heteroatoms such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen poses challenges because of the lack of general synthetic methods and reliance on bespoke reagents. Here, we present a modular flow platform that streamlines the synthesis of heteroatom-CF 3 motifs. Our method uses readily available organic precursors in combination with cesium fluoride as the primary fluorine source, facilitating the rapid generation of N -trifluoromethyl(R) [NCF 3 (R)], SCF 3 (trifluoromethylthio), and OCF 3 (trifluoromethoxy) anions on demand without reliance on perfluoroalkyl precursor reagents. This strategy offers a more environmentally friendly synthesis of trifluoromethyl(heteroatom)–containing molecules, with the potential for scalability in manufacturing processes facilitated by flow technology.},

  abstract     = {The disconnection of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic in the late Miocene 5 to 6 million years ago led to the sea’s nearly complete desiccation, leaving only a few hypersaline lakes similar to the present-day Dead Sea. There is a mass of data from both the geological and modern biological records that tracks this crisis and its legacy. Agiadi et al . undertook a comprehensive analysis of the event, including an evaluation of extinction rates and where repopulation originated, allowing a precise assessment of biodiversity before, during, and after the crisis. —Caroline Ash Massive salt accumulations, or salt giants, have formed in highly restricted marine basins throughout geological history, but their impact on biodiversity has been only patchily studied. The salt giant in the Mediterranean Sea formed as a result of the restriction of its gateway to the Atlantic during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) 5.97 to 5.33 million years ago. Here, we quantify the biodiversity changes associated with the MSC based on a compilation of the Mediterranean fossil record. We conclude that 86 endemic species of the 2006 pre-MSC marine species survived the crisis, and that the present eastward-decreasing richness gradient in the Mediterranean was established after the MSC.},

  abstract     = {The grain size of a polycrystalline material is one important part of the microstructure that constrains the properties. In contrast to previous assumptions, Qiu et al . have shown through modeling that grain boundaries can move in one direction in response to a nondirectional driving force. However, not all grain boundary types do so, mostly just the ones that are geometrically nonsymmetric. This observation helps us better understand some grain-coarsening behavior and may also be another tool for engineering microstructures and improving the material properties. —Brent Grocholski We demonstrate that grain boundaries (GBs) behave as Brownian ratchets, exhibiting direction-dependent mobilities and unidirectional motion under oscillatory driving forces or cyclic thermal annealing. We observed these phenomena for nearly all nonsymmetric GBs but not for symmetric ones. Our observations build on molecular dynamics and phase-field crystal simulations for a wide range of GB types and driving forces in both bicrystal and polycrystalline microstructures. We corroborate these simulation results through in situ experimental observations. We analyze these results with a Markov chain model and explore the implications of GB ratchet behavior for materials processing and microstructure tailoring.},

Li et al . paired up copper and palladium catalysts to deliver either E - or Z -configured double bonds in unnatural amino acids, depending on the ligand choice. The reaction is also highly enantioselective at the quaternary alpha carbon stereocenter. —Jake S.

Moreover, enantiopure non-natural α-amino acids are highly sought after in organic and medicinal chemistry. In this study, we report a ligand-controlled stereodivergent synthesis of non-natural α-quaternary amino acids bearing trisubstituted alkene moieties in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity and Z / E selectivities. This success is achieved through a palladium/copper–cocatalyzed three-component assembly of readily available aryl iodides, allenes, and aldimine esters by simply tuning the chiral ligands of the palladium and copper catalysts.},

Koppa et al . show that the warm, dry air flowing over drylands contributes to downwind dryland expansion and can cause the aridification of those areas. They found that more than 40% of the observed increase in aridity over regions that became drylands from 1981 to 2018 was due to self-expansion. —Jesse Smith Dryland expansion causes widespread water scarcity and biodiversity loss. Although the drying influence of global warming is well established, the role of existing drylands in their own expansion is relatively unknown. In this work, by tracking the air flowing over drylands, we show that the warming and drying of that air contributes to dryland expansion in the downwind direction. As they dry, drylands contribute less moisture and more heat to downwind humid regions, reducing precipitation and increasing atmospheric water demand, which ultimately causes their aridification. In ~40% of the land area that recently transitioned from a humid region into a dryland, self-expansion accounted for &gt;50% of the observed aridification. Our results corroborate the urgent need for climate change mitigation measures in drylands to decelerate their own expansion.},

  abstract     = {The Sun ejects a highly variable stream of plasma from its corona, forming the solar wind. As it expands across the Solar System, the solar wind accelerates and becomes supersonic through an unknown mechanism (see the Perspective by Sorriso Valvo and Malara). Rivera et al . studied a single patch of solar wind that passed two spacecraft, the Parker Solar Probe close to the Sun and then, about 2 days later, the Solar Orbiter near the orbit of Venus. Comparing the plasma properties at each location, the authors calculated that the additional kinetic and thermal energy gained by the plasma matches the energy lost by Alfvén waves, a form of plasma oscillation. This observation implies that Alfvén waves drive the acceleration. —Keith T. Smith After leaving the Sun’s corona, the solar wind continues to accelerate and cools, but more slowly than expected for a freely expanding adiabatic gas. Alfvén waves are perturbations of the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, along with the presence of large-amplitude Alfvén waves. We calculate that the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfvén waves are sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.},

One common example is the assessment of blood glucose levels in people with diabetes and subsequent administration of insulin, which in recent years has moved from periodic snapshots to continuous monitoring. Heng et al . developed a smart face mask integrated with a self-cooling strategy, automated microfluidics, and biosensors for wearable exhaled breath condensate sampling and analysis of metabolites. The authors show the potential value of this mask for the acquisition of data for healthy participants and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and post–COVID-19 infection in pilot human trials. —Marc S. Lavine Recent respiratory outbreaks have garnered substantial attention, yet most respiratory monitoring remains confined to physical signals. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) harbors rich molecular information that could unveil diverse insights into an individual’s health. Unfortunately, challenges related to sample collection and the lack of on-site analytical tools impede the widespread adoption of EBC analysis. Here, we introduce EBCare, a mask-based device for real-time in situ monitoring of EBC biomarkers. Using a tandem cooling strategy, automated microfluidics, highly selective electrochemical biosensors, and a wireless reading circuit, EBCare enables continuous multimodal monitoring of EBC analytes across real-life indoor and outdoor activities. We validated EBCare’s usability in assessing metabolic conditions and respiratory airway inflammation in healthy participants, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and patients after COVID-19 infection.},

We emphasize the challenges of RCTs, including limited participant diversity and logistical barriers, geographical constraints, and mistrust in research institutions, showing how DCTs are preferred in addressing these challenges by utilizing remote digital technologies and community providers to enable broader, more inclusive participation. Furthermore, we underscore the potential of DCTs for democratizing clinical research. We also stress the importance of addressing unresolved challenges, including data security and privacy, remote patient monitoring, and regulatory variations. Research is needed to devise standardized protocols to streamline DCT processes, explore its long-term impacts on patient outcomes, and overcome challenges through equitable stakeholder engagement.},

However, the nanoscale organization or even the existence of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) along the axon shaft remain unknown. To investigate this, Wernert et al . combined superresolution optical microscopy with platinum replica electron microscopy on cultured hippocampal neurons. In the axon initial segment (AIS), CCPs form within circular holes in the periodic actin-spectrin submembrane mesh and are called “clearings.” Cargo uptake and live-cell imaging experiments revealed that most AIS CCPs are immobile and long-lived within clearings. Further experiments suggested that the dense spectrin mesh controls the formation of these CCPs and their unusual stability. Stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors released this inhibition and triggered efficient endocytosis along the AIS. —Stella Hurtley Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has characteristic features in neuronal dendrites and presynapses, but how membrane proteins are internalized along the axon shaft remains unclear. We focused on clathrin-coated structures and endocytosis along the axon initial segment (AIS) and their relationship to the periodic actin-spectrin scaffold that lines the axonal plasma membrane. A combination of super-resolution microscopy and platinum-replica electron microscopy on cultured neurons revealed that AIS clathrin-coated pits form within “clearings”, circular areas devoid of actin-spectrin mesh. Actin-spectrin scaffold disorganization increased clathrin-coated pit formation. Cargo uptake and live-cell imaging showed that AIS clathrin-coated pits are particularly stable. Neuronal plasticity-inducing stimulation triggered internalization of the clathrin-coated pits through polymerization of branched actin around them. Thus, spectrin and actin regulate clathrin-coated pit formation and scission to control endocytosis at the AIS.},

  abstract     = {A key event in the process of cell division is the organization of microtubules into a bipolar spindle. At the appropriate stage, the two poles pull apart the microtubules, together with their attached sister chromatids, ensuring that each daughter cell receives the correct complement of chromosomes. The mechanics of this process are relatively well understood for mitosis, which takes place in somatic cells, but not for meiosis, which leads to the formation of gametes. Wu et al . used immunofluorescence imaging to monitor spindle bipolarization in human oocytes and also identified some of the key proteins involved in this process. Several of these proteins turned out to be mutated in human patients with unexplained infertility and failure of assisted reproduction, demonstrating the clinical relevance of these findings. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Spindle bipolarization, the process of a microtubule mass transforming into a bipolar spindle, is a prerequisite for accurate chromosome segregation. In contrast to mitotic cells, the process and mechanism of spindle bipolarization in human oocytes remains unclear. Using high-resolution imaging in more than 1800 human oocytes, we revealed a typical state of multipolar intermediates that form during spindle bipolarization and elucidated the mechanism underlying this process. We found that the minor poles formed in multiple kinetochore clusters contribute to the generation of multipolar intermediates. We further determined the essential roles of HAUS6, KIF11, and KIF18A in spindle bipolarization and identified mutations in these genes in infertile patients characterized by oocyte or embryo defects. These results provide insights into the physiological and pathological mechanisms of spindle bipolarization in human oocytes.},

  abstract     = {Excited states are important in many areas of physics and chemistry; however, scalable, accurate, and robust calculations of excited-state properties from first principles remain a critical theoretical challenge. Recent advances in computing the ground-state properties of molecular systems driven by deep learning demonstrate that this technique has the potential to address this problem. Pfau et al . present a parameter-free mathematical principle for computing excited states using deep neural networks by directly generalizing variational quantum Monte Carlo to ground states. The proposed method achieves accurate excited-state calculations on a number of atoms and molecules, far outperforms existing methods for computing excited-state properties with deep learning (especially on larger systems), and can be applied to various quantum systems. —Yury Suleymanov We present an algorithm to estimate the excited states of a quantum system by variational Monte Carlo, which has no free parameters and requires no orthogonalization of the states, instead transforming the problem into that of finding the ground state of an expanded system. Arbitrary observables can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations, such as the transition dipole moment. The method works particularly well with neural network ansätze, and by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer ansätze, we can accurately recover excitation energies and oscillator strengths on a range of molecules. We achieve accurate vertical excitation energies on benzene-scale molecules, including challenging double excitations. Beyond the examples presented in this work, we expect that this technique will be of interest for atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics.},

  abstract     = {Chromatin state is a key influencing factor for processes occurring around DNA, such as the regulation of gene expression. Enzymes that chemically modify histones and those that alter the position and composition of nucleosomes are critical to this regulation. The human TIP60/NuA4 complex combines both types of activities, and these have also been well studied in separate yeast counterparts. Cryo–electron microscopy, biochemical, and genomic data now shed light on how the complex has rearranged its functional modules to accommodate both roles. Modules for histone acetylation, histone variant exchange, and localization to active enhancers and gene promoters extend from a central scaffold to coordinate these distinct activities. —Di Jiang The human nucleosome acetyltransferase of histone H4 (NuA4)/Tat-interactive protein, 60 kilodalton (TIP60) coactivator complex, a fusion of the yeast switch/sucrose nonfermentable related 1 (SWR1) and NuA4 complexes, both incorporates the histone variant H2A.Z into nucleosomes and acetylates histones H4, H2A, and H2A.Z to regulate gene expression and maintain genome stability. Our cryo–electron microscopy studies show that, within the NuA4/TIP60 complex, the E1A binding protein P400 (EP400) subunit serves as a scaffold holding the different functional modules in specific positions, creating a distinct arrangement of the actin-related protein (ARP) module. EP400 interacts with the transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP) subunit by using a footprint that overlaps with that of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, preventing the formation of a hybrid complex. Loss of the TRRAP subunit leads to mislocalization of NuA4/TIP60, resulting in the redistribution of H2A.Z and its acetylation across the genome, emphasizing the dual functionality of NuA4/TIP60 as a single macromolecular assembly.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with brain metabolic alterations. Minhas et al . studied the role of glucose metabolism impairments on disease progression using a combination of human induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse models (see the Perspective by Johnson and Macauley). The authors showed that activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) by either amyloid β or tau oligomers, two prominent Alzheimer’s disease pathological proteins, promotes the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine, which then suppresses astrocytic glycolysis, thus reducing one of the main fuel sources for neurons. Inhibiting IDO1 rescued synaptic plasticity in vitro and improved cognition in multiple rodent models. Targeting metabolic dysfunctions holds promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. —Mattia Maroso Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with recent proteomic studies highlighting disrupted glial metabolism in AD. We report that inhibition of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine (KYN), rescues hippocampal memory function in mouse preclinical models of AD by restoring astrocyte metabolism. Activation of astrocytic IDO1 by amyloid β and tau oligomers increases KYN and suppresses glycolysis in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor–dependent manner. In amyloid and tau models, IDO1 inhibition improves hippocampal glucose metabolism and rescues hippocampal long-term potentiation in a monocarboxylate transporter–dependent manner. In astrocytic and neuronal cocultures from AD subjects, IDO1 inhibition improved astrocytic production of lactate and uptake by neurons. Thus, IDO1 inhibitors presently developed for cancer might be repurposed for treatment of AD.},

We introduce high-throughput Single-molecule Parallel Analysis for Rapid eXploration of Sequence space (SPARXS), integrating single-molecule fluorescence with next-generation sequencing. We applied SPARXS to study the sequence-dependent kinetics of the Holliday junction, a critical intermediate in homologous recombination. By examining the dynamics of millions of Holliday junctions, covering thousands of distinct sequences, we demonstrated the ability of SPARXS to uncover sequence patterns, evaluate sequence motifs, and construct thermodynamic models. SPARXS emerges as a versatile tool for untangling the mechanisms that underlie sequence-specific processes at the molecular scale.},

Some of those successes involved rarely studied policies and unappreciated combinations. This work illustrates the kinds of policy efforts that are needed to close the emissions gaps in various economic sectors. —Jesse Smith Meeting the Paris Agreement’s climate targets necessitates better knowledge about which climate policies work in reducing emissions at the necessary scale. We provide a global, systematic ex post evaluation to identify policy combinations that have led to large emission reductions out of 1500 climate policies implemented between 1998 and 2022 across 41 countries from six continents. Our approach integrates a comprehensive climate policy database with a machine learning–based extension of the common difference-in-differences approach. We identified 63 successful policy interventions with total emission reductions between 0.6 billion and 1.8 billion metric tonnes CO 2 .

For example, rapid-setting cyanoacrylate glues are used for external wound closures, but they cannot be used internally because of their high stiffness, cytotoxicity, and slow degradation. Pal et al . designed a family of poly(α-lipoic acid) adhesives by adding an electrophile that prevents closed-loop depolymerization during storage and use (see the Perspective by Guan). A range of applications were demonstrated, including a pressure-sensitive adhesive that functions well in dry or wet conditions with minor changes in monomer composition. The authors also showed that their adhesive can seal punctures in the murine amniotic sac, thus preventing fetal fatality. —Marc S. Lavine Polymer adhesives play an important role in many medical, consumer, and industrial products. Polymers of α-lipoic acid (αLA) have the potential to fulfill the need for versatile and environmentally friendly adhesives, but their performance is plagued by spontaneous depolymerization. We report a family of stabilized αLA polymer adhesives that can be tailored for a variety of medical or nonmedical uses and sustainably sourced and recycled in a closed-loop manner. Minor changes in monomer composition afforded a pressure-sensitive adhesive that functions well in dry and wet conditions, as well as a structural adhesive with strength equivalent to that of conventional epoxies. αLA surgical superglue successfully sealed murine amniotic sac ruptures, increasing fetal survival from 0 to 100%.},

  abstract     = {The 2024 magnitude 7.5 Noto Peninsula earthquake in Japan occurred on a fault system that has seen repeated seismic swarms since 2020. Ma et al . unraveled the slip behavior of this event, which seems to have ruptured a fault in a fluid-rich zone. The authors identified a slow rupture mode that immediately preceded the larger fault slip, which could be an important component for fluid-rich fault ruptures. Xu et al . found that the initial rupture was almost stopped by a strong asperity, a zone of increased friction, which was broken after a second rupture started on the other side of the barrier and generated strong shaking. The pattern of where seismic swarms occurred may be important for assessing risk elsewhere. —Brent Grocholski To reveal the connections between the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7.5 Noto earthquake in Japan and the seismicity swarms that preceded it, we investigated its rupture process through near-source waveform analysis and source imaging techniques, combining seismic and geodetic datasets. We found notable complexity in the initial rupture stages. A strong fault asperity, which remained unbroken in preceding seismic swarms, slowed down the rupture. Then, a second rupture initiated at the opposite edge of the asperity, and the asperity succumbed to double-pincer rupture fronts. The failure of this high-stress drop asperity drove the earthquake into a large-scale event. Our observations help unravel the crucial role of fault asperities in controlling swarm migration and rupture propagation and underscore the need for detailed seismological and interdisciplinary studies to assess seismic risk in swarm-prone regions.},

  abstract     = {Assessment of the status of fisheries stocks is a key component of their management. Although there has been much debate around how to do fishery assessments, there has been a general belief that estimates are roughly accurate. Edgar et al . used publicly available data on 230 of the best-known fisheries species to test whether stock biomass estimates made in the year of the estimate were as accurate as specifically calculated hindcast models (see the Perspective by Froese and Pauly). They found that, especially in overfished species, historical estimates were higher than later estimates, indicating the presence of excessively positive assessments of stock status. —Sacha Vignieri Effective fisheries management requires accurate estimates of stock biomass and trends; yet, assumptions in stock assessment models generate high levels of uncertainty and error. For 230 fisheries worldwide, we contrasted stock biomass estimates at the time of assessment with updated hindcast estimates modeled for the same year in later assessments to evaluate systematic over- or underestimation. For stocks that were overfished, low value, or located in regions with rising temperatures, historical biomass estimates were generally overstated compared with updated assessments. Moreover, rising trends reported for overfished stocks were often inaccurate. With consideration of bias identified retrospectively, 85% more stocks than currently recognized have likely collapsed below 10% of maximum historical biomass. The high uncertainty and bias in modeled stock estimates warrants much greater precaution by managers.},

However, modern blades for use in wind turbines are assembled with epoxy resins that are resource intensive to manufacture and cannot be easily recycled. Clarke et al . report a polyester material for blade manufacture that can be derived from biomass and straightforwardly deconstructed for recycling at the end of its life by heating in methanol. Performance properties compared favorably to incumbent resins. —Jake S. Yeston Wind energy is helping to decarbonize the electrical grid, but wind blades are not recyclable, and current end-of-life management strategies are not sustainable. To address the material recyclability challenges in sustainable energy infrastructure, we introduce scalable biomass-derivable polyester covalent adaptable networks and corresponding fiber-reinforced composites for recyclable wind blade fabrication. Through experimental and computational studies, including vacuum-assisted resin-transfer molding of a 9-meter wind blade prototype, we demonstrate drop-in technological readiness of this material with existing manufacture techniques, superior properties relative to incumbent materials, and practical end-of-life chemical recyclability. Most notable is the counterintuitive creep suppression, outperforming industry state-of-the-art thermosets despite the dynamic cross-link topology. Overall, this report details the many facets of wind blade manufacture, encompassing chemistry, engineering, safety, mechanical analyses, weathering, and chemical recyclability, enabling a realistic path toward biomass-derivable, recyclable wind blades.},

Attempts to use this reductant catalytically have been hindered by its tight binding to oxygen during reactions. Boyd et al . now report that a well-chosen acid can help cleave the samarium-oxygen bond and induce turnover with electrons provided electrochemically or by metallic zinc. Lactone formation from ketone coupling with acrylates showcased the catalysis. —Jake S. Yeston Samarium diiodide (SmI 2 ) is a privileged, single-electron reductant deployed in diverse synthetic settings. However, generalizable methods for catalytic turnover remain elusive because of the well-known challenge associated with cleaving strong Sm III –O bonds. Prior efforts have focused on the use of highly reactive oxophiles to enable catalyst turnover. However, such approaches give rise to complex catalyst speciation and intrinsically limit the synthetic scope. Herein, we leveraged a mild and selective protonolysis strategy to achieve samarium-catalyzed, intermolecular reductive cross-coupling of ketones and acrylates with broad scope. The modularity of our approach allows rational control of selectivity based on solvent, p K a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant), and the samarium coordination sphere and provides a basis for future developments in catalytic and electrocatalytic lanthanide chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The 2024 magnitude 7.5 Noto Peninsula earthquake in Japan occurred on a fault system that has seen repeated seismic swarms since 2020. Ma et al . unraveled the slip behavior of this event, which seems to have ruptured a fault in a fluid-rich zone. The authors identified a slow rupture mode that immediately preceded the larger fault slip, which could be an important component for fluid-rich fault ruptures. Xu et al . found that the initial rupture was almost stopped by a strong asperity, a zone of increased friction, which was broken after a second rupture started on the other side of the barrier and generated strong shaking. The pattern of where seismic swarms occurred may be important for assessing risk elsewhere. —Brent Grocholski The 2024 moment magnitude 7.5 Noto Peninsula (Japan) earthquake caused devastation to communities and was generated by a complex rupture process. Using space geodetic and seismic observations, we have shown that the event deformed the peninsula with a peak uplift reaching 5 meters at the west coast. Shallow slip exceeded 10 meters on an offshore fault. Peak stress drop was greater than 10 megapascals. This devastating event began with a slow rupture propagation lasting 15 to 20 seconds near its hypocenter, where seismic swarms had surged since 2020 because of lower-crust fluid supply. The slow start was accompanied by intense high-frequency seismic radiation. These observations suggest a distinct coseismic slip mode reflecting high heterogeneity in fault properties within a fluid-rich fault zone.},

Kveim et al . investigated the mechanisms that govern the reorganization of neuronal ensembles linked to a specific memory and how these dynamic changes affect memory persistence over time. They found that in the hippocampal network, learning resulted in the parallel establishment of two distinct memory traces. These traces were represented in distinct neurogenesis-defined subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons. Even though temporally restricted, the transient recruitment of late-born neurons was necessary for a memory’s long-term permanence, whereas shifts in the recruitment of early- and late-born neurons had a strong impact on the plasticity of a recently acquired memory. —Peter Stern Memories are dynamic constructs whose properties change with time and experience. The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence the evolution of a memory over time. By targeting developmentally distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we discovered that memory encoding resulted in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces were instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and followed distinct reactivation trajectories after encoding. The divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpinned gradual reorganization of memory ensembles and modulated memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and the progression of memories over time.},

Matsumoto et al . performed simultaneous imaging of retinal waves and spontaneous activity in neonatal mice while measuring morphological changes in retinal ganglion cell axons (see the Perspective by Somaiya and Feller). Their in vivo data showed that during development, connections are established following Hebb’s law: New branches tend to be added at the loci where spontaneous activity of individual branches is more correlated with retinal waves, whereas asynchronous activity is associated with branch elimination. These results demonstrate the primary role of Hebbian mechanisms in sensory system development. —Mattia Maroso Spontaneous activity refines neural connectivity prior to the onset of sensory experience, but it remains unclear how such activity instructs axonal connectivity with subcellular precision. We simultaneously measured spontaneous retinal waves and the activity of individual retinocollicular axons and tracked morphological changes in axonal arbors across hours in vivo in neonatal mice. We demonstrate that the correlation of an axon branch’s activity with neighboring axons or postsynaptic neurons predicts whether the branch will be added, stabilized, or eliminated. Desynchronizing individual axons from their local networks, changing the pattern of correlated activity, or blocking N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors all significantly altered single-axon morphology. These observations provide the first direct evidence in vivo that endogenous patterns of correlated neuronal activity instruct fine-scale refinement of axonal processes.},

Xu et al . used photoemission measurements to investigate the phase diagram of the electron-doped cuprate Nd 2-x Ce x CuO 4 . An unusual energy gap was observed to develop high above the temperature of the superconducting transition. The researchers ascribed the gap to superconducting pairing lacking global coherence. —Jelena Stajic In the underdoped n-type cuprate Nd 2- x Ce x CuO 4 , long-range antiferromagnetic order reconstructs the Fermi surface, resulting in a putative antiferromagnetic metal with small Fermi pockets. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe an anomalous energy gap, an order of magnitude smaller than the antiferromagnetic gap, in a wide portion of the underdoped regime and smoothly connecting to the superconducting gap at optimal doping. After considering all the known ordering tendencies in tandem with the phase diagram, we hypothesize that the normal-state gap in the underdoped n-type cuprates originates from Cooper pairing. The high temperature scale of the normal-state gap raises the prospect of engineering higher transition temperatures in the n-type cuprates comparable to those of the p-type cuprates.},

However, molecular state control is often limited by the interaction between the object (the molecule) and its environment, which can cause unwanted changes in the object’s state. Liu et al . present an approach in which the state of the molecule is preserved by actively correcting environment-induced transitions. Using quantum-logic spectroscopy, they observed, in real-time, quantum jumps between rotational states of a single molecular ion (calcium hydride) driven by thermal radiation, and then reversed these jumps through microwave-driven transitions. The presented molecular state control protocol opens opportunities for quantum information science, precision measurement, molecular physics, and chemistry. —Yury Suleymanov Understanding molecular state evolution is central to many disciplines, including molecular dynamics, precision measurement, and molecule-based quantum technology. Details of this evolution are obscured when observing a statistical ensemble of molecules. Here, we report real-time observations of thermal radiation–driven transitions between individual states (“jumps”) of a single molecule. We reversed these jumps through microwave-driven transitions, which resulted in a 20-fold improvement in the time the molecule dwells in a chosen state. The measured transition rates showed anisotropy in the thermal environment, pointing to the possibility of using single molecules as in situ probes for the strengths of ambient fields. Our approaches for state detection and manipulation could apply to a wide range of species, facilitating their uses in fields including quantum science, molecular physics, and ion-neutral chemistry.},

Fecal contamination is the primary limiting factor, affecting almost half of the population of these regions. This means that more than 4.4 billion people in poorer countries lack safe drinking water, a number more than twice as high as some other estimates. —Jesse Smith Safe drinking water access is a human right, but data on safely managed drinking water services (SMDWS) is lacking for more than half of the global population. We estimate SMDWS use in 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) at subnational levels with a geospatial modeling approach, combining existing household survey data with available global geospatial datasets. We estimate that only one in three people used SMDWS in LMICs in 2020 and identified fecal contamination as the primary limiting factor affecting almost half of the population of LMICs. Our results are relevant for raising awareness about the challenges and limitations of current global monitoring approaches and demonstrating how globally available geospatial data can be leveraged to fill data gaps and identify priority areas in LMICs.},

Ouchi and Fujisawa performed high-density neuronal recordings in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal area CA1 of rats during goal-directed behavior in an open field. They observed neurons in layer 3 of the medial entorhinal cortex that explicitly encode a grid representation of an animal’s future projected location, not the current position, and named them ““predictive grid cells.” Neuronal assemblies in the medial entorhinal cortex thus organize a predictive cognitive map. —Peter Stern The entorhinal cortex represents allocentric spatial geometry and egocentric speed and heading information required for spatial navigation. However, it remains unclear whether it contributes to the prediction of an animal’s future location. We discovered grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) that have grid fields representing future locations during goal-directed behavior. These predictive grid cells represented prospective spatial information by shifting their grid fields against the direction of travel. Predictive grid cells discharged at the trough phases of the hippocampal CA1 theta oscillation and, together with other types of grid cells, organized sequences of the trajectory from the current to future positions across each theta cycle. Our results suggest that the MEC provides a predictive map that supports forward planning in spatial navigation.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of protein complexes in which individual proteins are not functional on their own has garnered a great deal of curiosity. Navigating the gain of a new function with a partner is doubly difficult because at least two proteins must evolve in tandem. To study such a process, Despres et al . duplicated the cytosine deaminase gene in yeast and used selective pressure to induce loss-of-function mutations that affect the protein complex. They found that many deleterious variants could be compensated, maintaining the ancestral fitness state, and this greatly increased the number of possible mutations through which this complex could evolve. —Corinne N. Simonti The functions of proteins generally depend on their assembly into complexes. During evolution, some complexes have transitioned from homomers encoded by a single gene to heteromers encoded by duplicate genes. This transition could occur without adaptive evolution through intermolecular compensatory mutations. Here, we experimentally duplicated and evolved a homodimeric enzyme to determine whether and how this could happen. We identified hundreds of deleterious mutations that inactivate individual homodimers but produce functional enzymes when coexpressed as duplicated proteins that heterodimerize. The structure of one such heteromer reveals how both losses of function are buffered through the introduction of asymmetry in the complex that allows them to subfunctionalize. Constructive neutral evolution can thus occur by gene duplication followed by only one deleterious mutation per duplicate.},

  abstract     = {Diels-Alder reactions are widely used in chemistry to form six-membered carbon rings from four- and two-carbon reactant pairs, with fine control over the product geometry afforded by a variety of well-optimized catalysts. By contrast, the related coupling of four- and six-carbon fragments into 10-membered rings has proven much more difficult to control. Zheng et al . report that a highly acidic phosphorus-centered catalyst can form these larger rings with high stereoselectivity upon precipitating from the reaction mixture as a noncovalent framework. —Jake S. Yeston Whereas [4 + 2] cycloadditions are among the most powerful tools in the chemist’s synthetic arsenal, controlling reactivity and selectivity of [6 + 4] cycloadditions has proven to be extremely challenging. Such transformations, especially if compatible with simple hydrocarbon-based substrates, could ultimately provide a general approach to highly valuable and otherwise difficult to access 10-membered rings. We report here that highly acidic and confined imidodiphosphorimidate catalysts do not catalyze this reaction under homogeneous conditions. Notably, however, they can spontaneously precipitate an insoluble and double helix–shaped noncovalent organic framework, which acts as a distinctively reactive and stereoselective catalyst of [6 + 4] cycloadditions of simple dienes with tropone.},

  abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses a spike protein to bind to receptors on human cells. Cleavage of spike by a protease yields a fragment called S2 that is primed to initiate membrane fusion through a dramatic conformational change that has so far been difficult to visualize using structural techniques. Using virus-like particles decorated either with spike or the receptor, Grunst et al . collected cryo–electron tomography images of membrane-associated spike-receptor complexes and S2 undergoing refolding. The authors were able to solve a prehairpin structure in which S2 is inserted into the opposing membrane, and they mapped models from prior molecular dynamics simulations onto the tomography structures. Stem-helix–targeting antibodies bound near the head of the prehairpin complex, resulting in arrest of refolding and prevention of fusion of the adjacent membranes. —Michael A. Funk The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein binds the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and drives virus-host membrane fusion through refolding of its S2 domain. Whereas the S1 domain contains high sequence variability, the S2 domain is conserved and is a promising pan-betacoronavirus vaccine target. We applied cryo–electron tomography to capture intermediates of S2 refolding and understand inhibition by antibodies to the S2 stem-helix. Subtomogram averaging revealed ACE2 dimers cross-linking spikes before transitioning into S2 intermediates, which were captured at various stages of refolding. Pan-betacoronavirus neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 stem-helix bound to and inhibited refolding of spike prehairpin intermediates. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, these structures elucidate the process of SARS-CoV-2 entry and reveal how pan-betacoronavirus S2-targeting antibodies neutralize infectivity by arresting prehairpin intermediates.},

  abstract     = {The geologic boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene eras 66 million years ago is marked by worldwide deposits from an impact at modern Chicxulub, Mexico. The impact coincides with a mass extinction that wiped out non-avian dinosaurs and many other species. Fischer-Gödde et al . measured ruthenium isotopes in the impact deposits and compared them with multiple classes of meteorites, which represent potential impactor compositions. They found that the Chicxulub impactor was a carbonaceous asteroid that formed in the outer Solar System. Additional measurements of five other impacts showed that those were due to silicate asteroids that formed in the inner Solar System. —Keith T. Smith An impact at Chicxulub, Mexico, occurred 66 million years ago, producing a global stratigraphic layer that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene eras. That layer contains elevated concentrations of platinum-group elements, including ruthenium. We measured ruthenium isotopes in samples taken from three Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sites, five other impacts that occurred between 36 million to 470 million years ago, and ancient 3.5-billion- to 3.2-billion-year-old impact spherule layers. Our data indicate that the Chicxulub impactor was a carbonaceous-type asteroid, which had formed beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The five other impact structures have isotopic signatures that are more consistent with siliceous-type asteroids, which formed closer to the Sun. The ancient spherule layer samples are consistent with impacts of carbonaceous-type asteroids during Earth’s final stages of accretion.},

  abstract     = {A bottleneck in the deployment of sodium-layered oxide battery cathodes arises due to detrimental effects caused by air, particularly during their manufacture. What has not been clear, however, is what components in the air are the culprits. Yang et al . effectively isolated and examined individual air components and found that their stability is compromised by the combined effect of water with carbon dioxide or oxygen. The former causes acid degradation and the latter oxidative damage. Removal of water alone may thus be enough to ensure stability during manufacture and storage. The authors further showed that designing air-stable sodium-layered oxides requires the optimization of factors among the ionic potential, redox potential of transition metals, and particle sizes. —Marc S. Lavine Air sensitivity remains a substantial barrier to the commercialization of sodium (Na)–layered oxides (NLOs). This problem has puzzled the community for decades because of the complexity of interactions between air components and their impact on both bulk and surfaces of NLOs. We show here that water vapor plays a pivotal role in initiating destructive acid and oxidative degradations of NLOs only when coupled with carbon dioxide or oxygen, respectively. Quantification analysis revealed that reducing the defined cation competition coefficient (η), which integrates the effects of ionic potential and sodium content, and increasing the particle size can enhance the resistance to acid attack, whereas using high-potential redox couples can eliminate oxidative degradation. These findings elucidate the underlying air deterioration mechanisms and rationalize the design of air-stable NLOs.},

  abstract     = {During sleep, there is an increase in the coordinated firing of neuronal ensembles that were previously active during behavior. These hippocampal sharp-wave ripples are necessary for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. However, how the hippocampus regulates such increases in ensemble reactivation and synchrony while keeping the overall homeostatic balance of the network is not known. Karaba et al . discovered a new type of network pattern, a barrage of activity, that originated in hippocampal area CA2 and involved pyramidal cells and a specific type of interneurons (see the Perspective by Mou and Ji). This barrage had differential effects on the efferent CA1 neurons and was dependent on experience. Optogenetic manipulations of this activity indicated its role in different tasks. Unlike sharp-wave ripples, which increase hippocampal output, this barrage decreased the output, thereby rebalancing the network. —Peter Stern Memory consolidation involves the synchronous reactivation of hippocampal cells active during recent experience in sleep sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). How this increase in firing rates and synchrony after learning is counterbalanced to preserve network stability is not understood. We discovered a network event generated by an intrahippocampal circuit formed by a subset of CA2 pyramidal cells to cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) basket cells, which fire a barrage of action potentials (“BARR”) during non–rapid eye movement sleep. CA1 neurons and assemblies that increased their activity during learning were reactivated during SWRs but inhibited during BARRs. The initial increase in reactivation during SWRs returned to baseline through sleep. This trend was abolished by silencing CCK+ basket cells during BARRs, resulting in higher synchrony of CA1 assemblies and impaired memory consolidation.},

The resulting thin film is transparent but still has high conductivity and is mechanically stable. This strategy could potentially be used to develop flexible circuits that are robust even at elevated temperatures. —Brent Grocholski Metal oxide films are essential in most electronic devices, yet they are typically deposited at elevated temperatures by using slow, vacuum-based processes. We printed native oxide films over large areas at ambient conditions by moving a molten metal meniscus across a target substrate. The oxide gently separates from the metal through fluid instabilities that occur in the meniscus, leading to uniform films free of liquid residue. The printed oxide has a metallic interlayer that renders the films highly conductive. The metallic character of the printed films promotes wetting of trace amounts of evaporated gold that would otherwise form disconnected islands on conventional oxide surfaces. The resulting ultrathin (&lt;10 nanometers) conductors can be patterned into flexible circuits that are transparent, mechanically robust, and electrically stable, even at elevated temperatures.},

Kendall et al . show how testing and digital contact tracing technologies can give almost real-time insights into the way a pathogen is spreading. Data were analyzed from the National Health Service COVID-19 app used in England and Wales from 2020 to 2023. This app had up to 18 million users at its peak in February 2021. The data provided a picture of current infections 5 days earlier than any other estimates, showed the important contribution of household contacts to infections, identified strong day-of-the-week effects, and marked peaks associated with the UEFA European Football Championship and Christmas shopping in 2021. —Caroline Ash Understanding the drivers of respiratory pathogen spread is challenging, particularly in a timely manner during an ongoing epidemic. In this work, we present insights that we obtained using daily data from the National Health Service COVID-19 app for England and Wales and that we shared with health authorities in almost real time. Our indicator of the reproduction number R ( t ) was available days earlier than other estimates, with an innovative capability to decompose R ( t ) into contact rates and probabilities of infection. When Omicron arrived, the main epidemic driver switched from contacts to transmissibility. We separated contacts and transmissions by day of exposure and setting and found pronounced variability over days of the week and during Christmas holidays and events. For example, during the Euro football tournament in 2021, days with England matches showed sharp spikes in exposures and transmissibility. Digital contact-tracing technologies can help control epidemics not only by directly preventing transmissions but also by enabling rapid analysis at scale and with unprecedented resolution.},

  abstract     = {Tens of thousands of single-strand DNA breaks arise spontaneously in each of our cells each day, representing one of the most common forms of endogenous DNA damage. If these lesions persist, they can potentially collapse incoming replication forks, resulting in lethal double-strand breaks (DSBs). To study this process, Pavani et al . used a Cas9-nicking enzyme to introduce site-specific nicks in the human genome. Depending on which DNA strand a nick is located in relative to an incoming replication fork, DSBs are generated with different end structures. Furthermore, these DSBs are processed differently compared with DSBs generated independently of replication. —Di Jiang Using CRISPR-Cas9 nicking enzymes, we examined the interaction between the replication machinery and single-strand breaks, one of the most common forms of endogenous DNA damage. We show that replication fork collapse at leading-strand nicks generates resected single-ended double-strand breaks (seDSBs) that are repaired by homologous recombination (HR). If these seDSBs are not promptly repaired, arrival of adjacent forks creates double-ended DSBs (deDSBs), which could drive genomic scarring in HR-deficient cancers. deDSBs can also be generated directly when the replication fork bypasses lagging-strand nicks. Unlike deDSBs produced independently of replication, end resection at nick-induced seDSBs and deDSBs is BRCA1-independent. Nevertheless, BRCA1 antagonizes 53BP1 suppression of RAD51 filament formation. These results highlight distinctive mechanisms that maintain replication fork stability.},

  abstract     = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to red and white blood cells. They can be released from the bone marrow into the blood in low numbers during homeostasis or in greater numbers in response to infection and disease. Working with mouse and human cells, Gao et al . found that HSCs in the bone marrow could be distinguished by the expression of proteins associated with macrophages. These proteins were not produced within HSCs, but might be acquired from bone marrow–associated macrophages through a process of cell-cell membrane transfer that could be negatively regulated by signaling associated with the stem cell growth factor. —Sarah H. Ross Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are routinely mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) to the blood circulation for clinical transplantation. However, the precise mechanisms by which individual stem cells exit the marrow are not understood. This study identified cell-extrinsic and molecular determinants of a mobilizable pool of blood-forming stem cells. We found that a subset of HSCs displays macrophage-associated markers on their cell surface. Although fully functional, these HSCs are selectively niche-retained as opposed to stem cells lacking macrophage markers, which exit the BM upon forced mobilization. Macrophage markers on HSCs could be acquired through direct transfer by trogocytosis, regulated by receptor tyrosine-protein kinase C-Kit (CD117), from BM-resident macrophages in mouse and human settings. Our study provides proof of concept that adult stem cells utilize trogocytosis to rapidly establish and activate function-modulating molecular mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of the antidepressant effects of ketamine is an important advance in mental health therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Chen et al . found that in depressive-like animals, ketamine selectively inhibited NMDA receptor responses in lateral habenula neurons, but not in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (see the Perspective by Hernandez-Silva and Proulx). Compared with hippocampal neurons, lateral habenula neurons have much higher intrinsic activity in the depressive state and a much smaller extrasynaptic reservoir pool of NMDA receptors. By increasing the intrinsic activity of hippocampal neurons or decreasing the activity of lateral habenula neurons, the sensitivity of their NMDA receptor responses to ketamine blockade could be swapped. Removal of the obligatory NMDA receptor subunit NR1 in the lateral habenula prevented ketamine’s antidepressant effects. —Peter Stern Ketamine has been found to have rapid and potent antidepressant activity. However, despite the ubiquitous brain expression of its molecular target, the N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR), it was not clear whether there is a selective, primary site for ketamine’s antidepressant action. We found that ketamine injection in depressive-like mice specifically blocks NMDARs in lateral habenular (LHb) neurons, but not in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. This regional specificity depended on the use-dependent nature of ketamine as a channel blocker, local neural activity, and the extrasynaptic reservoir pool size of NMDARs. Activating hippocampal or inactivating LHb neurons swapped their ketamine sensitivity. Conditional knockout of NMDARs in the LHb occluded ketamine’s antidepressant effects and blocked the systemic ketamine–induced elevation of serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. This distinction of the primary versus secondary brain target(s) of ketamine should help with the design of more precise and efficient antidepressant treatments.},

  abstract     = {During replication, RNA viruses frequently generate defective particles that parasitize and interfere with the replication and packaging of intact virus. Such defective particles may also stimulate host immune responses. Pitchai et al . developed a continuous culture method in which deletions were cloned into HIV to generate therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs). First, they showed that transduction-competent viral-like particles were produced conditionally in trans with intact HIV and reduced HIV load. Sequencing did not detect subsequent large deletions or rearrangements. Engineered TIPS were then tested with one injected dose in donated HIV-infected human cells, humanized mice, and nonhuman primates infected with HIV. These experiments verified seroconversion, suppression of HIV replication, and TIP persistence for at least 30 weeks. —Caroline Ash Antiviral therapies with reduced frequencies of administration and high barriers to resistance remain a major goal. For HIV, theories have proposed that viral-deletion variants, which conditionally replicate with a basic reproductive ratio [R 0 ] &gt; 1 (termed “therapeutic interfering particles” or “TIPs”), could parasitize wild-type virus to constitute single-administration, escape-resistant antiviral therapies. We report the engineering of a TIP that, in rhesus macaques, reduces viremia of a highly pathogenic model of HIV by &gt;3log 10 following a single intravenous injection. Animal lifespan was significantly extended, TIPs conditionally replicated and were continually detected for &gt;6 months, and sequencing data showed no evidence of viral escape. A single TIP injection also suppressed virus replication in humanized mice and cells from persons living with HIV. These data provide proof of concept for a potential new class of single-administration antiviral therapies.},

These include bimolecular and electron-induced chemical reactions, which are important in astrochemistry and atmospheric chemistry. Dantus reviewed the ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges and highlights recent experimental successes. The author provides background information, acknowledges seminal work, and explores future approaches to improving the ultrafast studies of these elusive chemical reactions. —Yury Suleymanov The chemical composition of the interstellar medium and planetary atmospheres is constantly in flux as atoms and molecules collide and interact with high-energy particles such as electrons, protons, and photons. These transformative processes ultimately lead to the coalescence of molecules and eventually the birth of stars. Our understanding of these chemical ecosystems relies on models that synthesize data from gas-phase experiments, providing insights into reaction cross sections. This Review examines efforts to delve into the fundamental bond-forming and bond-breaking dynamics that occur during bimolecular and electron-initiated reactions. These experiments involve clever approaches to establish a time reference and the collision geometry necessary for tracking atomic motion with femtosecond time resolution. Findings from these efforts enhance present models and improve predictions for molecule-molecule and electron-molecule collisions.},

  abstract     = {The Hippo pathway functions in the control of cell growth and development and other processes that link it to various human diseases. Guo et al . show that phase transitions of Merlin, a regulator that links input from cell membranes and the cytoskeleton to the Hippo pathway, are important for regulation of pathway signaling. Binding of Merlin at the cell membrane and condensation were promoted by phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate, amounts of which were increased by the Hippo activator Pez and inhibited by cytoskeletal tension. The solid condensates appear to stabilize signaling against cellular changes such as hypoxia or hypoosmotic stress. —L. Bryan Ray Despite recent studies implicating liquid-like biomolecular condensates in diverse cellular processes, many biomolecular condensates exist in a solid-like state, and their function and regulation are less understood. We show that the tumor suppressor Merlin, an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, localizes to both cell junctions and medial apical cortex in Drosophila epithelia, with the latter forming solid-like condensates that activate Hippo signaling. Merlin condensation required phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P)–mediated plasma membrane targeting and was antagonistically controlled by Pez and cytoskeletal tension through plasma membrane PI4P regulation. The solid-like material properties of Merlin condensates are essential for physiological function and protect the condensates against external perturbations. Collectively, these findings uncover an essential role for solid-like condensates in normal physiology and reveal regulatory mechanisms for their formation and disassembly.},

  abstract     = {Distinguishing self from nonself is an existential challenge for all organisms. Mammals have a battery of sensors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger immune responses. Well-known PAMPS include large molecules such as flagellin and lipopolysaccharide, but there is growing recognition of the role that small molecules can play as PAMPS. Tang et al . found that small nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) heptoses trigger α-protein kinase–dependent innate immune responses in vertebrates through the nuclear factor κB signaling cascade. The degree of host response depends on the nucleotide incorporated. These heptoses are synthesized across kingdoms by a range of viruses, prokaryotes, and simple eukaryotes, and may be used by vertebrates as signals of potential invading pathogens. —Caroline Ash Bacterial small molecule metabolites such as adenosine-diphosphate- d - glycero -β- d - manno -heptose (ADP-heptose) and their derivatives act as effective innate immune agonists in mammals. We show that functional nucleotide-diphosphate-heptose biosynthetic enzymes (HBEs) are distributed widely in bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. We identified a conserved STT R5 motif as a hallmark of heptose nucleotidyltransferases that can synthesize not only ADP-heptose but also cytidine-diphosphate (CDP)– and uridine-diphosphate (UDP)–heptose. Both CDP- and UDP-heptoses are agonists that trigger stronger alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1)–dependent immune responses than ADP-heptose in human and mouse cells and mice. We also produced ADP-heptose in archaea and verified its innate immune agonist functions. Hence, the β- d - manno -heptoses are cross-kingdom, small-molecule, pathogen-associated molecular patterns that activate the ALPK1-dependent innate immune signaling cascade.},

These molecules often require large—sometimes massive—enzymes or enzyme complexes for their biosynthesis. Fallon et al . identified genes from a toxic microalga corresponding to polyketide synthase megaenzymes that are among the largest proteins identified to date, one being nearly 5 megadaltons. The authors dubbed these systems PKZILLAs and matched the individual domains to structural features of prymnesin polyketide fish toxins. Understanding the biosynthesis of these marine toxins will aid with tracking harmful algal blooms and also expands our awareness of the limits of large protein synthesis. —Michael A. Funk Prymnesium parvum are harmful haptophyte algae that cause massive environmental fish kills. Their polyketide polyether toxins, the prymnesins, are among the largest nonpolymeric compounds in nature and have biosynthetic origins that have remained enigmatic for more than 40 years. In this work, we report the “PKZILLAs,” massive P. parvum polyketide synthase (PKS) genes that have evaded previous detection. PKZILLA-1 and -2 encode giant protein products of 4.7 and 3.2 megadaltons that have 140 and 99 enzyme domains. Their predicted polyene product matches the proposed pre-prymnesin precursor of the 90-carbon–backbone A-type prymnesins. We further characterize the variant PKZILLA-B1, which is responsible for the shorter B-type analog prymnesin-B1, from P. parvum RCC3426 and thus establish a general model of haptophyte polyether biosynthetic logic.

To study this phenomenon systematically, Lumey et al . obtained extensive data on people born in Ukraine before, during, and after Holodomor, a severe but time-limited famine of artificial origin that took place in the early 1930s (see the Perspective by Klimek and Thurner). By correlating these data with records from a national register of type 2 diabetes from the 2000s, the authors were able to demonstrate a dose-dependent impact of prenatal famine exposure on the risk of developing diabetes later in life. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The short-term impact of famines on death and disease is well documented, but estimating their potential long-term impact is difficult. We used the setting of the man-made Ukrainian Holodomor famine of 1932–1933 to examine the relation between prenatal famine and adult type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This ecological study included 128,225 T2DM cases diagnosed from 2000 to 2008 among 10,186,016 male and female Ukrainians born from 1930 to 1938. Individuals who were born in the first half-year of 1934, and hence exposed in early gestation to the mid-1933 peak famine period, had a greater than twofold likelihood of T2DM compared with that of unexposed controls. There was a dose-response relationship between severity of famine exposure and increase in adult T2DM risk.},

Rogger et al . show that the biological evolution and geographical dispersal of terrestrial vegetation, as it adapts to the climate shock caused by magmatic emplacement, exerts a fundamental control on the duration and intensity of such a hyperthermal period. Their reconstructions of the Permian-Triassic, Triassic-Jurassic, and Paleocene-Eocene global warming events illustrate how the dynamics of the living biosphere shape the Earth system’s response to sudden major degassing and global warming episodes over millions of years. —Jesse Smith Periods of large igneous province (LIP) magmatism have shaped Earth’s biological and climatic history, causing major climatic shifts and biological reorganizations. The vegetation response to LIP-induced perturbations may affect the efficiency of the carbon-climate regulation system and the post-LIP climate evolution. Using an eco-evolutionary vegetation model, we demonstrate here that the vegetation’s climate adaptation capacity, through biological evolution and geographic dispersal, is a major determinant of the severity and longevity of LIP-induced hyperthermals and can promote the emergence of a new climatic steady state. Proxy-based temperature reconstructions of the Permian-Triassic, Triassic-Jurassic, and Paleocene-Eocene hyperthermals match the modeled trajectories of bioclimatic disturbance and recovery. We conclude that biological vegetation dynamics shape the multimillion-year Earth system response to sudden carbon degassing and global warming episodes.},

The authors reported a ferrocene-supported ytterbium complex that exhibits an ultranarrow absorption linewidth in solution at room temperature. Their work showcases the potential of tailor-designed molecules in liquid-based precision quantum sensing, which may spark future applications. However, the design principles for such a narrow transition in lanthanide complexes require further investigation. —Yury Suleymanov The energetic disorder induced by fluctuating liquid environments acts in opposition to the precise control required for coherence-based sensing. Overcoming fluctuations requires a protected quantum subspace that only weakly interacts with the local environment. We report a ytterbium complex that exhibited an ultranarrow absorption linewidth in solution at room temperature with a full width at half maximum of 0.625 milli–electron volts. Using spectral hole burning, we measured an even narrower linewidth of 410 pico–electron volts at 77 kelvin. Narrow linewidths allowed low-field magnetic circular dichroism at room temperature, used to sense Earth-scale magnetic fields. These results demonstrated that ligand protection in lanthanide complexes could substantially diminish electronic state fluctuations.

We found that a metal (gold) containing spherical voids with a fraction of up to 10% does not fracture prematurely in tension when the voids are shrunk to the submicron or nanometer scale. Instead, the dispersed nanovoids increase the strength and ductility of the material while simultaneously reducing its weight. Apart from the suppressed stress or strain concentration, such structure provides enormous surface area and promotes surface-dislocation interactions, which enable strengthening and additional strain hardening and thus toughening.

We find depleted compositions with notable variations in mantle mineralogy controlled by melt flow. Dunite zones have predominantly intermediate dips, in contrast to the originally steep mantle fabrics, indicative of oblique melt transport.

  abstract     = {The motion of electrons in topological solid-state devices can be controlled in a manner analogous to quantum optics under certain circumstances. Central to this concept are topological edge states, which ideally should exhibit no backscattering and should not require an applied magnetic field. Huang et al . observed a very precise quantization of resistance associated with a type of helical edge states called kink states in bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. The quantization exhibited only a slight deterioration as the temperature was increased to about 50 K, indicating protection against backscattering. —Jelena Stajic Edge states of a topological insulator can be used to explore fundamental science emerging at the interface of low dimensionality and topology. Achieving a robust conductance quantization, however, has proven challenging for helical edge states. In this work, we show wide resistance plateaus in kink states—a manifestation of the quantum valley Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene—quantized to the predicted value at zero magnetic field. The plateau resistance has a very weak temperature dependence up to 50 kelvin and is flat within a dc bias window of tens of millivolts. We demonstrate the electrical operation of a topology-controlled switch with an on/off ratio of 200. These results demonstrate the robustness and tunability of the kink states and its promise in constructing electron quantum optics devices.},

  abstract     = {Sharp projections derived from plant epidermis, known as prickles, are found across many plant species, the most iconic perhaps being roses. However, the genetic basis of prickles is unknown in many species, and it is unclear how broadly this architecture is shared. Satterlee et al . performed phylogenetic analyses across the genus Solanum and identified LOG family genes, enzymes underlying cytokinin biosynthesis, which when disrupted result in prickle loss in multiple species (see the Perspective by Kellogg). The authors performed CRISPR experiments in several species, including an indigenous crop, and found that loss of these genes greatly reduces or eliminates prickles without off-target phenotypic effects. This study sheds light on convergent evolution and provides a genetic target for prickle removal in crops. —Corinne N. Simonti An enduring question in evolutionary biology concerns the degree to which episodes of convergent trait evolution depend on the same genetic programs, particularly over long timescales. In this work, we genetically dissected repeated origins and losses of prickles—sharp epidermal projections—that convergently evolved in numerous plant lineages. Mutations in a cytokinin hormone biosynthetic gene caused at least 16 independent losses of prickles in eggplants and wild relatives in the genus Solanum . Homologs underlie prickle formation across angiosperms that collectively diverged more than 150 million years ago, including rice and roses. By developing new Solanum genetic systems, we leveraged this discovery to eliminate prickles in a wild species and an indigenously foraged berry. Our findings implicate a shared hormone activation genetic program underlying evolutionarily widespread and recurrent instances of plant morphological innovation.},

  abstract     = {The ability to model Alzheimer’s disease is critical for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and for identifying effective therapies. Sporadic, nongenetic, late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is the most common form, but unfortunately, LOAD models are lacking. Sun et al . developed a microRNA-based direct reprogramming approach using fibroblasts from individuals with LOAD. The authors generated neurons presenting the major hallmarks of the disease, including depositions of the proteins Aβ and tau and dysregulation of age-associated transposable elements. Preventing transposable element dysregulation rescued neurodegeneration and reduced Aβ deposition. Using direct reprogramming for modeling LOAD could help in the development of treatments for this incurable disorder. —Mattia Maroso Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is the most common form of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, modeling sporadic LOAD that endogenously captures hallmark neuronal pathologies such as amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau tangles, and neuronal loss remains an unmet need. We demonstrate that neurons generated by microRNA (miRNA)–based direct reprogramming of fibroblasts from individuals affected by autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) and LOAD in a three-dimensional environment effectively recapitulate key neuropathological features of AD. Reprogrammed LOAD neurons exhibit Aβ-dependent neurodegeneration, and treatment with β- or γ-secretase inhibitors before (but not subsequent to) Aβ deposit formation mitigated neuronal death. Moreover inhibiting age-associated retrotransposable elements in LOAD neurons reduced both Aβ deposition and neurodegeneration. Our study underscores the efficacy of modeling late-onset neuropathology of LOAD through high-efficiency miRNA-based neuronal reprogramming.},

  abstract     = {Sharks are well known as massive top predators with large pelagic ranges. This conception is accurate but too narrow. Sharks occupy a wide variety of niches and come in a range of sizes and shapes. Dedman et al . reviewed the ecological roles that sharks play and their importance in terms of how they affect their ecosystems. Many sharks are essential to ecosystem functioning, and many of these effects have been altered by human impacts on shark populations. Rebuilding these populations is essential not only for conserving sharks, but also for conserving their ecological function. —Sacha Vignieri In ecosystems, sharks can be predators, competitors, facilitators, nutrient transporters, and food. However, overfishing and other threats have greatly reduced shark populations, altering their roles and effects on ecosystems. We review these changes and implications for ecosystem function and management. Macropredatory sharks are often disproportionately affected by humans but can influence prey and coastal ecosystems, including facilitating carbon sequestration. Like terrestrial predators, sharks may be crucial to ecosystem functioning under climate change. However, large ecosystem effects of sharks are not ubiquitous. Increasing human uses of oceans are changing shark roles, necessitating management consideration. Rebuilding key populations and incorporating shark ecological roles, including less obvious ones, into management efforts are critical for retaining sharks’ functional value. Coupled social-ecological frameworks can facilitate these efforts.},

  abstract     = {The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a ring-shaped clamp that encircles DNA and slides along the DNA duplex. The PCNA ring binds numerous DNA metabolic factors to recruit them to DNA and/or enhance their speed and efficiency on DNA. PCNA requires a multisubunit ATPase-driven “clamp loader” to get onto DNA. Eukaryotes have four distinct clamp loaders. Yuan et al . solved the structure of the Ctf18-RFC clamp loader, which specifically binds the DNA polymerase ε (Polε) that is dedicated to synthesis of the leading strand of the duplex DNA genome. The structure reveals unique features in both Ctf18-RFC and Polε that have been crafted over evolutionary time to ensure their interdependent function. —Di Jiang The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) clamp encircles DNA to hold DNA polymerases (Pols) to DNA for processivity. The Ctf18-RFC PCNA loader, a replication factor C (RFC) variant, is specific to the leading-strand Pol (Polε). We reveal here the underlying mechanism of Ctf18-RFC specificity to Polε using cryo–electron microscopy and biochemical studies. We found that both Ctf18-RFC and Polε contain specific structural features that direct PCNA loading onto DNA. Unlike other clamp loaders, Ctf18-RFC has a disordered ATPase associated with a diverse cellular activities (AAA+) motor that requires Polε to bind and stabilize it for efficient PCNA loading. In addition, Ctf18-RFC can pry prebound Polε off of DNA, then load PCNA onto DNA and transfer the PCNA-DNA back to Polε. These elements in both Ctf18-RFC and Polε provide specificity in loading PCNA onto DNA for Polε.},

  abstract     = {The importance of communication between neurons and the gut immune system is becoming increasingly recognized. Using mouse models, Zhu et al . individually and systematically activated distinct neuronal subsets that innervate the intestine and examined the impact on the frequencies of immune cell subsets in gut tissues (see the Perspective by Vergnolle). Responses varied and depended on the neuronal type activated, demonstrating the complexity of neuroimmune relationships. A subset of regulatory T cells expressing the transcription factor RORγ decreased in frequency in the colon and cecum after activation of spinal sensory neurons expressing the pain receptor Trpv1. These neurons communicated with the T cells directly through the calcitonin gene–related peptide. —Sarah H. Ross Neuroimmune cross-talk participates in intestinal tissue homeostasis and host defense. However, the matrix of interactions between arrays of molecularly defined neuron subsets and of immunocyte lineages remains unclear. We used a chemogenetic approach to activate eight distinct neuronal subsets, assessing effects by deep immunophenotyping, microbiome profiling, and immunocyte transcriptomics in intestinal organs. Distinct immune perturbations followed neuronal activation: Nitrergic neurons regulated T helper 17 (T H 17)–like cells, and cholinergic neurons regulated neutrophils. Nociceptor neurons, expressing Trpv1, elicited the broadest immunomodulation, inducing changes in innate lymphocytes, macrophages, and RORγ + regulatory T (T reg ) cells. Neuroanatomical, genetic, and pharmacological follow-up showed that Trpv1 + neurons in dorsal root ganglia decreased T reg cell numbers via the neuropeptide calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP). Given the role of these neurons in nociception, these data potentially link pain signaling with gut T reg cell function.},

  abstract     = {When three-dimensional (3D) printing polymers, there is a trade-off between fast hardening, which ensures the strength and fidelity of the printed shape, and a slower reaction rate, which allows for more downstream processing but may not be compatible with some printing methods such as vat polymerization. Dhand et al . designed monomers that can be partially reacted using fast photo-initiated polymerization followed by a slow, redox initiated process, thus forming long polymer chains with dense entanglements. The key to the process is to keep the content of the initiators at a low level. The method enables the printing of objects with functional monomers, complex shapes, and multiple materials. —Marc S. Lavine Incorporation of polymer chain entanglements within a single network can synergistically improve stiffness and toughness, yet attaining such dense entanglements through vat photopolymerization additive manufacturing [e.g., digital light processing (DLP)] remains elusive. We report a facile strategy that combines light and dark polymerization to allow constituent polymer chains to densely entangle as they form within printed structures. This generalizable approach reaches high monomer conversion at room temperature without the need for additional stimuli, such as light or heat after printing, and enables additive manufacturing of highly entangled hydrogels and elastomers that exhibit fourfold- to sevenfold-higher extension energies in comparison to that of traditional DLP. We used this method to print high-resolution and multimaterial structures with features such as spatially programmed adhesion to wet tissues.},

  abstract     = {During the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, between ~1.2 million and 700 thousand years ago, the length of Earth’s glacial cycles changed from ~41,000 years to ~100,000 years, but the reason for this shift is not clear. An et al . combined climate and ice sheet records to show that growth of the Antarctic ice sheet and the associated expansion of Southern Ocean sea ice caused northern high-latitude cooling, more vigorous moisture transport to the Northern Hemisphere, and subsequent rapid growth of the Northern Hemispheric ice sheet, thereby triggering the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. —Jesse Smith Despite extensive investigation, the nature and causes of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition remain enigmatic. In this work, we assess its linkage to asynchronous development of bipolar ice sheets by synthesizing Pleistocene mid- to high-latitude proxy records linked to hemispheric ice sheet evolution. Our results indicate substantial growth of the Antarctic Ice Sheets (AISs) at 2.0 to 1.25 million years ago, preceding the rapid expansion of Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheets after ~1.25 million years ago. Proxy-model comparisons suggest that AIS and associated Southern Ocean sea ice expansion can induce northern high-latitude cooling and enhanced moisture transport to the Northern Hemisphere, thus triggering the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The dynamic processes involved are crucial for assessing modern global warming that is already inducing asynchronous bipolar melting of ice sheets.},

The resultant WBG absorbers show improved crystallinity and strong texture with suppressed nonradiative recombination and enhanced resistance to various aging stresses.

Their statistical analysis showed that by using a shuttering system and measuring the time to get to a predetermined number of detection counts, the total electron flux could be reduced for the same resolution. The authors applied their method to imaging beam-sensitive samples such as zeolites and human monocytes. —Phil Szuromi An ever-present limitation of transmission electron microscopy is the damage caused by high-energy electrons interacting with any sample. By reconsidering the fundamentals of imaging, we demonstrate an event-responsive approach to electron microscopy that delivers more information about the sample for a given beam current. Measuring the time to achieve an electron count threshold rather than waiting a predefined constant time improves the information obtained per electron. The microscope was made to respond to these events by blanking the beam, thus reducing the overall dose required. This approach automatically apportions dose to achieve a given signal-to-noise ratio in each pixel, eliminating excess dose that is associated with diminishing returns of information.

Shishania sclerites provide a morphological stepping stone between typical chaetae (chitinous bristles) and the external organic part of aculiferan sclerites that encloses a mineralized body.

  abstract     = {Crystallography is one of the core analytical techniques in the natural sciences. Various experimental advancements, such as noise-free detectors, synchrotrons, free-electron lasers, and the three-dimensional electron density electron diffraction technique, have made it possible to conduct fast experiments on weakly scattering, nanometer-sized crystals. However, interpretation of the data, especially determining the structure, still relies on methods that have not seen significant advancements for many decades. Using deep learning neural networks trained with millions of artificial crystal structures and their corresponding synthetic diffraction data, Larsen et al . developed an approach demonstrating exceptionally high predictive capabilities, which produced accurate electron density maps. The framework considered only centrosymmetric space groups, but with further research, it could be extended to other space groups. —Yury Suleymanov X-ray crystallography provides a distinctive view on the three-dimensional structure of crystals. To reconstruct the electron density map, the complex structure factors F = F exp i ϕ of a sufficiently large number of diffracted reflections must be known. In a conventional experiment, only the amplitudes F are obtained, and the phases ϕ are lost. This is the crystallographic phase problem. In this work, we show that a neural network, trained on millions of artificial structure data, can solve the phase problem at a resolution of only 2 angstroms, using only 10 to 20% of the data needed for direct methods. The network works in common space groups and for modest unit-cell dimensions and suggests that neural networks could be used to solve the phase problem in the general case for weakly scattering crystals.},

  abstract     = {Tropical glaciers, which are particularly vulnerable to climate warming, have retreated rapidly over recent decades, but how large they are now compared with during the rest of the Holocene is unclear. Gorin et al . report measurements of cosmogenic nuclides in recently exposed bedrock at the margin of glaciers in the tropical Andes showing that these locations remained covered by ice throughout the Holocene, implying that these glaciers, at least, are smaller now than they have been in at least 11,700 years. These findings are a dramatic reminder of just how perilous the state of tropical glaciers is in our warming world. —Jesse Smith Tropical glaciers have retreated over recent decades, but whether the magnitude of this retreat exceeds the bounds of Holocene fluctuations is unclear. We measured cosmogenic beryllium-10 and carbon-14 concentrations in recently exposed bedrock at the margin of four glaciers spanning the tropical Andes to reconstruct their past extents relative to today. Nuclide concentrations are near zero in almost all samples, suggesting that these locations were never exposed during the Holocene. Our data imply that many glaciers in the tropics are probably now smaller than they have been in at least 11,700 years, making the tropics the first large region where this milestone has been documented.},

  abstract     = {Determining the evolutionary origins of CRISPR-Cas bacterial immune systems can help to explain the functions of RNA-guided enzymes. Although DNA targeting class II CRISPR-Cas enzymes, including Cas9 and Cas12, likely emerged from transposon-encoded nucleases, the origins of the RNA-targeting Cas13 systems have been unknown. Yoon et al . used molecular structure–guided protein database searches to trace the origins of highly divergent Cas13 enzymes. This approach uncovered an ancient group of tiny, RNA-guided Cas13s that provide robust antiphage defense in Escherichia coli . Despite unrelated origins, early Cas13 enzymes share intriguing properties with early DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems, suggesting convergent evolution of all class II CRISPR-Cas systems. —Di Jiang The RNA-guided ribonuclease CRISPR-Cas13 enables adaptive immunity in bacteria and programmable RNA manipulation in heterologous systems. Cas13s share limited sequence similarity, hindering discovery of related or ancestral systems. To address this, we developed an automated structural-search pipeline to identify an ancestral clade of Cas13 (Cas13an) and further trace Cas13 origins to defense-associated ribonucleases. Despite being one-third the size of other Cas13s, Cas13an mediates robust programmable RNA depletion and defense against diverse bacteriophages. However, unlike its larger counterparts, Cas13an uses a single active site for both CRISPR RNA processing and RNA-guided cleavage, revealing that the ancestral nuclease domain has two modes of activity. Discovery of Cas13an deepens our understanding of CRISPR-Cas evolution and expands opportunities for precision RNA editing, showcasing the promise of structure-guided genome mining.},

  abstract     = {In the Report “Kinetics of dCas9 target search in Escherichia coli” (29 Sep 2017, p. 1420), the model underlying the analysis of nonspecific binding times was based on an incorrect assumption. Fluorescent spots were observed for labeled dCas9 protein bound to DNA. It was assumed that a nonspecifically bound molecule would be observed as a spot when the laser exposure starts during a binding event, which is at least as long as the laser exposure but can also end during the laser exposure. However, it has since been determined that it would be better to analyze the data using a new model based on the assumption that the molecule needs to be bound during the entire exposure to be observed as a spot. The revised supplementary materials provide a derivation of the formalism that was needed to analyze the experimental data according to this new model. Fig. 4 has been updated to reflect analysis of the data with the new model as follows: A schematic illustrating the effect of requiring the molecule to be bound for the full exposure has been added as Fig. 4B, and the analysis of the experimental data is now shown in Fig. 4C. Reanalysis of the data gave an average non-specific residence time of &lt;40 ms instead of &lt;30 ms, as was originally reported. The main text has been updated to reflect the changes to Fig. 4, B and C. The revised analysis does not change the overall conclusions about Cas9 search kinetics and binding properties.},

Stochastic expression of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) genes is proposed to underlie the diversity of neural morphologies and connectivity patterns within the nervous system. Kiefer et al . found that stochastic Pcdh gene choice requires coupling between genome folding and epigenetic silencing, and that the diversification of expression across neurons rests on the DNA loop extrusion activity of cohesion across neural cell types (see the Perspective by Kawaoka and Lomvardas). These findings suggest a logic for the diversification of neural anatomy and functions and reveal general principles for how genes arranged in clusters can hardwire stochasticity to achieve cellular singularity. —Di Jiang Expression of Protocadherin (Pcdh) genes is critical to the generation of neuron identity and wiring of the nervous system. Pcdhα genes are arranged in clusters and exhibit a range of expression profiles, from stochastic to deterministic. Because Pcdhα promoters have high sequence identity and share distal enhancers, how distinct neurons choose which gene to express remains unclear. We show that the interplay between multiple enhancers, epigenetics, and genome folding orchestrates differential readouts of the locus across neurons. The probability of Pcdhα promoter choice depends on enhancer/promoter encounters catalyzed by cohesin, whose extrusion trajectories determine the likelihood that an individual promoter can “escape” heterochromatin-mediated silencing. We propose that tunable locus-specific regulatory elements and cell type–specific cohesin activity underlie the generation of cellular diversity by Pcdh genes.},

We applied this scaling using supercomputing and unveiled large dynamic rupture earthquake cascades involving &gt;700 multiscale fractures within a fault damage zone.

Condic et al . studied many varieties of domesticated and wild yeast to understand how increasing concentrations of ethanol, an Hsp90 stressor, interact with the metabolism of different sugars. They found that redundancy of genes involved in sugar metabolism can result in improved survival, and these gene duplications replicate known phenomena in yeast that have been domesticated for brewing. —Corinne N.

We uncover this surprising duality in the role of the protein-folding chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in maintaining the integrity of yeast metabolism amid proteotoxic stressors within industrial domestication niches. Ethanol disrupts critical Hsp90-dependent metabolic pathways and exerts strong selective pressure for redundant duplications of key genes within these pathways, yielding the classical genomic signatures of beer and bread domestication.

The mechanism underlying this recruitment of neurons is currently unknown. Santoni et al . addressed this issue by focusing on chromatin plasticity in the lateral amygdala during associative fear learning (see the Perspective by Krabbe). After increasing chromatin plasticity by sparsely overexpressing histone acetyl transferases, neurons with elevated histone acetylation were preferentially enrolled into the engram. This overexpression altered intrinsic excitability of lateral amygdala principal cells, and this was accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility and altered gene expression, mainly of synaptic proteins. These results indicate that a neuron’s epigenetic makeup defines its eligibility to be selected for storing learned information. —Peter Stern Memories are encoded by sparse populations of neurons but how such sparsity arises remains largely unknown. We found that a neuron’s eligibility to be recruited into the memory trace depends on its epigenetic state prior to encoding. Principal neurons in the mouse lateral amygdala display intrinsic chromatin plasticity, which when experimentally elevated favors neuronal allocation into the encoding ensemble. Such chromatin plasticity occurred at genomic regions underlying synaptic plasticity and was accompanied by increased neuronal excitability in single neurons in real time. Lastly, optogenetic silencing of the epigenetically altered neurons prevented memory expression, revealing a cell-autonomous relationship between chromatin plasticity and memory trace formation. These results identify the epigenetic state of a neuron as a key factor enabling information encoding.},

Isomerization of complex molecules poses a challenge to this approach because tweaking one portion of the molecule can influence the sensitivity of others in the vicinity, leading to multiple competing processes. Carder et al . meticulously mapped out the rates of photo-driven stereoisomerization among the hexose sugars. By better understanding the full network of reactivity, they could then tune reaction times and catalyst design to select for particular isomers across the complex landscape. —Jake S. Yeston Stereochemical editing strategies have recently enabled the transformation of readily accessible substrates into rare and valuable products. Typically, site selectivity is achieved by minimizing kinetic complexity by using protecting groups to suppress reactivity at undesired sites (substrate control) or by using catalysts with tailored shapes to drive reactivity at the desired site (catalyst control). We propose “network control,” a contrasting paradigm that exploits hidden interactions between rate constants to greatly amplify modest intrinsic biases and enable precise multisite editing. When network control is applied to the photochemical isomerization of hexoses, six of the eight possible diastereomers can be selectively obtained. The amplification effect can be viewed as a mesoscale phenomenon between the limiting regimes of kinetic control in simple chemical systems and metabolic regulation in complex biological systems.},

Wang et al . demonstrate a platform for quantum computing that can be operated using discrete and digital control pulses only. Using a small array of quantum dots, they show that spin states can be moved from one dot to another with what is in effect a nudge and a hop. Extending the effect to a larger array demonstrates the ability to process quantum information on what can be a simpler platform requiring lower hardware overhead. —Ian S. Osborne Qubits that can be efficiently controlled are essential for the development of scalable quantum hardware. Although resonant control is used to execute high-fidelity quantum gates, the scalability is challenged by the integration of high-frequency oscillating signals, qubit cross-talk, and heating. Here, we show that by engineering the hopping of spins between quantum dots with a site-dependent spin quantization axis, quantum control can be established with discrete signals. We demonstrate hopping-based quantum logic and obtain single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.97%, coherent shuttling fidelities of 99.992% per hop, and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.3%, corresponding to error rates that have been predicted to allow for quantum error correction. We also show that hopping spins constitute a tuning method by statistically mapping the coherence of a 10–quantum dot system. Our results show that dense quantum dot arrays with sparse occupation could be developed for efficient and high-connectivity qubit registers.},

The strong lead-fluoride bonds suppressed defect formation and immobilized anions near the surface. Power conversion efficiencies were 24.8% for 0.16-square-centimeter single cells and 18.1% for 228-square-centimeter modules. Modules not only showed uniform performance, but also exhibited minimal degradation after continuous operation for 3000 hours under 1-sun illumination at 40°C. —Phil Szuromi The ever-increasing power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has illuminated the future of the photovoltaic industry, but the development of commercial devices is hampered by their poor stability. In this study, we report a scalable stabilization method using vapor-phase fluoride treatment, which achieves 18.1%-efficient solar modules (228 square centimeters) with accelerated aging–projected T 80 lifetimes (time to 80% of efficiency remaining) of 43,000 ± 9000 hours under 1-sun illumination at 30°C. The high stability results from vapor-enabled homogeneous fluorine passivation over large-area perovskite surfaces, suppressing defect formation energy and ion diffusion. The extracted degradation activation energy of 0.61 electron volts for solar modules is comparable to that of most reported stable cells, which indicates that modules are not inherently less stable than cells and closes the cell-to-module stability gap.},

A corollary to more rain is the amplification of precipitation variability, a behavior easier to predict than to observe. Zhang et al . used global records of daily precipitation to show that this expected increase in precipitation variability is in fact detectable in the data over the past century. This trend, which is most prominent over Europe, Australia, and eastern North America, will make adaptation more difficult for societies and ecosystems. —Jesse Smith As the climate warms, the consequent moistening of the atmosphere increases extreme precipitation. Precipitation variability should also increase, producing larger wet-dry swings, but that is yet to be confirmed observationally. Here we show that precipitation variability has already grown globally (over 75% of land area) over the past century, as a result of accumulated anthropogenic warming. The increased variability is seen across daily to intraseasonal timescales, with daily variability increased by 1.2% per 10 years globally, and is particularly prominent over Europe, Australia, and eastern North America. Increased precipitation variability is driven mainly by thermodynamics linked to atmospheric moistening, modulated at decadal timescales by circulation changes.

  abstract     = {Ceramics break instead of deforming plastically, which can be partially attributed to their low number of dislocation defects compared with more ductile materials such as metals. Dong et al . show that by carefully choosing a ceramic-metal interface, the dislocation defects generated in the metal during straining can migrate into the ceramic. The result is a dramatic improvement in the tensile properties, suggesting a different way to improve the properties of brittle ceramics. —Brent Grocholski The inherent brittleness of ceramics, primarily due to restricted atomic motions from rigid ionic or covalent bonded structures, is a persistent challenge. This characteristic hinders dislocation nucleation in ceramics, thereby impeding the enhancement of plasticity through a dislocation-engineering strategy commonly used in metals. Finding a strategy that continuously generates dislocations within ceramics may enhance plasticity. Here, we propose a “borrowing-dislocations” strategy that uses a tailored interfacial structure with well-ordered bonds. Such an approach enables ceramics to have greatly improved tensile ductility by mobilizing a considerable number of dislocations in ceramic borrowed from metal through the interface, thereby overcoming the challenge associated with direct dislocation nucleation within ceramics. This strategy provides a way to enhance tensile ductility in ceramics.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-fluorine bonds are notoriously scarce within naturally occurring biomolecules. Li et al . developed an enzymatic approach in which trifluoroiodoethane serves as a fluoroalkyl donor through radical addition to a vinyl arene. The enzyme uses a flavin cofactor as a chromophore, and the active site provides stereocontrol over hydrogen atom transfer to the radical intermediate. The authors performed computational and biochemical experiments to study the mechanism and expand the scope of the reaction to include longer fluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chains. —Michael A. Funk Enzymes capable of assimilating fluorinated feedstocks are scarce. This situation poses a challenge for the biosynthesis of fluorinated compounds used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. We developed a photoenzymatic hydrofluoroalkylation that integrates fluorinated motifs into olefins. The photoinduced promiscuity of flavin-dependent ene-reductases enables the generation of carbon-centered radicals from iodinated fluoroalkanes, which are directed by the photoenzyme to engage enantioselectively with olefins. This approach facilitates stereocontrol through interaction between a singular fluorinated unit and the enzyme, securing high enantioselectivity at β, γ, or δ positions of fluorinated groups through enzymatic hydrogen atom transfer—a process that is notably challenging with conventional chemocatalysis. This work advances enzymatic strategies for integrating fluorinated chemical feedstocks and opens avenues for asymmetric synthesis of fluorinated compounds.},

  abstract     = {The neural mechanisms underlying social behavior during development are not fully understood. Li et al . studied the neural basis of the infant-mother bond in mice during pups’ separation and reunion with their mothers. Somatostatin-expressing neurons in the zona incerta area of the brain increased their activity upon a pup’s reunion with its own mother. Modulating the activity of this neuronal population affected stress and learning behavior in pups, suggesting that these neurons are critical for processing social sensory information during infancy to minimize stress and enhance learning. —Mattia Maroso Understanding the neural basis of infant social behaviors is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of early social and emotional development. In this work, we report a specific population of somatostatin-expressing neurons in the zona incerta (ZI SST ) of preweaning mice that responds dynamically to social interactions, particularly those with their mother. Bidirectional neural activity manipulations in pups revealed that widespread connectivity of preweaning ZI SST neurons to sensory, emotional, and cognitive brain centers mediates two key adaptive functions associated with maternal presence: the reduction of behavior distress and the facilitation of learning. These findings reveal a population of neurons in the infant mouse brain that coordinate the positive effects of the relationship with the mother on an infant’s behavior and physiology.},

This Review highlights insights from two popular in situ measurement methods—mobile monitoring and dense sensor networks—that have distinct but complementary strengths in characterizing the dynamics and impacts of the multidimensional urban air quality system. Mobile monitoring can measure many pollutants at fine spatial scales, thereby informing about processes and control strategies. Sensor networks excel at providing temporal resolution at many locations. Increasingly sophisticated studies leveraging both methods can vividly identify spatial and temporal patterns that affect exposures and disparities and offer mechanistic insight toward effective interventions.

  abstract     = {Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a pivotal role in signaling the termination of food consumption. GLP-1 receptor agonists are highly successful medications for obesity that are linked to shifts in food cognition, including diminished hypothalamic responses to food cues and alterations in the perception of food palatability in humans. However, the targets of these agonists have not been fully clarified. Kim et al . identified hypothalamic circuits that interact with these agonists to induce dampening of the desire for food. These results offer insights into the neural pathways by which GLP-1 receptor agonists increase cognitive satiation to prevent the overconsumption of food, which is key to mitigating obesity. —Peter Stern Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are effective antiobesity drugs. However, the precise central mechanisms of GLP-1RAs remain elusive. We administered GLP-1RAs to patients with obesity and observed a heightened sense of preingestive satiation. Analysis of human and mouse brain samples pinpointed GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) as candidates for encoding preingestive satiation. Optogenetic manipulation of DMH GLP-1R neurons caused satiation. Calcium imaging demonstrated that these neurons are actively involved in encoding preingestive satiation. GLP-1RA administration increased the activity of DMH GLP-1R neurons selectively during eating behavior. We further identified that an intricate interplay between DMH GLP-1R neurons and neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC NPY/AgRP neurons) occurs to regulate food intake. Our findings reveal a hypothalamic mechanism through which GLP-1RAs control preingestive satiation, offering previously unexplored neural targets for obesity and metabolic diseases.},

Errors are more likely to occur with age, especially with smaller chromosomes, but the reasons for this pattern are poorly understood. Takenouchi et al . established a method to identify and track targeted chromosomes throughout meiosis in live mouse oocytes. This method revealed that smaller chromosomes actively move toward the inner region of the spindle equator, creating a chromosome size–based spatial arrangement on the metaphase plate. Inner positioning of smaller chromosomes increases the risk of their premature separation, a hallmark of aging-associated errors in oocytes. —Di Jiang Meiotic errors of relatively small chromosomes in oocytes result in egg aneuploidies that cause miscarriages and congenital diseases. Unlike somatic cells, which preferentially mis-segregate larger chromosomes, aged oocytes preferentially mis-segregate smaller chromosomes through unclear processes. Here, we provide a comprehensive three-dimensional chromosome identifying-and-tracking dataset throughout meiosis I in live mouse oocytes. This analysis reveals a prometaphase pathway that actively moves smaller chromosomes to the inner region of the metaphase plate. In the inner region, chromosomes are pulled by stronger bipolar microtubule forces, which facilitates premature chromosome separation, a major cause of segregation errors in aged oocytes. This study reveals a spatial pathway that facilitates aneuploidy of small chromosomes preferentially in aged eggs and implicates the role of the M phase in creating a chromosome size–based spatial arrangement.},

Moran et al . developed a chemical labeling approach (mitoDMS-MaPseq) and used a clustering algorithm to reveal the folding patterns of mitochondrial mRNA (mt-mRNA) in wild-type and LRPPRC-deficient cells. LRPPRC is a protein crucial for mt-mRNA maintenance and translation and acts as an mRNA holdase, influencing mRNA folding. Analyses of genome-wide and mt-mRNA–specific folding features revealed mRNA-programmed translational pausing and programmed ribosomal frameshifting. These findings establish a pivotal layer in mitochondrial gene expression, providing mt-mRNA folding maps for diverse physiological and pathological studies. —Di Jiang The human mitochondrial genome encodes crucial oxidative phosphorylation system proteins, pivotal for aerobic energy transduction. They are translated from nine monocistronic and two bicistronic transcripts whose native structures remain unexplored, posing a gap in understanding mitochondrial gene expression. In this work, we devised the mitochondrial dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (mitoDMS-MaPseq) method and applied detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation-maximization (DREEM) clustering to unravel the native mitochondrial messenger RNA (mt-mRNA) structurome in wild-type (WT) and leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat–containing protein (LRPPRC)–deficient cells. Our findings elucidate LRPPRC’s role as a holdase contributing to maintaining mt-mRNA folding and efficient translation. mt-mRNA structural insights in WT mitochondria, coupled with metabolic labeling, unveil potential mRNA-programmed translational pausing and a distinct programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism.

Recent advances have improved the resolution with which these interactions can be identified through proximity labeling, but it is a challenge to integrate information from different length scales. Lin et al . developed an approach that uses an organic photocatalyst that can activate several common reactive probes with different radical half-lives corresponding to different distance scales. Using a workflow called MultiMap, the authors identified a large number of partner proteins for a key cell surface receptor and profile cell-cell interactions in a T cell immune synapse model. —Michael A. Funk Proximity labeling proteomics (PLP) strategies are powerful approaches to yield snapshots of protein neighborhoods. Here, we describe a multiscale PLP method with adjustable resolution that uses a commercially available photocatalyst, Eosin Y, which upon visible light illumination activates different photo-probes with a range of labeling radii. We applied this platform to profile neighborhoods of the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor and orthogonally validated more than 20 neighbors using immunoassays and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction. We further profiled the protein neighborhoods of cell-cell synapses induced by bispecific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. This integrated multiscale PLP platform maps local and distal protein networks on and between cell surfaces, which will aid in the systematic construction of the cell surface interactome, revealing horizontal signaling partners and reveal new immunotherapeutic opportunities.},

This shortcoming limits both the biological insights that can be gleaned from these data and their clinical applications to non-European patients, who may not match up well with the traditional study participants. To address this problem, the Million Veterans Program recruited hundreds of thousands of US veterans of various ethnic backgrounds for study. Verma et al . present this resource, as well as a few discoveries of genetic connections to disease that emerged from their diverse dataset (see the Perspective by Williamson and Fatumo). —Yevgeniya Nusinovich One of the justifiable criticisms of human genetic studies is the underrepresentation of participants from diverse populations. Lack of inclusion must be addressed at-scale to identify causal disease factors and understand the genetic causes of health disparities. We present genome-wide associations for 2068 traits from 635,969 participants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program, a longitudinal study of diverse United States Veterans. Systematic analysis revealed 13,672 genomic risk loci; 1608 were only significant after including non-European populations. Fine-mapping identified causal variants at 6318 signals across 613 traits. One-third ( n = 2069) were identified in participants from non-European populations.

However, the microbiota may have life history traits and a capacity for rapid evolution at odds with host traits. Wilde et al . reviewed the challenges to the microbiota of living with chronic competition and in highly dynamic environments. To prevent being overwhelmed by their microbiota, hosts have evolved a diversity of mechanisms to constrain them yet still be able to reap nutritional and other benefits from them. Conversely, some constituents of the microbiota have evolved to elude host surveillance to further their fitness and emerge as pathogens. —Caroline Ash Many species, including humans, host communities of symbiotic microbes. There is a vast literature on the ways these microbiomes affect hosts, but here we argue for an increased focus on how hosts affect their microbiomes. Hosts exert control over their symbionts through diverse mechanisms, including immunity, barrier function, physiological homeostasis, and transit. These mechanisms enable hosts to shape the ecology and evolution of microbiomes and generate natural selection for microbial traits that benefit the host. Our microbiomes result from a perpetual tension between host control and symbiont evolution, and we can leverage the host’s evolved abilities to regulate the microbiota to prevent and treat disease. The study of host control will be central to our ability to both understand and manipulate microbiotas for better health.},

  abstract     = {Across their geographic ranges, animals experience different levels of environmental stress and different types of resources, both of which may lead them to select different foods in different places. Species may be more stressed at the limits of their ranges, where conditions become less favorable. Therefore, Martins et al . hypothesized that frugivorous birds may optimize their fruit selection by favoring fruits that more closely match their beak size, which provide the most food per effort, near range edges (see the Perspective by Hargreaves and Alexander). Data on fruit feeding from 196 bird communities showed support for this hypothesis, but only among birds with a diet that consists mainly of fruit. These choices may contribute to geographic variation in species fitness and seed dispersal patterns. —Bianca Lopez Animals can adjust their diet to maximize energy or nutritional intake. For example, birds often target fruits that match their beak size because those fruits can be consumed more efficiently. We hypothesized that pressure to optimize diet—measured as matching between fruit and beak size—increases under stressful environments, such as those that determine species’ range edges. Using fruit-consumption and trait information for 97 frugivorous bird and 831 plant species across six continents, we demonstrate that birds feed more frequently on closely size-matched fruits near their geographic range limits. This pattern was particularly strong for highly frugivorous birds, whereas opportunistic frugivores showed no such tendency. These findings highlight how frugivore interactions might respond to stressful conditions and reveal that trait matching may not predict resource use consistently.},

Yeston Diazo compounds and organic azides are widely used as reagents for accessing valuable molecules in multiple areas of fundamental and applied chemistry. Their capacity to undergo versatile chemical transformations arises from the reactive nature of an incipient dinitrogen molecule at the terminal position. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)–stabilized diazoborane—a boron-centered analog of organic azides and diazoalkanes. The diazoborane displays a strong tendency to release dinitrogen, thus serving as a borylene source, in analogy to organic azides and diazoalkanes serving as nitrene and carbene sources, respectively. Also reminiscent of diazoalkane and organic azide reactivity, the diazoborane serves as a 1,3-dipole that undergoes uncatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition with an unactivated terminal alkyne, affording a five-membered heterocycle after a two-step rearrangement.},

  abstract     = {Earth’s climate underwent a dramatic transition around 34 million years ago, when the Antarctic Ice Sheet first began to form, but the regional evolution of that ice sheet remains poorly defined. Klages et al . present data from marine sediments near West Antarctica showing that conditions there during the beginning of the Oligocene were mild and unfavorable to the growth of a permanent ice sheet. Model results based on those data suggest that the ice sheet in West Antarctica did not begin to form until 7 or 8 million years after the process began in East Antarctica. —Jesse Smith One of Earth’s most fundamental climate shifts, the greenhouse-icehouse transition 34 million years ago, initiated Antarctic ice sheet buildup, influencing global climate until today. However, the extent of the ice sheet during the Early Oligocene Glacial Maximum (~33.7 to 33.2 million years ago) that immediately followed this transition—a critical knowledge gap for assessing feedbacks between permanently glaciated areas and early Cenozoic global climate reorganization—is uncertain. In this work, we present shallow-marine drilling data constraining earliest Oligocene environmental conditions on West Antarctica’s Pacific margin—a key region for understanding Antarctic ice sheet evolution. These data indicate a cool-temperate environment with mild ocean and air temperatures that prevented West Antarctic Ice Sheet formation. Climate–ice sheet modeling corroborates a highly asymmetric Antarctic ice sheet, thereby revealing its differential regional response to past and future climatic change.},

Despite the wealth of chiro-optical studies on these materials, their charge-to-spin conversion efficiency is unknown. We demonstrate highly efficient electrically driven charge-to-spin conversion in enantiopure chiral perovskites (R/S-MB) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 (〈 n 〉 = 4), where MB is 2-methylbutylamine, MA is methylamine, Pb is lead, and I is iodine.

In addition to current-induced transverse spin current, the presence of a coexisting out-of-plane spin current confirms that both conventional and collinear spin Hall conductivities exist in these low-dimensional crystals.},

Koike et al . introduce a convenient and surprisingly stable reagent that can deliver bare carbon atoms in reactions with carbonyls. The structure is a sort of ylide-diazo hybrid that sandwiches the carbon between phosphine and dinitrogen groups, each of which can be either displaced or retained depending on the reacting partner. —Jake S. Yeston Precise modification of a chemical site in a molecule at the single-atom level is one of the most elegant yet difficult transformations in chemistry. A reagent specifically designed for chemoselective introduction of monoatomic carbon is a particularly formidable challenge. Here, we report a straightforward, azide-free synthesis of a crystalline and isolable diazophosphorus ylide, Ph 3 PCN 2 , a stable compound with a carbon atom bonded to two chemically labile groups, triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) and dinitrogen (N 2 ). Without any additives, the diazophosphorus ylide serves as a highly selective transfer reagent for fragments, including Ph 3 PC, to deliver phosphorus ylide–terminated heterocumulenes and CN 2 to produce multisubstituted pyrazoles. Ultimately, even exclusive carbon-atom transfer is possible. In reactions with aldehydes and acyclic and cyclic ketones (R 2 C=O), the carbon-atom substitution forms a vinylidene (R 2 C=C:) en route to alkynes or butatrienes.},

Although dielectric breakdown is a primary cause of failure of these systems, we do not fully understand this process. We analyzed the dielectric breakdown channel propagation dynamics of two distinct types of electrical trees. One type of these electrical trees has not been formally classified. We observed the propagation speed of this electrical tree type to exceed 10 million meters per second.

This process completely encapsulated the metallic nickel, and this catalyst displayed 94% propylene selectivity at 40% propane conversion. Tetra-coordinated titanium sites surrounding oxygen vacancies appeared to be the catalytically active site, and subsurface metallic nickel acted as a promoter for carbon-hydrogen bond activation and promoted hydrogen desorption. —Phil Szuromi The industrial catalysts utilized for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene, an important alternative to petroleum-based cracking processes, either use expensive metals or metal oxides that are environmentally unbenign. We report that a typically less-active oxide, titanium oxide (TiO 2 ), can be combined with earth-abundant metallic nickel (Ni) to form an unconventional Ni@TiO x catalyst for efficient PDH. The catalyst demonstrates a 94% propylene selectivity at 40% propane conversion and superior stability under industrially relevant conditions. Complete encapsulation of Ni nanoparticles was allowed at elevated temperatures (&gt;550°C). A mechanistic study suggested that the defective TiO x overlayer consisting of tetracoordinated Ti sites with oxygen vacancies is catalytically active. Subsurface metallic Ni acts as an electronic promoter to accelerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation and hydrogen (H 2 ) desorption on the TiO x overlayer.},

Soyano et al . describe an oscillatory mechanism that regulates bacteria nodulation sites in a legume. Live-imaging and transcriptome analyses revealed oscillating gene expression that matched a similar oscillation pattern in response to the plant hormone cytokinin. Perturbing cytokinin signaling led to altered infection distribution. The size of the root region responsive to infection and the progression of the nodulation process are influenced by this periodic regulation. —Ankit Walia Host plants benefit from legume root nodule symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria under nitrogen-limiting conditions. In this interaction, the hosts must regulate nodule numbers and distribution patterns to control the degree of symbiosis and maintain root growth functions. The host response to symbiotic bacteria occurs discontinuously but repeatedly at the region behind the tip of the growing roots. Here, live-imaging and transcriptome analyses revealed oscillating host gene expression with approximately 6-hour intervals upon bacterial inoculation. Cytokinin response also exhibited a similar oscillation pattern. Cytokinin signaling is crucial to maintaining the periodicity, as observed in cytokinin receptor mutants displaying altered infection foci distribution. This periodic regulation influences the size of the root region responsive to bacteria, as well as the nodulation process progression.},

By contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties. Here we describe a general approach to designing transmembrane β-barrel pores with different diameters and pore geometries. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic characterization show that the designs are stably folded with structures resembling those of the design models. The designs have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore diameter, ranging from 110 picosiemens (~0.5 nanometer pore diameter) to 430 picosiemens (~1.1 nanometer pore diameter).

One promising concept is a small domain that could be incorporated into other applications with ease.

High-throughput screening and computational resampling enabled the creation of second-generation binders with substantially higher affinities for four example target molecules. The authors demonstrate two applications of such binders that rely on incorporating them as a domain into a larger, de novo–designed protein: a nanopore fusion for small-molecule sensing and a split protein for chemically induced dimerization. —Michael A. Funk We describe an approach for designing high-affinity small molecule–binding proteins poised for downstream sensing. We use deep learning–generated pseudocycles with repeating structural units surrounding central binding pockets with widely varying shapes that depend on the geometry and number of the repeat units. We dock small molecules of interest into the most shape complementary of these pseudocycles, design the interaction surfaces for high binding affinity, and experimentally screen to identify designs with the highest affinity. We obtain binders to four diverse molecules, including the polar and flexible methotrexate and thyroxine. Taking advantage of the modular repeat structure and central binding pockets, we construct chemically induced dimerization systems and low-noise nanopore sensors by splitting designs into domains that reassemble upon ligand addition.},

Because the food environment— i.e., the type and amount of food that is available and accessible—affects children’s dietary preferences and health outcomes, it is considered a primary cause of obesity (4, 5). Bangladesh must collect data about the food environment in and near schools and then use that information to address childhood obesity.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen most commonly forms three bonds in its chemical compounds. In certain cases, it can persist in motifs with just one bond, but these nitrene molecules tend to have extremely short lifetimes and are seen transiently by time-resolved spectroscopy. Recently, a class of bulky aryl frameworks has stabilized nitrene analogs of nitrogen’s heavier congeners, antimony and bismuth. Janssen et al . now report that such a framework can stabilize a nitrene as well. The compound was isolated and characterized crystallographically, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy supported a triplet ground state. —Jake S. Yeston Nitrenes are a highly reactive, yet fundamental, compound class. They possess a monovalent nitrogen atom and usually a short life span, typically in the nanosecond range. Here, we report on the synthesis of a stable nitrene by photolysis of the arylazide M S FluindN 3 ( 1 ), which gave rise to the quantitative formation of the arylnitrene M S FluindN ( 2 ) (M S Fluind is dispiro[fluorene-9,3′-(1′,1′,7′,7′-tetramethyl-s-hydrindacen-4′-yl)-5′,9′′-fluorene]) that remains unchanged for at least 3 days when stored under argon atmosphere at room temperature. The extraordinary life span permitted the full characterization of 2 by single-crystal x-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, which supported a triplet ground state. Theoretical simulations suggest that in addition to the kinetic stabilization conferred by the bulky M S Fluind aryl substituent, electron delocalization across the central aromatic ring contributes to the electron stabilization of 2 .},

  abstract     = {Transposons are mobile genetic elements that use diverse mechanisms to catalyze their proliferation within the genome. Žedaveinytė et al . uncovered an intricate molecular strategy exploited by bacterial transposons known as IStrons to spread silently while mitigating adverse fitness costs on the host. The elements encode complex, noncoding RNAs that have the ability to both self-splice, thus restoring the genes interrupted through DNA transposition, and to undergo direct RNA-guided DNA cleavage by a TnpB nuclease, thus preserving transposon copy number. TnpB nucleases are ancestors of CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes and are thus a key evolutionary stepping stone in the emergence of bacterial adaptive immunity, which is now of great interest for genome engineering technology. —Di Jiang TnpB nucleases represent the evolutionary precursors to CRISPR-Cas12 and are widespread in all domains of life. IS605-family TnpB homologs function as programmable RNA-guided homing endonucleases in bacteria, driving transposon maintenance through DNA double-strand break–stimulated homologous recombination. In this work, we uncovered molecular mechanisms of the transposition life cycle of IS607-family elements that, notably, also encode group I introns. We identified specific features for a candidate “IStron” from Clostridium botulinum that allow the element to carefully control the relative levels of spliced products versus functional guide RNAs. Our results suggest that IStron transcripts evolved an ability to balance competing and mutually exclusive activities that promote selfish transposon spread while limiting adverse fitness costs on the host. Collectively, this work highlights molecular innovation in the multifunctional utility of transposon-encoded noncoding RNAs.},

  abstract     = {Transposable elements (TEs) are relics of ancient viral infections scattered throughout mammalian genomes. TE reactivation and detection by cytosolic nucleic acid sensors acts as a cellular alarm, eliciting antiviral immunity (viral mimicry). Wu et al . report a new pathway for viral mimicry underlying the anticancer mechanism of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (mIDH1) inhibitors (see the Perspective by Pitarresi and Fitzgerald). mIDH1 affects cancer by producing the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which inactivates DNA- and histone-demethylating enzymes. The researchers show that the double-stranded DNA sensor cGAS is silenced by promoter DNA hypermethylation in mIDH1 liver and brain tumors. Conversely, mIDH1 inhibition causes DNA hypomethylation and transcriptional activation of cGAS, which results in the stimulation of a potent antitumor T cell response. —Pricilla N. Kelly Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) is the most commonly mutated metabolic gene across human cancers. Mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) generates the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, disrupting enzymes involved in epigenetics and other processes. A hallmark of IDH1 -mutant solid tumors is T cell exclusion, whereas mIDH1 inhibition in preclinical models restores antitumor immunity. Here, we define a cell-autonomous mechanism of mIDH1-driven immune evasion. IDH1 -mutant solid tumors show selective hypermethylation and silencing of the cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor CGAS , compromising innate immune signaling. mIDH1 inhibition restores DNA demethylation, derepressing CGAS and transposable element (TE) subclasses. dsDNA produced by TE-reverse transcriptase (TE-RT) activates cGAS, triggering viral mimicry and stimulating antitumor immunity. In summary, we demonstrate that mIDH1 epigenetically suppresses innate immunity and link endogenous RT activity to the mechanism of action of a US Food and Drug Administration–approved oncology drug.},

  abstract     = {Crops have been radically altered both by artificial selection for traits of interest and by natural selection from being forced to adapt to new environments. However, the speed and overall dynamics of these processes are difficult to determine because the initial genetic variation of the population is often unknown. Landis et al . studied the dynamics of adaptation using data from composite cross II, a common garden experiment in barley that began in 1929 with all possible crosses from 28 diverse barley varieties. They found that genetic diversity quickly decreases, with about 30% of the genome essentially fixed and about 60% of progeny descended from one parent line by generation 50. —Corinne N. Simonti Direct observation is central to our understanding of adaptation, but evolution is rarely documented in a large, multicellular organism for more than a few generations. In this study, we observed evolution across a century-scale competition experiment, barley composite cross II (CCII). CCII was founded in 1929 in Davis, California, with thousands of genotypes, but we found that natural selection has massively reduced genetic diversity, leading to a single lineage constituting most of the population by generation 50. Selection favored alleles originating from climates similar to that of Davis and targeted loci contributing to reproductive development, including the barley diversification loci Vrs1 , HvCEN , Ppd-H1 , and Vrn-H2 . Our findings point to selection as the predominant force shaping genomic variation in one of the world’s oldest biological experiments.},

  abstract     = {Our understanding of admixture between humans and Neanderthals has changed dramatically over the past decade and a half. Once thought not to have occurred at all, there is now ample evidence for gene flow from Neanderthals to humans and vice versa. Li et al . used a new framework to model the increasingly complex dynamics of introgression between humans and Neanderthals and the ramifications for both populations. They identified regions of human ancestry in Neanderthals, estimated population sizes for Neanderthals were about 20% lower than previously thought, and proposed the possibility of two pulses of gene flow from humans to Neanderthals. This study comprehensively synthesizes our current knowledge of hominin admixture. —Corinne N. Simonti Although it is well known that the ancestors of modern humans and Neanderthals admixed, the effects of gene flow on the Neanderthal genome are not well understood. We develop methods to estimate the amount of human-introgressed sequences in Neanderthals and apply it to whole-genome sequence data from 2000 modern humans and three Neanderthals. We estimate that Neanderthals have 2.5 to 3.7% human ancestry, and we leverage human-introgressed sequences in Neanderthals to revise estimates of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans, show that Neanderthal population sizes were significantly smaller than previously estimated, and identify two distinct waves of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals. Our data provide insights into the genetic legacy of recurrent gene flow between modern humans and Neanderthals.},

  abstract     = {Most of the world uses alternating current (AC) to distribute electricity. However, when it comes to applications in chemistry, direct current still dominates, perhaps because of its simplicity. Recently, chemists have started to show that switching to AC can be advantageous in their milieu as well, in particular by suppressing undesired side reactions. Zeng et al . now showcase the myriad additional improvements to reaction yield available by systematically tuning AC frequency and duty ratio, as well as current, in copper-catalyzed electro-oxidative couplings of alkynes with beta-ketoamides. —Jake S. Yeston Direct current (DC) electrosynthesis, which has undergone optimization over the past century, plays a pivotal role in a variety of industrial processes. Alternating current (AC) electrosynthesis, characterized by polarity reversal and periodic fluctuations, may be advantageous for multiple chemical reactions, but apparatus, principles, and application scenarios remain underdeveloped. In this work, we introduce a protocol for programmed AC (pAC) electrosynthesis that systematically adjusts currents, frequencies, and duty ratios. The application of representative pAC waveforms facilitates copper-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage in cross-coupling and difunctionalization reactions that exhibit suboptimal performance under DC and chemical oxidation conditions. Moreover, observing catalyst dynamic variation under diverse waveform applications provides mechanistic insight.},

  abstract     = {Aerosol particle production from gas-phase precursors, a process called new particle formation (NPF), creates approximately half of the cloud condensation nuclei that form in the atmosphere. This process is a major control on cloudiness, Earth’s radiative balance, and climate. Zhang et al . present evidence that the intrusion of ozone-rich stratospheric air into the underlying troposphere leads to mixing and generation of sulfuric acid from sulfur dioxide, leading to NPF (see the Perspective by Coe). This discovery identifies another mechanism for NPF that is distinct from the main mechanism known so far, which involves outflow from convective clouds. —Jesse Smith New particle formation in the free troposphere is a major source of cloud condensation nuclei globally. The prevailing view is that in the free troposphere, new particles are formed predominantly in convective cloud outflows. We present another mechanism using global observations. We find that during stratospheric air intrusion events, the mixing of descending ozone-rich stratospheric air with more moist free tropospheric background results in elevated hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. Such mixing is most prevalent near the tropopause where the sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) mixing ratios are high. The combination of elevated SO 2 and OH levels leads to enhanced sulfuric acid concentrations, promoting particle formation. Such new particle formation occurs frequently and over large geographic regions, representing an important particle source in the midlatitude free troposphere.},

Despite progress in improving properties such as electrical breakdown strength, such improvements can lead to degradation of hysteresis through charge-discharge cycles and thus lower the efficiency. Shu et al . used computational exploration to identify a composition in the bismuth magnesium titanate–strontium titanate system that avoids this pitfall. This dielectric has very high energy density, low remnant polarization, and was stable through 10 million charge-discharge cycles —Brent Grocholski Relaxor ferroelectric (RFE) films are promising energy-storage candidates for miniaturizing high-power electronic systems, which is credited to their high energy density ( U e ) and efficiency. However, advancing their U e beyond 200 joules per cubic centimeter is challenging, limiting their potential for next-generation energy-storage devices. We implemented a partitioning polar-slush strategy in RFEs to push the boundary of U e . Guided by phase-field simulations, we designed and fabricated high-performance Bi(Mg 0.5 Ti 0.5 )O 3 -SrTiO 3 –based RFE films with isolated slush-like polar clusters, which were realized through suppression of the nonpolar cubic matrix and introduction of highly insulating networks. The simultaneous enhancement of the reversible polarization and breakdown strength leads to a U e of 202 joules per cubic centimeter with a high efficiency of ~79%. The proposed strategy provides a design freedom for next-generation high-performance dielectrics.},

  abstract     = {Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, so understanding its atmospheric chemistry is essential for the development of models to successfully project climate change. Current models uniformly underestimate the atmospheric lifetime of methane because they uniformly overestimate how much hydroxyl radical (OH), the chemical species responsible for most of the destruction of methane, the atmosphere contains. Prather and Zhu investigated the cause of this discrepancy and report that it is due in part to a previously unrecognized pathway of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet that causes models to calculate OH concentrations that are too high and thus methane lifetimes that are too short. —Jesse Smith The decay of methyl chloroform, a banned ozone-depleting substance, has provided a clear observational metric of mean tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) abundance. Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to 350 nanometers) imply reductions in sunlight with key photolysis rates decreasing by 8 to 12% in the near-surface tropical atmosphere. Incorporation of this new mechanism in a chemistry-transport model reduces OH and methane loss by only 4%, but combined with other proposed mechanisms, such as tropospheric halogen chemistry (7%), we may be able to resolve this conundrum.},

  abstract     = {Cave-dwelling and hibernating bat populations are being extirpated by a cold-tolerant fungal pathogen called Pseudogymnoascus destructans , which causes bat white nose syndrome. Isidoro-Ayza and Klein developed an immortalized bat keratinocyte line to study the activity of P. destructans during bat torpor and arousal (see the Perspective by Vargas-Muñiz). At low temperatures, when the bats are hibernating, fungal conidia within host cell reservoirs germinate and the hyphae actively tunnel through keratinocytes. At temperatures that stimulate bat arousal, the fungus is endocytosed by host cells in an actin-dependent mechanism that avoids stimulating apoptosis. Both infection routes require the epidermal growth factor receptor. The fungus avoids fulminant host responses partly because melanin-coated fungal conidia inhibit endolysosomal maturation and killing, and the burrowing hyphae do not cause the cell disruption that provokes host immune effectors. —Caroline Ash Millions of hibernating bats across North America have died from white-nose syndrome (WNS), an emerging disease caused by a psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans , that invades their skin. Mechanisms of P. destructans invasion of bat epidermis remain obscure. Guided by our in vivo observations, we modeled hibernation with a newly generated little brown bat ( Myotis lucifugus ) keratinocyte cell line. We uncovered the stealth intracellular lifestyle of P. destructans , which inhibits apoptosis of keratinocytes and spreads through the cells by two epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–dependent mechanisms: active penetration during torpor and induced endocytosis during arousal. Melanin of endocytosed P. destructans blocks endolysosomal maturation, facilitating P. destructans survival and germination after return to torpor. Blockade of EGFR aborts P. destructans entry into keratinocytes.},

Usually, the probe itself has a chiral feature that interacts with the sample under investigation. Fang et al . have now shown that electrons can be engineered with a series of laser pulses such that the mass and electronic charge are structured into a corkscrew shape. By combining ultrafast electron bunches in a transmission electron microscope with ultrafast helical optical pulses, the helical optical phase of the laser pulses is imprinted onto the electrons. The resulting helical modulation of longitudinal momentum of the electron’s de Broglie wave provides a probe of ultrafast chiral properties on microscopic scales. —Ian S. Osborne Chirality is a phenomenon with widespread relevance in fundamental physics, material science, chemistry, optics, and spectroscopy. In this work, we show that a free electron can be converted by the field cycles of laser light into a right-handed or left-handed coil of mass and charge. In contrast to phase-vortex beams, our electrons maintained a flat de Broglie wave but obtained their chirality from the shape of their expectation value in space and time. Measurements of wave function densities by attosecond gating revealed the three-dimensional shape of coils and double coils with left-handed or right-handed pitch. Engineered elementary particles with such or related chiral geometries should be useful for applications in chiral sensing, free-electron quantum optics, particle physics or electron microscopy.},

Hartung et al . demonstrate the ability to load rubidium atoms into an optical lattice placed in an optical cavity. With the aid of optical tweezers and individual site addressability, they were able to load the lattice deterministically and entangle specific atoms with photons. The approach is promising for building larger-scale quantum networks. —Ian S.

However, scalability to larger systems with many qubits is challenging. One solution is to develop a quantum network consisting of small-scale quantum registers containing computation qubits that are reversibly interfaced to communication qubits. In this study, we report on a register that uses both optical tweezers and optical lattices to deterministically assemble a two-dimensional array of atoms in an optical cavity. Harnessing a single atom–addressing beam, we stimulate the emission of a photon from each atom and demonstrate multiplexed atom-photon entanglement with a generation-to-detection efficiency approaching 90%.

When provided with the appropriate starting conditions, a droplet-confined system can self-regenerate by producing missing enzymes. This integrated metabolic and genetic biosynthetic system may be a useful system in which to study metabolic networks and could serve as a platform for additional metabolic modules. —Michael A. Funk One of the hallmarks of living organisms is their capacity for self-organization and regeneration, which requires a tight integration of metabolic and genetic networks. We sought to construct a linked metabolic and genetic network in vitro that shows such lifelike behavior outside of a cellular context and generates its own building blocks from nonliving matter. We integrated the metabolism of the crotonyl-CoA/ethyl-malonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA cycle with cell-free protein synthesis using recombinant elements. Our network produces the amino acid glycine from CO 2 and incorporates it into target proteins following DNA-encoded instructions. By orchestrating ~50 enzymes we established a basic cell-free operating system in which genetically encoded inputs into a metabolic network are programmed to activate feedback loops allowing for self-integration and (partial) self-regeneration of the complete system.},

We show that the classic solvent system for perovskite fabrication exacerbates this reproducibility challenge. The conventional coordinative solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) promoted δ-FAPbI 3 formation under high relative humidity (RH) conditions because of its hygroscopic nature. We introduced chlorine-containing organic molecules to form a capping layer that blocked moisture penetration while preserving DMSO-based complexes to regulate crystal growth.

  abstract     = {Current pandemic Vibrio cholerae strains have two genome defense systems called DdmABC and DdmDE that provide immunity against DNA plasmids. These systems are thought to have played a crucial role in the evolutionary success of these strains. Loeff et al . used cryo–electron microscopy to investigate the plasmid elimination mechanism of DdmDE. Their findings revealed that DdmE is a DNA-guided prokaryotic Argonaute that recruits and activates the downstream effector protein DdmD, the helicase and nuclease activities of which cooperate to degrade plasmid DNA. By revealing the molecular mechanism of antiplasmid immunity, this study lays the foundation for biotechnological applications of DdmDE. —Di Jiang Seventh-pandemic Vibrio cholerae strains contain two pathogenicity islands that encode the DNA defense modules DdmABC and DdmDE. In this study, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the mechanistic basis for plasmid defense by DdmDE. The helicase-nuclease DdmD adopts an autoinhibited dimeric architecture. The prokaryotic Argonaute protein DdmE uses a DNA guide to target plasmid DNA. The structure of the DdmDE complex, validated by in vivo mutational studies, shows that DNA binding by DdmE triggers disassembly of the DdmD dimer and loading of monomeric DdmD onto the nontarget DNA strand. In vitro studies indicate that DdmD translocates in the 5′-to-3′ direction, while partially degrading the plasmid DNA. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanism of DdmDE systems in plasmid elimination.},

  abstract     = {Chemical communication between neurons involves the rapid release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Vesicular-type ATPase (V-ATPase) uses ATP to pump protons into synaptic vesicles, enabling neurotransmitter uptake from the cytosol before release. Coupland et al . isolated whole synaptic vesicles from rat brain and were able to determine high-resolution electron cryomicroscopy structures of the V-ATPase in its native membrane. The authors found several unexpected features that were not seen in structures of purified V-ATPase, including a stoichiometric complex with the protein synaptophysin. They also observed dissociation of the V1 head group under active conditions, consistent with prior biochemical work. —Michael A. Funk Intercellular communication in the nervous system occurs through the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft between neurons. In the presynaptic neuron, the proton pumping vesicular- or vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) powers neurotransmitter loading into synaptic vesicles (SVs), with the V 1 complex dissociating from the membrane region of the enzyme before exocytosis. We isolated SVs from rat brain using SidK, a V-ATPase–binding bacterial effector protein. Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy allowed high-resolution structure determination of V-ATPase within the native SV membrane. In the structure, regularly spaced cholesterol molecules decorate the enzyme’s rotor and the abundant SV protein synaptophysin binds the complex stoichiometrically. ATP hydrolysis during vesicle loading results in a loss of the V 1 region of V-ATPase from the SV membrane, suggesting that loading is sufficient to induce dissociation of the enzyme.},

  abstract     = {Rice is foundational to the diet of humans across the world. Like many crops, it is difficult to disentangle the genetic underpinnings of traits among highly inbred lines. Wei et al . generated a set of more than 18,000 lines of rice from 16 parent accessions of diverse geographic origins. They planted these lines in three different environments, measured 16 agronomic phenotypes, and performed genome-wide association studies. The authors found that the genetic basis of many traits is highly polygenic, identified potential causal genes, and estimated epistatic effects to be quite small. This study will provide a large genetic resource for the future study and improvement of this staple crop. —Corinne N. Simonti Understanding how numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) shape phenotypic variation is an important question in genetics. To address this, we established a permanent population of 18,421 (18K) rice lines with reduced population structure. We generated reference-level genome assemblies of the founders and genotyped all 18K-rice lines through whole-genome sequencing. Through high-resolution mapping, 96 high-quality candidate genes contributing to variation in 16 traits were identified, including OsMADS22 and OsFTL1 verified as causal genes for panicle number and heading date, respectively. We identified epistatic QTL pairs and constructed a genetic interaction network with 19 genes serving as hubs. Overall, 170 masking epistasis pairs were characterized, serving as an important factor contributing to genetic background effects across diverse varieties. The work provides a basis to guide grain yield and quality improvements in rice.},

  abstract     = {Individuals with cystic fibrosis and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases are particularly vulnerable to colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Epidemic clones have emerged in certain patient groups that are associated with poor clinical outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Weimann et al . investigated when and how such clones emerge by accessing international collections of clinical and environmental strains of P. aeruginosa amassed over the past century. The authors distinguished 21 major clones based on pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism distances and majority multilocus sequence type. A series of epidemic clones emerged and expanded between 1850 and 2000, indicating recent selective pressures, possibly driven by industrialization, associated pollution, and human population change and underpinned by major changes in bacterial physiology. —Caroline Ash The major human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes multidrug-resistant infections in people with underlying immunodeficiencies or structural lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). We show that a few environmental isolates, driven by horizontal gene acquisition, have become dominant epidemic clones that have sequentially emerged and spread through global transmission networks over the past 200 years. These clones demonstrate varying intrinsic propensities for infecting CF or non-CF individuals (linked to specific transcriptional changes enabling survival within macrophages); have undergone multiple rounds of convergent, host-specific adaptation; and have eventually lost their ability to transmit between different patient groups. Our findings thus explain the pathogenic evolution of P. aeruginosa and highlight the importance of global surveillance and cross-infection prevention in averting the emergence of future epidemic clones.},

By leveraging a distinctive “cap signature” derived from the 5′-end cap, Oguchi et al . introduced a technique to investigate the precise position of the RNA 5′-ends in single cells, enabling simultaneous profiling of gene expression and enhancer activity. The authors constructed a CD4 + T cell–type resolved multimodal atlas to integrate and elucidate CD4 + T cell diversity and genetic risk of immune-mediated diseases. They also identified rare, uncharacterized CD4 + T cell types that might contribute to the pathology of immune-mediated diseases. —Di Jiang Transcribed enhancer maps can reveal nuclear interactions underpinning each cell type and connect specific cell types to diseases. Using a 5′ single-cell RNA sequencing approach, we defined transcription start sites of enhancer RNAs and other classes of coding and noncoding RNAs in human CD4 + T cells, revealing cellular heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories. Integration of these datasets with single-cell chromatin profiles showed that active enhancers with bidirectional RNA transcription are highly cell type–specific and that disease heritability is strongly enriched in these enhancers. The resulting cell type–resolved multimodal atlas of bidirectionally transcribed enhancers, which we linked with promoters using fine-scale chromatin contact maps, enabled us to systematically interpret genetic variants associated with a range of immune-mediated diseases.},

  abstract     = {Viruses frequently harbor mobile introns containing homing endonucleases, but their function or selective advantage is in doubt. Birkholz et al . have discovered that a mobile intron containing a homing endonuclease found within a viral RNA polymerase gene in one bacteriophage blocks productive infection by a related and competing coinfecting bacteriophage. The homing endonuclease of one phage aims for the homologous sequence in the polymerase of the competitor phage to block assembly of the rival’s progeny. Competition experiments confirmed that even small selective advantages such as this are quickly amplified because of the rapid rates of viral replication. Similar mobile introns are ubiquitous across phage, fungi, and archaea, and may provide selective advantages in a range of interactions. —Caroline Ash Introns containing homing endonucleases are widespread in nature and have long been assumed to be selfish elements that provide no benefit to the host organism. These genetic elements are common in viruses, but whether they confer a selective advantage is unclear. In this work, we studied intron-encoded homing endonuclease gp210 in bacteriophage ΦPA3 and found that it contributes to viral competition by interfering with the replication of a coinfecting phage, ΦKZ. We show that gp210 targets a specific sequence in ΦKZ, which prevents the assembly of progeny viruses. This work demonstrates how a homing endonuclease can be deployed in interference competition among viruses and provide a relative fitness advantage. Given the ubiquity of homing endonucleases, this selective advantage likely has widespread evolutionary implications in diverse plasmid and viral competition as well as virus-host interactions.},

  abstract     = {Single crystals of rhombohedral transition metal dichalcogenides (3R-TMDs) have been produced through interfacial epitaxy. These crystals exhibit higher current density and carrier mobility than monolayer and hexagonal (2H) TMDs. Qin et al . continuously delivered metals and chalcogens to the interface between a single-crystal nickel substrate to grow a consistent 3R stacking sequence. Thicknesses from a few to 15,000 layers were achieved for compositions such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ), and MoS 2(1-x) Se 2x on a wafer scale. High carrier mobility was observed, as well as high-efficiency, nonlinear parametric down-conversion. —Phil Szuromi Rhombohedral-stacked transition-metal dichalcogenides (3R-TMDs), which are distinct from their hexagonal counterparts, exhibit higher carrier mobility, sliding ferroelectricity, and coherently enhanced nonlinear optical responses. However, surface epitaxial growth of large multilayer 3R-TMD single crystals is difficult. We report an interfacial epitaxy methodology for their growth of several compositions, including molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), molybdenum diselenide, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, niobium disulfide, niobium diselenide, and molybdenum sulfoselenide. Feeding of metals and chalcogens continuously to the interface between a single-crystal Ni substrate and grown layers ensured consistent 3R stacking sequence and controlled thickness from a few to 15,000 layers. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed the large-scale uniformity, high crystallinity, and phase purity of these films. The as-grown 3R-MoS 2 exhibited room-temperature mobilities up to 155 and 190 square centimeters per volt second for bi- and trilayers, respectively. Optical difference frequency generation with thick 3R-MoS 2 showed markedly enhanced nonlinear response under a quasi–phase matching condition (five orders of magnitude greater than monolayers).},

  abstract     = {Sickle cell disease affects millions of people worldwide, occurring disproportionately in resource-limited regions. The development of a globally accessible, oral fetal hemoglobin (HbF) inducer has long been a primary goal for the field. Inspired by the potential of targeted protein degradation to modulate gene control factors, Ting et al . leveraged a chemical library of molecular glues targeting the protein cereblon to explore HbF reactivation (see the Perspective by Higgs and Kassouf). Phenotypic screening identified the transcription factor WIZ as a previously unrecognized repressor of HbF. Chemical optimization generated potent and selective chemical probes of WIZ protein stability. WIZ degradation was well tolerated and induced fetal hemoglobin in humanized mice and nonhuman primates, which may pave the way for an investigational new medicine to potentially tackle sickle cell disease. —Priscilla N. Kelly Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a prevalent, life-threatening condition attributable to a heritable mutation in β-hemoglobin. Therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate disease complications and has been intently pursued. However, safe and effective small-molecule inducers of HbF remain elusive. We report the discovery of dWIZ-1 and dWIZ-2, molecular glue degraders of the WIZ transcription factor that robustly induce HbF in erythroblasts. Phenotypic screening of a cereblon (CRBN)–biased chemical library revealed WIZ as a previously unknown repressor of HbF. WIZ degradation is mediated by recruitment of WIZ(ZF7) to CRBN by dWIZ-1, as resolved by crystallography of the ternary complex. Pharmacological degradation of WIZ was well tolerated and induced HbF in humanized mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These findings establish WIZ degradation as a globally accessible therapeutic strategy for SCD.},

If each site of the lattice hosted not one, but multiple localized electrons, then the concept could be generalized to that of a Wigner molecular crystal. Li et al . created such a state in a twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide moiré superlattice. The researchers used scanning tunneling microscopy to image the crystal, which, depending on parameters, hosted up to four electrons or holes per site. —Jelena Stajic Semiconductor moiré superlattices provide a versatile platform to engineer quantum solids composed of artificial atoms on moiré sites. Previous studies have mostly focused on the simplest correlated quantum solid—the Fermi-Hubbard model—in which intra-atom interactions are simplified to a single onsite repulsion energy U . Here we report the experimental observation of Wigner molecular crystals emerging from multielectron artificial atoms in twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide moiré superlattices. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that Wigner molecules appear in multielectron artificial atoms when Coulomb interactions dominate. The array of Wigner molecules observed in a moiré superlattice comprises a crystalline phase of electrons: the Wigner molecular crystal, which is shown to be highly tunable through mechanical strain, moiré period, and carrier charge type.},

  abstract     = {The pathophysiology of migraine remains to be fully elucidated. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of suppression of brain activity, has been hypothesized to play a main role in triggering headache. However, the mechanism remains elusive. Kaag Rasmussen et al . used rodent models to show that CSD could induce alterations in cerebrospinal fluid proteome, with increased expression of proteins able to activate the trigeminal nerve (see the Perspective by Russo and Iliff). These proteins could reach and activate the trigeminal nerve, thus triggering headache, through a previously unrecognized zone of the trigeminal ganglion lacking epineural sheath. These results identify a route of communication between the central and peripheral nervous systems that is potentially involved in triggering migraine. —Mattia Maroso Classical migraine patients experience aura, which is transient neurological deficits associated with cortical spreading depression (CSD), preceding headache attacks. It is not currently understood how a pathological event in cortex can affect peripheral sensory neurons. In this study, we show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows into the trigeminal ganglion, establishing nonsynaptic signaling between brain and trigeminal cells. After CSD, ~11% of the CSF proteome is altered, with up-regulation of proteins that directly activate receptors in the trigeminal ganglion. CSF collected from animals exposed to CSD activates trigeminal neurons in naïve mice in part by CSF-borne calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP). We identify a communication pathway between the central and peripheral nervous system that might explain the relationship between migrainous aura and headache.},

Laughlin and McGill investigated how much of their potential niches North American trees occupy by comparing temperature data from their native ranges with those from the arboreta where they have been planted around the world. Some species occupy almost all of their potential thermal niche, whereas others take up less than half. Although trees clearly occupy different climates across North America, all 188 studied species can live at a mean temperature of 12°C, possibly because of past selection events. —Bianca Lopez Tree species appear to prefer distinct climatic conditions, but the true nature of these preferences is obscured by species interactions and dispersal, which limit species’ ranges. We quantified realized and potential thermal niches of 188 North American tree species to conduct a continental-scale test of the architecture of niches. We found strong and consistent evidence that species occurring at thermal extremes occupy less than three-quarters of their potential niches, and species’ potential niches overlap at a mean annual temperature of ~12°C. These results clarify the breadth of thermal tolerances of temperate tree species and support the centrifugal organization of thermal niches.

The gelatin- and DNA-based aerogel has a large cooling effect, in part due to fluorescence and phosphorescence. It is also degradable and recyclable, which are important factors when considering the environmental impact of this type of material. —Brent Grocholski Passive radiant cooling is a potentially sustainable thermal management strategy amid escalating global climate change. However, petrochemical-derived cooling materials often face efficiency challenges owing to the absorption of sunlight. We present an intrinsic photoluminescent biomass aerogel, which has a visible light reflectance exceeding 100%, that yields a large cooling effect. We discovered that DNA and gelatin aggregation into an ordered layered aerogel achieves a solar-weighted reflectance of 104.0% in visible light regions through fluorescence and phosphorescence. The cooling effect can reduce ambient temperatures by 16.0°C under high solar irradiance. In addition, the aerogel, efficiently produced at scale through water-welding, displays high reparability, recyclability, and biodegradability, completing an environmentally conscious life cycle.

A layer-by-layer approach using repeated cycles of blade coating improves the orientation degree to 0.935 in the LBM film, while a LM with good deformability reduces voids into porosity of 5.4%.

Focusing on the problem of antibody engineering, Shanker et al . used a structure-informed protein language model to predict high-fitness sequences constrained by the known structure of the antibody or antibody-antigen complex. In experimental screens of virus-neutralizing antibodies, the authors observed substantial improvement in binding affinity and neutralization for their predicted sequences. These results demonstrate the potential for machine learning and protein language models trained on protein sequence information to contribute to protein engineering tasks even in the absence of task-specific training data. —Michael A. Funk Large language models trained on sequence information alone can learn high-level principles of protein design. However, beyond sequence, the three-dimensional structures of proteins determine their specific function, activity, and evolvability. Here, we show that a general protein language model augmented with protein structure backbone coordinates can guide evolution for diverse proteins without the need to model individual functional tasks. We also demonstrate that ESM-IF1, which was only trained on single-chain structures, can be extended to engineer protein complexes. Using this approach, we screened about 30 variants of two therapeutic clinical antibodies used to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We achieved up to 25-fold improvement in neutralization and 37-fold improvement in affinity against antibody-escaped viral variants of concern BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively.

However, inevitable fatigue hinders practical applications of these materials. Fatigue-free ferroelectric switching could dramatically improve the endurance of such devices. We report a fatigue-free ferroelectric system based on the sliding ferroelectricity of bilayer 3R molybdenum disulfide (3R-MoS 2 ). The memory performance of this ferroelectric device does not show the wake-up effect at low cycles or a substantial fatigue effect after 10 6 switching cycles under different pulse widths. The total stress time of the device under an electric field is up to 10 5 s, which is long relative to other devices. Our theoretical calculations reveal that the fatigue-free feature of sliding ferroelectricity is due to the immobile charge defects in sliding ferroelectricity.},

We investigate the performance of a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) based on sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer boron nitride at room temperature. Sliding ferroelectricity represents a different form of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, characterized by the switching of out-of-plane polarization through interlayer sliding motion. We examined the FeFET device employing monolayer graphene as the channel layer, which demonstrated ultrafast switching speeds on the nanosecond scale and high endurance exceeding 10 11 switching cycles, comparable to state-of-the-art FeFET devices. These characteristics highlight the potential of 2D sliding ferroelectrics for inspiring next-generation nonvolatile memory technology.},

  abstract     = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a prevalent, persistent infection in humans. Although many cases are asymptomatic, EBV may cause disease in individuals with a weakened immune system. Müller-Durovic et al . found that the virally encoded protein EBNA2 induced the expression of the metabolic enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in infected B cells and sustained their subsequent proliferation and transformation into malignant cells. In transplant recipients, elevated expression of IDO1 in B cells preceded the development of lymphoma. Treating mice with a small-molecule inhibitor of IDO1 before infection with EBV decreased the development of tumors, suggesting that blocking the pathway might be a strategy for protecting EBV-negative individuals receiving solid organ transplants. —Sarah H. Ross After infection of B cells, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) engages host pathways that mediate cell proliferation and transformation, contributing to the propensity of the virus to drive immune dysregulation and lymphomagenesis. We found that the EBV protein EBNA2 initiates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo biosynthesis by driving expression of the metabolic enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in infected B cells. Virus-enforced NAD production sustained mitochondrial complex I activity, to match adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production with bioenergetic requirements of proliferation and transformation. In transplant patients, IDO1 expression in EBV-infected B cells, and a serum signature of increased IDO1 activity, preceded development of lymphoma. In humanized mice infected with EBV, IDO1 inhibition reduced both viremia and lymphomagenesis. Virus-orchestrated NAD biosynthesis is therefore a druggable metabolic vulnerability of EBV-driven B cell transformation, opening therapeutic possibilities for EBV-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {Measles outbreaks are on the rise in the US and other countries due to falling vaccination rates. There are currently no available specific antiviral treatments and only limited structural information about neutralizing antibodies that might be useful as therapeutics. Zyla et al . determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of the measles virus fusion protein in complex with an antibody or an engineered peptide, both of which can block fusion (see the Perspective by Aguilar). The authors identified multiple conformational states of the fusion protein and inferred that the antibody can trap an intermediate in the refolding process, thus halting fusion. Therefore, in addition to visualizing an important epitope that may be a therapeutic target, these structures provide mechanistic information about the viral fusion process in this system. —Michael A. Funk Measles virus (MeV) presents a public health threat that is escalating as vaccine coverage in the general population declines and as populations of immunocompromised individuals, who cannot be vaccinated, increase. There are no approved therapeutics for MeV. Neutralizing antibodies targeting viral fusion are one potential therapeutic approach but have not yet been structurally characterized or advanced to clinical use. We present cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of prefusion F alone [2.1-angstrom (Å) resolution], F complexed with a fusion-inhibitory peptide (2.3-Å resolution), F complexed with the neutralizing and protective monoclonal antibody (mAb) 77 (2.6-Å resolution), and an additional structure of postfusion F (2.7-Å resolution). In vitro assays and examination of additional EM classes show that mAb 77 binds prefusion F, arrests F in an intermediate state, and prevents transition to the postfusion conformation.

  abstract     = {The transcription factor GATA3 controls the differentiation of naïve innate lymphoid cells and T cells into their type 2 effector subtypes, innate lymphoid 2 cells (ILC2s) and T helper 2 cells (TH2s), respectively, during immune responses. Szeto et al found that another transcription factor, Mef2d, augmented the expression of GATA3 and the type-2 cytokine interleukin-13. The authors generated a mouse model that resulted in deletion of Mef2d in mature ILC2s specifically. Using it alongside established gene-knockout systems, the authors determined that Mef2d promotes the function of ILC2 and TH2 cells during lung inflammation. Mef2d controls gene expression associated with type 2 responses by inhibiting the expression of Regnase-1, which controls mRNA abundance, and by interacting with another transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1. —Sarah H. Ross Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and adaptive T lymphocytes promote tissue homeostasis and protective immune responses. Their production depends on the transcription factor GATA3, which is further elevated specifically in ILC2s and T helper 2 cells to drive type-2 immunity during tissue repair, allergic disorders, and anti-helminth immunity. The control of this crucial up-regulation is poorly understood. Using CRISPR screens in ILCs we identified previously unappreciated myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2d (Mef2d)-mediated regulation of GATA3-dependent type-2 lymphocyte differentiation. Mef2d-deletion from ILC2s and/or T cells specifically protected against an allergen lung challenge. Mef2d repressed Regnase-1 endonuclease expression to enhance IL-33 receptor production and IL-33 signaling and acted downstream of calcium-mediated signaling to translocate NFAT1 to the nucleus to promote type-2 cytokine-mediated immunity.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation of the pancreas, known as pancreatitis, can influence the emergence and progression of pancreatic cancer. How the body’s immune system responds to pancreatitis versus pancreatic cancer remains unclear. Mahadevan et al . report that pancreatitis leads to the recruitment of a class of immune cells called conventional dendritic cells that can help to protect tissue from self-destruction by T lymphocytes. They found that the coexistence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer resulted in an aggressive disease in which conventional dendritic cells influenced a suppressive T cell subset to override the action of T cells that usually destroy cancer. Blocking the suppressor T cells with immunotherapy reduced the growth of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, engineered cancer-specific conventional dendritic cells along with immunotherapy may provide a mechanism to intervene in pancreatic cancer. —Priscilla N. Kelly Inflammation and tissue damage associated with pancreatitis can precede or occur concurrently with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that in PDAC coupled with pancreatitis (ptPDAC), antigen-presenting type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are specifically activated. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (iCBT) leads to cytotoxic CD8 + T cell activation and elimination of ptPDAC with restoration of life span even upon PDAC rechallenge. Using PDAC antigen-loaded cDC1s as a vaccine, immunotherapy-resistant PDAC was rendered sensitive to iCBT with elimination of tumors. cDC1 vaccination coupled with iCBT identified specific CDR3 sequences in the tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells with potential therapeutic importance. This study identifies a fundamental difference in the immune microenvironment in PDAC concurrent with, or without, pancreatitis and provides a rationale for combining cDC1 vaccination with iCBT as a potential treatment option.},

Sampling revealed that jellies from deep environments have abundant phospholipids that show negative curvature at low pressure but allow the formation of functional membranes at high pressure. Increasing the expression of such lipids in the bacteria Escherichia coli was sufficient to enhance pressure tolerance in those cells. —L. Bryan Ray Hydrostatic pressure increases with depth in the ocean, but little is known about the molecular bases of biological pressure tolerance. We describe a mode of pressure adaptation in comb jellies (ctenophores) that also constrains these animals’ depth range. Structural analysis of deep-sea ctenophore lipids shows that they form a nonbilayer phase at pressures under which the phase is not typically stable. Lipidomics and all-atom simulations identified phospholipids with strong negative spontaneous curvature, including plasmalogens, as a hallmark of deep-adapted membranes that causes this phase behavior. Synthesis of plasmalogens enhanced pressure tolerance in Escherichia coli , whereas low-curvature lipids had the opposite effect. Imaging of ctenophore tissues indicated that the disintegration of deep-sea animals when decompressed could be driven by a phase transition in their phospholipid membranes.},

  abstract     = {Azetidines are saturated four-membered rings comprising three carbon centers and a nitrogen center. A seemingly intuitive way to make them would be to pair up the double bonds in an alkene (C=C) and an imine (C=N) using light, in analogy to the photocoupling of two alkenes to cyclobutanes. However, this approach has proven surprisingly constrained to specialized substrates. Wearing et al . report that modifying the electronics of the imine through oxime formation enables a more general photosensitized coupling with styrenes. —Jake S. Yeston The aza Paternò–Büchi reaction is a [2+2]-cycloaddition reaction between imines and alkenes that produces azetidines, four-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Currently, successful examples rely primarily on either intramolecular variants or cyclic imine equivalents. To unlock the full synthetic potential of aza Paternò–Büchi reactions, it is essential to extend the reaction to acyclic imine equivalents. Here, we report that matching of the frontier molecular orbital energies of alkenes with those of acyclic oximes enables visible light–mediated aza Paternò–Büchi reactions through triplet energy transfer catalysis. The utility of this reaction is further showcased in the synthesis of epi- penaresidin B. Density functional theory computations reveal that a competition between the desired [2+2]-cycloaddition and alkene dimerization determines the success of the reaction. Frontier orbital energy matching between the reactive components lowers transition-state energy (Δ G ǂ ) values and ultimately promotes reactivity.},

To address this issue, Xie et al . characterized the hyperfine structure of HCl-(H 2 O) n clusters produced in a supersonic jet expansion using rotational spectroscopy, which provided distinctive information on the electronic environment of the chlorine nucleus as a function of the number of waters associated. HCl was found to dissociate after forming three hydrogen bonds with water molecules upon the addition of a fifth water molecule, resulting in a dissociated H + Cl − (H 2 O) 5 cluster with a contacting ionic bond. —Yury Suleymanov Investigating the dissociation of acids in the presence of a limited number of water molecules is crucial for understanding various elementary chemical processes. In our study, focusing on HCl(H 2 O) n clusters (where HCl is hydrogen chloride and H 2 O is water) formed in a cold and isolated jet expansion, we used the nuclear quadrupole coupling tensor obtained through rotational spectroscopy to decipher the nature of the hydrogen-chlorine (H-Cl) chemical bond in a microaqueous environment. For n = 1 to 4, the H-Cl bond is covalent.

We documented pristine three-dimensional (3D) anatomy of trilobites fossilized through rapid ash burial from a pyroclastic flow entering a shallow marine environment. Cambrian ellipsocephaloid trilobites from Morocco are articulated and undistorted, revealing exquisite details of the appendages and digestive system. Previously unknown anatomy includes a soft-tissue labrum attached to the hypostome, a slit-like mouth, and distinctive cephalic feeding appendages. Our findings resolve controversy over whether the trilobite hypostome is the labrum or incorporates it and establish crown-group euarthropod homologies in trilobites. This occurrence of moldic fossils with 3D soft parts highlights volcanic ash deposits in marine settings as an underexplored source for exceptionally preserved organisms.},

  abstract     = {The modern plastics industry has relied for decades on methylaluminoxane, a mysterious compound of aluminum, oxygen, and methyl groups, to activate polymerization catalysts. Despite the centrality of methylaluminoxane to such high-volume manufacturing, its agglomeration behavior has thoroughly hindered its detailed structural characterization. Luo et al . report crystallization of methylaluminoxane and x-ray diffraction analysis to reveal a two-dimensional sheet arrangement. The active-site assignments were further supported by quantum chemical simulations and experimental tests of polymerization catalyst activation. —Jake S. Yeston Methylaluminoxane (MAO) is used as a precatalyst activator for million ton–scale production of commercial polyolefins, but its precise structure and associated activation mechanisms have been a fundamental research puzzle for more than 40 years. We report here the crystallographic characterization of an active MAO component, which reveals a discrete two-dimensional sheet cluster [Al 33 O 26 (CH 3 ) 47 ][Al(CH 3 ) 3 ] 2 featuring two trimethylaluminum units, Al(CH 3 ) 3 , coordinated to two unsaturated aluminum sites. Our structural data are consistent with the hypothesis that the active sites bear coordinated Al(CH 3 ) 3 and provide [Al(CH 3 ) 2 ] + for precatalyst activation. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the most preferred sites for [Al(CH 3 ) 2 ] + abstraction (a change in Gibbs free energy of 0.0 kilocalories per mole). Olefin polymerization tests on metallocenes activated with the crystallized MAO show higher activities than with the commercial MAO.},

  abstract     = {Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are between 10 2 and 10 5 solar masses—larger than the stellar-mass black holes produced by supernovae but smaller than the supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies. It is unclear how an IMBH could form. One possibility is through the mergers of smaller black holes, but simulations of that process do not reach high enough masses. Fujii et al . simulated the formation of globular clusters, large gravitationally bound assemblages of millions of stars. At early times, the high density at the cluster core caused stellar mergers, producing a single supermassive star. When that star reached the end of its life, it collapsed to directly form an IMBH. —Keith T. Smith The formation process of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), defined as those between 100 and 10 5 solar masses ( M ⊙ ), is debated. One potential origin is the growth of less-massive black holes merging with stars and compact objects within globular clusters (GCs). However, previous simulations have indicated that this process only produces IMBHs under 500 M ⊙ before gravitational wave recoil ejects them from the GC. We performed star-by-star simulations of GC formation, finding that high-density star formation in a GC’s parent giant molecular cloud can produce sufficient mergers of massive stars to overcome that mass threshold. We conclude that GCs can form with IMBHs more than 10 3 M ⊙⨀ , which is sufficiently massive to be retained within the GC even with the expected gravitational wave recoil.},

  abstract     = {Treatment outcomes for breast cancer metastasis to the leptomeninges (LM), the cerebrospinal fluid–containing membranes that line the surface of the brain and spinal cord, are extremely poor. Whiteley et al . used experimental models of breast cancer LM metastasis to show that breast cancers expressing the cell surface receptor integrin α6 can invade the LM by traversing the outer surface of the blood vessels that normally connect the adjacent vertebral and skull bone marrow to the central nervous system meninges (see the Perspective by Monteran and Erez). Breast cancer cells then stimulate resident meningeal macrophages to secrete a neuronal prosurvival protein called glial-derived neurotrophic factor that supports tumor growth. These findings shed new light on tumor-host interactions in the LM and may guide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of LM metastasis. —Priscilla N. Kelly The molecular mechanisms that regulate breast cancer cell (BCC) metastasis and proliferation within the leptomeninges (LM) are poorly understood, which limits the development of effective therapies. In this work, we show that BCCs in mice can invade the LM by abluminal migration along blood vessels that connect vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and meninges, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. This process is dependent on BCC engagement with vascular basement membrane laminin through expression of the neuronal pathfinding molecule integrin α6. Once in the LM, BCCs colocalize with perivascular meningeal macrophages and induce their expression of the prosurvival neurotrophin glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Intrathecal GDNF blockade, macrophage-specific GDNF ablation, or deletion of the GDNF receptor neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) from BCCs inhibits breast cancer growth within the LM. These data suggest integrin α6 and the GDNF signaling axis as new therapeutic targets against breast cancer LM metastasis.},

It has been successful in treating certain tumors, but patients frequently have chronic inflammation and immunosuppression, which can limit treatment response.

A combination of ruxolitinib and nivolumab resulted in improved clinical efficacy in patients who had previously failed checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. —Priscilla N. Kelly Persistent inflammation driven by cytokines such as type-one interferon (IFN-I) can cause immunosuppression. We show that administration of the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor itacitinib after anti–PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) immunotherapy improves immune function and antitumor responses in mice and results in high response rates (67%) in a phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic non–small cell lung cancer. Patients who failed to respond to initial anti–PD-1 immunotherapy but responded after addition of itacitinib had multiple features of poor immune function to anti–PD-1 alone that improved after JAK inhibition. Itacitinib promoted CD8 T cell plasticity and therapeutic responses of exhausted and effector memory–like T cell clonotypes. Patients with persistent inflammation refractory to itacitinib showed progressive CD8 T cell terminal differentiation and progressive disease. Thus, JAK inhibition may improve the efficacy of anti–PD-1 immunotherapy by pivoting T cell differentiation dynamics.},

The combination yielded a best overall response rate of 53% (10/19).

There are efficiency advantages to using acidic conditions instead, but nearly all anodic catalysts other than the rare and expensive iridium dissolve too rapidly to be practical. Ram et al . report a strategy for stabilizing a more Earth-abundant cobalt catalyst by deliberately introducing tungsten that leaches out. Water and hydroxide fill the resulting vacancies to form a structure that keeps the cobalt in place for at least 600 hours of catalytic activity at a current density of one amp per square centimeter. —Jake S. Yeston The oxygen evolution reaction is the bottleneck to energy-efficient water-based electrolysis for the production of hydrogen and other solar fuels. In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), precious metals have generally been necessary for the stable catalysis of this reaction. In this work, we report that delamination of cobalt tungstate enables high activity and durability through the stabilization of oxide and water-hydroxide networks of the lattice defects in acid. The resulting catalysts achieve lower overpotentials, a current density of 1.8 amperes per square centimeter at 2 volts, and stable operation up to 1 ampere per square centimeter in a PEMWE system at industrial conditions (80°C) at 1.77 volts; a threefold improvement in activity; and stable operation at 1 ampere per square centimeter over the course of 600 hours.},

  abstract     = {Spin-orbit torque effects involve the transfer of angular momentum between a spin current and a magnetic layer mediated by the exchange interaction between conduction and localized electron. Measuring these effects in magnetic materials continues to be a very active area of interest in spintronics for both fundamental reasons and practical considerations. The most rigorous way to carry out such measurements is to use a spin-polarized current to perturb the resonant magnetization dynamics of a ferromagnet (or antiferromagnet) and then determine the response. This approach has been used successfully over the past decade, but only in macroscopic systems. Kovarik et al . present a remarkable advance in this approach using a spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscope to measure the spin-orbit torque effect of a spin current on electron paramagnetic resonance at single-molecule scale. Their work will be of general interest for a broad variety of disciplines, including quantum information science, surface chemistry, and organic electronics and photovoltaics. —Yury Suleymanov Control over quantum systems is typically achieved by time-dependent electric or magnetic fields. Alternatively, electronic spins can be controlled by spin-polarized currents. Here, we demonstrate coherent driving of a single spin by a radiofrequency spin-polarized current injected from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope into an organic molecule. With the excitation of electron paramagnetic resonance, we established dynamic control of single spins by spin torque using a local electric current. In addition, our work highlights the dissipative action of the spin-transfer torque, in contrast to the nondissipative action of the magnetic field, which allows for the manipulation of individual spins based on controlled decoherence.},

This technique is practiced in areas such as free diving and meditation, and offers the promise of future applications in therapy for arrhythmias, pain, and depression. However, the neural circuits underlying this biofeedback remain poorly understood. Using biofeedback-based operant learning, Yoshimoto et al . developed a rat model of self-regulated heart rate control. Neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex was central to the development of bradycardia. Electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and synaptic tracing techniques revealed the complete neuronal pathway from the anterior cingulate cortex to the heart through several relay stations. —Peter Stern Heart rate (HR) can be voluntarily regulated when individuals receive real-time feedback. In a rat model of HR biofeedback, the neocortex and medial forebrain bundle were stimulated as feedback and reward, respectively. The rats reduced their HR within 30 minutes, achieving a reduction of approximately 50% after 5 days of 3-hour feedback. The reduced HR persisted for at least 10 days after training while the rats exhibited anxiolytic behavior and an elevation in blood erythrocyte count. This bradycardia was prevented by inactivating anterior cingulate cortical (ACC) neurons projecting to the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VMT). Theta-rhythm stimulation of the ACC-to-VMT pathway replicated the bradycardia. VMT neurons projected to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and DMH neurons projected to the nucleus ambiguus, which innervates parasympathetic neurons in the heart.},

Nevertheless, on-chip frequency combs have relied predominantly on single-ring resonators. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of a novel class of frequency combs, the topological frequency combs, in a two-dimensional lattice of hundreds of ring resonators that hosts fabrication-robust topological edge states with linear dispersion. By pumping these edge states, we demonstrate the generation of a nested frequency comb that shows oscillation of multiple edge state resonances across ≈40 longitudinal modes and is spatially confined at the lattice edge. Our results provide an opportunity to explore the interplay between topological physics and nonlinear frequency comb generation in a commercially available nanophotonic platform.},

However, it is often challenging to identify water molecules, especially protons, in x-ray crystal structures. Hussein et al . instead used cryo–electron microscopy, which has different benefits and drawbacks, to visualize photosystem II at even higher resolution than existing x-ray structures. Hydrogen atoms are more visible with this approach, and the authors identified more than half of those expected to be present, providing key insights into the functioning of this crucial enzyme. —Michael A. Funk Photosystem II starts the photosynthetic electron transport chain that converts solar energy into chemical energy and thus sustains life on Earth. It catalyzes two chemical reactions: water oxidation to molecular oxygen and plastoquinone reduction. Coupling of electron and proton transfer is crucial for efficiency; however, the molecular basis of these processes remains speculative owing to uncertain water binding sites and the lack of experimentally determined hydrogen positions. We thus collected high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy data of fully hydrated photosystem II from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vestitus to a final resolution of 1.71 angstroms. The structure reveals several previously undetected partially occupied water binding sites and more than half of the hydrogen and proton positions.

The authors constructed biomimetic counterparts that can include magnetic particles, which allows for changes in the flow directions simply through small changes in the angle and geometry of the fins. —Marc S. Lavine Directional liquid transport has been widely observed in various species including cacti, spiders, lizards, the pitcher plant Nepenthes alata , and Araucaria leaves. However, in all these examples the liquid transport for a specific liquid is completely restricted in a fixed direction. We demonstrate that Crassula muscosa shoot surfaces have the ability to transport a specific liquid unidirectionally in either direction. This is accomplished through the presence of asymmetric reentrant leaves with varying reentrant angles, which yields the variation in liquid meniscus heterogeneity. These findings enable engineered biomimetic structures capable of selective directional liquid transport, with functions such as intelligent flow direction switching, liquid distribution, and mixing.},

  abstract     = {Net primary productivity (NPP), the storage of carbon within plant tissues resulting from photosynthesis, is a major carbon sink that we rely on for slowing climate change. Global NPP estimates are variable, leading to uncertainty in modeling current and future carbon cycling. Graven et al . updated NPP estimates using radiocarbon data from nuclear bomb testing in the 1960s. This analysis of radiocarbon uptake into vegetation suggested that current models underestimate NPP, likely by underestimating the carbon stored in short-lived, nonwoody tissues. This work suggests that plants store more carbon but for a shorter time frame than is currently recognized. —Bianca Lopez Vegetation and soils are taking up approximately 30% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions because of small imbalances in large gross carbon exchanges from productivity and turnover that are poorly constrained. We combined a new budget of radiocarbon produced by nuclear bomb testing in the 1960s with model simulations to evaluate carbon cycling in terrestrial vegetation. We found that most state-of-the-art vegetation models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project underestimated the radiocarbon accumulation in vegetation biomass. Our findings, combined with constraints on vegetation carbon stocks and productivity trends, imply that net primary productivity is likely at least 80 petagrams of carbon per year presently, compared with the 43 to 76 petagrams per year predicted by current models. Storage of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial vegetation is likely more short-lived and vulnerable than previously predicted.},

Reduced tree cover led to a reduction in shade, which is critical for the monkeys. In response, there was a general increase in social tolerance among the animals in the population. The most tolerant animals had the highest survival. —Sacha Vignieri Extreme weather events radically alter ecosystems. When ecological damage persists, selective pressures on individuals can change, leading to phenotypic adjustments. For group-living animals, social relationships may be a mechanism enabling adaptation to ecosystem disturbance. Yet whether such events alter selection on sociality and whether group-living animals can, as a result, adaptively change their social relationships remain untested. We leveraged 10 years of data collected on rhesus macaques before and after a category 4 hurricane caused persistent deforestation, exacerbating monkeys’ exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques demonstrated persistently increased tolerance and decreased aggression toward other monkeys, facilitating access to scarce shade critical for thermoregulation. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane, but not before it, revealing a shift in the adaptive function of sociality.},

  abstract     = {Despite the great strides that have been made in reducing urban pollution in major North America and European cities, there is much that remains unclear about the causes of such pollution. Pfannerstill et al . report that about 60% of ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation potential in summertime Los Angeles is caused by biogenic terpenoid emissions, and this contribution strongly increases with temperature (see the Perspective by Karl). Successful mitigation of urban air pollution needs to take into account that climate warming will strongly change emission amounts and composition. —Jesse Smith Despite declines in transportation emissions, urban North America and Europe still face unhealthy air pollution levels. This has challenged conventional understanding of the sources of their volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors. Using airborne flux measurements to map emissions of a wide range of VOCs, we demonstrate that biogenic terpenoid emissions contribute ~60% of emitted VOC OH reactivity, ozone, and secondary organic aerosol formation potential in summertime Los Angeles and that this contribution strongly increases with temperature. This implies that control of nitrogen oxides is key to reducing ozone formation in Los Angeles. We also show some anthropogenic VOC emissions increase with temperature, which is an effect not represented in current inventories. Air pollution mitigation efforts must consider that climate warming will strongly change emission amounts and composition.},

  abstract     = {When processing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into fibers, a recurring problem is that the mechanical properties of the fibers are far worse than those of the intrinsic CNTs. This issue is particularly true for dynamic strength, when the fibers are subject to a high strain rate or ballistic impact. Zhang et al . developed carbon nanotube fibers with a dynamic strength up to 14 gigapascals by controlling alignment, porosity, and interfacial interactions between the CNTs when they were combined with a high-performance polymer. The authors attribute the high dynamic strength to the simultaneous breakage of individual nanotubes and the widespread impact energy delocalization that occurs during high–strain rate loading processes. —Marc S. Lavine High dynamic strength is of fundamental importance for fibrous materials that are used in high–strain rate environments. Carbon nanotube fibers are one of the most promising candidates. Using a strategy to optimize hierarchical structures, we fabricated carbon nanotube fibers with a dynamic strength of 14 gigapascals (GPa) and excellent energy absorption. The dynamic performance of the fibers is attributed to the simultaneous breakage of individual nanotubes and delocalization of impact energy that occurs during the high–strain rate loading process; these behaviors are due to improvements in interfacial interactions, nanotube alignment, and densification therein. This work presents an effective strategy to utilize the strength of individual carbon nanotubes at the macroscale and provides fresh mechanism insights.},

  abstract     = {Structure-based drug discovery relies on high-resolution experimental structures, and some studies have found that deep-learning structure prediction tools such as AlphaFold2 (AF2) do not perform well for docking of known ligands. Studying two human receptors, Lyu et al . found that using high-confidence AF2-predicted structures as starting models was as effective as using experimental structures for prospective docking campaigns to identify new ligands. The authors followed up on several hundred computational hits and found that there was little to no overlap for the same receptor when starting with the computational model versus the experimental structure. Functional assays revealed that the AF2-docking campaign produced a mixture of agonists and antagonists, whereas only agonists were observed when starting with the agonist-bound structure. These results underscore that there is great potential in some structural predictions for drug discovery. —Michael A. Funk AlphaFold2 (AF2) models have had wide impact but mixed success in retrospective ligand recognition. We prospectively docked large libraries against unrefined AF2 models of the σ 2 and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors, testing hundreds of new molecules and comparing results with those obtained from docking against the experimental structures. Hit rates were high and similar for the experimental and AF2 structures, as were affinities. Success in docking against the AF2 models was achieved despite differences between orthosteric residue conformations in the AF2 models and the experimental structures. Determination of the cryo–electron microscopy structure for one of the more potent 5-HT2A ligands from the AF2 docking revealed residue accommodations that resembled the AF2 prediction. AF2 models may sample conformations that differ from experimental structures but remain low energy and relevant for ligand discovery, extending the domain of structure-based drug design.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) are abundant, but we do not understand much about how they interact with bacteria in wild populations. Backman et al . investigated wild-collected herbarium samples of a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana , infected with the bacterium Pseudomonas viridiflava . Comparative genomics between modern and historical Pseudomonas strains revealed a viral gene cluster encoding a phage tail fiber protein called a tailocin, which has been co-opted as a toxic element by the bacteria to ward off competitors. Purified tailocin killed a selection of non-kin but closely related bacteria while being less potent or not at all potent against other plant-associated bacteria. The dominant tailocin among the plant specimens examined has persisted largely unchanged for more than 177 years. —Caroline Ash Bacteria can repurpose their own bacteriophage viruses (phage) to kill competing bacteria. Phage-derived elements are frequently strain specific in their killing activity, although there is limited evidence that this specificity drives bacterial population dynamics. Here, we identified intact phage and their derived elements in a metapopulation of wild plant–associated Pseudomonas genomes. We discovered that the most abundant viral cluster encodes a phage remnant resembling a phage tail called a tailocin, which bacteria have co-opted to kill bacterial competitors. Each pathogenic Pseudomonas strain carries one of a few distinct tailocin variants that target the variable polysaccharides in the outer membrane of co-occurring pathogenic Pseudomonas strains. Analysis of herbarium samples from the past 170 years revealed that the same tailocin and bacterial receptor variants have persisted in Pseudomonas populations. These results suggest that tailocin genetic diversity can be mined to develop targeted “tailocin cocktails” for microbial control.},

  abstract     = {Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine condition in women of reproductive age. Its manifestations include androgen excess and other hormonal changes, menstrual cycle alterations, infertility, and metabolic abnormalities. Artemisinins are plant-derived compounds that are best known for their antimalarial properties but have also been shown to have some beneficial metabolic effects. Liu et al . demonstrated that artemisinins can also relieve the endocrine manifestations of polycystic ovarian syndrome in multiple rodent models and in human patients, suggesting a potential approach to treating multiple facets of this endocrine disorder (see the Perspective by Stener-Victorin). —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent reproductive disorder in women of reproductive age, features androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Despite its high prevalence, specific pharmacologic intervention for PCOS is challenging. In this study, we identified artemisinins as anti-PCOS agents. Our finding demonstrated the efficacy of artemisinin derivatives in alleviating PCOS symptoms in both rodent models and human patients, curbing hyperandrogenemia through suppression of ovarian androgen synthesis. Artemisinins promoted cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1) protein degradation to block androgen overproduction. Mechanistically, artemisinins directly targeted lon peptidase 1 (LONP1), enhanced LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction, and facilitated LONP1-catalyzed CYP11A1 degradation. Overexpression of LONP1 replicated the androgen-lowering effect of artemisinins. Our data suggest that artemisinin application is a promising approach for treating PCOS and highlight the crucial role of the LONP1-CYP11A1 interaction in controlling hyperandrogenism and PCOS occurrence.},

  abstract     = {When liver damage occurs, a key condition for recovery is ensuring the proliferation of healthy tissue without propagating sick or damaged cells. Wang et al . have identified a mechanism by which this happens through selective pressure on the mitochondria. In some pathogenic conditions, such as cirrhosis, the diseased areas contain mutations in the mitochondrial genome that lead to dysfunction in the electron transport chain required for cellular respiration. Although such dysfunction is not directly lethal, the authors have found that it puts the affected cells at a competitive disadvantage and reduces their metabolic flexibility. In addition, biliary epithelial cells can pitch in and transdifferentiate into hepatocytes when healthy liver cells are in short supply. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Mitochondria are critical for proper organ function and mechanisms to promote mitochondrial health during regeneration would benefit tissue homeostasis. We report that during liver regeneration, proliferation is suppressed in electron transport chain (ETC)–dysfunctional hepatocytes due to an inability to generate acetyl-CoA from peripheral fatty acids through mitochondrial β-oxidation. Alternative modes for acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate or acetate are suppressed in the setting of ETC dysfunction. This metabolic inflexibility forces a dependence on ETC-functional mitochondria and restoring acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate is sufficient to allow ETC-dysfunctional hepatocytes to proliferate. We propose that metabolic inflexibility within hepatocytes can be advantageous by limiting the expansion of ETC-dysfunctional cells.},

The platform includes three core elements: a vibrating microtome for ultraprecision slicing of large-scale tissues without losing cellular connectivity (MEGAtome), a polymer hydrogel–based tissue processing technology for multiplexed multiscale imaging of human organ–scale tissues (mELAST), and a computational pipeline for reconstructing three-dimensional connectivity across multiple brain slabs (UNSLICE).

The idea is that the functional components of each prospective drug are encoded with a DNA sequence that can be amplified later to identify the structure of a hit. However, incomplete syntheses can introduce errors in matching the tag to the functionality. Keller et al . devised a dual linker technique to ensure fidelity. Orthogonally cleavable linkers tether the first and last introduced components to a bead. Cutting both linkers successively, with washing in between, release only complete structures. —Jake S. Yeston The first drugs discovered using DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL) screens have entered late-stage clinical development. However, DEL technology as a whole still suffers from poor chemical purity resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, we report a technique to overcome this issue through self-purifying release of the DEL after magnetic bead–based synthesis. Both the first and last building blocks of each assembled library member were linked to the beads by tethers that could be cleaved by mutually orthogonal chemistry. Sequential cleavage of the first and last tether, with washing in between, ensured that the final library comprises only the fully complete compounds. The outstanding purity attained by this approach enables a direct correlation of chemical display and encoding, allows for an increased chemical reaction scope, and facilitates the use of more diversity elements while achieving greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios in selections.},

The microscopic origin of this counterintuitive property is unclear. Using a cryogenic atomic force microscopy technique, Wu et al . directly imaged bilayer hexagonal two-dimensional water islands on homopolar graphene and heteropolar hexagonal boron nitride monolayers and measured their friction forces as a function of island area. The experimental data confirmed a frictionless limit for water islands transport on graphene and, together with molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrated that this property originates from a delicate interplay between the water-water and water-surface interactions. —Yury Suleymanov Low-dimensional water transport can be drastically enhanced under atomic-scale confinement. However, its microscopic origin is still under debate. In this work, we directly imaged the atomic structure and transport of two-dimensional water islands on graphene and hexagonal boron nitride surfaces using qPlus-based atomic force microscopy. The lattice of the water island was incommensurate with the graphene surface but commensurate with the boron nitride surface owing to different surface electrostatics. The area-normalized static friction on the graphene diminished as the island area was increased by a power of ~–0.58, suggesting superlubricity behavior. By contrast, the friction on the boron nitride appeared insensitive to the area. Molecular dynamic simulations further showed that the friction coefficient of the water islands on the graphene could reduce to &lt;0.01.},

Grba et al . prepared bovine heart complex I in proteoliposomes, where it could be studied in parallel with biochemical assays and electron microscopy. The authors identified three states: two were open, dormant forms and one was a closed form, which they argue is the only conformation compatible with activity. Further analysis suggested structural mechanisms for deactivation and reactivation. —Michael A. Funk Respiratory complex I is an efficient driver for oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian mitochondria, but its uncontrolled catalysis under challenging conditions leads to oxidative stress and cellular damage. Ischemic conditions switch complex I from rapid, reversible catalysis into a dormant state that protects upon reoxygenation, but the molecular basis for the switch is unknown. We combined precise biochemical definition of complex I catalysis with high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures in the phospholipid bilayer of coupled vesicles to reveal the mechanism of the transition into the dormant state, modulated by membrane interactions. By implementing a versatile membrane system to unite structure and function, attributing catalytic and regulatory properties to specific structural states, we define how a conformational switch in complex I controls its physiological roles.},

Despite the importance of this basic pattern, the regulatory mechanism that determines the boundary between node and internode and how these basic units are developmentally defined are poorly understood. Tsuda et al . used the stem of rice, which has clear nodes and internodes, as an experimental system to show that knotted1-like homeobox ( KNOX1 ) genes of a particular subclade confine nodes to form internodes by repressing leaf regulator YABBY genes and another node-specific KNOX1 gene of a different subclade. Thus, KNOX-YABBY modules create the pattern for the basic unit of node and internode that make up a plant stem. —Ankit Walia Plant stems comprise nodes and internodes that specialize in solute exchange and elongation. However, their boundaries are not well defined, and how these basic units arise remains elusive. In rice with clear nodes and internodes, we found that one subclade of class I knotted1-like homeobox ( KNOX1 ) genes for shoot meristem indeterminacy restricts node differentiation and allows internode formation by repressing YABBY genes for leaf development and genes from another node-specific KNOX1 subclade. YABBY s promote nodal vascular differentiation and limit stem elongation. YABBY and node-specific KNOX1 genes specify the pulvinus, which further elaborates the nodal structure for gravitropism. Notably, this KNOX1 subclade organization is specific to seed plants.

However, these materials also absorb thermal radiation in places where heat islands exist, including the urban environment. Wu et al . developed a textile with a top layer that selectively emits through the atmospheric infrared radiation window, a silver nanowire layer to reject incoming thermal radiation, and a wool bottom layer to move heat from the skin to the middle layer. The result is a textile that passively cools even when heat islands are present while also having good durability, mechanical properties, and washability. —Brent Grocholski Radiative cooling textiles hold promise for achieving personal thermal comfort under increasing global temperature. However, urban areas have heat island effects that largely diminish the effectiveness of cooling textiles as wearable fabrics because they absorb emitted radiation from the ground and nearby buildings. We developed a mid-infrared spectrally selective hierarchical fabric (SSHF) with emissivity greatly dominant in the atmospheric transmission window through molecular design, minimizing the net heat gain from the surroundings. The SSHF features a high solar spectrum reflectivity of 0.97 owing to strong Mie scattering from the nano-micro hybrid fibrous structure. The SSHF is 2.3°C cooler than a solar-reflecting broadband emitter when placed vertically in simulated outdoor urban scenarios during the day and also has excellent wearable properties.},

  abstract     = {Although gene editing is beginning to achieve clinical acceptance as an intervention for some genetic diseases, difficulties remain. Challenges include efficient editing of cells directly in an organism rather than ex vivo and long-term persistence of the edits, which requires targeting the relevant stem cells. Sun et al . designed lipid nanoparticles for delivering gene-editing reagents and optimized them to deliver these reagents to all lung cell types, including stem cells (see the Perspective by Bulcaen and Carlon). The authors then tested their approach in patient-derived cells and in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis, demonstrating that they could achieve therapeutically relevant editing lasting for up to a year. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich In vivo genome correction holds promise for generating durable disease cures; yet, effective stem cell editing remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that optimized lung-targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enable high levels of genome editing in stem cells, yielding durable responses. Intravenously administered gene-editing LNPs in activatable tdTomato mice achieved &gt;70% lung stem cell editing, sustaining tdTomato expression in &gt;80% of lung epithelial cells for 660 days. Addressing cystic fibrosis (CF), NG-ABE8e messenger RNA (mRNA)–sgR553X LNPs mediated &gt;95% cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) DNA correction, restored CFTR function in primary patient-derived bronchial epithelial cells equivalent to Trikafta for F508del, corrected intestinal organoids and corrected R553X nonsense mutations in 50% of lung stem cells in CF mice. These findings introduce LNP-enabled tissue stem cell editing for disease-modifying genome correction.},

  abstract     = {There has been great progress in developing gene therapies using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, but this approach has thus far not worked for targeting brain disorders. Many researchers have used screening methods to try to find AAVs that can get across the blood–brain barrier, but they have only been identified in animal models and do not translate to humans. Huang et al . used the opposite approach and identified an AAV specifically targeting the human transferrin receptor, which is expressed on the blood–brain barrier. Using transgenic mice that express this human protein, the authors showed that their optimized AAV can get into the central nervous system and even deliver a therapeutically relevant protein that is lacking in Gaucher disease. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Developing vehicles that efficiently deliver genes throughout the human central nervous system (CNS) will broaden the range of treatable genetic diseases. We engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid, BI-hTFR1, that binds human transferrin receptor (TfR1), a protein expressed on the blood-brain barrier. BI-hTFR1 was actively transported across human brain endothelial cells and, relative to AAV9, provided 40 to 50 times greater reporter expression in the CNS of human TFRC knockin mice. The enhanced tropism was CNS-specific and absent in wild-type mice. When used to deliver GBA1 , mutations of which cause Gaucher disease and are linked to Parkinson’s disease, BI-hTFR1 substantially increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid glucocerebrosidase activity compared with AAV9. These findings establish BI-hTFR1 as a potential vector for human CNS gene therapy.},

Liu et al . found that the product of the decay of the electron diffraction signal induced by disordering and the inelastic scattering cross section provides an experimental measure of the number of microscopic states formed. Using this number, the entropy can then be determined through Boltzmann’s formula. This entropy is highly correlated with the calorimetric entropy of melting for several organic crystals, and this method allows the entropy to be determined for samples that sublime or decompose rather than melt. —Phil Szuromi Upon melting, the molecules in a crystal explore numerous configurations, reflecting an increase in disorder. The molar entropy of disorder can be defined by Boltzmann’s formula Δ S d = R ln( W d ), where W d is the increase in the number of microscopic states, so far inaccessible experimentally. We found that the Arrhenius frequency factor A of the electron diffraction signal decay provides W d through an experimental equation A = A INT W d , where A INT is an inelastic scattering cross section. The method connects Clausius and Boltzmann experimentally and supplements the Clausius approach, being applicable to a femtogram quantity of thermally unstable and biomolecular crystals. The data also showed that crystal disordering and crystallization of melt are reciprocal, both governed by the entropy change but manifesting in opposite directions.},

  abstract     = {Plant detritus is continually added to rivers and streams, where it is stored and decomposed, forming the base for aquatic food webs. Despite the major role that rivers play in carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production, the factors that influence organic matter decomposition in rivers are poorly understood. Tiegs et al . addressed this knowledge gap with a distributed experiment of cellulose decomposition (CELLDEX) replicated in more than 500 streams across six continents. Environmental variables explained cellulose decomposition rates and, when combined with data on litter quality, also explained published rates of leaf litter decomposition. This work could help to improve prediction of global change effects on the carbon cycle. —Bianca Lopez Rivers and streams contribute to global carbon cycling by decomposing immense quantities of terrestrial plant matter. However, decomposition rates are highly variable and large-scale patterns and drivers of this process remain poorly understood. Using a cellulose-based assay to reflect the primary constituent of plant detritus, we generated a predictive model (81% variance explained) for cellulose decomposition rates across 514 globally distributed streams. A large number of variables were important for predicting decomposition, highlighting the complexity of this process at the global scale. Predicted cellulose decomposition rates, when combined with genus-level litter quality attributes, explain published leaf litter decomposition rates with high accuracy (70% variance explained).

How the rewarding and aversive effects of opioids interact in the brain to control addiction-related behaviors is poorly understood. Smith et al . identified regions exhibiting modified neural activity in response to a rewarding dose of oxycodone. In addition to well-established regulators of physiological and behavioral responses to opioids, neural activity in the dorsal peduncular nucleus, a relatively unexplored area in the ventral prefrontal cortex, was also highly opioid responsive. A population of unusual glutamatergic neurons that were spatially restricted to the dorsal peduncular nucleus encoded states of aversion and were directly inhibited by opioids. —Peter Stern In addition to their intrinsic rewarding properties, opioids can also evoke aversive reactions that protect against misuse. Cellular mechanisms that govern the interplay between opioid reward and aversion are poorly understood. We used whole-brain activity mapping in mice to show that neurons in the dorsal peduncular nucleus (DPn) are highly responsive to the opioid oxycodone. Connectomic profiling revealed that DPn neurons innervate the parabrachial nucleus (PBn). Spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics resolved a population of PBn-projecting pyramidal neurons in the DPn that express μ-opioid receptors (μORs). Disrupting μOR signaling in the DPn switched oxycodone from rewarding to aversive and exacerbated the severity of opioid withdrawal. These findings identify the DPn as a key substrate for the abuse liability of opioids.},

Here, we describe how the single-celled protist Lacrymaria olor , a 40-micrometer cell, is capable of reversibly and repeatably extending its necklike protrusion up to 1200 micrometers in 30 seconds. We discovered a layered cortical cytoskeleton and membrane architecture that enables hyperextensions through the folding and unfolding of cellular-scale origami. Physical models of this curved crease origami display topological singularities, including traveling developable cones and cytoskeletal twisted domain walls, which provide geometric control of hyperextension. Our work unravels how cell geometry encodes behavior in single cells and provides inspiration for geometric control in microrobotics and deployable architectures.},

  abstract     = {When an individual T cell responds to signs of infection, the differentiation trajectory that it follows is defined by the cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic factors it experiences. Using single-cell imaging and deep learning, Hale et al . found that some T cells within a population were “stripy” and had nuclear envelope invaginations that concentrated cellular organelles. The occurrence of a stripy phenotype varied between populations of T cells at different developmental stages. In vitro analysis suggested that naïve T cells with a stripy architecture at the time of antigen stimulation differentiated preferentially into an effector-like phenotype. Cells without nuclear envelope invaginations responded to antigen but exhibited characteristics associated with memory T cells. —Sarah H. Ross After antigen stimulation, naïve T cells display reproducible population-level responses, which arise from individual T cells pursuing specific differentiation trajectories. However, cell-intrinsic predeterminants controlling these single-cell decisions remain enigmatic. We found that the subcellular architectures of naïve CD8 T cells, defined by the presence (T Ø ) or absence (T O ) of nuclear envelope invaginations, changed with maturation, activation, and differentiation. Upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, naïve T Ø cells displayed increased expression of the early-response gene Nr4a1 , dependent upon heightened calcium entry. Subsequently, in vitro differentiation revealed that T Ø cells generated effector-like cells more so compared with T O cells, which proliferated less and preferentially adopted a memory-precursor phenotype. These data suggest that cellular architecture may be a predeterminant of naïve CD8 T cell fate.},

These results illustrate a new approach to engineering the thermal properties of materials for applications in thermal management, energy harvesting, and thermal camouflage. —Ian S. Osborne The control of thermal radiation by shaping its spatial and spectral emission characteristics plays a key role in many areas of science and engineering. Conventional approaches to tailoring thermal emission using metamaterials are hampered both by the limited spatial resolution of the required subwavelength material structures and by the materials’ strong absorption in the infrared. In this work, we demonstrate an approach based on the concept of topology. By changing a single parameter of a multilayer coating, we were able to control the reflection topology of a surface, with the critical point of zero reflection being topologically protected. The boundaries between subcritical and supercritical spatial domains host topological interface states with near-unity thermal emissivity.

  abstract     = {Thermogenesis, the ability to generate heat and maintain body temperature in cold conditions, was an important adaptation that allowed mammals to thrive on Earth. Keipert et al . explored the evolutionary origin of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which acts at the mitochondria to uncouple respiratory metabolism from ATP generation, thus allowing the release of energy as heat (see the Perspective by Grabek and Sprenger). The authors analyzed transcriptome profiles from opossums and mice, representatives of marsupial and eutherian lineages that diverged about 150 million years ago. They also characterized a protein made from the predicted eutherian ancestral UCP1 sequence. Expression of UCP1 appears to have first evolved in adipose tissue and functioned in juvenile cold stress in the common therian ancestor. However, marsupials lack thermogenic UCP1, indicating that thermogenesis emerged in a second stage in the eutherians. —L. Bryan Ray Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a heater organ that expresses thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) to maintain high body temperatures during cold stress. BAT thermogenesis is considered an overarching mammalian trait, but its evolutionary origin is unknown. We show that adipose tissue of marsupials, which diverged from eutherian mammals ~ 150 million years ago, expresses a nonthermogenic UCP1 variant governed by a partial transcriptomic BAT signature similar to that found in eutherian beige adipose tissue. We found that the reconstructed UCP1 sequence of the common eutherian ancestor displayed typical thermogenic activity, whereas therian ancestor UCP1 is nonthermogenic. Thus, mammalian adipose tissue thermogenesis may have evolved in two distinct stages, with a prethermogenic stage in the common therian ancestor linking UCP1 expression to adipose tissue and thermal stress. We propose that in a second stage, UCP1 acquired its thermogenic function specifically in eutherians, such that the onset of mammalian BAT thermogenesis occurred only after the divergence from marsupials.},

In other fishes, mothers provide products to the egg to determine the embryonic axes, but these killifish do not follow this script. Abitua et al . discovered that killifish blastomere cells spread across the yolk, aggregate, and form a body axis in the developing embryo without the instruction of the maternal determinant, a protein named Huluwa. Moreover, killifish repurposed two important signaling pathways, Nodal and β-catenin, to coordinate aggregation and axis formation. This developmental strategy may help annual killifish survive drought conditions, and it shares features with the self-organization process of synthetic mammalian embryos. —Stella M. Hurtley Axis formation in fish and amphibians typically begins with a prepattern of maternal gene products. Annual killifish embryogenesis, however, challenges prepatterning models as blastomeres disperse and then aggregate to form the germ layers and body axes. We show that huluwa , a prepatterning factor thought to break symmetry by stabilizing β-catenin, is truncated and inactive in Nothobranchius furzeri . Nuclear β-catenin is not selectively stabilized on one side of the blastula but accumulates in cells forming the aggregate. Blocking β-catenin activity or Nodal signaling disrupts aggregate formation and germ layer specification. Nodal signaling coordinates cell migration, establishing an early role for this signaling pathway. These results reveal a surprising departure from established mechanisms of axis formation: Huluwa-mediated prepatterning is dispensable, and β-catenin and Nodal regulate morphogenesis.},

  abstract     = {The bulk photovoltaic effect in low-dimensional materials exploits built-in polarization to produce photoexcited carriers without the need for a junction. The output photocurrent, however, is low and efforts are underway to scale up the effect. Xue et al . introduce a method for the epitaxial growth of tungsten disulfide nanoribbon arrays with predefined chirality and coherent polarity. The flexibility in fabricating deterministic-structured ribbon arrays enables the systematic investigation of a chirality-dependent bulk photovoltaic effect and the realization of photovoltaic device arrays. The authors’ strategy provides a versatile means of on-demand tailoring and large-scale integration of one-dimensional materials, which should enable advances in self-driving on-chip electronics and optoelectronics. —Ian S. Osborne One-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides exhibiting an enhanced bulk photovoltaic effect have the potential to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit efficiency in solar energy harvest within p - n junction architectures. However, the collective output of these prototype devices remains a challenge. We report on the synthesis of single-crystalline WS 2 ribbon arrays with defined chirality and coherent polarity through an atomic manufacturing strategy. The chirality of WS 2 ribbon was defined by substrate couplings into tunable armchair, zigzag, and chiral species, and the polarity direction was determined by the ribbon-precursor interfacial energy along a coherent direction. A single armchair ribbon showed strong bulk photovoltaic effect and the further integration of ~1000 aligned ribbons with coherent polarity enabled upscaling of the photocurrent.},

  abstract     = {A number of twisted and helical structures have been observed in systems of achiral molecules. However, these structures are usually induced by the molecules having curved shapes or by the introduction of a chiral additive or solvent. In these latter cases, the chirality will reflect that of the additive. Karcz et al . reveal polar nematic phases in which breaking of mirror symmetry results in the spontaneous formation of a heliconical structure with the helical pitch in the near infrared and visible light wavelength range (see the Perspective by Lucchetti). The spontaneous breaking of the mirror symmetry arises from electric dipole interactions, thus showing similarity to the behavior of spins in magnetic systems. —Marc S. Lavine Spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking by formation of chiral structures from achiral building blocks and emergent polar order are phenomena rarely observed in fluids. Separately, they have both been found in certain nematic liquid crystalline phases; however, they have never been observed simultaneously. Here, we report a heliconical arrangement of achiral molecules in the ferroelectric nematic phase. The phase is thus spontaneously both polar and chiral. Notably, the pitch of the heliconical structure is comparable to the wavelength of visible light, giving selective reflection controllable by temperature or application of a weak electric field. Despite bearing resemblance to the heliconical twist-bend nematic phase, this chiral ferroelectric nematic phase arises from electrical interactions that induce a noncollinear orientation of electric dipoles.},

  abstract     = {The presence of neuronal amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates is one of the major hallmarks and causes of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ is produced by successive cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase; however, how precisely these multiple cleavages occur remains to be fully elucidated. Guo et al . used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize and describe how human γ-secretase engages the different peptide substrates during the successive steps of APP cleavage. Elucidating how γ-secretase generates Aβ peptides of varying lengths will deepen our understanding of amyloid biology and contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for AD. —Mattia Maroso Successive cleavages of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment with 99 residues (APP-C99) by γ-secretase result in amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides of varying lengths. Most cleavages have a step size of three residues. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we determined the atomic structures of human γ-secretase bound individually to APP-C99, Aβ49, Aβ46, and Aβ43. In all cases, the substrate displays the same structural features: a transmembrane α-helix, a three-residue linker, and a β-strand that forms a hybrid β-sheet with presenilin 1 (PS1). Proteolytic cleavage occurs just ahead of the substrate β-strand. Each cleavage is followed by unwinding and translocation of the substrate α-helix by one turn and the formation of a new β-strand. This mechanism is consistent with existing biochemical data and may explain the cleavages of other substrates by γ-secretase.},

  abstract     = {In most astronomical objects, carbon and oxygen have similar abundances. However, in regions cool enough for molecules to form, the resulting chemistry can be carbon or oxygen rich depending on their relative abundances. Arabhavi et al . used midinfrared spectroscopy to investigate the protoplanetary disk around a young low-mass star, finding that its spectrum is dominated by small hydrocarbon molecules, which indicates a high carbon/oxygen ratio in the inner disk gas. The authors discuss possible mechanisms to produce this carbon enrichment and suggest that it could influence the composition of any planets that form within the disk. —Keith T. Smith Very-low-mass stars (those less than 0.3 solar masses) host orbiting terrestrial planets more frequently than other types of stars. The compositions of those planets are largely unknown but are expected to relate to the protoplanetary disk in which they form. We used James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared spectroscopy to investigate the chemical composition of the planet-forming disk around ISO-ChaI 147, a 0.11-solar-mass star. The inner disk has a carbon-rich chemistry; we identified emission from 13 carbon-bearing molecules, including ethane and benzene. The high column densities of hydrocarbons indicate that the observations probe deep into the disk. The high carbon-to-oxygen ratio indicates radial transport of material within the disk, which we predict would affect the bulk composition of any planets forming in the disk.},

Evans alerted the authors to errors in an R script on which they had relied to calculate potential evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit using a heat load–modified Thornthwaite equation. In response, the authors updated to the newest, corrected version of this script and reran their analysis. Although many results remained unchanged after these corrections, the statistical significance of some conclusions, and the results of some robustness tests, did change. In addition, the paper’s primary result was not robust to the use of an alternate climate input dataset that calculated potential evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith equation. As a result, all authors agree to retract the paper. The authors thank S. Klesse, W. Anderegg, J. Abatzoglou, and M. E. K. Evans for quickly detecting and raising these issues.},

The authors investigated this question using a “ model ” gas-phase reaction of potassium-rubidium molecules, 2KRb → K 2 + Rb 2 , at the ultracold temperature of 500 nanokelvin. The KRb molecules were prepared in an entangled nuclear spin state using magnetic field ramping. The authors observed the preserved coherence in nuclear spin wave function after the reaction. The present research is not only of fundamental importance but also opens up new possibilities for the coherent control of chemical reactions and for broad quantum science applications. —Yury Suleymanov Chemical reactions, in which bonds break and form, are highly dynamic quantum processes. A fundamental question is whether coherence can be preserved in chemical reactions and then harnessed to generate entangled products. Here we investigated this question by studying the 2KRb → K 2 + Rb 2 reaction at 500 nanokelvins, focusing on the nuclear spin degrees of freedom. We prepared the initial nuclear spins in KRb (potassium-rubidium) in an entangled state by lowering the magnetic field to where the spin-spin interaction dominates and characterized the preserved coherence in nuclear spin wave function after the reaction. We observed an interference pattern that is consistent with full coherence at the end of the reaction, suggesting that entanglement prepared within the reactants could be redistributed through the atom-exchange process.},

Fortunately, the impact of flagrant vaccine misinformation on Facebook was greatly attenuated once such posts were flagged and debunked as false by third-party fact-checkers. However, ambiguous misinformation remained unflagged. Allen et al . examined a gray area that eluded fact-checkers: factually accurate but deceptive content (see the Perspective by van der Linden and Kyrychenko). This unflagged content cast doubts on vaccine safety or efficacy and was 46-fold more consequential for driving vaccine hesitancy than flagged misinformation. Tech companies assert that unflagged content must be protected by First Amendment free speech rights. However, this study’s causal evidence that unflagged content posed the greatest threat to public health carries policy implications for government regulation needed to save lives. —Ekeoma Uzogara Low uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the US has been widely attributed to social media misinformation. To evaluate this claim, we introduce a framework combining lab experiments (total N = 18,725), crowdsourcing, and machine learning to estimate the causal effect of 13,206 vaccine-related URLs on the vaccination intentions of US Facebook users ( N ≈ 233 million). We estimate that the impact of unflagged content that nonetheless encouraged vaccine skepticism was 46-fold greater than that of misinformation flagged by fact-checkers. Although misinformation reduced predicted vaccination intentions significantly more than unflagged vaccine content when viewed, Facebook users’ exposure to flagged content was limited. In contrast, unflagged stories highlighting rare deaths after vaccination were among Facebook’s most-viewed stories. Our work emphasizes the need to scrutinize factually accurate but potentially misleading content in addition to outright falsehoods.},

In fact, it remains unclear whether these cells actually exist and how they may relate to healthy tissue stem cells. Taylor et al . used a mouse model of skin carcinogenesis in which the tissue could be systematically studied during every stage of standardized progression from healthy skin to premalignant lesions and eventually full-blown cancer. By examining gene expression patterns at each stage, the authors identified particular gene networks, or “metagenes, ” that were associated with the cells’ behavior and potential response to chemotherapy, as well as transitions between the observed cell states. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Stem cells play a critical role in cancer development by contributing to cell heterogeneity, lineage plasticity, and drug resistance. We created gene expression networks from hundreds of mouse tissue samples (both normal and tumor) and integrated these with lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-seq, to identify convergence of cell states in premalignant tumor cells expressing markers of lineage plasticity and drug resistance. Two of these cell states representing multilineage plasticity or proliferation were inversely correlated, suggesting a mutually exclusive relationship. Treatment of carcinomas in vivo with chemotherapy repressed the proliferative state and activated multilineage plasticity whereas inhibition of differentiation repressed plasticity and potentiated responses to cell cycle inhibitors.

  abstract     = {Cancers such as HER2-positive breast cancer are typically characterized by their location and marker proteins that influence how they behave and what treatments they respond to. However, not all cancers or tumors that nominally fall into a single category behave the same way. Some of these differences are caused by genetically encoded attributes affecting the tumor’s interactions with the immune system, as shown by Houlahan et al . (see the Perspective by Waddell and Addala). The authors demonstrated that a patient’s germline variants in an oncogene of interest, such as HER2, as well as their human leukocyte antigens responsible for the presentation of antigens to T cells, help to determine which tumors might survive and which ones will likely be destroyed by the patient’s immune system. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Tumors with the same diagnosis can have different molecular profiles and response to treatment. It remains unclear when and why these differences arise. Somatic genomic aberrations occur within the context of a highly variable germline genome. Interrogating 5870 breast cancer lesions, we demonstrated that germline-derived epitopes in recurrently amplified genes influence somatic evolution by mediating immunoediting. Individuals with a high germline-epitope burden in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ ERBB2 ) are less likely to develop HER2-positive breast cancer compared with other subtypes. The same holds true for recurrent amplicons defining three aggressive estrogen receptor (ER)–positive subgroups. Tumors that overcome such immune-mediated negative selection are more aggressive and demonstrate an “immune cold” phenotype. These data show that the germline genome plays a role in dictating somatic evolution.},

Princen et al . identified a class of compounds called ReS19-T that were able to restore calcium homeostasis in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of AD. The compounds were also able to inhibit pathological activation of store-operated calcium channels by binding to septins and restraining calcium entry into the neurons through these channels. Treating animal models of AD with ReS19-T compounds reduced pathological protein accumulation and restored neuronal function, suggesting that normalization of calcium homeostasis through septin modulation might be an effective approach for reducing neurodegeneration in AD. —Mattia Maroso Abnormal calcium signaling is a central pathological component of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we describe the identification of a class of compounds called ReS19-T, which are able to restore calcium homeostasis in cell-based models of tau pathology. Aberrant tau accumulation leads to uncontrolled activation of store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) by remodeling septin filaments at the cell cortex. Binding of ReS19-T to septins restores filament assembly in the disease state and restrains calcium entry through SOCCs. In amyloid-β and tau-driven mouse models of disease, ReS19-T agents restored synaptic plasticity, normalized brain network activity, and attenuated the development of both amyloid-β and tau pathology. Our findings identify the septin cytoskeleton as a potential therapeutic target for the development of disease-modifying AD treatments.},

  abstract     = {Coevolution has often been studied in systems such as infectious disease, where hosts and parasites have very different generation times and other life history traits. By contrast, Langmore et al . studied several virulent species of cuckoos, brood parasite birds that kick host young out of the nest after hatching, thus placing a high selective pressure on their hosts to recognize the imposters. Using modeling, the authors found that particularly virulent species had higher speciation rates than less virulent ones. They also looked at the DNA and morphology of bronze cuckoos, finding that assortative mating was occurring between those that targeted the same hosts. This study elucidates speciation dynamics in this coevolving system. —Corinne Simonti Coevolution between interacting species is thought to increase biodiversity, but evidence linking microevolutionary processes to macroevolutionary patterns is scarce. We leveraged two decades of behavioral research coupled with historical DNA analysis to reveal that coevolution with hosts underpins speciation in brood-parasitic bronze-cuckoos. At a macroevolutionary scale, we show that highly virulent brood-parasitic taxa have higher speciation rates and are more likely to speciate in sympatry than less-virulent and nonparasitic relatives. We reveal the microevolutionary process underlying speciation: Hosts reject cuckoo nestlings, which selects for mimetic cuckoo nestling morphology. Where cuckoos exploit multiple hosts, selection for mimicry drives genetic and phenotypic divergence corresponding to host preference, even in sympatry. Our work elucidates perhaps the most common, but poorly characterized, evolutionary process driving biological diversification.},

Wang et al . developed a high-strength steel with attractive ductility even at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The steel contains iron, manganese, aluminum, nickel, and carbon and forms a very strong matrix with zones of local ordering and nanoprecipitates. The high strength is due to solid solution strengthening, and this strengthening effect is high enough that the normally brittle nanoparticles will shear instead and accommodate deformation. This allows the high-strength steel to resist brittle fracture better than other low-temperature structural materials. —Brent Grocholski Precipitates are crucial for crafting mechanically strong metallic materials. In this work, we report the dislocation cutting of B2 (ordered body-centered cubic) nanoprecipitates, typically considered nonshearable intermetallics, in a lightweight compositionally complex steel during cryogenic tensile loading. Shearing is enabled by the high strength level for dislocation glide within the austenitic matrix, attributed to the substantial strengthening from subnanoscale local chemical ordering zones and the pronounced solid solution strengthening from the multiprincipal elements in the matrix. This mechanism not only harnesses the intense strengthening and strain hardening provided by otherwise impenetrable brittle nanoprecipitates but also introduces ductility through their sequential shearing with ongoing deformation. Our steel thus showcases ultrahigh cryogenic tensile strength up to 2 gigapascal at a remarkable tensile elongation of 34%. This study reveals a new strategy for designing high-performance structural materials.},

The authors started with 5- to 10-millimeter particles and ended up with 5- to 10-nanometer particles. The nanoparticles were created through a complex process involving defects, droplet formation, chemical interactions, and the electric field. This process may be naturally replicated in some settings, which could explain the origin of some mineral nanoparticles. —Brent Grocholski In this work, we show that particles of common minerals break down spontaneously to form nanoparticles in charged water microdroplets within milliseconds. We transformed micron-sized natural minerals like quartz and ruby into 5- to 10-nanometer particles when integrated into aqueous microdroplets generated via electrospray. We deposited the droplets on a substrate, which allowed nanoparticle characterization. We determined through simulations that quartz undergoes proton-induced slip, especially when reduced in size and exposed to an electric field. This leads to particle scission and the formation of silicate fragments, which we confirmed with mass spectrometry.

  abstract     = {Mammals have drawn particular research attention because of their huge level of morphological variation. Until recently, most believed that the dinosaur decline at the end of the Cretaceous opened niches for mammals to fill, resulting in a burst of speciation. Quintero et al . developed a model that integrated phylogenetics and fossils to estimate diversification rates across all mammalian lineages and concluded that mammalian speciation rates were high well before the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Rather than leading to a burst of diversification, the major environmental changes during the time filtered out more slowly speciating mammalian lineages, leading to domination of the group by those that speciated more rapidly. —Sacha Vignieri The evolutionary histories of major clades, including mammals, often comprise changes in their diversification dynamics, but how these changes occur remains debated. We combined comprehensive phylogenetic and fossil information in a new “birth-death diffusion” model that provides a detailed characterization of variation in diversification rates in mammals. We found an early rising and sustained diversification scenario, wherein speciation rates increased before and during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. The K-Pg mass extinction event filtered out more slowly speciating lineages and was followed by a subsequent slowing in speciation rates rather than rebounds. These dynamics arose from an imbalanced speciation process, with separate lineages giving rise to many, less speciation-prone descendants. Diversity seems to have been brought about by these isolated, fast-speciating lineages, rather than by a few punctuated innovations.},

Shao et al . grew nanowires of (BrCA3) 2 PbBr 4 , where BrCA3 is 2-(2-bromo-5-carboxyphenoxy)ethan-1-aminium. The carboxylic acid group of BrCA3 inhibited the growth of all crystal facets except [110], which led to one-directional growth. The nanowires also achieved efficient light amplification, with a threshold of less than 20 microjoules per square centimeter. —Phil Szuromi Layered metal-halide perovskites, or two-dimensional perovskites, can be synthesized in solution, and their optical and electronic properties can be tuned by changing their composition. We report a molecular templating method that restricted crystal growth along all crystallographic directions except for [110] and promoted one-dimensional growth. Our approach is widely applicable to synthesize a range of high-quality layered perovskite nanowires with large aspect ratios and tunable organic-inorganic chemical compositions. These nanowires form exceptionally well-defined and flexible cavities that exhibited a wide range of unusual optical properties beyond those of conventional perovskite nanowires. We observed anisotropic emission polarization, low-loss waveguiding (below 3 decibels per millimeter), and efficient low-threshold light amplification (below 20 microjoules per square centimeter).},

  abstract     = {The formation of crystalline order is usually considered the ground state of a system. However, recent work has shown that open quantum systems driven either periodically or continuously can form ordered states as a function of time. These discrete or continuous time crystals have been realized in a number of systems. Carraro-Haddad et al . provide an example of a continuous time crystal in a solid-state system. The coupled excitons and photons in a semiconducting microcavity break time-translational symmetry as energy is continuously pumped into the system, forming a time crystal that oscillates to the phonon frequency. The tunable system is a versatile platform for fundamental studies of time crystals and for applications in polaritonics. —Ian S. Osborne Time crystals (TCs) are many-body systems that display spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry. We demonstrate a TC by using driven-dissipative condensates of microcavity exciton-polaritons, spontaneously formed from an incoherent particle bath. The TC phases are controlled by the power of a continuous-wave nonresonant optical drive exciting the condensate and the interaction with cavity phonons. Those phases are, for increasing power, Larmor-like precession of the condensate pseudo-spins—a signature of continuous TC; locking of the frequency of precession to self-sustained coherent phonons—stabilized TC; and doubling of TC’s period by phonons—a discrete TC with continuous excitation. These results establish microcavity polaritons as a platform for the investigation of time-broken symmetry in nonhermitian systems.},

Liu et al . designed, fabricateed, and used artificial intelligence–guided signal processing to develop an electronic skin that mimics human mechanosensation. The three-dimensional configuration of pressure and strain sensors and a heterogeneous encapsulation strategy enabled the differentiation of normal or shear forces and induced strain. The authors demonstrated the application of this electronic skin by measuring the freshness of foods such as fruits, cake, and bread through touch-sensitive detection of changes in modulus. —Marc S. Lavine Human skin sensing of mechanical stimuli originates from transduction of mechanoreceptors that converts external forces into electrical signals. Although imitating the spatial distribution of those mechanoreceptors can enable developments of electronic skins capable of decoupled sensing of normal/shear forces and strains, it remains elusive. We report a three-dimensionally (3D) architected electronic skin (denoted as 3DAE-Skin) with force and strain sensing components arranged in a 3D layout that mimics that of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings in human skin. This 3DAE-Skin shows excellent decoupled sensing performances of normal force, shear force, and strain and enables development of a tactile system for simultaneous modulus/curvature measurements of an object through touch. Demonstrations include rapid modulus measurements of fruits, bread, and cake with various shapes and degrees of freshness.},

  abstract     = {Will ice mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet caused by climate warming disrupt large-scale ocean circulation? Zhou et al . reconstructed iceberg production rates during the massive calving episodes of the last glacial period, called Heinrich events, when icebergs did affect ocean circulation. The authors found that present-day Greenland Ice Sheet calving rates are as high as during some of those events. However, because melting is causing the Greenland Ice Sheet to recede from the coasts of Greenland, where icebergs originate, its iceberg discharge should not persist long enough to cause major disruption of the Atlantic overturning circulation by itself. —Jesse Smith During Heinrich events, great armadas of icebergs episodically flooded the North Atlantic Ocean and weakened overturning circulation. The ice discharges of these episodes constrain the sensitivity of overturning circulation to iceberg melting. We reconstructed these ice discharges to be as high as 0.13 sverdrup (Sv) (1 Sv = 1 million cubic meters per second) during Heinrich event 4 and to average 0.029 Sv over all episodes. The present-day Greenland Ice Sheet calving of icebergs is comparable to that of a mid-range Heinrich event. As the future Greenland Ice Sheet recedes from marine-terminating outlets, its iceberg calving likely will not persist long enough for icebergs alone to cause catastrophic disruption to the Atlantic overturning circulation, although the accelerating Greenland runoff and continued global warming remain threats to the circulation stability.},

  abstract     = {Most fake news on Twitter (now X) is spread by an extremely small population called supersharers. They flood the platform and unequally distort political debates, but a clear demographic portrait of these users was not available. Baribi-Bartov et al . identified a meaningful sample of supersharers during the 2020 US presidential election and asked who they were, where they lived, and what strategies they used (see the Perspective by van der Linden and Kyrychenko). The authors found that supersharers were disproportionately Republican, middle-aged White women residing in three conservative states, Arizona, Florida, and Texas, which are focus points of contentious abortion and immigration battles. Their neighborhoods were poorly educated but relatively high in income. Supersharers persistently retweeted misinformation manually. These insights are relevant for policymakers developing effective mitigation strategies to curtail misinformation. —Ekeoma Uzogara Governments may have the capacity to flood social media with fake news, but little is known about the use of flooding by ordinary voters. In this work, we identify 2107 registered US voters who account for 80% of the fake news shared on Twitter during the 2020 US presidential election by an entire panel of 664,391 voters. We found that supersharers were important members of the network, reaching a sizable 5.2% of registered voters on the platform. Supersharers had a significant overrepresentation of women, older adults, and registered Republicans. Supersharers’ massive volume did not seem automated but was rather generated through manual and persistent retweeting. These findings highlight a vulnerability of social media for democracy, where a small group of people distort the political reality for many.},

Science is now publishing a formal erratum that, in addition to the previous correction to fig. S4, includes the corrections to figs. S6 and S10. Busino et al. retrieved the original blots and corrected the three figures. In figs. S4, B and C, and S10, actin loading controls were duplicated. Actin blots from several experiments were electronically stored as cropped images with similar names, leading to errors in the final assembly of these two figures. Figures S4, B and C, and S10 have been revised to show the correct actin blots. Labels indicating hours of cycloheximide treatment have also been added to fig. S4. In fig. S6, there was a duplication in the c-Jun blot, which occurred after quantification with ImageJ, when blots were pasted back into the original files to keep track of the quantification progress. The Fbxl3 shRNA blot was inadvertently pasted into the LacZ shRNA file, which was then mistakenly used to assemble the c-Jun blot. Figure S6A has been revised to show the correct c-Jun blot. These corrections do not change any of Busino et al.’s conclusions.},

For 28 cell types, we assessed population-level variation in expression and chromatin across gene families and drug targets. We identified &gt;550,000 cell type–specific regulatory elements and &gt;1.4 million single-cell expression quantitative trait loci, which we used to build cell-type regulatory and cell-to-cell communication networks. These networks manifest cellular changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders.

In this work, we leveraged single-molecule long-read sequencing to deeply profile the full-length transcriptome of the germinal zone and cortical plate regions of the developing human neocortex at tissue and single-cell resolution. We identified 214,516 distinct isoforms, of which 72.6% were novel (not previously annotated in Gencode version 33), and uncovered a substantial contribution of transcript-isoform diversity—regulated by RNA binding proteins—in defining cellular identity in the developing neocortex. We leveraged this comprehensive isoform-centric gene annotation to reprioritize thousands of rare de novo risk variants and elucidate genetic risk mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Only 10.4% of caQTLs are shared between neurons and non-neurons, which supports cell type–specific genetic regulation of the brain regulome. Incorporating allele-specific chromatin accessibility improves statistical fine-mapping and refines molecular mechanisms that underlie disease risk. Using massively parallel reporter assays in induced excitatory neurons, we screened 19,893 brain QTLs and identified the functional impact of 476 regulatory variants.

Transcriptomic changes were primarily cell type specific, involving multiple cell types, most prominently interhemispheric and callosal-projecting neurons, interneurons within superficial laminae, and distinct glial reactive states involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes.

Gene expression heritability drops during development, likely reflecting both increasing cellular heterogeneity and the intrinsic properties of neuronal maturation. Isoform-level regulation, particularly in the second trimester, mediated the largest proportion of GWAS heritability. Through colocalization, we prioritized mechanisms for about 60% of GWAS loci across five disorders, exceeding adult brain findings. Finally, we contextualized results within gene and isoform coexpression networks, revealing the comprehensive landscape of transcriptome regulation in development and disease.},

Using massively parallel reporter assays in primary human cells from mid-gestation cortex and cerebral organoids, we interrogated the cis-regulatory activity of 102,767 open chromatin regions, including thousands of sequences with cell type–specific accessibility and variants associated with brain gene regulation. In primary cells, we identified 46,802 active enhancer sequences and 164 variants that alter enhancer activity. Activity was comparable in organoids and primary cells, suggesting that organoids provide an adequate model for the developing cortex. Using deep learning we decoded the sequence basis and upstream regulators of enhancer activity.

  abstract     = {Living cells contain numerous membraneless organelles formed by phase separation of macrobiomolecules. These organelles need to be segregated as discrete cellular subcompartments to perform specific cellular functions, although the molecular mechanisms that maintain this segregation are poorly understood. The postsynaptic cytomatrices of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal synapses (ePSDs and iPSDs, respectively) are such membraneless organelles that do not mix with each other even within a tiny spine protrusion. Zhu et al . demonstrate that ePSD and iPSD condensates each form a percolated network through specific molecular interactions and are naturally segregated from each other. Forced interaction between ePSD and iPSD proteins with a nanomolar binding affinity cannot mix ePSD and iPSD condensates together, indicating that demixing is a default process for biomolecules in membraneless organelles formed by phase separation. —Di Jiang Excitatory and inhibitory synapses do not overlap even when formed on one submicron-sized dendritic protrusion. How excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic cytomatrices or densities (e/iPSDs) are segregated is not understood. Broadly, why membraneless organelles are naturally segregated in cellular subcompartments is unclear. Using biochemical reconstitutions in vitro and in cells, we demonstrate that ePSDs and iPSDs spontaneously segregate into distinct condensed molecular assemblies through phase separation. Tagging iPSD scaffold gephyrin with a PSD-95 intrabody (dissociation constant ~4 nM) leads to mistargeting of gephyrin to ePSD condensates. Unexpectedly, formation of iPSD condensates forces the intrabody-tagged gephyrin out of ePSD condensates. Thus, instead of diffusion-governed spontaneous mixing, demixing is a default process for biomolecules in condensates. Phase separation can generate biomolecular compartmentalization specificities that cannot occur in dilute solutions.},

  abstract     = {In theory, larger metal crystals in high-nickel-content nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathodes should have a higher practical capacity than polycrystalline ones because of the absence of grain boundaries and heterogeneous volume changes. However, in practice, single-crystalline NMC particles with more than 70% nickel exhibit worse performance with more rapid capacity fade. Huang et al . developed a technique to capture both statistical and individual lattice distortions in an ensemble of particles, thus bridging between the information provided by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy methods. The authors observed that lattice rotation, a frequently occurring but often underdetected lattice distortion, is a primary factor initiating structural and electrochemical degradation in single-crystal cathode particles. —Marc S. Lavine Transitioning from polycrystalline to single-crystalline nickel-rich cathodes has garnered considerable attention in both academia and industry, driven by advantages of high tap density and enhanced mechanical properties. However, cathodes with high nickel content (&gt;70%) suffer from substantial capacity degradation, which poses a challenge to their commercial viability. Leveraging multiscale spatial resolution diffraction and imaging techniques, we observe that lattice rotations occur universally in single-crystalline cathodes and play a pivotal role in the structure degradation. These lattice rotations prove unrecoverable and govern the accumulation of adverse lattice distortions over repeated cycles, contributing to structural and mechanical degradation and fast capacity fade. These findings bridge the previous knowledge gap that exists in the mechanistic link between fast performance failure and atomic-scale structure degradation.},

Vogelsang et al . focused on the impact of neonatal visual experience, analyzing recognition performance in 10 congenitally blind children who gained sight later in life (see the Perspective by Mamassian). The late-sighted children showed reduced resilience to color removal compared with born-sighted children. Control experiments and in silico simulations suggested that the immature grayscale vision that born-sighted children experienced at the neonatal stage facilitates color-independent recognition later in life. By experiencing color vision from the very beginning, late-sighted children likely rely more on colors than their age-matched counterparts. —Mattia Maroso Human visual recognition is remarkably robust to chromatic changes. In this work, we provide a potential account of the roots of this resilience based on observations with 10 congenitally blind children who gained sight late in life. Several months or years following their sight-restoring surgeries, the removal of color cues markedly reduced their recognition performance, whereas age-matched normally sighted children showed no such decrement. This finding may be explained by the greater-than-neonatal maturity of the late-sighted children’s color system at sight onset, inducing overly strong reliance on chromatic cues. Simulations with deep neural networks corroborate this hypothesis. These findings highlight the adaptive significance of typical developmental trajectories and provide guidelines for enhancing machine vision systems.},

  abstract     = {Humans have been domesticating plants for over 10,000 years, collecting wild species and eventually breeding them for desirable traits. Although rice is one of the most globally important staple crops, the timing and stages of its path from wild ( Oryza rufipogon ) to domesticated ( O. sativa ) is poorly understood. Genetic studies suggest that rice exploitation may have begun in the late Pleistocene, earlier than is documented in archaeological evidence. Zhang et al . present phytolith samples from the lower Yangtze River valley that suggest an earlier domestication date (about 11,000 years ago), which followed stages of exploitation (about 24,000 years ago) and early cultivation. This work shows that plant use and domestication occurred concurrently in Southeast Asia and the Fertile Crescent. —Bianca Lopez Rice ( Oryza sativa ) serves as a staple food for more than one-third of the global population. However, its journey from a wild gathered food to domestication remains enigmatic, sparking ongoing debates in the biological and anthropological fields. Here, we present evidence of rice phytoliths sampled from two archaeological sites in China, Shangshan and Hehuashan, near the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. We demonstrate the growth of wild rice at least 100,000 years before present, its initial exploitation as a gathered resource at about 24,000 years before present, its predomestication cultivation at about 13,000 years before present, and eventually its domestication at about 11,000 years before present. These developmental stages illuminate a protracted process of rice domestication in East Asia and extend the continuous records of cereal evolution beyond the Fertile Crescent.},

Building on these findings, Ku et al . performed large-scale drug screening to identify chemical inhibitors of STK33, obtained crystal structures of STK33 with some of the compounds, and used this information to inform structure-activity relationship studies (see the Perspective by Holdaway and Georg). The most promising compound successfully reduced fertility in vivo in male mice without any detectable safety concerns. Importantly, the effects of this treatment were reversible, and the mice recovered their fertility soon after the treatment was discontinued. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Men or mice with homozygous serine/threonine kinase 33 ( STK33 ) mutations are sterile owing to defective sperm morphology and motility. To chemically evaluate STK33 for male contraception with STK33-specific inhibitors, we screened our multibillion-compound collection of DNA-encoded chemical libraries, uncovered potent STK33-specific inhibitors, determined the STK33 kinase domain structure bound with a truncated hit CDD-2211, and generated an optimized hit CDD-2807 that demonstrates nanomolar cellular potency (half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 9.2 nanomolar) and favorable metabolic stability. In mice, CDD-2807 exhibited no toxicity, efficiently crossed the blood-testis barrier, did not accumulate in brain, and induced a reversible contraceptive effect that phenocopied genetic STK33 perturbations without altering testis size.

  abstract     = {Numerical ability has been increasingly identified in nonhuman animals. Animals as diverse as birds and bees have been shown to be able to “count, ” and they can discriminate among different numbers of objects or between greater or fewer objects. Liao et al . tested whether crows, which are known for both their numerical skills and high level of cognition, could use vocalizations to count out loud, a skill that is challenging even for young humans. The crows flexibly produced between one and four vocalizations for corresponding cues associated with numerical values. Furthermore, they used different calls for different numbers. —Sacha Vignieri Producing a specific number of vocalizations with purpose requires a sophisticated combination of numerical abilities and vocal control. Whether this capacity exists in animals other than humans is yet unknown. We show that crows can flexibly produce variable numbers of one to four vocalizations in response to arbitrary cues associated with numerical values. The acoustic features of the first vocalization of a sequence were predictive of the total number of vocalizations, indicating a planning process. Moreover, the acoustic features of vocal units predicted their order in the sequence and could be used to read out counting errors during vocal production.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, the diffuse gas that permeates the space between galaxies, exists today in an ionized state ( 1 ). Yet, this hasn’t always been the case. Very early on, approximately 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the intergalactic medium was primarily neutral. The subsequent transition to an ionized universe, known as reionization, lasted about a billion years and remains poorly understood. Ionization occurs when hydrogen absorbs a photon from the far-ultraviolet (UV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which breaks the electron-nucleus bond. It is thought that the first stars and galaxies initiated this transformation. On page 890 of this issue, however, Heintz et al . ( 2 ) report three galaxies harboring substantial reservoirs of neutral hydrogen a few hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang, a time when this transition is expected to occur. This challenges the role that early galaxies play in the reionization process.},

Hormonal-based approaches for male contraception are being investigated in clinical trials, but none have been approved ( 2 ). Nonhormonal targets present a promising avenue with potentially fewer side effects, but few are pursued for drug discovery. On page 885 of this issue, Ku et al . ( 3 ) report a drug screen of multibillion compounds encoded with DNA that enabled the discovery and development of a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine-protein kinase 33 (STK33). This testis-enriched kinase is indispensable for male fertility in humans and mice. The STK33 inhibitor CDD-2807 induced reversible male infertility without measurable toxicity in mice. These findings provide substantial support that targeted nonhormonal approaches can be effective in the development of a male contraceptive pill.},

This question is particularly critical for newborns as they start to discover their environment, when the simultaneous exposure to a variety of sensory stimuli likely makes the world feel like “one great blooming, buzzing confusion” [( 1 ), p. 488]. This complexity explains in part why perceptual systems (such as the visual system) need time to fully mature, so that, for instance, motion is perceived earlier than color, and motion of the full visual field is detected earlier than motion of isolated objects ( 2 ). On page 907 of this issue, Vogelsang et al . ( 3 ) report the functional benefits of multistage maturation for the visual system, showing that the late development of color vision is important to improve object recognition. This could help to explain why sequential steps in the maturation of perceptual abilities are important.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in experimental automation and integration with artificial intelligence (AI) have laid the foundation for so-called “self-driving labs,” but they remained limited to simple proof-of-concept experiments. Strieth-Kalthoff et al . introduced the concept of asynchronous cloud-based delocalized closed-loop (ACDC) discovery to drive multiple geographically distributed platforms in a single discovery campaign in which each unit operates as an independent, asynchronous worker executing experiments planned by a central AI entity. The ACDC concept has been successfully applied in the search for organic solid-state laser gain materials with state-of-the-art lasing performance, a challenging scientific problem with slow progress, thereby demonstrating the power of this closed-loop campaign. —Yury Suleymanov Contemporary materials discovery requires intricate sequences of synthesis, formulation, and characterization that often span multiple locations with specialized expertise or instrumentation. To accelerate these workflows, we present a cloud-based strategy that enabled delocalized and asynchronous design-make-test-analyze cycles. We showcased this approach through the exploration of molecular gain materials for organic solid-state lasers as a frontier application in molecular optoelectronics. Distributed robotic synthesis and in-line property characterization, orchestrated by a cloud-based artificial intelligence experiment planner, resulted in the discovery of 21 new state-of-the-art materials. Gram-scale synthesis ultimately allowed for the verification of best-in-class stimulated emission in a thin-film device. Demonstrating the asynchronous integration of five laboratories across the globe, this workflow provides a blueprint for delocalizing—and democratizing—scientific discovery.},

Kelly Germline-targeting (GT) HIV vaccine strategies are predicated on deriving broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) through multiple boost immunogens. However, as the recruitment of memory B cells (MBCs) to germinal centers (GCs) is inefficient and may be derailed by serum antibody–induced epitope masking, driving further B cell receptor (BCR) modification in GC-experienced B cells after boosting poses a challenge. Using humanized immunoglobulin knockin mice, we found that GT protein trimer immunogen N332-GT5 could prime inferred-germline precursors to the V3-glycan–targeted bnAb BG18 and that B cells primed by N332-GT5 were effectively boosted by either of two novel protein immunogens designed to have minimum cross-reactivity with the off-target V1-binding responses. The delivery of the prime and boost immunogens as messenger RNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) generated long-lasting GCs, somatic hypermutation, and affinity maturation and may be an effective tool in HIV vaccine development.},

In this work, immunization with N332-GT5, an HIV envelope trimer designed to target precursors of the HCDR3-dominant bnAb BG18, primed bnAb-precursor B cells in eight of eight rhesus macaques to substantial frequencies and with diverse lineages in germinal center and memory B cells.

  abstract     = {Dehydration of alcohols is a common reaction in organic chemistry. Loss of water typically produces an olefin with a double bond between the site where the OH group was and its neighboring carbon—a process called β elimination. Grant et al . report an unusual variation in which alcohols on 10-membered rings are treated with triflic acid. Instead of forming double bonds, these compounds react highly selectively to produce decalins through ζ elimination, in which a new bond forms between the alcohol carbon and a carbon five bonds away. A computational study elucidated the thermodynamics underlying the selectivity. —Jake S. Yeston Science 10.1126/science.adi8997 Generally, the acidity of carbon-hydrogen bonds is most sensitive to functionality just one or two bonds away. Here, we present an approach to the formation of carbon-carbon σ bonds by remote proton elimination, a distinct mode of carbon-hydrogen activation enabled by distal acidification through five carbon-carbon bonds. Application of remote proton elimination to cyclodecyl cations unveiled an appealing method for the synthesis of decalins. The transformation is regioconvergent, proceeds without the need for a directing group or precious metal, and demonstrates exquisite site selectivity. An in-depth computational study illuminated the reaction mechanism. Additionally, we describe the complete stereoisomeric enrichment of the decalin products through epimerization mediated by hydrogen atom transfer.},

  abstract     = {The physician-patient relationship should be immune from bias, but growing evidence challenges physicians’ objectivity. Previous research has struggled to quantify variations in power differentials and the impact on diverse patients in real-world settings. Schwab and Singh exploited vast data from US military emergency departments where active-duty physicians and patients have military ranks and some patients outrank their assigned physician (see the Perspective by Nimmon). They found that patients who outranked physicians enjoyed more physician effort and better health outcomes because more resources were inequitably invested on them, and that White physicians consistently put less effort into caring for Black patients. Subsequent health disparities may be starker outside of the military because civilians are typically less physically healthy. —Ekeoma Uzogara Power—the asymmetric control of valued resources—affects most human interactions. Although power is challenging to study with real-world data, a distinctive dataset allowed us to do so within the critical context of doctor-patient relationships. Using 1.5 million quasi-random assignments in US military emergency departments, we examined how power differentials between doctor and patient (measured by using differences in military ranks) affect physician behavior. Our findings indicate that power confers nontrivial advantages: “High-power” patients (who outrank their physician) receive more resources and have better outcomes than equivalently ranked “low-power” patients. Patient promotions even increase physician effort. Furthermore, low-power patients suffer if their physician concurrently cares for a high-power patient. Doctor-patient concordance on race and sex also matters. Overall, power-driven variation in behavior can harm the most vulnerable populations in health care settings.},

  abstract     = {It has long been known that sea otters sometimes use tools like shells and rocks to help them process their often thick-shelled mollusk prey. Law et al . show that animals who make regular use of such tools, especially females, are better able to consume a wide variety of prey, have higher energy consumption rates, and show reduced tooth wear (see the Perspective by Klump). The broadening of prey base facilitated by the use of tools was especially important in cases where the more easily processed prey that are preferred, such as abalone, were in short supply. —Sacha Vignieri Although tool use may enhance resource utilization, its fitness benefits are difficult to measure. By examining longitudinal data from 196 radio-tagged southern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris nereis ), we found that tool-using individuals, particularly females, gained access to larger and/or harder-shelled prey. These mechanical advantages translated to reduced tooth damage during food processing. We also found that tool use diminishes trade-offs between access to different prey, tooth condition, and energy intake, all of which are dependent on the relative prey availability in the environment. Tool use allowed individuals to maintain energetic requirements through the processing of alternative prey that are typically inaccessible with biting alone, suggesting that this behavior is a necessity for the survival of some otters in environments where preferred prey are depleted.},

Boon et al . elucidated a pathway by which DNA damage can induce cell death in cells lacking p53. In cultured human cells, apoptosis induced by DNA damage occurred in cells with decreased translation. A genetic screen showed that this response required the transfer RNA endonuclease SLFN11, which is often found to be mutated in cancers unresponsive to chemotherapy. Activation of SLFN11 led to ribosome stalling, which then signaled initiation of apoptosis. —L. Bryan Ray In response to excessive DNA damage, human cells can activate p53 to induce apoptosis. Cells lacking p53 can still undergo apoptosis upon DNA damage, yet the responsible pathways are unknown. We observed that p53-independent apoptosis in response to DNA damage coincided with translation inhibition, which was characterized by ribosome stalling on rare leucine-encoding UUA codons and globally curtailed translation initiation. A genetic screen identified the transfer RNAse SLFN11 and the kinase GCN2 as factors required for UUA stalling and global translation inhibition, respectively. Stalled ribosomes activated a ribotoxic stress signal conveyed by the ribosome sensor ZAKα to the apoptosis machinery. These results provide an explanation for the frequent inactivation of SLFN11 in chemotherapy-unresponsive tumors and highlight ribosome stalling as a signaling event affecting cell fate in response to DNA damage.},

However, attempts so far have mostly only been successful in silico and often fail in experiment because of unpredicted traps associated with kinetic slowing down (gelation, glass transition) and competing ordered structures. Theoretical predictions also face the difficulty of encoding the desired interparticle interaction potential with the experimentally available nano- and micrometer-sized particles. To overcome these issues, we combine SAT assembly (a patchy-particle interaction design algorithm based on constrained optimization) with coarse-grained simulations of DNA nanotechnology to experimentally realize trap-free self-assembly pathways. We use this approach to assemble a pyrochlore three-dimensional lattice, coveted for its promise in the construction of optical metamaterials, and characterize it with small-angle x-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy visualization.},

It has also been well studied over many years, leading to much knowledge about how much energy is directly invested in the production of offspring. However, the other half of this investment, the cost of caring for offspring, was not clear. Ginther et al . developed a framework for estimating the overall costs of reproduction across taxa and teased apart the factors that contribute to the total. They found that caring for offspring is as much as 10 times more energy expensive than producing them, and this higher expense is the case not just in mammals (in which costs are the highest), but in other taxa as well. —Sacha Vignieri Reproduction includes two energy investments—the energy in the offspring and the energy expended to make them. The former is well understood, whereas the latter is unquantified but often assumed to be small. Without understanding both investments, the true energy costs of reproduction are unknown. We present a framework for estimating the total energy costs of reproduction by combining data on the energy content of offspring (direct costs) and the metabolic load of bearing them (indirect costs). We find that direct costs typically represent the smaller fraction of the energy expended on reproduction. Mammals pay the highest reproductive costs (excluding lactation), ~90% of which are indirect. Ectotherms expend less on reproduction overall, and live-bearing ectotherms pay higher indirect costs compared with egg-layers. We show that the energy demands of reproduction exceed standard assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Zintl materials can be attractive for thermoelectric applications because of their wide range of compositions and tunable properties. Shi et al . devised a method to quickly find which materials from four parent compounds have electronic band structures that improve thermoelectric performance. After identifying several compositions, the authors showed that the best of these has good long-term and high temperature stability. This compound can be paired with another zintl material to make a device that has attractive thermoelectric performance at midrange temperatures. —Brent Grocholski Electronic band convergence can have a beneficial impact on thermoelectric performance, but finding the right band-converged compositions is still time-consuming. We propose a method for designing a series of compositions with simultaneous band convergence in the high-entropy Yb x Ca 1− x Mg y Zn 2− y Sb 2 material by zeroing the weighted sum of crystal-field splitting energies of the parent compounds. We found that so-designed compositions have both larger power factors and lower thermal conductivities and that one of these compositions exhibits a large thermoelectric figure of merit value in comparison with to other p-type Zintls. Our material shows high stability both thermally and temporally. We then assembled an all-Zintl single-stage module, nontoxic and free of tellurium, that demonstrates an exceptional heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency exceeding 10% at a temperature difference of 475 kelvin.},

  abstract     = {Gasdermins are proteins that mediate immune defense by triggering a type of cell death called pyroptosis. Gasdermins are usually activated by proteolytic cleavage that releases the active, membrane-perforating part of the protein. Li et al . have found two ancient types of gasdermins that work differently. One, from a basal metazoan, is switched on upon disruption of the chemical bonds linking an autoinhibited dimer. The other is from a fungus and is activated by pairing between incompatible strains to form membrane pores to kill mistakenly fused cells. These discoveries show that gasdermins can be activated in more ways than previously thought, suggesting versatile functions in nature. —Di Jiang Gasdermins (GSDMs) are pore-forming proteins that execute pyroptosis for immune defense. GSDMs are two-domain proteins activated by proteolytic removal of the inhibitory domain. In this work, we report two types of cleavage-independent GSDM activation. First, Tricho GSDM, a pore-forming domain–only protein from the basal metazoan Trichoplax adhaerens , is a disulfides-linked autoinhibited dimer activated by reduction of the disulfides. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure illustrates the assembly mechanism for the 44-mer Tricho GSDM pore. Second, RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2, encoded by the polymorphic regulator of cell death–1 ( rcd-1 ) gene in filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa , are also pore-forming domain–only GSDMs. RCD-1-1 and RCD-1-2, when encountering each other, form pores and cause pyroptosis, underlying allorecognition in Neurospora . The cryo-EM structure reveals a pore of 11 RCD-1-1/RCD-1-2 heterodimers and a heterodimerization-triggered pore assembly mechanism. This study shows mechanistic diversities in GSDM activation and indicates versatile functions of GSDMs.},

  abstract     = {CRISPR RNA–guided nucleases and cellular DNA repair mechanisms have enabled programmable manipulations of the human genome, with life-saving implications. Although CRISPR-based DNA editing has become increasingly sophisticated, RNA editing using similar methods has not been reported. Nemudraia et al . found that CRISPR-guided cleavage of RNA is repaired by a cellular RNA ligase called RtcB. The authors leveraged this cut-and-repair mechanism to excise a disease-causing nonsense mutation common in people with cystic fibrosis. The work reveals opportunities for making programmable changes to the human transcriptome without introducing permanent and heritable changes to the genome. —Di Jiang Genome editing with CRISPR RNA-guided endonucleases generates DNA breaks that are resolved by cellular DNA repair machinery. However, analogous methods to manipulate RNA remain unavailable. We show that site-specific RNA breaks generated with type-III CRISPR complexes are repaired in human cells and that this repair can be used for programmable deletions in human transcripts to restore gene function. Collectively, this work establishes a technology for precise RNA manipulation with potential therapeutic applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was invented more than 50 years ago and has continued to improve in resolution and image quality. These improvements are the result of ever more powerful magnets, which make for very heavy and noisy machines that require extensive shielding. These high-power MRI machines are also extremely expensive, which greatly limits patient access. By applying machine learning to the output of a lower-power MRI device, Zhao et al . were able to address these concerns (see the Perspective by Anazodo and du Plessis). The lower-power machine was much cheaper to manufacture and operate, more comfortable and less noisy for patients, and the final images after computational processing were as clear and detailed as those obtained by the high-power devices currently used in the clinical setting. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Despite a half-century of advancements, global magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accessibility remains limited and uneven, hindering its full potential in health care. Initially, MRI development focused on low fields around 0.05 Tesla, but progress halted after the introduction of the 1.5 Tesla whole-body superconducting scanner in 1983. Using a permanent 0.05 Tesla magnet and deep learning for electromagnetic interference elimination, we developed a whole-body scanner that operates using a standard wall power outlet and without radiofrequency and magnetic shielding. We demonstrated its wide-ranging applicability for imaging various anatomical structures. Furthermore, we developed three-dimensional deep learning reconstruction to boost image quality by harnessing extensive high-field MRI data. These advances pave the way for affordable deep learning–powered ultra-low-field MRI scanners, addressing unmet clinical needs in diverse health care settings worldwide.},

  abstract     = {Although seemingly simple, the Hubbard model, which describes a many-body interacting system on a lattice, is difficult to investigate numerically. This has made it challenging to understand whether the model can capture the phenomenology of real materials such as high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Xu et al . made progress in answering this question by using two complementary methods to study the Hubbard model with nonzero next-nearest neighbor hopping. The researchers found that the model supports superconductivity for doping with both electrons and holes and that the ground-state pairing order parameter displays dome-like structures as a function of doping. These findings bear resemblance to the cuprate phase diagram. —Jelena Stajic The Hubbard model is an iconic model in quantum many-body physics and has been intensely studied, especially since the discovery of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Combining the complementary capabilities of two computational methods, we found superconductivity in both the electron- and hole-doped regimes of the two-dimensional Hubbard model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. In the electron-doped regime, superconductivity was weaker and was accompanied by antiferromagnetic Néel correlations at low doping. The strong superconductivity on the hole-doped side coexisted with stripe order, which persisted into the overdoped region with weaker hole-density modulation. These stripe orders varied in fillings between 0.6 and 0.8. Our results suggest the applicability of the Hubbard model with next-nearest hopping for describing cuprate high–transition temperature ( T c ) superconductivity.},

Using topological quantum chemistry, we calculated the band representations, compatibility relations, and band topologies of each isolated set of phonon bands for the materials in the phonon databases. Additionally, we calculated the real-space invariants for all the topologically trivial bands and classified them as atomic or obstructed atomic bands.

In addition, where and how water flows and collects to form malaria vector mosquito breeding sites would be valuable input for refining future malaria transmission scenarios. Smith et al . have collated an ensemble of hydrological and climate models to estimate future distributions of mosquito breeding sites. Projections are discussed in the context of the breeding ecology of different malaria-transmitting mosquito species. The ensemble indicates a future contraction of the areas where malaria is transmitted. What remains is a patchwork of concentrated and intense risk, especially at higher altitudes and populated riverine locations such as along the Nile. —Caroline Ash Changes in climate shift the geographic locations that are suitable for malaria transmission because of the thermal constraints on vector Anopheles mosquitos and Plasmodium spp. malaria parasites and the lack of availability of surface water for vector breeding. Previous Africa-wide assessments have tended to solely represent surface water using precipitation, ignoring many important hydrological processes. Here, we applied a validated and weighted ensemble of global hydrological and climate models to estimate present and future areas of hydroclimatic suitability for malaria transmission. With explicit surface water representation, we predict a net decrease in areas suitable for malaria transmission from 2025 onward, greater sensitivity to future greenhouse gas emissions, and different, more complex, malaria transmission patterns. Areas of malaria transmission that are projected to change are smaller than those estimated by precipitation-based estimates but are associated with greater changes in transmission season lengths.},

Lynch-Stieglitz et al . examined how this nutrient stream changed over the Younger Dryas climate reversal from glacial to warmer conditions, finding that Gulf Stream nutrient content decreased during that period. The future of the North Atlantic could thus be one of lower biological productivity if the past is a good analog. —H.

In this work, we examine how the nutrient stream changed over the Younger Dryas climate reversal that marked the transition out of the last ice age. Gulf Stream nutrient content decreased, and oxygen content increased at the Florida Straits during this time of weakened AMOC.

Rectifying patterns observed across these scales has long been a goal of evolutionary biology. Holstad et al . used a large database of fossil and extant species to test several hypotheses and concluded that evolvability (as measured by genetic variation within a population) shapes divergence due to the ability, or inability, of populations to track environmental fluctuations (see the Perspective by Uyeda and McGlothlin). —Sacha Vignieri Heritable variation is a prerequisite for evolutionary change, but the relevance of genetic constraints on macroevolutionary timescales is debated. By using two datasets on fossil and contemporary taxa, we show that evolutionary divergence among populations, and to a lesser extent among species, increases with microevolutionary evolvability. We evaluate and reject several hypotheses to explain this relationship and propose that an effect of evolvability on population and species divergence can be explained by the influence of genetic constraints on the ability of populations to track rapid, stationary environmental fluctuations.},

Chen et al . present a photoelectrochemical method to introduce CF3 groups to arenes and heteroarenes using relatively inexpensive trifluoroacetate. Because the acetate requires highly oxidizing potentials to release CF3, competing oxidation of the arenes would ordinarily complicate the reaction. In this case, however, adsorption of the acetate on the electrode forms a shielding layer that keeps the aryl coupling partners from undergoing electron transfer. —Jake S. Yeston Electrochemistry offers a sustainable synthesis route to value-added fine chemicals but is often constrained by competing electron transfer between the electrode and redox-sensitive functionalities distinct from the target site. Here, we describe an ion-shielding heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis strategy to impose mass-transfer limitations that invert the thermodynamically determined order of electron transfer. This strategy is showcased to enable decarboxylative trifluoromethylation of sensitive (hetero)arenes by using trifluoroacetate, an inexpensive yet relatively inert trifluoromethyl group (CF 3 ) source. An ion-shielding layer, formed by trifluoroacetate anions electrostatically adsorbed on a positive molybdenum-doped tungsten trioxide (WO 3 ) photoanode, prevents undesired electron transfer between substrates and photogenerated holes. The practicality of the developed method was demonstrated with robust photoanode stability (approximately 380 hours), a good substrate scope, and scaling capability to achieve 100-gram synthesis by using photoelectrochemical flow cells.},

  abstract     = {Electrolytic water splitting to generate hydrogen is most commonly carried out under basic conditions. Major research efforts are being directed toward switching to the more efficient acidic conditions in a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) apparatus, but catalyst stability and expense remain serious obstacles. Li et al . report a means of oxidizing iridium catalysts to the +6 oxidation state using manganese oxide as the oxidant. The resultant iridium(VI) oxide proved highly active and stable over several months of continuous PEM testing, consistent with prior modeling predictions. —Jake S. Yeston Hexavalent iridium (Ir VI ) oxide is predicted to be more active and stable than any other iridium oxide for the oxygen evolution reaction in acid; however, its experimental realization remains challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis, characterization, and application of atomically dispersed Ir VI oxide (Ir VI - ado ) for proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. The Ir VI - ado was synthesized by oxidatively substituting the ligands of potassium hexachloroiridate(IV) (K 2 IrCl 6 ) with manganese oxide (MnO 2 ). The mass-specific activity (1.7 × 10 5 amperes per gram of iridium) and turnover number (1.5 × 10 8 ) exceeded those of benchmark iridium oxides, and in situ x-ray analysis during PEM operations manifested the durability of Ir VI at current densities up to 2.3 amperes per square centimeter. The high activity and stability of Ir VI - ado showcase its promise as an anode material for PEM electrolysis.},

  abstract     = {More effective and natural tactile sensors could improve the performance of prosthetic and robotic artificial systems. Chen et al . developed a neuromorphic tactile artificial skin able to achieve fast, precise object discrimination during different grasping tasks (see the Perspective by Micera). By exploiting a spike timing–based approach to process tactile information, they were able to improve the performance of conventional electronic skin during object classification experiments. Moreover, the artificial sensor allowed coding of tactile information with millisecond resolution, similar to the performance of the nervous system. The biomimetic device developed here could be used for improving the performance of prosthetic and other robotic systems. —Mattia Maroso Rapid processing of tactile information is essential to human haptic exploration and dexterous object manipulation. Conventional electronic skins generate frames of tactile signals upon interaction with objects. Unfortunately, they are generally ill-suited for efficient coding of temporal information and rapid feature extraction. In this work, we report a neuromorphic tactile system that uses spike timing, especially the first-spike timing, to code dynamic tactile information about touch and grasp. This strategy enables the system to seamlessly code highly dynamic information with millisecond temporal resolution on par with the biological nervous system, yielding dynamic extraction of tactile features. Upon interaction with objects, the system rapidly classifies them in the initial phase of touch and grasp, thus paving the way to fast tactile feedback desired for neuro-robotics and neuro-prosthetics.},

  abstract     = {The mechanisms mediating the development and integration of the sensory systems have not been fully elucidated. Cai et al . studied the development of olfaction, which is considered the earliest sense to appear in mice, in relation to somatosensation, which appears shortly after. The authors showed that during an early postnatal period, before the development of other senses, olfactory stimuli induced excitation propagating over a large cortical area, including the somatosensory cortex (S1). This olfactory-mediated excitation strengthened whisker-evoked activity in S1 in neonates and was lost later in postnatal development. Olfactory deprivation during early development impaired somatosensation later in life, suggesting the existence of a developmental window in which olfaction affects the development of somatosensory processing. —Mattia Maroso Nasal chemosensation is considered the evolutionarily oldest mammalian sense and, together with somatosensation, is crucial for neonatal well-being before auditory and visual pathways start engaging the brain. Using anatomical and functional approaches in mice, we reveal that odor-driven activity propagates to a large part of the cortex during the first postnatal week and enhances whisker-evoked activation of primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1). This effect disappears in adult animals, in line with the loss of excitatory connectivity from olfactory cortex to wS1. By performing neonatal odor deprivation, followed by electrophysiological and behavioral work in adult animals, we identify a key transient regulation of nasal chemosensory information necessary for the development of wS1 sensory-driven dynamics and somatosensation. Our work uncovers a cross-modal critical window for nasal chemosensation–dependent somatosensory functional maturation.},

  abstract     = {The quantum anomalous Hall effect has been observed in several materials, including those with a two-dimensional moiré structure. Han et al . observed this effect in a simpler two-dimensional material without a moiré potential: a five-layer rhombohedral graphene. The graphene was placed under a layer of tungsten disulfide, which induced spin-orbital coupling and was encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. The Hall resistance of the sample was fully quantized at zero magnetic field at a value corresponding to a high Chern number of 5. —Jelena Stajic The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a robust topological phenomenon that features quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. We report the QAHE in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) heterostructure. Distinct from other experimentally confirmed QAHE systems, this system has neither magnetic element nor moiré superlattice effect. The QAH states emerge at charge neutrality and feature Chern numbers C = ±5 at temperatures of up to about 1.5 kelvin. This large QAHE arises from the synergy of the electron correlation in intrinsic flat bands of pentalayer graphene, the gate-tuning effect, and the proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of crystalline two-dimensional materials for intertwined electron correlation and band topology physics and may enable a route for engineering chiral Majorana edge states.},

  abstract     = {Dengue, a mosquito-borne flavivirus disease, now affects nearly half of the world’s population. Although serious sequelae are generally rare, there are no specific drugs or vaccines for this disease, and the associated morbidity has a serious economic impact. El Niño climate events influence the dynamics of Dengue transmission globallybecause of their effects on mosquito breeding. However, there are gaps in our understanding about long-distance climate drivers of Dengue outbreaks. Chen et al . modeled associations between sea surface temperature anomalies and Dengue outbreaks and identified a climate index covering the Indian Ocean basin that predicts the magnitude and timing of local and remote outbreaks. This will allow for more effective planning of Dengue outbreak responses. —Caroline Ash Despite identifying El Niño events as a factor in dengue dynamics, predicting the oscillation of global dengue epidemics remains challenging. Here, we investigate climate indicators and worldwide dengue incidence from 1990 to 2019 using climate-driven mechanistic models. We identify a distinct indicator, the Indian Ocean basin-wide (IOBW) index, as representing the regional average of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. IOBW is closely associated with dengue epidemics for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The ability of IOBW to predict dengue incidence likely arises as a result of its effect on local temperature anomalies through teleconnections. These findings indicate that the IOBW index can potentially enhance the lead time for dengue forecasts, leading to better-planned and more impactful outbreak responses.},

Research on topological materials has focused mainly on electronic systems ( 1 , 2 ). But solids host numerous collective excitations, including phonons, which are vibrations that pass from atom to atom in a lattice. The intersection of topology and phonons has opened a new field of topological phononics. A better understanding of topological phonons could drive advances in thermoelectric devices and superconductivity. However, a survey of materials that support topological phonons has been lacking. On page 638 of this issue, Xu et al. ( 3 ) report on more than 10,000 topological phononic material candidates. Using high-throughput computation, topological quantum chemistry, and key empirical evidence (sometimes called “chemical intuition”), their study provides an extensive topological classification of phonon bands (vibrational spectra) for each material, which should accelerate materials by design.},

  abstract     = {Genetic variation is essential for evolutionary change. Over a few generations, variation within populations can be used to predict how traits evolve under natural selection. However, how such microevolution translates into macroevolution, or change over many thousands or millions of years, is less clear. On page 688 of this issue, Holstad et al. ( 1 ) report analyses of a massive database of traits from both natural populations and the fossil record, revealing that within-population variation predicts how traits evolve across population and species boundaries. They test several competing hypotheses that may explain this relationship and come to the surprising conclusion that the tendency of natural selection to shift in its direction and intensity may explain why genetic variation leaves such a long-lasting stamp.},

A “Task Force on Sustainability-Linked Sovereign Financing for Nature and Climate” will convene to establish a framework to ameliorate these crises by reforming debt-for-nature swaps—voluntary transactions in which creditors reduce or cancel debt in exchange for debtor-country commitments to fund specific environmental activities. We identify four reforms that should underpin the new framework: (i) Offer debt relief at a nationally consequential scale; (ii) defer to debtors on implementation to reduce transaction costs and raise debtors’ benefits; (iii) employ performancelinked instruments based on reliable metrics to ensure global gains; and (iv) integrate all of those metrics across biodiversity conservation, emissions reduction, and climate adaptation to allocate funds most efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Jupiter’s moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System because of the tidal heating of its interior. It is unclear how long that activity has persisted because volcanic flows have covered Io’s surface, obliterating most records of its history. de Kleer et al . observed Io using millimeter spectroscopy to detect sulfur- and chlorine-bearing molecules in its tenuous atmosphere. They found that both elements were enriched in heavy isotopes due to the loss of lighter isotopes from the upper atmosphere. Modeling showed that the moon has lost more than 94% of the sulfur that can reach the surface, requiring about the current level of volcanic activity for the entire age of the Solar System. —Keith T. Smith Jupiter’s moon Io hosts extensive volcanism, driven by tidal heating. The isotopic composition of Io’s inventory of volatile chemical elements, including sulfur and chlorine, reflects its outgassing and mass-loss history and thus records information about its evolution. We used submillimeter observations of Io’s atmosphere to measure sulfur isotopes in gaseous sulfur dioxide and sulfur monoxide, and chlorine isotopes in gaseous sodium chloride and potassium chloride. We find 34 S/ 32 S = 0.0595 ± 0.0038 (equivalent to δ 34 S = +347 ± 86‰), which is highly enriched compared to average Solar System values and indicates that Io has lost 94 to 99% of its available sulfur. Our measurement of 37 Cl/ 35 Cl = 0.403 ± 0.028 (δ 37 Cl = +263 ± 88‰) shows that chlorine is similarly enriched. These results indicate that Io has been volcanically active for most (or all) of its history, with potentially higher outgassing and mass-loss rates at earlier times.},

Ma et al . examined tumor-infiltrating B cells across 21 different cancer types from more than 270 patients (see the Perspective by Tellier and Nutt). The authors compiled single-cell transcriptome, B cell receptor repertoire, and chromatin accessibility data and report that tumor-associated B cells differentiated into antibody-secreting cells by either an extrafollicular pathway or by a more canonical germinal center pathway. Tumors associated with the extrafollicular B cell profile demonstrated poor clinical prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy compared with tumors harboring germinal center B cells. Alterations in the availability of glutamine-derived metabolites, which are known to influence T cell–dependent immunosuppression, may be linked to a dysfunctional humoral response and the adverse effect of extrafollicular B cells on tumors. —Priscilla N. Kelly B lymphocytes are essential mediators of humoral immunity and play multiple roles in human cancer. To decode the functions of tumor-infiltrating B cells, we generated a B cell blueprint encompassing single-cell transcriptome, B cell–receptor repertoire, and chromatin accessibility data across 20 different cancer types (477 samples, 269 patients). B cells harbored extraordinary heterogeneity and comprised 15 subsets, which could be grouped into two independent developmental paths (extrafollicular versus germinal center). Tumor types grouped into the extrafollicular pathway were linked with worse clinical outcomes and resistance to immunotherapy. The dysfunctional extrafollicular program was associated with glutamine-derived metabolites through epigenetic-metabolic cross-talk, which promoted a T cell–driven immunosuppressive program. These data suggest an intratumor B cell balance between extrafollicular and germinal-center responses and suggest that humoral immunity could possibly be harnessed for B cell–targeting immunotherapy.},

One of the most vulnerable points in the parasite’s life cycle is when it makes the developmental commitment to sexual reproduction. Dogga et al . have built a rich atlas of short- and long-read single-cell transcriptomes of over 37,000 Plasmodium falciparum cells across intraerythrocytic asexual and sexual development (see the Perspective by Carlton and Cunnington). Parasites obtained from an individual infected with multiple strains of P. falciparum were compared with the atlas data. Considerable heterogeneity in gene expression was seen among strains of parasite from the “wild” donor strains compared with the laboratory-cultured strains and, unlike in laboratory culture, unexpected stages in male and female parasite development were observed. —Caroline Ash The developmental decision made by malaria parasites to become sexual underlies all malaria transmission. Here, we describe a rich atlas of short- and long-read single-cell transcriptomes of over 37,000 Plasmodium falciparum cells across intraerythrocytic asexual and sexual development. We used the atlas to explore transcriptional modules and exon usage along sexual development and expanded it to include malaria parasites collected from four Malian individuals naturally infected with multiple P. falciparum strains. We investigated genotypic and transcriptional heterogeneity within and among these wild strains at the single-cell level, finding differential expression between different strains even within the same host.

  abstract     = {Exploiting features of social networks (e.g., identifying “gossips”) has effectively diffused knowledge across populations. However, selecting ideal frontline individuals to receive information (influencers that serve as “seeds” to boost message diffusion) previously required mapping the entire social network, which is an expensive, time-consuming, and often impracticable task. Is it possible to identify the best seeds without having full maps of all individuals in networks? Field experiments by Airoldi and Christakis explored this question in a very challenging context: extremely poor, isolated Honduran villages. By expanding the “friendship paradox” strategy, in which friends nominate optimal friends as seeds, their algorithm efficiently distributed seeds throughout social networks without full network maps. This scalable strategy was more effective than random targeting, carrying far-reaching policy implications for enhancing low- and middle-income country welfare. —Ekeoma Uzogara Certain people occupy topological positions within social networks that enhance their effectiveness at inducing spillovers. We mapped face-to-face networks among 24,702 people in 176 isolated villages in Honduras and randomly assigned villages to targeting methods, varying the fraction of households receiving a 22-month health education package and the method by which households were chosen (randomly versus using the friendship-nomination algorithm). We assessed 117 diverse knowledge, attitude, and practice outcomes. Friendship-nomination targeting reduced the number of households needed to attain specified levels of village-wide uptake. Knowledge spread more readily than behavior, and spillovers extended to two degrees of separation. Outcomes that were intrinsically easier to adopt also manifested greater spillovers. Network targeting using friendship nomination effectively promotes population-wide improvements in welfare through social contagion.},

  abstract     = {Loss of proper control of the cell cycle is a central characteristic of cancer cells and can lead to genome doubling and aneuploidy. McKenney et al . explored the effects of ribotoxic stress (interference with translation with the antibiotic anisomicin) and other stresses on cell cycle control in mammalian cells in culture (see the Perspective by Westendorp). In stressed cells, stress-activated protein kinases led to the inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1, CDK4, and CDK6, thus allowing some cells to restart DNA replication without entering mitosis and to become polyploid. This role of CDK4/6 in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle was not previously known. The findings offer insight into control over the anaphase-promoting complex in G 2 and offer an avenue to further understand and manipulate genome instability in cancer. —L. Bryan Ray Cell cycle events are coordinated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to ensure robust cell division. CDK4/6 and CDK2 regulate the growth 1 (G 1 ) to synthesis (S) phase transition of the cell cycle by responding to mitogen signaling, promoting E2F transcription and inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex. We found that this mechanism was still required in G 2 -arrested cells to prevent cell cycle exit after the S phase. This mechanism revealed a role for CDK4/6 in maintaining the G 2 state, challenging the notion that the cell cycle is irreversible and that cells do not require mitogens after passing the restriction point. Exit from G 2 occurred during ribotoxic stress and was actively mediated by stress-activated protein kinases. Upon relief of stress, a significant fraction of cells underwent a second round of DNA replication that led to whole-genome doubling.},

  abstract     = {Meningomyelocele is a severe type of spina bifida, and it is also the most common type. Although its incidence has decreased in recent decades after many countries introduced folate supplementation into staple foods, meningomyelocele remains a challenge in many parts of the world. Moreover, dietary fortification with folate is not always effective, and some medications and medical conditions can also affect disease risk, as can genetic predisposition. To study meningomyelocele genetics, Vong et al . established the large, multinational Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium. Based on data from this consortium, the authors identified chromosomal 22q11.2 deletions that greatly increase the risk of meningomyelocele and then showed how the loss of a specific gene on this chromosome can alter neural tube development. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Meningomyelocele is one of the most severe forms of neural tube defects (NTDs) and the most frequent structural birth defect of the central nervous system. We assembled the Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium to identify causes. Exome and genome sequencing of 715 parent-offspring trios identified six patients with chromosomal 22q11.2 deletions, suggesting a 23-fold increased risk compared with the general population. Furthermore, analysis of a separate 22q11.2 deletion cohort suggested a 12- to 15-fold increased NTD risk of meningomyelocele. The loss of Crkl , one of several neural tube–expressed genes within the minimal deletion interval, was sufficient to replicate NTDs in mice, where both penetrance and expressivity were exacerbated by maternal folate deficiency. Thus, the common 22q11.2 deletion confers substantial meningomyelocele risk, which is partially alleviated by folate supplementation.},

These exotic states are topologically robust and are of interest in condensed matter physics and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Wang et al . report on the optical simulation of fractional quantum Hall physics using a lattice of superconducting qubits. Using a four-by-four array of superconducting qubits, the authors demonstrate the formation of strongly correlated photonic states displaying topological features of the electronic counterpart. The engineered, bottom-up approach provides a scalable platform for achieving topological quantum computing and for studying topological quantum physics more generally. —Ian S. Osbourne Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are known for their robust topological order and possess properties that are appealing for applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. An engineered quantum platform would provide opportunities to operate FQH states without an external magnetic field and enhance local and coherent manipulation of these exotic states. We demonstrate a lattice version of photon FQH states using a programmable on-chip platform based on photon blockade and engineering gauge fields on a two-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics system. We observe the effective photon Lorentz force and butterfly spectrum in the artificial gauge field, a prerequisite for FQH states. After adiabatic assembly of Laughlin FQH wave function of 1/2 filling factor from localized photons, we observe strong density correlation and chiral topological flow among the FQH photons. We then verify the unique features of FQH states in response to external fields, including the incompressibility of generating quasiparticles and the smoking-gun signature of fractional quantum Hall conductivity. Our work illustrates a route to the creation and manipulation of novel strongly correlated topological quantum matter composed of photons and opens up possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum information devices.},

  abstract     = {Neurons in the brain acquire left or right identity during development. However, the mechanisms responsible for determining this asymmetry remain to be fully elucidated. Powell et al . studied brain development in zebrafish and discovered that the transmembrane protein Cachd1 is required for neurons in the habenula to acquire left-right asymmetric character. Cachd1 loss of function resulted in increased probability for habenular neurons to acquire left identity. Mechanistically, Cachd1 exerts this function by binding the Wnt co-receptors Frizzled and Lrp6. Cachd1-dependent modulation of Wnt signaling in the brain represents a previously unappreciated mechanism necessary for determining brain asymmetry in zebrafish. —Mattia Maroso Neurons on the left and right sides of the nervous system often show asymmetric properties, but how such differences arise is poorly understood. Genetic screening in zebrafish revealed that loss of function of the transmembrane protein Cachd1 resulted in right-sided habenula neurons adopting left-sided identity. Cachd1 is expressed in neuronal progenitors, functions downstream of asymmetric environmental signals, and influences timing of the normally asymmetric patterns of neurogenesis. Biochemical and structural analyses demonstrated that Cachd1 can bind simultaneously to Lrp6 and Frizzled family Wnt co-receptors. Consistent with this, lrp6 mutant zebrafish lose asymmetry in the habenulae, and epistasis experiments support a role for Cachd1 in modulating Wnt pathway activity in the brain. These studies identify Cachd1 as a conserved Wnt receptor–interacting protein that regulates lateralized neuronal identity in the zebrafish brain.},

  abstract     = {Mice lacking the circadian clock component Bmal1 show not only disrupted rhythms but also premature aging and muscle wasting. To explore the specific roles of the central brain clock and the peripheral clock in muscle, Kumar et al . restored clock function by targeted expression of Bmal1 in the brain, skeletal muscle, or both. Restoration of both clocks was needed to substantially inhibit premature aging and muscle dysfunction. The muscle clock alone did not restore rhythmicity but acted to filter signals from the brain clock to achieve proper muscle function. Time-restricted feeding, a behavioral timing cue, could partially substitute for loss of the central clock. Such insights should enhance our understanding of the roles of circadian disruption in aging and provide potential strategies to protect muscle function in aging individuals. —L. Bryan Ray A molecular clock network is crucial for daily physiology and maintaining organismal health. We examined the interactions and importance of intratissue clock networks in muscle tissue maintenance. In arrhythmic mice showing premature aging, we created a basic clock module involving a central and a peripheral (muscle) clock. Reconstituting the brain-muscle clock network is sufficient to preserve fundamental daily homeostatic functions and prevent premature muscle aging. However, achieving whole muscle physiology requires contributions from other peripheral clocks. Mechanistically, the muscle peripheral clock acts as a gatekeeper, selectively suppressing detrimental signals from the central clock while integrating important muscle homeostatic functions. Our research reveals the interplay between the central and peripheral clocks in daily muscle function and underscores the impact of eating patterns on these interactions.},

  abstract     = {With their high water content, hydrogels readily interface with biological tissues and also show good ionic conductivity, which makes it possible to use them as biological sensors. However, they typically have poor electronic conductivity, making it difficult to extract electrical signals. Although doping with carbon or metals can help, this detrimentally affects the other hydrogel properties. Li et al . synthesized a hydrogel using a conducting polymer with a cationic backbone and added disodium 1,3-benzenedisulfonate, a noncovalent cross linker, which formed a polymer that will swell but remain stable in water (see the Perspective by Gao and Fabiano). The authors fabricated organic electrochemical transistors and organic field-effect transistors using the semiconducting hydrogel and demonstrated their ability to record electroencephalograms. —Marc S. Lavine Hydrogels are an attractive category of biointerfacing materials with adjustable mechanical properties, diverse biochemical functions, and good ionic conductivity. Despite these advantages, their application in electronics has been restricted because of their lack of semiconducting properties, and they have traditionally only served as insulators or conductors. We developed single- and multiple-network hydrogels based on a water-soluble n-type semiconducting polymer, endowing conventional hydrogels with semiconducting capabilities. These hydrogels show good electron mobilities and high on/off ratios, enabling the fabrication of complementary logic circuits and signal amplifiers with low power consumption and high gains. We demonstrate that hydrogel electronics with good bioadhesive and biocompatible interface can sense and amplify electrophysiological signals with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios.},

Luo et al . engineered such a system using cold rubidium atoms that reside in a vertical standing-wave cavity. Shining laser light into the cavity resulted in an interaction in which pairs of atoms exchanged their momenta. This enabled the realization of a model of quantum magnetism, as well as a collective atomic recoil phenomenon akin to the Mössbauer effect. —Jelena Stajic Large ensembles of laser-cooled atoms interacting through infinite-range photon-mediated interactions are powerful platforms for quantum simulation and sensing. Here we realize momentum-exchange interactions in which pairs of atoms exchange their momentum states by collective emission and absorption of photons from a common cavity mode, a process equivalent to a spin-exchange or XX collective Heisenberg interaction. The momentum-exchange interaction leads to an observed all-to-all Ising-like interaction in a matter-wave interferometer. A many-body energy gap also emerges, effectively binding interferometer matter-wave packets together to suppress Doppler dephasing in analogy to Mössbauer spectroscopy. The tunable momentum-exchange interaction expands the capabilities of quantum interaction–enhanced matter-wave interferometry and may enable the realization of exotic behaviors, including simulations of superconductors and dynamical gauge fields.},

Increasing these interactions could be accomplished by bringing the atoms close together. Du et al . addressed this challenge by creating a bilayer system of dipolar dysprosium atoms with the layers separated by a distance of about 50 nanometers. This setup enabled the researchers to create oscillations in one layer by acting on the other in an experiment related to Coulomb drag measurements in solid-state systems. —Jelena Stajic Controlling ultracold atoms with laser light has greatly advanced quantum science. The wavelength of light sets a typical length scale for most experiments to the order of 500 nanometers (nm) or greater. In this work, we implemented a super-resolution technique that localizes and arranges atoms on a sub–50-nm scale, without any fundamental limit in resolution. We demonstrate this technique by creating a bilayer of dysprosium atoms and observing dipolar interactions between two physically separated layers through interlayer sympathetic cooling and coupled collective excitations. At 50-nm distance, dipolar interactions are 1000 times stronger than at 500 nm. For two atoms in optical tweezers, this should enable purely magnetic dipolar gates with kilohertz speed.},

Although other phases of α-Mo 2 C have been used for this reverse water gas shift reaction, Ahmadi Khoshooei et al . describe a scalable synthesis of phase-pure α-Mo 2 C that is both highly active and highly stable. It maintains its activity for more than 500 hours under the high-temperature and high-throughput reaction conditions needed to make this endothermic reaction industrially scalable. The authors attribute the high activity in part to weak CO interactions with the surface and the presence of interstitial oxygen atoms. —Phil Szuromi Although technologically promising, the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to produce carbon monoxide (CO) remains economically challenging owing to the lack of an inexpensive, active, highly selective, and stable catalyst. We show that nanocrystalline cubic molybdenum carbide (α-Mo 2 C), prepared through a facile and scalable route, offers 100% selectivity for CO 2 reduction to CO while maintaining its initial equilibrium conversion at high space velocity after more than 500 hours of exposure to harsh reaction conditions at 600°C. The combination of operando and postreaction characterization of the catalyst revealed that its high activity, selectivity, and stability are attributable to crystallographic phase purity, weak CO-Mo 2 C interactions, and interstitial oxygen atoms, respectively. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided evidence that the reaction proceeds through an H 2 -aided redox mechanism.},

Assumed droplet-size spectra may not be accurate, however, and could introduce errors into those calculations. Allwayin et al . report measurements made from aircraft showing that droplet size distributions are more narrow at small scales than assumed and are heterogeneous within the cloud, unlike whole-cloud averages. —H. Jesse Smith Marine stratocumulus clouds are the “global reflectors,” sharply contrasting with the underlying dark ocean surface and exerting a net cooling on Earth’s climate. The magnitude of this cooling remains uncertain in part owing to the averaged representation of microphysical processes, such as the droplet-to-drizzle transition in global climate models (GCMs). Current GCMs parameterize cloud droplet size distributions as broad, cloud-averaged gammas. Using digital holographic measurements of discrete stratocumulus cloud volumes, we found cloud droplet size distributions to be narrower at the centimeter scale, never resembling the cloud average. These local distributions tended to form pockets of similar-looking cloud regions, each characterized by a size distribution shape that is diluted to varying degrees. These observations open the way for new modeling representations of microphysical processes.},

Development of resistance to almost all antimalarial drugs by the parasite, resistance of the Anopheles mosquito (which transmits the parasite) to commonly used insecticides, and variable efficacy of the two malaria vaccines recommended by the World Health Organization ( 2 ) mean that basic and translational research are the cornerstones of a global response to the disease. Indeed, there is still much unknown about the biology of Plasmodium . On page 527 of this issue, Dogga et al . ( 3 ) report a reference atlas for single-cell transcriptomic data spanning the complete life cycle of P. falciparum . The study included natural infections of four asymptomatic children from Mali, revealing distinct behavior of such infections compared with that of two standard laboratory strains.},

Cells commit to the cell cycle in response to small peptide signals called mitogens, which ensure entry into S phase, when DNA is replicated. Once S phase is initiated, the cell cycle is normally self-sustaining and irreversible. However, under certain circumstances, two consecutive rounds of DNA replication without cell division (endoreplication) can occur, leading to whole-genome doubling. On page 525 of this issue, McKenney et al . ( 1 ) report that during a delayed G 2 phase, mitogenic signaling via cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) acts as a crucial reverse brake to prevent cells from slipping back into a G 1 state and restarting S phase. Given that mitogenic signaling pathways are frequently targeted by cancer therapies, this finding may have broad implications for cancer treatment.},

In a typical response, B cells specific for an antigen become activated and proliferate in a transient structure called a germinal center (GC), where their B cell receptor (BCR) undergoes rounds of mutation, and clones with BCRs that bind antigen more robustly are selected. Selected GC B cells then become either memory cells, poised to respond to future challenge, or differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. This process underpins both naturally acquired and vaccine-induced protection against infections. By contrast, the importance of B cells to the anticancer immune response has been largely overlooked and, where examined, has yielded contradictory findings ( 1 , 2 ). On page 524 of this issue, Ma et al.

  abstract     = {Telomeres, the sequences at chromosome ends, shorten as cells divide. To counteract this shortening, telomerase elongates telomeres in a highly regulated fashion. Too little elongation leads to cell senescence and age-related disease, and too much elongation predisposes to some cancers. Karimian et al . developed a new method to sequence telomeres, which they call Telomere Profiling, and found that telomeres are not all regulated at a uniform length as current models predict. Instead, each telomere has a distinct equilibrium length. This work indicates that there are as-yet undiscovered mechanisms for telomere length regulation. Investigating these mechanisms will inform new approaches to treating cancer and certain degenerative diseases. —Di Jiang Short telomeres cause age-related disease, and long telomeres contribute to cancer; however, the mechanisms regulating telomere length are unclear. We developed a nanopore-based method, which we call Telomere Profiling, to determine telomere length at nearly single-nucleotide resolution. Mapping telomere reads to chromosome ends showed chromosome end–specific length distributions that could differ by more than six kilobases. Examination of telomere lengths in 147 individuals revealed that certain chromosome ends were consistently longer or shorter. The same rank order was found in newborn cord blood, suggesting that telomere length is determined at birth and that chromosome end–specific telomere length differences are maintained as telomeres shorten with age. Telomere Profiling makes precision investigation of telomere length widely accessible for laboratory, clinical, and drug discovery efforts and will allow deeper insights into telomere biology.},

  abstract     = {Despite major advances in protein structure determination and prediction, it remains challenging to identify small-molecule ligands for most proteins. Offensperger et al . used a chemical proteomics approach to map protein-ligand interactions across the human proteome. With a library of around 400 ligand fragments attached to a photoactivatable cross-linker, the authors identified about 50,000 statistically significant interactions over about 2500 proteins, including a large fraction of targets for which there are no prior known ligands. They validated these results with biochemical experiments, identifying from their screen an E3 ligase binder and an inhibitor of a transmembrane transporter. This rich interaction dataset also provided the basis for developing a machine learning model to predict fragment properties and interaction profiles. The authors have made their work available as an online community resource. —Michael A. Funk Chemical modulation of proteins enables a mechanistic understanding of biology and represents the foundation of most therapeutics. However, despite decades of research, 80% of the human proteome lacks functional ligands. Chemical proteomics has advanced fragment-based ligand discovery toward cellular systems, but throughput limitations have stymied the scalable identification of fragment-protein interactions. We report proteome-wide maps of protein-binding propensity for 407 structurally diverse small-molecule fragments. We verified that identified interactions can be advanced to active chemical probes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, transporters, and kinases. Integrating machine learning binary classifiers further enabled interpretable predictions of fragment behavior in cells. The resulting resource of fragment-protein interactions and predictive models will help to elucidate principles of molecular recognition and expedite ligand discovery efforts for hitherto undrugged proteins.},

Using genomes from over 1000 species of Saccharomycotina yeasts and data on their performance growing in 24 different environments, the authors found that genes related to metabolic pathways had the clearest relationship to niche breadth. There was little support for the “ jack of all trades, master of none ” tradeoff across the subphylum. —Bianca Lopez Organisms exhibit extensive variation in ecological niche breadth, from very narrow (specialists) to very broad (generalists). Two general paradigms have been proposed to explain this variation: (i) trade-offs between performance efficiency and breadth and (ii) the joint influence of extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (genomic) factors. We assembled genomic, metabolic, and ecological data from nearly all known species of the ancient fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina (1154 yeast strains from 1051 species), grown in 24 different environmental conditions, to examine niche breadth evolution. We found that large differences in the breadth of carbon utilization traits between yeasts stem from intrinsic differences in genes encoding specific metabolic pathways, but we found limited evidence for trade-offs.

  abstract     = {Microtubules play diverse structural and dynamic roles in cell biology, comprising polymers of tubulin heterodimers each made of a single α- and β-tubulin subunit. Humans have nine types of α-tubulin and 10 types of β-tubulin, which can theoretically pair in any combination. Therefore, a cell has a dizzying choice of heterodimers with which to build microtubules. But are all tubulin heterodimers interchangeable? Rare disease genetics tells us no. Dodd et al . used next-generation sequencing of patients with ciliopathies to identify nonredundant functions for the β-tubulin TUBB4B in assembling centrioles and cilia. Distinct dominant-negative disease mechanisms in the same gene caused different clinical conditions ranging from blindness to lung disease. Spatial proteomics revealed that TUBB4B preferentially localizes to stable microtubules of cilia and centrioles, which may explain why these cellular structures are disrupted in patients. —Stella M. Hurtley Tubulin, one of the most abundant cytoskeletal building blocks, has numerous isotypes in metazoans encoded by different conserved genes. Whether these distinct isotypes form cell type– and context-specific microtubule structures is poorly understood. Based on a cohort of 12 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia as well as mouse mutants, we identified and characterized variants in the TUBB4B isotype that specifically perturbed centriole and cilium biogenesis. Distinct TUBB4B variants differentially affected microtubule dynamics and cilia formation in a dominant-negative manner. Structure-function studies revealed that different TUBB4B variants disrupted distinct tubulin interfaces, thereby enabling stratification of patients into three classes of ciliopathic diseases. These findings show that specific tubulin isotypes have distinct and nonredundant subcellular functions and establish a link between tubulinopathies and ciliopathies.},

  abstract     = {Human-produced noise has become a part of the world’s environment, and traffic noise in particular is incessant and present globally. Such noise has been shown to alter behavior in a variety of animals, including birds. In zebra finches, Meillère et al . show that such noise doesn’t just alter adult behavior; it also has direct impacts on growth and fitness when only embryos are exposed (see the Perspective by Slabbekoorn). Specifically, birds exposed to traffic sounds in the egg had impaired growth, shorter telomeres, and reduced production as adults. Such effects may be pervasive given the ever-present background drone of our traffic noise. —Sacha Vignieri Noise pollution is expanding at an unprecedented rate and is increasingly associated with impaired reproduction and development across taxa. However, whether noise sound waves are intrinsically harmful for developing young—or merely disturb parents—and the fitness consequences of early exposure remain unknown. Here, by only manipulating the offspring, we show that sole exposure to noise in early life in zebra finches has fitness consequences and causes embryonic death during exposure. Exposure to pre- and postnatal traffic noise cumulatively impaired nestling growth and physiology and aggravated telomere shortening across life stages until adulthood. Consistent with a long-term somatic impact, early life noise exposure, especially prenatally, decreased individual offspring production throughout adulthood. Our findings suggest that the effects of noise pollution are more pervasive than previously realized.},

  abstract     = {Lake Tanganyika contains one of the most impressive adaptive radiations, with about 250 species of cichlid occupying a variety of niches. Much research has focused on understanding the drivers of this and other adaptive radiations. Sommer-Trembo et al . looked in depth at 57 of these cichlid species with regard to their behavior, ecomorphology, and genomics. They found that one behavior in particular, a tendency to explore, was related to niche adaptation, and they identified a regulatory gene that is highly associated with this behavior. These findings suggest the existence of an adaptive syndrome driven in part by a tendency to explore what is new. —Sacha Vignieri Behavior is critical for animal survival and reproduction, and possibly for diversification and evolutionary radiation. However, the genetics behind adaptive variation in behavior are poorly understood. In this work, we examined a fundamental and widespread behavioral trait, exploratory behavior, in one of the largest adaptive radiations on Earth, the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika. By integrating quantitative behavioral data from 57 cichlid species (702 wild-caught individuals) with high-resolution ecomorphological and genomic information, we show that exploratory behavior is linked to macrohabitat niche adaptations in Tanganyikan cichlids. Furthermore, we uncovered a correlation between the genotypes at a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the AMPA glutamate-receptor regulatory gene cacng5b and variation in exploratory tendency. We validated this association using behavioral predictions with a neural network approach and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.},

  abstract     = {Electronic transport in a conductor can display properties similar to fluid flow if collisions between electrons dominate over collisions with impurities and lattice excitations in the sample. Signatures of this hydrodynamic regime have been identified in graphene, but stationary vortices, a prediction of the theory of hydrodynamic flow, have remained tricky to observe. Palm et al . uncovered these current whirlpools at room temperature in samples of graphene encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. The observation was enabled by the use of sensitive magnetometry based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, a noninvasive technique that does not require a cryogenic environment. —Jelena Stajic Electron–electron interactions in high-mobility conductors can give rise to transport signatures resembling those described by classical hydrodynamics. Using a nanoscale scanning magnetometer, we imaged a distinctive hydrodynamic transport pattern—stationary current vortices—in a monolayer graphene device at room temperature. By measuring devices with increasing characteristic size, we observed the disappearance of the current vortex and thus verified a prediction of the hydrodynamic model. We further observed that vortex flow is present for both hole- and electron-dominated transport regimes but disappears in the ambipolar regime. We attribute this effect to a reduction of the vorticity diffusion length near charge neutrality. Our work showcases the power of local imaging techniques for unveiling exotic mesoscopic transport phenomena.},

Pereira et al . forecasted changes in both biodiversity loss and ecosystem services to 2050 and compared them with changes from 1900 to 2015, combining results from 13 different models. Across three shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios, rates of biodiversity decline from land-use change are expected to be lower than in the 20th century but much higher when climate change is considered. Provisioning ecosystem services (i.e., materials) are expected to increase, but regulating services (e.g., pollination) decline under most scenarios. Outcomes depend on the scenario, suggesting that policies can make a difference. —Bianca Lopez Based on an extensive model intercomparison, we assessed trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services from historical reconstructions and future scenarios of land-use and climate change. During the 20th century, biodiversity declined globally by 2 to 11%, as estimated by a range of indicators. Provisioning ecosystem services increased several fold, and regulating services decreased moderately. Going forward, policies toward sustainability have the potential to slow biodiversity loss resulting from land-use change and the demand for provisioning services while reducing or reversing declines in regulating services. However, negative impacts on biodiversity due to climate change appear poised to increase, particularly in the higher-emissions scenarios. Our assessment identifies remaining modeling uncertainties but also robustly shows that renewed policy efforts are needed to meet the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity.},

  abstract     = {The current biodiversity crisis requires action to protect species from extinction and ecosystems from severe degradation. Billions of dollars are thus invested annually in global conservation. Assessing whether conservation initiatives result in positive outcomes for biodiversity is necessary to guide future efforts. Langhammer et al . performed a meta-analysis to determine whether conservation actions, including protected areas and management, provide better outcomes compared with no action. They found that more than half of the time, conservation actions had a net positive effect but did not necessarily stop biodiversity decline. This work shows that multiple types of conservation actions are usually beneficial and are needed to curb the loss of biodiversity. —Bianca Lopez Governments recently adopted new global targets to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity. It is therefore crucial to understand the outcomes of conservation actions. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 186 studies (including 665 trials) that measured biodiversity over time and compared outcomes under conservation action with a suitable counterfactual of no action. We find that in two-thirds of cases, conservation either improved the state of biodiversity or at least slowed declines. Specifically, we find that interventions targeted at species and ecosystems, such as invasive species control, habitat loss reduction and restoration, protected areas, and sustainable management, are highly effective and have large effect sizes. This provides the strongest evidence to date that conservation actions are successful but require transformational scaling up to meet global targets.},

  abstract     = {The Sandmeyer reaction is one of the oldest in organic chemistry, and, remarkably, it is still widely practiced in much the same way that it was reported in the 19 th century. The reaction appends a variety of substituents onto aryl rings by first generating highly reactive diazonium leaving groups. With this reactivity comes explosion risk, however. Mateos et al . report a safer variation that avoids diazonium accumulation. By steadily producing small quantities of these reactive intermediates just before displacement, the authors achieved the same outcome at much lower risk. —Jake S. Yeston Aryldiazonium salts remain a staple in organic synthesis and are still prepared largely in accord with the protocol developed in the 19th century. Because of the favorable reactivity that often cannot be achieved with other aryl(pseudo)halides, diazonium chemistry continues to grow. Facile extrusion of dinitrogen contributes to the desired reactivity but is also reason for safety concerns. Explosions have occurred since the discovery of these reagents and still result in accidents. In this study, we report a diazonium chemistry paradigm shift based on nitrate reduction using thiosulfate or dihalocuprates as electron donors that avoids diazonium accumulation. Because nitrate reduction is rate-limiting, aryldiazoniums are produced as fleeting intermediates, which results in a safer and often more efficient deaminative halogenation in a single step from anilines.},

Metabolism-regulatory pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)–expressing neurons in the hypothalamus are activated upon food-related cues and prime peripheral metabolism. Henschke et al . report that sensory food perception and POMC neuron activation rapidly promote mitochondrial fragmentation in the liver through activation of AKT kinase to phosphorylate the mitochondrial fission factor (MFF). A mutation that prevents phosphorylation of MFF abrogates AKT-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in response to insulin in vitro and refeeding in mice in vivo. This breakdown affects insulin’s ability to suppress hepatic glucose production. —Stella M. Hurtley Liver mitochondria play a central role in metabolic adaptations to changing nutritional states, yet their dynamic regulation upon anticipated changes in nutrient availability has remained unaddressed. Here, we found that sensory food perception rapidly induced mitochondrial fragmentation in the liver through protein kinase B/AKT (AKT)–dependent phosphorylation of serine 131 of the mitochondrial fission factor (MFFS131). This response was mediated by activation of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)–expressing neurons. A nonphosphorylatable MFF S131G knock-in mutation abrogated AKT-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in vitro. In vivo, MFF S131G knock-in mice displayed altered liver mitochondrial dynamics and impaired insulin-stimulated suppression of hepatic glucose production. Thus, rapid activation of a hypothalamus–liver axis can adapt mitochondrial function to anticipated changes of nutritional state in control of hepatic glucose metabolism.},

Giampazolias et al . report that vitamin D bioavailability in mice influences the composition of the gut microbiome (see the Perspective by Franco and McCoy). After dietary manipulation, vitamin D levels were observed to affect gut bacteria, which in turn improved cancer immunotherapy and antitumor immunity. In humans, low vitamin D levels were correlated with tumor development, and gene signatures of vitamin D activity were associated with improved patient responses to immunotherapy. These findings highlight the connection between vitamin D and the immune system through gut bacteria and may have applications for improving cancer therapies. —Priscilla N. Kelly A role for vitamin D in immune modulation and in cancer has been suggested. In this work, we report that mice with increased availability of vitamin D display greater immune-dependent resistance to transplantable cancers and augmented responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Similarly, in humans, vitamin D–induced genes correlate with improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment as well as with immunity to cancer and increased overall survival. In mice, resistance is attributable to the activity of vitamin D on intestinal epithelial cells, which alters microbiome composition in favor of Bacteroides fragilis , which positively regulates cancer immunity. Our findings indicate a previously unappreciated connection between vitamin D, microbial commensal communities, and immune responses to cancer.

They used this data to identify nearly 15 million combinations that lead to closed macrocycles and characterized the predictions experimentally. Using motif scaffolding based on peptide fragments, the authors generated macrocyclic binders to two enzymes. They also developed a protein-protein interaction inhibitor by virtual screening of the predicted macrocycles. —Michael A.

We describe a computational method for identifying ordered macrocycles composed of alpha, beta, gamma, and 17 other amino acid backbone chemistries, which we used to predict 14.9 million closed cycles composed of &gt;42,000 monomer combinations. We chemically synthesized 18 macrocycles predicted to adopt single low-energy states and determined their x-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance structures; 15 of these were very close to the design models. We illustrate the therapeutic potential of these macrocycle designs by developing selective inhibitors of three protein targets of current interest. By opening up a vast space of readily synthesizable drug-like macrocycles, our results should considerably enhance structure-based drug design.},

Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has been predicted to host topologically nontrivial states such as the Chern insulator. Sha et al . observed such a state in four-layer rhombohedral graphene encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride and placed next to a layer of tungsten diselenide. The role of this last layer was to induce spin-orbit coupling, which is normally negligible in graphene. Transport measurements indicated ferromagnetism and a quantization of Hall resistance stabilized by magnetic fields, corresponding to a Chern number of 4. —Jelena Stajic Degeneracies in multilayer graphene, including spin, valley, and layer degrees of freedom, can be lifted by Coulomb interactions, resulting in rich broken-symmetry states. Here, we report a ferromagnetic state in charge-neutral ABCA-tetralayer graphene driven by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from adjacent tungsten diselenide. The ferromagnetic state is identified as a Chern insulator with a Chern number of 4; its maximum Hall resistance reaches 78% quantization at zero magnetic field and is fully quantized at either 0.4 or –1.5 tesla. Three distinct broken-symmetry insulating states, layer-antiferromagnet, Chern insulator, and layer-polarized insulator, along with their transitions, can be continuously tuned by the vertical displacement field. In this system, the magnetic order of the Chern insulator can be switched by three knobs, including magnetic field, electrical doping, and vertical displacement field.},

  abstract     = {How tightly can a carbon-carbon triple bond be confined? With the right driving reactions, it has become straightforward to squeeze the motif into six-membered rings such as benzyne and then reap the benefit of the prompt reactivity promoted by the strain. However, five-membered rings have tended to be too tight a squeeze. Humke et al . now report that coordination by nickel can relieve the strain just enough to stabilize a triple bond in the pentagonal portion of azaindoles. These azaindolyne complexes were crystallographically characterized and reacted with both nucleophiles and electrophiles. —Jake S. Yeston N-Heteroaromatics are key elements of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. N-Heteroarynes provide a scaffold to build these essential molecules but are underused because five-membered N-heteroarynes have been largely inaccessible on account of the strain of a triple bond in that small of a ring. On the basis of principles of metal-ligand interactions that are foundational to organometallic chemistry, in this work we report the stabilization of five-membered N-heteroarynes in the nickel coordination sphere. A series of 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane nickel 7-azaindol-2,3-yne complexes were synthesized and characterized crystallographically and spectroscopically. Ambiphilic reactivity of the nickel 7-azaindol-2,3-yne complexes was observed with multiple nucleophilic, electrophilic, and enophilic coupling partners.},

The plan aims to end world hunger without breaching the relatively safe 1.5°C global temperature rise threshold (1). The livestock industry is food systems’ biggest climate culprit, accounting for more than half of food systems emissions (2) and at least 16.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (2, 3). FAO’s roadmap calls for intensification of livestock production—i.e., keeping more livestock in less space—to cut GHG emissions. However, this recommendation conflicts with the findings in past FAO reports (4, 5) and will not solve the problem of livestock emissions.},

Here, we highlight conceptual limitations of effort-sharing approaches applied to companies and argue that the fundamental assumption of using emission-reduction targets as the central and often sole metric for setting or benchmarking individual corporations’ climate action ambition is simply insufficient because future innovators are neglected. Although emissions targets can help curb emissions, we detail the risks of relying on individual corporation’s emissions targets to guide and track progress in aligning the economy with the Paris Agreement goals. Last, we clarify the distinct roles of companies as agents of innovation and of market regulators and supervisors as either definers or enforcers of market-wide objectives for sustainability.},

ICIs are used to treat a variety of cancer types, including melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma ( 1 ), with patients often displaying long-lasting responses. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients do not respond to ICIs ( 1 ), and the gut microbiome has been identified as a key modulator of ICI effectiveness ( 2 – 4 ). Diet strongly influences gut microbial composition and function. On page 428 of this issue, Giampazolias et al .

With a limited vocabulary of four nucleotides (A, C, G, and T), DNA encodes an extensive instruction set, including the chromosomal positions where RNAs begin to be transcribed and the magnitudes of their expression. This process, known as transcription initiation ( 1 ), begins at transcription start sites (TSSs) and depends on RNA polymerase II recruitment to promoter sequences ( 2 ). However, the sequences and rules that govern transcription initiation remain elusive. On page 405 of this issue, Dudnyk et al . ( 3 ) use an explainable deep-learning model to find a small set of DNA sequence motifs that predict the position and activity of most TSSs in the human genome.

  abstract     = {Flavivirus diseases are increasing in incidence and prevalence owing to the urban proclivities of its Aedes mosquito vector species. Extirpation of mosquitoes is considered key for the control of several human diseases but often involves toxic chemicals that prompt mosquito resistance. As some biocontrol alternatives look promising in malaria campaigns, Zhang et al . examined the microbiota of Aedes mosquitoes for potential agents to control dengue and Zika virus transmission. The authors isolated a bacterium called Rosenbergiella _YN46 in Aedes albopictus mosquitos. The bacterium was fed to caged mosquitoes to establish stable gut infections, and it was found to prevent the insects from being infected by viruses and blocked viral transmission to mice. —Caroline Ash The commensal microbiota of the mosquito gut plays a complex role in determining the vector competence for arboviruses. In this study, we identified a bacterium from the gut of field Aedes albopictus mosquitoes named Rosenbergiella sp. YN46 ( Rosenbergiella_ YN46) that rendered mosquitoes refractory to infection with dengue and Zika viruses. Inoculation of 1.6 × 10 3 colony forming units (CFUs) of Rosenbergiella_ YN46 into A. albopictus mosquitoes effectively prevents viral infection. Mechanistically, this bacterium secretes glucose dehydrogenase ( Ry GDH), which acidifies the gut lumen of fed mosquitoes, causing irreversible conformational changes in the flavivirus envelope protein that prevent viral entry into cells. In semifield conditions, Rosenbergiella_ YN46 exhibits effective transstadial transmission in field mosquitoes, which blocks transmission of dengue virus by newly emerged adult mosquitoes. The prevalence of Rosenbergiella_ YN46 is greater in mosquitoes from low-dengue areas (52.9 to ~91.7%) than in those from dengue-endemic regions (0 to ~6.7%). Rosenbergiella_ YN46 may offer an effective and safe lead for flavivirus biocontrol.},

  abstract     = {Innate brain functions that normally process natural rewards are corrupted by drugs of abuse. However, the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms linking these functions are still unclear. Tan et al . compared the response of key reward circuits activated by hunger and thirst with the response to morphine and cocaine in the same animals (see the Perspective by Millan and McNally). They found that the protein RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain), a signaling partner of mammalian target of rapamycin, is a crucial molecular substrate that enables drugs to gain access to neurons that process natural reward. This molecular mechanism is engaged in dissociable ensembles of neurons of a brain region called the nucleus accumbens. These neuronal ensembles are at the center of the addictive effects of these drugs, where conflict between drug-taking and the homeostatic regulation of hunger and thirst takes place. —Peter Stern Drugs of abuse are thought to promote addiction in part by “hijacking” brain reward systems, but the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Using whole-brain FOS mapping and in vivo single-neuron calcium imaging, we found that drugs of abuse augment dopaminoceptive ensemble activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and disorganize overlapping ensemble responses to natural rewards in a cell type–specific manner. Combining FOS-Seq, CRISPR-perturbation, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we identified Rheb as a molecular substrate that regulates cell type–specific signal transduction in NAc while enabling drugs to suppress natural reward consumption. Mapping NAc-projecting regions activated by drugs of abuse revealed input-specific effects on natural reward consumption. These findings characterize the dynamic, molecular and circuit basis of a common reward pathway, wherein drugs of abuse interfere with the fulfillment of innate needs.},

To study how such factors interact in a human infection, Madi et al . obtained fecal specimens upon admission of patients to hospitals in Bangladesh for diarrheal infections, largely cholera, which is endemic to the country. The authors investigated the multifactorial dynamics between Vibrio cholerae infection outcomes, phage incidence, antibiotic resistance, occurrence of mobile elements, hypermutation, and the evolutionary arms race between phage and bacterial antiphage defenses. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the significance of the evolutionary pressure that phage apparently apply to V. cholerae populations during fulminant infection. —Caroline Ash Despite an increasingly detailed picture of the molecular mechanisms of bacteriophage (phage)–bacterial interactions, we lack an understanding of how these interactions evolve and impact disease within patients. In this work, we report a year-long, nationwide study of diarrheal disease patients in Bangladesh. Among cholera patients, we quantified Vibrio cholerae (prey) and its virulent phages (predators) using metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction while accounting for antibiotic exposure using quantitative mass spectrometry. Virulent phage (ICP1) and antibiotics suppressed V. cholerae to varying degrees and were inversely associated with severe dehydration depending on resistance mechanisms. In the absence of antiphage defenses, predation was “effective,” with a high predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the prey. In the presence of antiphage defenses, predation was “ineffective,” with a lower predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the predators. Phage-bacteria coevolution within patients should therefore be considered in the deployment of phage-based therapies and diagnostics.},

Avdellidou et al . examined the Athor family of asteroids, which are thought to be related to meteorites classified as low-iron enstatite (EL) chondrites. The authors used thermal models and orbital dynamics simulations to investigate scenarios that connect the EL chondrites and the Athor family. They found that connection can only be produced by the giant planet migration, which sets a lower limit on its timing of more than 60 million years. —Keith T. Smith The giant planets of the Solar System formed on initially compact orbits, which transitioned to the current wider configuration by means of an orbital instability. The timing of that instability is poorly constrained. In this work, we use dynamical simulations to demonstrate that the instability implanted planetesimal fragments from the terrestrial planet region into the asteroid main belt. We use meteorite data to show that the implantation occurred &gt;60 million years (Myr) after the Solar System began to form. Combining this constraint with a previous upper limit derived from Jupiter’s trojan asteroids, we conclude that the orbital instability occurred 60 to 100 Myr after the beginning of Solar System formation. The giant impact that formed the Moon occurred within this range, so it might be related to the giant planet instability.},

In twisted structures, electronic correlations are typically highest for small twist angles, which can be challenging to achieve for some of these materials. Foutty et al . fabricated twisted bilayers of tungsten diselenide at a twist angle of about 1.23° and observed a series of quantum anomalous Hall insulating states, indicating the presence of multiple moiré bands with nontrivial topology. This platform should enable further exploration of the interplay of strong correlations with topology. —Jelena Stajic Semiconductor moiré superlattices have been shown to host a wide array of interaction-driven ground states. However, twisted homobilayers have been difficult to study in the limit of large moiré wavelengths, where interactions are most dominant. In this study, we conducted local electronic compressibility measurements of twisted bilayer WSe 2 (tWSe 2 ) at small twist angles. We demonstrated multiple topological bands that host a series of Chern insulators at zero magnetic field near a “magic angle” around 1.23°. Using a locally applied electric field, we induced a topological quantum-phase transition at one hole per moiré unit cell. Our work establishes the topological phase diagram of a generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in tWSe 2 , demonstrating a tunable platform for strongly correlated topological phases.},

Most of our current knowledge of the cortical synaptic structure is derived from rodent studies. Peng et al . analyzed multineuron patch-clamp recordings obtained from human cortical brain slices to determine the principles governing synaptic connectivity and compared the results with rodent cortical activity. Unlike in rodents, connectivity in the human cortex is heterogeneous and exhibits a directed and mostly acyclic graph topology. Using these principles in neural network models increased dimensionality and improved performance in functionally relevant tasks, suggesting that these properties of cortical connectivity in humans facilitate high-order computation. —Mattia Maroso The computational capabilities of neuronal networks are fundamentally constrained by their specific connectivity. Previous studies of cortical connectivity have mostly been carried out in rodents; whether the principles established therein also apply to the evolutionarily expanded human cortex is unclear. We studied network properties within the human temporal cortex using samples obtained from brain surgery. We analyzed multineuron patch-clamp recordings in layer 2-3 pyramidal neurons and identified substantial differences compared with rodents. Reciprocity showed random distribution, synaptic strength was independent from connection probability, and connectivity of the supragranular temporal cortex followed a directed and mostly acyclic graph topology. Application of these principles in neuronal models increased dimensionality of network dynamics, suggesting a critical role for cortical computation.},

Polyesters are not typically used for water filtration membranes because they suffer from hydrolytic degradation when immersed in aqueous solution. Yao et al . show that the polymerization of 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylbenzoic acid with trimesoyl chloride yields a polymer membrane with impressive resistance to hydrolytic degradation in acidic or basic conditions (up to pH 9) and a complete resistance to chlorine. —Marc S. Lavine Thin-film composite reverse osmosis membranes have remained the gold standard technology for desalination and water purification for nearly half a century. Polyamide films offer excellent water permeability and salt rejection but also suffer from poor chlorine resistance, high fouling propensity, and low boron rejection. We addressed these issues by molecularly designing a polyester thin-film composite reverse osmosis membrane using co-solvent–assisted interfacial polymerization to react 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylbenzoic acid with trimesoyl chloride. This polyester membrane exhibits substantial water permeability, high rejection for sodium chloride and boron, and complete resistance toward chlorine. The ultrasmooth, low-energy surface of the membrane also prevents fouling and mineral scaling compared with polyamide membranes. These membranes could increasingly challenge polyamide membranes by further optimizing water-salt selectivity, offering a path to considerably reducing pretreatment steps in desalination.},

An artificial intelligence CIM processor developed by Wen et al . combines the advantages of digital and memristive approaches. The authors’ CIM-fusion scheme, combined with adaptive local training for customization, achieves high speed, energy efficiency, and accuracy. —Phil Szuromi Artificial intelligence (AI) edge devices prefer employing high-capacity nonvolatile compute-in-memory (CIM) to achieve high energy efficiency and rapid wakeup-to-response with sufficient accuracy. Most previous works are based on either memristor-based CIMs, which suffer from accuracy loss and do not support training as a result of limited endurance, or digital static random-access memory (SRAM)–based CIMs, which suffer from large area requirements and volatile storage. We report an AI edge processor that uses a memristor-SRAM CIM-fusion scheme to simultaneously exploit the high accuracy of the digital SRAM CIM and the high energy-efficiency and storage density of the resistive random-access memory memristor CIM. This also enables adaptive local training to accommodate personalized characterization and user environment. The fusion processor achieved high CIM capacity, short wakeup-to-response latency (392 microseconds), high peak energy efficiency (77.64 teraoperations per second per watt), and robust accuracy (&lt;0.5% accuracy loss).

Although this phenomenon is tricky to study in electronic materials, it is more accessible in “artificial” quantum Hall systems. Zhu et al . used ultracold potassium-40 atoms to engineer an equivalent of a quantum Hall system featuring one real and one synthetic dimension. The atoms were “pumped” toward the system’s edge, reversing direction at the location of the topological boundary. The researchers found an additional, partial reversal in the presence of repulsive atomic interactions. —Jelena Stajic The transport properties of gapless edge modes at boundaries between topologically distinct domains are of fundamental and technological importance. We experimentally studied long-distance quantized Hall drifts in a harmonically confined topological pump of ultracold fermionic atoms. We found that quantized drifts halt and reverse their direction when the atoms reach a critical slope of the confining potential, revealing the presence of a topological boundary. The drift reversal corresponded to a band transfer between a band with Chern number C = +1 and another with C = –1 through a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for noninteracting particles. Nonzero repulsive Hubbard interactions led to the emergence of an additional edge in the system through a mechanism in which pairs of fermions are split.},

  abstract     = {Avoiding waste heat during capacitor operation is important for improving energy efficiency. Han et al . designed a dielectric heterostructure with barium titanate sandwiched between a two-dimensional material. Charge accumulation at the material interfaces under an alternating electric field changes the relaxation time of the heterostructure. This, in turn, can substantially reduce the energy loss when the right materials are chosen. The authors produced one such structure with high energy density and low loss using two-layer molybdenum disulfide and barium titanate. The general strategy should be useful for refining other dielectric materials. —Brent Grocholski Electrostatic capacitors are foundational components of advanced electronics and high-power electrical systems owing to their ultrafast charging-discharging capability. Ferroelectric materials offer high maximum polarization, but high remnant polarization has hindered their effective deployment in energy storage applications. Previous methodologies have encountered problems because of the deteriorated crystallinity of the ferroelectric materials. We introduce an approach to control the relaxation time using two-dimensional (2D) materials while minimizing energy loss by using 2D/3D/2D heterostructures and preserving the crystallinity of ferroelectric 3D materials. Using this approach, we were able to achieve an energy density of 191.7 joules per cubic centimeter with an efficiency greater than 90%. This precise control over relaxation time holds promise for a wide array of applications and has the potential to accelerate the development of highly efficient energy storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic skyrmions—topologically protected spin textures—have shown promise as information carriers in spintronic devices. Although they can be manipulated with electric currents, their speeds in tracks tend to be limited by phenomena such as the skyrmion Hall effect, which deflects and damps the skyrmion motion. Pham et al . avoided this issue, typical of ferromagnets, by using an antiferromagnet instead. The synthetic antiferromagnetic material, fabricated by sputtering, was composed of two platinum/cobalt layers coupled through a thin layer of ruthenium. The authors used magnetic force microscopy to monitor the motion of skyrmions after current injections and measured skyrmion velocities of up to 900 meters per second along the current direction. —Jelena Stajic Magnetic skyrmions are topological magnetic textures that hold great promise as nanoscale bits of information in memory and logic devices. Although room-temperature ferromagnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation have been demonstrated, their velocity has been limited to about 100 meters per second. In addition, their dynamics are perturbed by the skyrmion Hall effect, a motion transverse to the current direction caused by the skyrmion topological charge. Here, we show that skyrmions in compensated synthetic antiferromagnets can be moved by current along the current direction at velocities of up to 900 meters per second. This can be explained by the cancellation of the net topological charge leading to a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect. Our results open an important path toward the realization of logic and memory devices based on the fast manipulation of skyrmions in tracks.},

Ao et al . used satellite observations to determine the extent of land subsidence across 82 major cities in China (see the Perspective by Nicholls and Shirzaei). They found that about 40% of the land is undergoing moderate to severe subsidence, which adds to the risk of flooding for a large population. —Brent Grocholski China’s massive wave of urbanization may be threatened by land subsidence. Using a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar interferometry technique, we provided a systematic assessment of land subsidence in all of China’s major cities from 2015 to 2022. Of the examined urban lands, 45% are subsiding faster than 3 millimeters per year, and 16% are subsiding faster than 10 millimeters per year, affecting 29 and 7% of the urban population, respectively. The subsidence appears to be associated with a range of factors such as groundwater withdrawal and the weight of buildings. By 2120, 22 to 26% of China’s coastal lands will have a relative elevation lower than sea level, hosting 9 to 11% of the coastal population, because of the combined effect of city subsidence and sea-level rise. Our results underscore the necessity of enhancing protective measures to mitigate potential damages from subsidence.},

However, their physiological regulation and function remain to be fully elucidated. Seeholzer and Julius performed an in-depth molecular, biophysical, and morphological characterization of these cells across the mouse airway (see the Perspective by Zhu and Sun). Using ex vivo and in vivo recording, optogenetic intervention, and behavioral analysis, the authors showed that tracheal and laryngeal NE cells protect the airway by triggering swallowing and cough-like behaviors in response to potentially noxious stimuli. These data represent a valuable resource and uncover important protective mechanisms. —Mattia Maroso Airway neuroendocrine (NE) cells have been proposed to serve as specialized sensory epithelial cells that modulate respiratory behavior by communicating with nearby nerve endings. However, their functional properties and physiological roles in the healthy lung, trachea, and larynx remain largely unknown. In this work, we show that murine NE cells in these compartments have distinct biophysical properties but share sensitivity to two commonly aspirated noxious stimuli, water and acid. Moreover, we found that tracheal and laryngeal NE cells protect the airways by releasing adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) to activate purinoreceptive sensory neurons that initiate swallowing and expiratory reflexes. Our work uncovers the broad molecular and biophysical diversity of NE cells across the airways and reveals mechanisms by which these specialized excitable cells serve as sentinels for activating protective responses.},

By enabling immunization at scales sufficient to interrupt pathogen transmission, transmissible vaccines (TVs) that spread themselves through wildlife populations by infectious processes could potentially transform the management of otherwise intractable challenges to public health, wildlife conservation, and animal welfare. However, generating TVs likely requires modifying viruses that would be intended to spread in nature, which raises concerns ranging from technical feasibility, to safety and security risks, to regulatory uncertainties ( 1 , 2 ). We propose a series of commitments and strategies for vaccine development—beginning with a priori decisions on vaccine design and continuing through to stakeholder codevelopment [see supplementary materials (SM)]—that we believe increase the likelihood that the potential risks of vaccine transmission are outweighed by benefits to conservation, animal welfare, and zoonosis prevention.},

  abstract     = {Drug addictions are a leading global cause of health and economic burden, with opioids responsible for 80% of drug use–related deaths ( 1 ). Persistent drug use is accompanied by profound motivational reprioritization ( 2 ), with decision-making skewed toward drug use at the expense of other activities ( 3 ), often with little recognition of adverse consequences ( 4 ). These impacts owe, at least in part, to alterations in the brain’s reward systems ( 5 , 6 ), which normally help to identify and respond to factors essential for survival (e.g., food, water). Yet how drugs drive reprioritization toward a myopic focus on drug use has been unclear. On page 294 of this issue, Tan et al . ( 7 ) show that drugs of abuse interfere with signaling in the nucleus accumbens and disrupt natural responses of mice to food and water, providing a new mechanistic understanding of the links between addiction and motivational reprioritization.},

  abstract     = {The respiratory tract is essential for breathing but is also important for detecting and responding to inhaled harmful (noxious) stimuli, such as pollutants, pathogens, water, and acid. Neuroendocrine cells (NECs)—rare epithelial cells that share characteristics with neurons—are an integral component of this sensory surveillance system ( 1 ). Although NECs have been proposed to act as airway sentinels capable of perceiving chemical and mechanical cues and can secrete signals to relay information to other cells and tissues ( 2 ), their functional roles remain poorly understood. On page 295 of this issue, Seeholzer et al . ( 3 ) report the morphological and biophysical diversity of NECs along the respiratory tract of mice, highlighting their ability to sense different noxious stimuli. Moreover, NECs in the larynx and trachea interact with sensory neurons to initiate protective swallowing and expiratory reflexes. These findings elucidate how NECs control fundamental physiological responses and may inform interventions for treating respiratory disorders.},

Potentially 19% of the global population is at high risk of being affected by this process ( 1 ). Such sinking is caused by a range of natural or anthropogenic factors, including human-induced underground fluid withdrawal, which is generally considered the most important driver. However, present understanding of subsidence is fragmented and qualitative, including measurements, attribution to drivers, prognosis, and appropriate responses. On page 301 of this issue, Ao et al .

By fine-tuning on denoising tasks, we developed RFdiffusion All-Atom (RFdiffusionAA), which builds protein structures around small molecules.

Formins, a large class of actin-binding proteins, bind and move with the growing end of actin filaments to regulate their assembly in various cellular processes. Oosterheert et al . determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of three functionally distinct formins that encircle the actin filament end like a ring. These structures, together with biochemical experiments, explain how formins elongate filaments over long distances and differentially control the speed of actin subunit addition. This work provides a foundation for manipulating the activity of formins and understanding their various roles in physiological processes and diseases. —Stella M. Hurtley Formins control the assembly of actin filaments (F-actin) that drive cell morphogenesis and motility in eukaryotes. However, their molecular interaction with F-actin and their mechanism of action remain unclear. In this work, we present high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of F-actin barbed ends bound by three distinct formins, revealing a common asymmetric formin conformation imposed by the filament. Formation of new intersubunit contacts during actin polymerization sterically displaces formin and triggers its translocation. This “undock-and-lock” mechanism explains how actin-filament growth is coordinated with formin movement. Filament elongation speeds are controlled by the positioning and stability of actin-formin interfaces, which distinguish fast and slow formins. Furthermore, we provide a structure of the actin-formin-profilin ring complex, which resolves how profilin is rapidly released from the barbed end during filament elongation.},

Chi et al . found that female mice had higher numbers of T cells, dendritic cells, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) within the skin (see the Perspective by Puttur and Lloyd). The numbers of these immune cells were regulated by male sex hormones, which are sensed by androgen receptors expressed in ILC2s of both sexes. ILC2s produced cytokines required for skin dendritic cell homeostasis and expressed relatively high levels of the androgen receptor. Negative regulation of ILC2s within the skin in response to androgens could thus restrict the number and activation status of dendritic cells in the skin of male mice, contributing to differences in local immune responses between the sexes. —Sarah H. Ross Males and females exhibit profound differences in immune responses and disease susceptibility. However, the factors responsible for sex differences in tissue immunity remain poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a dominant role for type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in shaping sexual immune dimorphism within the skin. Mechanistically, negative regulation of ILC2s by androgens leads to a reduction in dendritic cell accumulation and activation in males, along with reduced tissue immunity. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the androgen-ILC2-dendritic cell axis in controlling sexual immune dimorphism. Moreover, this work proposes that tissue immune set points are defined by the dual action of sex hormones and the microbiota, with sex hormones controlling the strength of local immunity and microbiota calibrating its tone.},

The recovered components can then be converted back to the original monomers for closed-loop recycling. The authors further demonstrate clean recovery of glass fibers from composite materials subjected to the recycling protocol. —Jake S. Yeston Epoxy resin thermosets (ERTs) are an important class of polymeric materials. However, owing to their highly cross-linked nature, they suffer from poor recyclability, which contributes to an unacceptable level of environmental pollution. There is a clear need for the design of inherently recyclable ERTs that are based on renewable resources. We present the synthesis and closed-loop recycling of a fully lignocellulose-derivable epoxy resin (DGF/MBCA), prepared from dimethyl ester of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (DMFD), 4,4′-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (MBCA), and glycidol, which displays excellent thermomechanical properties (a glass transition temperature of 170°C, and a storage modulus at 25°C of 1.2 gigapascals). Notably, the material undergoes methanolysis in the absence of any catalyst, regenerating 90% of the original DMFD. The diamine MBCA and glycidol can subsequently be reformed by acetolysis.

Huang et al . addressed that imbalance by analyzing a large database of field-based SIC measurements with machine-learning models to estimate better how much inorganic carbon exists in soils globally and how vulnerable it is to future loss. They found that nearly one billion tons of inorganic carbon are lost to inland waters annually, and that future losses will reduce global SIC by 23 billion tons over the next 30 years under a business-as-usual scenario. This value represents a substantial component of atmosphere and hydrosphere carbon dynamics. —H.

By compiling 223,593 field-based measurements and developing machine-learning models, we report that global soils store 2305 ± 636 (±1 SD) billion tonnes of carbon as SIC over the top 2-meter depth. Under future scenarios, soil acidification associated with nitrogen additions to terrestrial ecosystems will reduce global SIC (0.3 meters) up to 23 billion tonnes of carbon over the next 30 years, with India and China being the most affected.

Vayssières et al . now provide definitive structural evidence for a model predicted nearly four decades ago. Escherichia coli gyrase wraps DNA into a positive node against the torsional stress of a negatively supercoiled DNA minicircle to simultaneously bind both the strand that it will cleave and the strand that it will pass through the break. The cryo–electron microscopy structure reveals new enzyme grooves that are conserved among the type II topoisomerases. —Di Jiang DNA supercoiling must be precisely regulated by topoisomerases to prevent DNA entanglement. The interaction of type IIA DNA topoisomerases with two DNA molecules, enabling the transport of one duplex through the transient double-stranded break of the other, remains elusive owing to structures derived solely from single linear duplex DNAs lacking topological constraints. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the structure of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase bound to a negatively supercoiled minicircle DNA. We show how DNA gyrase captures a DNA crossover, revealing both conserved molecular grooves that accommodate the DNA helices. Together with molecular tweezer experiments, the structure shows that the DNA crossover is of positive chirality, reconciling the binding step of gyrase-mediated DNA relaxation and supercoiling in a single structure.},

In keeping with theoretical predictions, the system exhibits nontrivial topological properties and features nonplanar cyclotron orbits. —Jelena Stajic Modern condensed matter physics relies on the concept of topology to classify matter, from quantum Hall systems to topological insulators. Engineered systems, benefiting from synthetic dimensions, can potentially give access to topological states predicted in dimensions D &gt; 3. We report the realization of an atomic quantum Hall system evolving in four dimensions (4D), with two spatial dimensions and two synthetic ones encoded in the large spin of dysprosium atoms. We measure the nontrivial topological index of the ground band through a full characterization of the nonlinear electromagnetic response and observe the associated anisotropic hyperedge modes. We also excite nonplanar cyclotron motion, in contrast to the planar orbits in D ≤ 3. Our work may enable the investigation of strongly correlated topological liquids in 4D, generalizing fractional quantum Hall states.},

  abstract     = {Many partnerships have been formed between nitrogen-fixing microbes and carbon-fixing eukaryotes that need nitrogen to grow. The possibility of a eukaryote with a nitrogen-fixing organelle derived from endosymbiosis, which is called a nitroplast, has been speculated. Studying a marine alga with a cyanobacterial endosymbiont, Coale et al . used soft x-ray tomography to visualize cell morphology and division of the alga, revealing a coordinated cell cycle in which the endosymbiont divides and is split evenly, similar to the situation for plastids and mitochondria in these cells (see the Perspective by Massana). Proteomics revealed that a sizable fraction of the proteins in this structure are encoded by and imported from the alga, including many that are essential for biosynthesis, cell growth, and division. These results offer a fascinating view into the transition from an endosymbiont into a bona fide organelle. —Michael A. Funk Symbiotic interactions were key to the evolution of chloroplast and mitochondria organelles, which mediate carbon and energy metabolism in eukaryotes. Biological nitrogen fixation, the reduction of abundant atmospheric nitrogen gas (N 2 ) to biologically available ammonia, is a key metabolic process performed exclusively by prokaryotes. Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa, or UCYN-A, is a metabolically streamlined N 2 -fixing cyanobacterium previously reported to be an endosymbiont of a marine unicellular alga. Here we show that UCYN-A has been tightly integrated into algal cell architecture and organellar division and that it imports proteins encoded by the algal genome. These are characteristics of organelles and show that UCYN-A has evolved beyond endosymbiosis and functions as an early evolutionary stage N 2 -fixing organelle, or “nitroplast.”},

  abstract     = {Most stellar magnetic fields (including the Sun’s) are produced by a dynamo that is generated in interior layers undergoing convection. Massive stars (eight or more solar masses) do not have convective interiors, so it has been unclear why about 7% have magnetic fields. Frost et al . observed a binary massive star using interferometry and spectroscopy and found that one component is magnetic and appears to be younger than its companion. They argue that the system originally contained three or more stars and then experienced a merger that produced the magnetic star and made it appear younger. Comparing with theoretical models, the authors reproduced the properties of the system within this merger scenario. —Keith T. Smith Massive stars (those ≥8 solar masses at formation) have radiative envelopes that cannot sustain a dynamo, the mechanism that produces magnetic fields in lower-mass stars. Despite this, approximately 7% of massive stars have observed magnetic fields, the origin of which is debated. We used multi-epoch interferometric and spectroscopic observations to characterize HD 148937, a binary system of two massive stars. We found that only one star is magnetic and that it appears younger than its companion. The system properties and a surrounding bipolar nebula can be reproduced with a model in which two stars merged (in a previous triple system) to produce the magnetic massive star. Our results provide observational evidence that magnetic fields form in at least some massive stars through stellar mergers.},

Typically, the addition of a third component is needed to allow droplets of one to be stabilized within the other. Nannette et al . have revealed an exception to this behavior: the mixing of water with a polymeric oil. When a thin layer of oil absorbs onto the surface of water droplets, it stabilizes the droplets and causes a weak attraction between them, leading to long-term stability. —Marc S. Lavine Oil and water can only be mixed by dispersing droplets of one fluid in the other. When two droplets approach one another, the thin film that separates them invariably becomes unstable, causing the droplets to coalesce. The only known way to avoid this instability is through addition of a third component, typically a surfactant, which stabilizes the thin film at its equilibrium thickness. We report the observation that a thin fluid film of oil separating two water droplets can lead to an adhesive interaction between the droplets. Moreover, this interaction prevents their coalescence over timescales of several weeks, without the use of any surfactant or solvent.},

Photonic computing has the potential to achieve these goals, but despite attracting attention, current photonic integrated circuits, specifically optical neural networks (ONNs), have limited scale and computing capabilities, barely supporting modern AGI tasks. Xu et al . explored a distributed diffractive-interference hybrid photonic computing architecture to effectively increase the scale of the ONN to the million-neuron level. They experimentally realized an on-chip 13.96-million-neuron ONN for complex, thousand-category-level classification and AI-generated content tasks. The present work is a promising step toward real-world photonic computing, supporting various applications in AI. —Yury Suleymanov The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) continuously demands higher computing performance. Despite the superior processing speed and efficiency of integrated photonic circuits, their capacity and scalability are restricted by unavoidable errors, such that only simple tasks and shallow models are realized. To support modern AGIs, we designed Taichi—large-scale photonic chiplets based on an integrated diffractive-interference hybrid design and a general distributed computing architecture that has millions-of-neurons capability with 160–tera-operations per second per watt (TOPS/W) energy efficiency. Taichi experimentally achieved on-chip 1000-category–level classification (testing at 91.89% accuracy in the 1623-category Omniglot dataset) and high-fidelity artificial intelligence–generated content with up to two orders of magnitude of improvement in efficiency.

  abstract     = {Motor learning requires the acquisition and retention of motor skills obtained through practice and repetition. The circuits and cell populations in the spinal cord involved in the different steps of motor learning have not been fully elucidated. Using a variety of transgenic mouse models, optogenetics, and electrophysiology, Lavaud et al . identified a population of dorsal horn interneurons in the spinal cord that are necessary for the acquisition of motor learning. A different population of interneurons, Renshaw cells, was critical for retaining and recalling the learned motor skills. The results highlight the contribution of spinal cord circuits in motor learning and memory. Targeting these circuits might have therapeutic value during motor rehabilitation. —Mattia Maroso Spinal circuits are central to movement adaptation, yet the mechanisms within the spinal cord responsible for acquiring and retaining behavior upon experience remain unclear. Using a simple conditioning paradigm, we found that dorsal inhibitory neurons are indispensable for adapting protective limb-withdrawal behavior by regulating the transmission of a specific set of somatosensory information to enhance the saliency of conditioning cues associated with limb position. By contrast, maintaining previously acquired motor adaptation required the ventral inhibitory Renshaw cells. Manipulating Renshaw cells does not affect the adaptation itself but flexibly alters the expression of adaptive behavior. These findings identify a circuit basis involving two distinct populations of spinal inhibitory neurons, which enables lasting sensorimotor adaptation independently from the brain.},

A design study identified 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate as a ligand that would bind two neighboring lead(II) ion defect sites in a planar orientation and also minimize the energy mismatch with the fullerene electron-transfer layer. An inverted solar cell with a 1-square-centimeter illuminated area had a power conversion efficiency of 24.7%, and 95% of that efficiency was maintained for 1200 hours of continuous operation at 65°C. —Phil Szuromi Inverted (pin) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) afford improved operating stability in comparison to their nip counterparts but have lagged in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The energetic losses responsible for this PCE deficit in pin PSCs occur primarily at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-transport layers. Additive and surface treatments that use passivating ligands usually bind to a single active binding site: This dense packing of electrically resistive passivants perpendicular to the surface may limit the fill factor in pin PSCs. We identified ligands that bind two neighboring lead(II) ion (Pb 2+ ) defect sites in a planar ligand orientation on the perovskite. We fabricated pin PSCs and report a certified quasi–steady state PCE of 26.15 and 24.74% for 0.05– and 1.04–square centimeter illuminated areas, respectively.

Dielectrics with high energy densities often are relatively inefficient, producing waste heat during charging and discharging. Zhang et al . combined two strategies for improving the dielectric properties to make an energy-efficient barium titanate–based material (see the Perspective by Chen). The authors used a high-entropy design to increase the breakdown strength, which requires adding many additional elements. They also found a composition near a ferroelectric phase boundary, which improves efficiency. The result is a more efficient dielectric that retains ultrahigh energy density. —Brent Grocholski Ultrahigh–power-density multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) are critical components in electrical and electronic systems. However, the realization of a high energy density combined with a high efficiency is a major challenge for practical applications. We propose a high-entropy design in barium titanate (BaTiO 3 )–based lead-free MLCCs with polymorphic relaxor phase. This strategy effectively minimizes hysteresis loss by lowering the domain-switching barriers and enhances the breakdown strength by the high atomic disorder with lattice distortion and grain refining. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, we achieved a high energy density of 20.8 joules per cubic centimeter with an ultrahigh efficiency of 97.5% in the MLCCs.

Cook et al . discovered a refractory alloy composed of niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, and hafnium that is an exception to the general trend. Because this alloy forms kink bands, in which crystal rotation accommodates strain, the fracture toughness is greatly enhanced. The high fracture toughness extends from cryogenic conditions up to very high temperatures, making the alloy attractive for applications across a wide temperature range. —Brent Grocholski Single-phase body-centered cubic (bcc) refractory medium- or high-entropy alloys can retain compressive strength at elevated temperatures but suffer from extremely low tensile ductility and fracture toughness. We examined the strength and fracture toughness of a bcc refractory alloy, NbTaTiHf, from 77 to 1473 kelvin. This alloy’s behavior differed from that of comparable systems by having fracture toughness over 253 MPa·m 1/2 , which we attribute to a dynamic competition between screw and edge dislocations in controlling the plasticity at a crack tip. Whereas the glide and intersection of screw and mixed dislocations promotes strain hardening controlling uniform deformation, the coordinated slip of edge dislocations with {110} and {112} glide planes prolongs nonuniform strain through formation of kink bands. These bands suppress strain hardening by reorienting microscale bands of the crystal along directions of higher resolved shear stress and continually nucleate to accommodate localized strain and distribute damage away from a crack tip.},

Tribal lands contain an estimated 6.5% of utility-scale technical potential for US renewable energy development on 5.8% of land area ( 1 ). New federal legislation sets aside approximately $14 billion solely for 574 federally recognized American Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages ( 2 – 5 ), which can support tribal climate responsiveness and energy sovereignty. This opportunity positions tribes and villages to develop their economies and reimagine energy projects on their terms, building beyond many decades of energy and economic poverty.

Two of these organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, which function in respiration and photosynthesis, evolved from the integration of endosymbiotic bacteria to the eukaryotic cell ( 1 ). In marine systems, some nitrogen-fixing bacteria are endosymbionts of microalgae, such as Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A), a cyanobacterial symbiont of the unicellular algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii ( 2 ). On page 217 of this issue, Coale et al . ( 3 ) report a close integration of the endosymbiont into the architecture and function of the host cell, which is a characteristic of organelles. These findings show that UCYN-A has evolved from a symbiont to a eukaryotic organelle for nitrogen fixation—the nitroplast—thereby expanding a function that was thought to be exclusively carried out by prokaryotic cells to eukaryotes.},

These interactions are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that calibrate the tone and strength of the immune response. On page 175 of this issue, Chi et al. ( 1 ) reveal how male sex hormones in mice reduce the number of skin type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), which limits the function of skin-resident dendritic cells (DCs) by restricting the production of ILC2-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an essential DC growth factor. DCs present antigen (including from microbiota) to T cells, which helps to shape tissue-resident T cell subsets. The reduced number and antigen-presenting capacity of DCs in the skin of male mice result in lower skin inflammation compared to female mice.},

In closed-loop recycling, a polymer can be processed into a new material without sacrificing properties, retaining the value of the virgin material ( 3 ). Under this efficient recycling regime, both global plastic production and waste would decrease. Although innovative technologies have been developed toward this goal, chemical methods for recycling thermosets remain elusive. On page 177 of this issue, Wu et al .

  abstract     = {Viruses that infect bacteria are ubiquitous even among bacterial pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a widespread opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that has multiple potential virulence factors, including a retractable type 4 pilus that propels the cell. Thongchol et al . have found that one Pseudomonas phage called PP7 infects its host cell by means of a virus protein called Mat that attached to the bacterium’s pilus. The pilus retracts and drags the phage to the bacterial cell surface. At the point of virus entry into the cell, the pilus is bent and snaps off, thus disabling and reducing the bacterium’s ability to infect its own host. —Caroline Ash The retractile type IV pilus (T4P) is important for virulence of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) phage PP7 binds to T4P and is brought to the cell surface through pilus retraction. Using fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that PP7 detaches T4P, which impairs cell motility and restricts the pathogen’s virulence. Using cryo–electron microscopy, mutagenesis, optical trapping, and Langevin dynamics simulation, we resolved the structure of PP7, T4P, and the PP7/T4P complex and showed that T4P detachment is driven by the affinity between the phage maturation protein and its bound pilin, plus the pilus retraction force and speed, and pilus bending. Pilus detachment may be widespread among other ssRNA phages and their retractile pilus systems and offers new prospects for antibacterial prophylaxis and therapeutics.},

Liebold et al . found that macrophages exposed to dying cells in vitro induced different gene expression programs in response to interleukin-4 depending on the identity of the apoptotic cells that they had engulfed. The same gene expression programs were detected in macrophages from the livers of mice infected with the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni . Engulfment of apoptotic neutrophils, which was dependent on two phagocytic receptors, augmented a tissue-remodeling profile in macrophages. Macrophages that were conditioned with both interleukin-4 and apoptotic neutrophils in vitro and then transferred into mice were protective against S. mansoni infection. —Sarah H. Ross Macrophages are functionally heterogeneous cells essential for apoptotic cell clearance. Apoptotic cells are defined by homogeneous characteristics, ignoring their original cell lineage identity. We found that in an interleukin-4 (IL-4)–enriched environment, the sensing of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages triggered their tissue remodeling signature. Engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes promoted a tolerogenic phenotype, whereas phagocytosis of T cells had little effect on IL-4–induced gene expression. In a mouse model of parasite-induced pathology, the transfer of macrophages conditioned with IL-4 and apoptotic neutrophils promoted parasitic egg clearance. Knockout of phagocytic receptors required for the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils and partially T cells, but not hepatocytes, exacerbated helminth infection. These findings suggest that the identity of apoptotic cells may contribute to the development of distinct IL-4–driven immune programs in macrophages.},

  abstract     = {Self-pollinating plants are useful for agriculture because favorable traits can easily be passed on to offspring. Domesticated tomatoes achieve this anatomically by forming a cone around the male anthers, which ensures that pollen can easily reach the stigma. The anther cone is held together by a dense network of hairs called zipper trichomes. Wu et al . identified a set of homeodomain–leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) genes that regulate the formation of these trichomes. Simultaneously, these genes regulate the length of the female style, allowing coordinated development of a self-pollinating reproductive structure. Expression of the HD-ZIPs was found to be lower in wild tomato plants, which may explain why they do not develop the anther cone and are able to receive pollen from another plant. —Madeleine Seale Cleistogamy is a type of self-pollination that relies on the formation of a stigma-enclosing floral structure. We identify three homeodomain-leucine zipper IV (HD-Zip IV) genes that coordinately promote the formation of interlocking trichomes at the anther margin to unite neighboring anthers, generating a closed anther cone and cleistogamy (flower morphology necessitating strict self-pollination). These HD-Zip IV genes also control style length by regulating the transition from cell division to endoreduplication. The expression of these HD-Zip IV genes and their downstream gene, Style 2.1 , was sequentially modified to shape the cleistogamy morphology during tomato evolution and domestication. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of cleistogamy in modern tomato and suggest targets for improving fruit set and preventing pollen contamination in genetically modified crops.},

  abstract     = {Carbons bonded to four other carbons pose a particular challenge to synthetic chemists. Routes to their preparation often involve multiple manipulations, as well as successive oxidations and reductions, to crowd the substituents together in the requisite tight space. Gan et al . now report a direct approach to such quaternary carbons that couples readily available, comparatively simple reagents. Specifically, an iron catalyst and a reductant link olefins with redox-active esters by generating and then combining radical intermediates. —Jake S. Yeston The synthesis of quaternary carbons often requires numerous steps and complex conditions or harsh reagents that act on heavily engineered substrates. This is largely a consequence of conventional polar-bond retrosynthetic disconnections that in turn require multiple functional group interconversions, redox manipulations, and protecting group chemistry. Here, we report a simple catalyst and reductant combination that converts two types of feedstock chemicals, carboxylic acids and olefins, into tetrasubstituted carbons through quaternization of radical intermediates. An iron porphyrin catalyst activates each substrate by electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer, and then combines the fragments using a bimolecular homolytic substitution (S H 2) reaction. This cross-coupling reduces the synthetic burden to procure numerous quaternary carbon–­­containing products from simple chemical feedstocks.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in protein design have benefited greatly from machine learning but usually do not consider the physics and chemistry of protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. Such methods can generate many potential structures but typically require considerable screening, validation, and optimization. Using a method that considers local structure of interacting chemical groups, Lu et al . focused on developing a smaller number of protein designs for binding polar drug molecules. They screened three top-scoring designs and identified one that bound to the desired small molecule with subnanomolar affinity even without laborious optimization. Experimental validation and computational work confirmed the design accuracy and revealed a correlation between predicted and observed binding affinities for related drug molecules. These results offer a promising approach for the design of high-affinity drug-binding proteins. —Michael A. Funk The de novo design of small molecule–binding proteins has seen exciting recent progress; however, high-affinity binding and tunable specificity typically require laborious screening and optimization after computational design. We developed a computational procedure to design a protein that recognizes a common pharmacophore in a series of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 inhibitors. One of three designed proteins bound different inhibitors with affinities ranging from &lt;5 nM to low micromolar. X-ray crystal structures confirmed the accuracy of the designed protein-drug interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations informed the role of water in binding. Binding free energy calculations performed directly on the designed models were in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured affinities. We conclude that de novo design of high-affinity small molecule–binding proteins with tuned interaction energies is feasible entirely from computation.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial pathogens are host to several viruses known as bacteriophages, which often endow their hosts with virulence effectors. Uppalapati et al . discovered one phage in the mammalian macrophage parasite Salmonella enterica called Gifsy-1 that unexpectedly halts translation and growth of its bacterial host. The terminase of this phage is a DNA-degrading enzyme that chops up concatemer DNA into phage-sized pieces for packaging into virions. The terminase is redox sensitive and switches to degrading transfer RNAs (tRNAs) when the host immune cell generates a respiratory burst of reactive oxygen species. The resulting tRNA fragmentation compromises translation. Although bacterial growth may stop, tRNA recycling is promoted. A halt in translation may allow genome repair and integrity to be maintained during stress events, and the parasite thus ultimately promotes host survival. —Caroline Ash Phage viruses shape the evolution and virulence of their bacterial hosts. The Salmonella enterica genome encodes several stress-inducible prophages. The Gifsy-1 prophage terminase protein, whose canonical function is to process phage DNA for packaging in the virus head, unexpectedly acts as a transfer ribonuclease (tRNase) under oxidative stress, cleaving the anticodon loop of tRNA Leu . The ensuing RNA fragmentation compromises bacterial translation, intracellular survival, and recovery from oxidative stress in the vertebrate host. S. enterica adapts to this transfer RNA (tRNA) fragmentation by transcribing the RNA repair Rtc system. The counterintuitive translational arrest provided by tRNA cleavage may subvert prophage mobilization and give the host an opportunity for repair as a way of maintaining bacterial genome integrity and ultimately survival in animals.},

  abstract     = {Farms tend to be simplified ecosystems designed to efficiently produce one or a few crops or livestock. Strategies to diversify these systems by managing multiple species, incorporating areas of noncrop vegetation, or conserving soil or water have been posed as ways of countering the negative environmental effects of simplified agriculture such as biodiversity loss and pollution. Rasmussen et al . examined the effects of such practices on both environmental and social outcomes by harmonizing data from 24 studies in 11 countries. They found that implementing livestock diversification or soil conservation tended to create beneficial social and environmental outcomes, especially for biodiversity. Farms that implemented multiple diversification strategies had more win-win outcomes. —Bianca Lopez Agricultural simplification continues to expand at the expense of more diverse forms of agriculture. This simplification, for example, in the form of intensively managed monocultures, poses a risk to keeping the world within safe and just Earth system boundaries. Here, we estimated how agricultural diversification simultaneously affects social and environmental outcomes. Drawing from 24 studies in 11 countries across 2655 farms, we show how five diversification strategies focusing on livestock, crops, soils, noncrop plantings, and water conservation benefit social (e.g., human well-being, yields, and food security) and environmental (e.g., biodiversity, ecosystem services, and reduced environmental externalities) outcomes. We found that applying multiple diversification strategies creates more positive outcomes than individual management strategies alone. To realize these benefits, well-designed policies are needed to incentivize the adoption of multiple diversification strategies in unison.},

The traps help to prevent scattering but also release holes at higher temperatures to maintain a constant carrier capacity. The result is a thermoelectric material with very attractive efficiency across midrange temperatures. —Brent Grocholski Thermoelectric materials can realize direct and mutual conversion between electricity and heat.

We demonstrate a case in which both pseudo-nanostructures of vacancy clusters and dynamic charge-carrier regulation of trapped-hole release have been achieved in p-type lead telluride–based materials, enabling the simultaneous regulations of phonon and charge carrier transports. We realized a peak zT value up to 2.8 at 850 kelvin and an average zT value of 1.65 at 300 to 850 kelvin. We also achieved an energy conversion efficiency of ~15.5% at a temperature difference of 554 kelvin in a segmented module.

  abstract     = {Asthma, a very common airway disorder, is generally understood to be a condition of excessive inflammation in which environmental triggers stimulate immune responses in the lungs, resulting in bronchoconstriction. The mainstays of asthma therapy are albuterol, which is a short-acting bronchodilator for immediate relief of symptoms, and corticosteroids to treat the underlying inflammation. Unfortunately, this approach is not always effective even in combination. Bagley et al . have demonstrated that bronchoconstriction-induced mechanical damage to the airways and extrusion of epithelial cells also contribute to asthma pathology and may interfere with healing (see the Perspective by Drazen and Fredberg). By contrast, compounds that counteracted this mechanical damage showed beneficial effects in mouse models, either alone or combined with albuterol, although their safety in humans remains to be assessed. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Asthma is deemed an inflammatory disease, yet the defining diagnostic feature is mechanical bronchoconstriction. We previously discovered a conserved process called cell extrusion that drives homeostatic epithelial cell death when cells become too crowded. In this work, we show that the pathological crowding of a bronchoconstrictive attack causes so much epithelial cell extrusion that it damages the airways, resulting in inflammation and mucus secretion in both mice and humans. Although relaxing the airways with the rescue treatment albuterol did not affect these responses, inhibiting live cell extrusion signaling during bronchoconstriction prevented all these features. Our findings show that bronchoconstriction causes epithelial damage and inflammation by excess crowding-induced cell extrusion and suggest that blocking epithelial extrusion, instead of the ensuing downstream inflammation, could prevent the feed-forward asthma inflammatory cycle.},

These long-lived RNAs were stably retained in nuclei in a neural cell type–specific manner and were required for the maintenance of heterochromatin.

Rosenberg et al . studied magnetization dynamics in a chain of 46 superconducting qubits simulating the one-dimensional Heisenberg model. The mean and variance of the magnetization transferred across the center of the chain followed the scaling expected from the conjectured Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. However, going to higher moments revealed deviations from the KPZ conjecture, indicating that a fuller theoretical picture is needed to describe the dynamics. —Jelena Stajic Understanding universal aspects of quantum dynamics is an unresolved problem in statistical mechanics. In particular, the spin dynamics of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model were conjectured as to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class based on the scaling of the infinite-temperature spin-spin correlation function. In a chain of 46 superconducting qubits, we studied the probability distribution of the magnetization transferred across the chain’s center, P M . The first two moments of P M show superdiffusive behavior, a hallmark of KPZ universality. However, the third and fourth moments ruled out the KPZ conjecture and allow for evaluating other theories.

Reinforcement learning (RL) agents that plan over a long time horizon far more effectively than humans present particular risks. Giving an advanced AI system the objective to maximize its reward and, at some point, withholding reward from it, strongly incentivizes the AI system to take humans out of the loop, if it has the opportunity. The incentive to deceive humans and thwart human control arises not only for RL agents but for long-term planning agents (LTPAs) more generally. Because empirical testing of sufficiently capable LTPAs is unlikely to uncover these dangerous tendencies, our core regulatory proposal is simple: Developers should not be permitted to build sufficiently capable LTPAs, and the resources required to build them should be subject to stringent controls.},

Pollutants include gases [for example, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), NO x , and ozone] and particulate matter, which is commonly characterized by its aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM 2.5 ) or less than 10 μm (PM 10 ). Air pollutants are mainly emitted by energy production, industry, traffic, heating, and agriculture. Exposure to air pollution affects most organ systems, causing a wide array of physiological changes, organ dysfunction, and manifest clinical disease ( 1 , 2 ). Therefore, a burden of disease assessment that adequately reflects all related exposure-outcome relationships and their impacts on disease and mortality in the target population is important to guide population-based prevention.},

  abstract     = {RNA has come a long way from a simple “messenger” or “translator” of canonical genic information during the production of proteins. A plethora of new types of noncoding RNAs have been discovered, including thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which have no identified functions ( 1 , 2 ). Throughout this “RNA revolution,” one property of RNA has been thought to be constant: RNAs are short-lived molecules that turn over, unlike DNA, which is much more stable. On page 53 of this issue, Zocher et al . ( 3 ) challenge that paradigm by showing that newly synthesized RNA labeled with 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) in early postnatal mice was still present in many brain cells 2 years later. The complex pattern of when and which cells are labeled suggests that EU that is incorporated into RNA in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) frequently remains in adult neurons. This suggests that a diversity of long and repeat-rich RNAs, collectively called long-lived RNAs (LL-RNAs), can be stable fixtures in postmitotic and quiescent neural cells.},

  abstract     = {Reports of what were known at that time as “asthmatic fits” can be traced back millennia ( 1 , 2 ), but a mechanistic understanding of the basis for what are now called asthma exacerbations remains incomplete. Over the past 100 years, multiple mechanisms have been proposed, including constriction of the smooth muscle that encircles the airways (bronchoconstriction), persistent airway inflammation, and disruption of the epithelial layer that lines the airways. Yet how these processes interconnect and contribute to asthma exacerbations has been debated. On page 66 of this issue, Bagley et al. ( 3 ) show that bronchoconstriction results in pathological overcrowding of cells in the airway epithelium, squeezing out (extruding) epithelial cells and thus damaging the epithelial layer enough to trigger inflammation. They also show that drugs that block the extrusion pathway, and thereby prevent mechanical damage to the epithelium during acute airway narrowing, may have the capacity to break the inflammatory cycle and potentially revolutionize how asthma is treated.},

They create vast opportunities, ranging from monitoring physiological signals ( 2 , 3 ) and daily physical interactions ( 4 , 5 ) to powering smart-home devices ( 6 ). Challenges to achieving such materials include incorporating softness, flexibility, and breathability without losing desired functionality. However, present wireless modules, microprocessors, and analog-to-digital converters rely on intrinsically rigid integrated circuit chips ( 7 ) that consume high power and hinder coherent incorporation into soft fibers and textiles. On page 74 of this issue, Yang et al . ( 8 ) report a chipless fiber for wireless visual-to-digital transmission that senses interactions with the human body. The fibers can be woven into wearable fabric and could transform how people interact with the environment and with each other.},

Using single-molecule imaging, Cameron et al . demonstrated that cohesins are pushed along DNA by the replication machinery (replisome) until they converge with another replisome. Whereas replisomes disassemble upon fork convergence during DNA replication termination, cohesins persist, establishing cohesion at replication termination sites. Disrupting replisome disassembly after fork convergence in living cells hinders cohesion, emphasizing a crucial link between sister chromatid cohesion and the termination of DNA replication. —Di Jiang Newly copied sister chromatids are tethered together by the cohesin complex, but how sister chromatid cohesion coordinates with DNA replication is poorly understood. Prevailing models suggest that cohesin complexes, bound to DNA before replication, remain behind the advancing replication fork to keep sister chromatids together. By visualizing single replication forks colliding with preloaded cohesin complexes, we find that the replisome instead pushes cohesin to where a converging replisome is met. Whereas the converging replisomes are removed during DNA replication termination, cohesin remains on nascent DNA and provides cohesion. Additionally, we show that CMG (CDC45–MCM2-7–GINS) helicase disassembly during replication termination is vital for proper cohesion in budding yeast. Together, our results support a model wherein sister chromatid cohesion is established during DNA replication termination.},

  abstract     = {We know that the gut microbiota can metabolize a range of drugs into unexpected—and sometimes harmful—entities. Several drugs also have unintended antimicrobial effects even though they are not intended for use as antibiotics. Noto Guillen et al . screened a range of drugs for antimicrobial activity in a library of barcoded Escherichia coli bacteria with single-gene deletions. The mode of action of antibiotics clustered by expected mechanisms in this analysis, but the non-antibiotics tended to target divergent bacterial pathways. The authors’ network analysis not only identified the source of side effects with the long-term administration of some drugs, but also revealed possibilities for identifying unanticipated targets for new antibiotics, including a bacterial translation initiation factor. Further, examination of efflux systems showed how some nonantibiotics, such as psychotropic agents, might select for unintended antibiotic resistance. —Caroline Ash Numerous nonantibiotic drugs have potent antibacterial activity and can adversely affect the human microbiome. The mechanistic underpinning of this toxicity remains largely unknown. We investigated the antibacterial activity of 200 drugs using genetic screens with thousands of barcoded Escherichia coli knockouts. We analyzed 2 million gene-drug interactions underlying drug-specific toxicity. Network-based analysis of drug-drug similarities revealed that antibiotics clustered into modules that are consistent with the mode of action of their established classes, whereas nonantibiotics remained unconnected. Half of the nonantibiotics clustered into separate modules, potentially revealing shared and unexploited targets for new antimicrobials. Analysis of efflux systems revealed that they widely affect antibiotics and nonantibiotics alike, suggesting that the impact of nonantibiotics on antibiotic cross-resistance should be investigated closely in vivo.},

  abstract     = {In industrialized countries, tuberculosis control in cattle is routinely done by test-and-slaughter, but for most of the world, this strategy is unacceptable. As the dairy industry develops in low- and middle-come countries, there is a risk of uncontrolled bovine tuberculosis and a risk of cross-infections with humans. Fromsa et al . exploited developments in diagnostic tests that distinguish vaccinated from naturally infected animals to measure the effectiveness of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination (see the Perspective by Michel). BCG does not fully prevent infection, and its effectiveness is contested in cattle and humans. A mechanistic transmission model calibrated using estimates of the within-herd reproduction rate and empirical cattle movement data from four regions of Ethiopia showed that a 1-year end point efficacy of 24% could be achieved. Although not eliminating disease, BCG vaccination could potentially reduce transmission of bovine tuberculosis by 89% over ensuing decades of consistent vaccination. —Caroline Ash Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a routinely used vaccine for protecting children against Mycobacterium tuberculosis that comprises attenuated Mycobacterium bovis . BCG can also be used to protect livestock against M. bovis ; however, its effectiveness has not been quantified for this use. We performed a natural transmission experiment to directly estimate the rate of transmission to and from vaccinated and unvaccinated calves over a 1-year exposure period. The results show a higher indirect efficacy of BCG to reduce transmission from vaccinated animals that subsequently become infected [74%; 95% credible interval (CrI): 46 to 98%] compared with direct protection against infection (58%; 95% CrI: 34 to 73%) and an estimated total efficacy of 89% (95% CrI: 74 to 96%). A mechanistic transmission model of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) spread within the Ethiopian dairy sector was developed and showed how the prospects for elimination may be enabled by routine BCG vaccination of cattle.},

Assembly and regulation are essential for proper targeting and processive movement. Singh et al . determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of the dynein-dynactin molecular motor complex bound to the regulatory protein LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor protein JIP3. The latter appears as an unusually short coiled coil that scaffolds assembly of dynein-dynactin through its interactions. LIS1 interacts with the dynein motor through a WD40 domain, stabilizing the pre-powerstroke state, and also contacts the dynactin p150 arm to facilitate adaptor binding. This work reveals the essential role of LIS1 in orchestrating assembly of a massive molecular machine. —Michael A. Funk Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule motor vital for cellular organization and division. It functions as a ~4-megadalton complex containing its cofactor dynactin and a cargo-specific coiled-coil adaptor. However, how dynein and dynactin recognize diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) protein (LIS1) remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. This structure reveals the molecular basis of interactions occurring during dynein activation. We show how JIP3 activates dynein despite its atypical architecture. Unexpectedly, LIS1 binds dynactin’s p150 subunit, tethering it along the length of dynein. Our data suggest that LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.},

We quantified emissions at hundreds of large landfills across 18 states in the United States between 2016 and 2022 using airborne imaging spectrometers. Spanning 20% of open United States landfills, this represents the most systematic measurement-based study of methane point sources of the waste sector. We detected significant point source emissions at a majority (52%) of these sites, many with emissions persisting over multiple revisits (weeks to years). We compared these against independent contemporaneous in situ airborne observations at 15 landfills and established good agreement.

Sahu et al . now report that pyrimidines influence the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, a key intermediary enzyme between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiration. Depletion of pyrimidines led to loss of thiamine pyrophosphate (a required cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase), apparently because the pyrimidine UTP rather than ATP functions as a preferred substrate for TPK1, the enzyme that produces thiamine pyrophosphate. The authors propose that cellular abundance of pyrimidines may thus influence tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and respiration and thereby affect processes such as adipocyte differentiation through the regulation of lipogenesis. —L. Bryan Ray Cellular purines, particularly adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), fuel many metabolic reactions, but less is known about the direct effects of pyrimidines on cellular metabolism. We found that pyrimidines, but not purines, maintain pyruvate oxidation and the tricarboxylic citric acid (TCA) cycle by regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. PDH activity requires sufficient substrates and cofactors, including thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Depletion of cellular pyrimidines decreased TPP synthesis, a reaction carried out by TPP kinase 1 (TPK1), which reportedly uses ATP to phosphorylate thiamine (vitamin B1). We found that uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP) acts as the preferred substrate for TPK1, enabling cellular TPP synthesis, PDH activity, TCA-cycle activity, lipogenesis, and adipocyte differentiation. Thus, UTP is required for vitamin B1 utilization to maintain pyruvate oxidation and lipogenesis.},

Simultaneously recording large numbers of neurons from the hippocampus, Yang et al . found that their population activity differentiated not only the position of the animal in a maze but also the exact trial number in a memory task. After some trials, sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) occurred during reward consummation. The spike content of these SPW-Rs replayed the population activity during the maze run on that trial. Later, SPW-Rs occurred during non–rapid eye movement sleep, and these sleep SPW-Rs replayed mainly the sequences that were tagged by the waking SPW-Rs in the maze. This is a candidate tagging mechanism that determines which waking experience(s) will undergo long-term consolidation. —Peter Stern Experiences need to be tagged during learning for further consolidation. However, neurophysiological mechanisms that select experiences for lasting memory are not known. By combining large-scale neural recordings in mice with dimensionality reduction techniques, we observed that successive maze traversals were tracked by continuously drifting populations of neurons, providing neuronal signatures of both places visited and events encountered. When the brain state changed during reward consumption, sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) occurred on some trials, and their specific spike content decoded the trial blocks that surrounded them. During postexperience sleep, SPW-Rs continued to replay those trial blocks that were reactivated most frequently during waking SPW-Rs. Replay content of awake SPW-Rs may thus provide a neurophysiological tagging mechanism to select aspects of experience that are preserved and consolidated for future use.},

Using an intense pulsed standing wave, Lin et al . added a temporal dimension when probing the evolution of a photoelectron wavepacket. Such phase sensitivity of the demonstrated dynamical Kapitza-Dirac effect should provide a valuable tool for ultrafast electron spectroscopy studies. —Ian S. Osborne Similar to the optical diffraction of light passing through a material grating, the Kapitza-Dirac effect occurs when an electron is diffracted by a standing light wave. In its original description, the effect is time independent. Here, we extended the Kapitza-Dirac effect to the time domain. By tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of a pulsed electron wave packet diffracted by a 60-femtosecond (where one femtosecond = 10 −15 seconds) standing wave pulse in a pump-probe scheme, we observed time-dependent diffraction patterns. The fringe spacing in the observed pattern differs from that generated by the conventional Kapitza-Dirac effect. By exploiting this time-resolved diffraction scheme, we can access the time evolution of the phase properties of a free electron and potentially image ionic potentials and electronic decoherences.},

The presented mechanism provides a backpropagation-free approach for feature learning in various machine learning models, including those that previously had no such capabilities. —Yury Suleymanov Understanding how neural networks learn features, or relevant patterns in data, for prediction is necessary for their reliable use in technological and scientific applications. In this work, we presented a unifying mathematical mechanism, known as average gradient outer product (AGOP), that characterized feature learning in neural networks. We provided empirical evidence that AGOP captured features learned by various neural network architectures, including transformer-based language models, convolutional networks, multilayer perceptrons, and recurrent neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrated that AGOP, which is backpropagation-free, enabled feature learning in machine learning models, such as kernel machines, that a priori could not identify task-specific features. Overall, we established a fundamental mechanism that captured feature learning in neural networks and enabled feature learning in general machine learning models.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogels are typically composed of cross-linked networks of polymers that are highly swollen with water. Depending on the specific architecture, they may be able to undergo a large degree of stretching, although usually only in one direction. Chen et al . developed a polyelectrolyte hydrogel that will form a “pearl necklace” structure in the relaxed state. The pearl regions, which form between cross-links, contain a reservoir of chain segments that can uncoil when the polymer is stretched. This structure allows the hydrogels to be reversibly biaxially stretched to a large areal strain and to heal from mechanical damage. —Marc S. Lavine Hyperelastic materials exhibit a nonlinear elastic response to large strains, whereas hydrogels typically possess a low elastic range due to the nonuniform cross-linking and limited chain segments among cross-links. We developed a hyperelastic hydrogel that possesses a broader elastic range by introducing a reversible pearl-necklace structure, in which beads are connected by strings. The subnanometric beads can efficiently unfold and refold under cyclic mechanical strains; thus, the hydrogel can rapidly recover after being stretched to an areal strain of more than 10,000%. Additionally, the hydrogel can quickly heal from minor mechanical damages such as needle punctures and cuts. These advancements make our ionic hydrogels ideal for multifunctional pneumatic gripper materials; they simultaneously offer an ultralarge gripping range, self-sensing capabilities, and fast healing abilities.},

  abstract     = {The defensive alkaloid gramine in barley and other grasses is important for chemical defense against insects, but it makes grasses less palatable to ruminants. One important goal for breeders is to arrive at a balance where both the protective and the palatability features of grasses are maintained through targeted gramine engineering. Dias et al . used pan-genome sequencing of barley to identify a cluster of two genes for gramine biosynthesis and characterized an enzyme that carries out a cryptic oxidative rearrangement of tryptophan. The authors were able to modulate gramine levels in yeast, model plants, and barley varieties, thus demonstrating the potential for integrating synthetic biology and genetic engineering aimed at targeted optimization of gramine-linked traits. —Ankit Walia The defensive alkaloid gramine not only protects barley and other grasses from insects but also negatively affects their palatability to ruminants. The key gene for gramine formation has remained elusive, hampering breeding initiatives. In this work, we report that a gene encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP76M57, which we name AMI synthase (AMIS), enables the production of gramine in Nicotiana benthamiana , Arabidopsis thaliana , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We reconstituted gramine production in the gramine-free barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) variety Golden Promise and eliminated it from cultivar Tafeno by Cas-mediated gene editing. In vitro experiments unraveled that an unexpected cryptic oxidative rearrangement underlies this noncanonical conversion of an amino acid to a chain-shortened biogenic amine. The discovery of the genetic basis of gramine formation now permits tailor-made optimization of gramine-linked traits in barley by plant breeding.},

  abstract     = {Conditions that cause mitotic delays are likely to contribute to genomic instability. Meitinger et al . propose a mechanism by which cells can detect an abnormally long mitosis and transmit that information to daughter cells, which then arrest proliferation in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle (see the Perspective by Bertolin and Gottifredi). In cells with delayed mitosis, the authors detected the formation of a protein complex containing p53-binding protein 1 and ubiquitin-specific protease 28, the amount of which depended on the extent of the delay. The complexes were stably transmitted to daughter cells. Better understanding of this mechanism, which may be important in preventing the spread of cancerous cells, could enhance cancer detection and therapy. —L. Bryan Ray Mitotic duration is tightly constrained, and extended mitosis is characteristic of problematic cells prone to chromosome missegregation and genomic instability. We show here that mitotic extension leads to the formation of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)–ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28)–p53 protein complexes that are transmitted to, and stably retained by, daughter cells. Complexes assembled through a Polo-like kinase 1–dependent mechanism during extended mitosis and elicited a p53 response in G 1 that prevented the proliferation of the progeny of cells that experienced an approximately threefold extended mitosis or successive less extended mitoses. The ability to monitor mitotic extension was lost in p53-mutant cancers and some p53–wild-type (p53-WT) cancers, consistent with classification of TP53BP1 and USP28 as tumor suppressors. Cancers retaining the ability to monitor mitotic extension exhibited sensitivity to antimitotic agents.},

Drugs targeting the main protease, M pro , are now being used clinically, but alternatives are necessary to address drug resistance and interactions. There has been less success so far targeting the papain-like protease PL pro . Tan et al . used a structure-guided design based on several previously developed leads to generate a series of noncovalent PL pro inhibitors that take advantage of the particular surface features of the protease active site. They confirmed a distinct binding mode for their inhibitors and demonstrated promising efficacy in a mouse infection model. —Michael A. Funk The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and drug-resistant mutants calls for additional oral antivirals. The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL pro ) is a promising but challenging drug target. We designed and synthesized 85 noncovalent PL pro inhibitors that bind to a recently discovered ubiquitin binding site and the known BL2 groove pocket near the S4 subsite. Leads inhibited PL pro with the inhibitory constant K i values from 13.2 to 88.2 nanomolar. The co-crystal structures of PL pro with eight leads revealed their interaction modes. The in vivo lead Jun12682 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including nirmatrelvir-resistant strains with EC 50 from 0.44 to 2.02 micromolar. Oral treatment with Jun12682 improved survival and reduced lung viral loads and lesions in a SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, suggesting that PL pro inhibitors are promising oral SARS-CoV-2 antiviral candidates.},

These requirements make piezoelectric materials attractive for their design because they convert mechanical force into electricity and vice versa ( 1 ). However, traditional piezoelectrics such as lead zirconate titanate are permanent, rather than transient, in nature ( 2 , 3 ). Although biodegradable piezoelectrics—such as those including amino acids, collagen, and chitin constituents—have the desired properties for implantation and are immune to infection and inflammation risks ( 4 ), they suffer from weak piezoelectric performance ( 5 ). On page 1492 of this issue, Zhang et al . ( 6 ) report a simple ferroelectric molecular crystal that exhibits piezoelectricity performance that is more than 13 times greater than that of amino acid–based piezoelectric materials ( 7 ). When composited with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), the material demonstrates high flexibility and biodegradation and biosafety in physiological environments.

  abstract     = {Mitosis is a challenging time for cells owing to the potential for structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities, termed chromosomal instability, which is a hallmark of cancer ( 1 ). In M phase, chromosomal instability is prevented by the spindle assembly checkpoint, which delays cell cycle progression until chromosomes are properly attached to spindle microtubules, ensuring proper separation into daughter cells ( 2 ). Recently, another M phase checkpoint was described: If a threshold mitotic duration is surpassed, proliferation of daughter cells is arrested in a manner that requires the tumor suppressor p53, the cell cycle inhibitor p21, ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28), and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) ( 3 – 6 ). On page 1441 of this issue, Meitinger et al . ( 7 ) clarify how this process works, with extended mitosis leading to the assembly of a USP28-53BP1-p53 complex—the “mitotic stopwatch”—which mediates daughter cell arrest and may prevent cancer development.},

  abstract     = {Freshwater ecosystems, such as lakes and rivers, have been deteriorating in many places worldwide ( 1 ). Growing research suggests that many aspects of freshwater health—that is, the maintenance of chemical, physical, and biological integrity—may depend on the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) ( 2 ). DOM consists of thousands of distinct organic compounds that mainly originate from different plant and animal remains. The resulting variety of compounds in DOM has been called chemodiversity to mirror the term biodiversity. Whereas past research tested how the environment shapes the chemodiversity of DOM ( 3 , 4 ), a new research frontier is understanding how healthy ecosystems may depend on chemodiversity so as to monitor and reverse declines in freshwater health.},

Although speech itself is uniquely human, vocal learning, the ability to modify vocal output as a result of experience, has evolved independently in multiple mammals, including many bats. Wirthlin et al . combined experiments in the bat brain with an artificial intelligence–based analysis of more than 200 genomes and found hundreds of genomic regions that are associated with vocal learning. Their results implicate networks of genes related to human autism. —Di Jiang Vocal production learning (“vocal learning”) is a convergently evolved trait in vertebrates. To identify brain genomic elements associated with mammalian vocal learning, we integrated genomic, anatomical, and neurophysiological data from the Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) with analyses of the genomes of 215 placental mammals. First, we identified a set of proteins evolving more slowly in vocal learners. Then, we discovered a vocal motor cortical region in the Egyptian fruit bat, an emergent vocal learner, and leveraged that knowledge to identify active cis-regulatory elements in the motor cortex of vocal learners. Machine learning methods applied to motor cortex open chromatin revealed 50 enhancers robustly associated with vocal learning whose activity tended to be lower in vocal learners. Our research implicates convergent losses of motor cortex regulatory elements in mammalian vocal learning evolution.},

Male and female sexes in brown algae are determined by the presence of a V (male) or a U (female) sex chromosome, but the genes determining sex determination remain elusive. Luthringer et al . reported an HMG-box gene, MIN , as being the master regulator of male sex determination in brown algae. A combination of genome mining, gene expression profiling, and functional characterization using deletion lines revealed notable phenotype changes. Deletion of the homologous gene in kelp (another group of brown algae) showed similar phenotypes, indicating conservation of sex determination by MIN . HMG-box genes have been found to represent sex determination factors in animals. These findings in brown algae indicate a striking evolutionary conservation maintained through more than a billion years of evolution. —Ankit Walia In many eukaryotes, genetic sex determination is not governed by XX/XY or ZW/ZZ systems but by a specialized region on the poorly studied U (female) or V (male) sex chromosomes. Previous studies have hinted at the existence of a dominant male-sex factor on the V chromosome in brown algae, a group of multicellular eukaryotes distantly related to animals and plants. The nature of this factor has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that an HMG-box gene acts as the male-determining factor in brown algae, mirroring the role HMG-box genes play in sex determination in animals. Over a billion-year evolutionary timeline, these lineages have independently co-opted the HMG box for male determination, representing a paradigm for evolution’s ability to recurrently use the same genetic “toolkit” to accomplish similar tasks.},

Ying et al . found an alternative role for ABCB19 as a transporter of another hormone group, brassinosteroids. The authors determined the cryoelectron microscopy structure and found a hydrophobic pocket where brassinolides can bind. They also demonstrated that brassinosteroids triggered ABCB19 ATP hydrolase activity and that mutating specific amino acids in the ABCB19 protein disrupted brassinosteroid transport. The work challenges the auxin-focused view of ABCB19 function and provides an explanation for how brassinosteroids might be exported out of cells to the site of their perception. —Madeleine Seale Brassinosteroids are steroidal phytohormones that regulate plant development and physiology, including adaptation to environmental stresses. Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior but bind receptors at the cell surface, necessitating a yet to be identified export mechanism. Here, we show that a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, ABCB19, functions as a brassinosteroid exporter. We present its structure in both the substrate-unbound and the brassinosteroid-bound states. Bioactive brassinosteroids are potent activators of ABCB19 ATP hydrolysis activity, and transport assays showed that ABCB19 transports brassinosteroids. In Arabidopsis thaliana , ABCB19 and its close homolog, ABCB1, positively regulate brassinosteroid responses. Our results uncover an elusive export mechanism for bioactive brassinosteroids that is tightly coordinated with brassinosteroid signaling.},

Using insights from evolutionary analysis, two independent groups now show that the cumbersome enzyme complexes that produce these molecules can be pieced together to create new products on demand—if one knows the right spot for joining the pieces. Working with nonribosomal peptide synthetases, Bozhüyük et al . developed an approach called XUT (“exchange unit between T domains”) and demonstrated the production of a proteasome inhibitor by an enzyme complex containing fragments of five separate systems. Mabesoone et al . worked with polyketide synthases, demonstrating facile deletion and insertion of conceptually similar exchange units, producing a large number of related polyketide products with diverse modifications. These approaches are an important step forward for rational engineering of large enzyme complexes for small-molecule drug discovery and production. —Michael A.

In this work, we describe a detailed phylogenetic analysis of several bacterial NRPSs that led to the identification of yet undescribed recombination sites within the thiolation (T) domain that can be used for NRPS engineering. We then developed an evolution-inspired “eXchange Unit between T domains” (XUT) approach, which allows the assembly of NRPS fragments over a broad range of GC contents, protein similarities, and extender unit specificities, as demonstrated for the specific production of a proteasome inhibitor designed and assembled from five different NRPS fragments.},

However, less is known about the effects of organic fields on surrounding farms and thus the net impact of organic agriculture. Organic fields may harbor larger pest populations or, alternately, organisms that naturally control pests, leading to potential spillover of organisms to neighboring fields. Using pesticide application data from Kern County, California, Larsen et al . found that organic fields surrounded by more organic agriculture used pesticides less, whereas conventional fields surrounded by organic agriculture used them more (see the Perspective by Lichtenberg). Clustering organic fields could reduce pesticide use on both organic and conventional fields. —Bianca Lopez The environmental impacts of organic agriculture are only partially understood and whether such practices have spillover effects on pests or pest control activity in nearby fields remains unknown. Using about 14,000 field observations per year from 2013 to 2019 in Kern County, California, we postulate that organic crop producers benefit from surrounding organic fields decreasing overall pesticide use and, specifically, pesticides targeting insect pests. Conventional fields, by contrast, tend to increase pesticide use as the area of surrounding organic production increases. Our simulation suggests that spatially clustering organic cropland can entirely mitigate spillover effects that lead to an increase in net pesticide use.},

Both the magnitude of the force and its rate of increase, known as the loading rate, govern the structure of the molecular components and the stability of the bonds between them. The loading rate is also expected to play a pivotal role in the rigidity-sensing mechanism, which regulates various cellular behaviors including adhesion and differentiation. By developing a single-molecule tension sensor based on DNA overstretching, Jo et al . measured the loading rate of single-molecule forces in living cells. —Stella M. Hurtley Cells connect with their environment through surface receptors and use physical tension in receptor–ligand bonds for various cellular processes. Single-molecule techniques have revealed bond strength by measuring “rupture force,” but it has long been recognized that rupture force is dependent on loading rate—how quickly force is ramped up. Thus, the physiological loading rate needs to be measured to reveal the mechanical strength of individual bonds in their functional context. We have developed an overstretching tension sensor (OTS) to allow more accurate force measurement in physiological conditions with single-molecule detection sensitivity even in mechanically active regions. We used serially connected OTSs to show that the integrin loading rate ranged from 0.5 to 4 piconewtons per second and was about three times higher in leukocytes than in epithelial cells.},

Rossi et al . studied three species of Heliconius butterflies that overlap geographically but display differences in both wing coloration and mate preference (see the Perspective by Briscoe). They identified a genomic region associated with males preferring red wing patterns that contains the gene regucalcin1 . Experimental follow-up demonstrated that this gene showed expression differences between red- and white-preferring species, and deletion of the gene altered male courting behavior, thus providing experimental evidence of a gene involved in mediating visual preference. —Corinne Simonti Visual preferences are important drivers of mate choice and sexual selection, but little is known of how they evolve at the genetic level. In this study, we took advantage of the diversity of bright warning patterns displayed by Heliconius butterflies, which are also used during mate choice. Combining behavioral, population genomic, and expression analyses, we show that two Heliconius species have evolved the same preferences for red patterns by exchanging genetic material through hybridization. Neural expression of regucalcin1 correlates with visual preference across populations, and disruption of regucalcin1 with CRISPR-Cas9 impairs courtship toward conspecific females, providing a direct link between gene and behavior. Our results support a role for hybridization during behavioral evolution and show how visually guided behaviors contributing to adaptation and speciation are encoded within the genome.},

  abstract     = {In the absence of molecular chirality or constraints caused by specific alignment at surfaces, nonchiral liquid crystals will display uniaxial alignment. Under confinement, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are known to show uniaxial polarization when confined between glass slides with controlled alignment. However, Kumari et al . now show that in the absence of anchoring constraints, these molecules will display a helicoidal structure. This arrangement is driven by the formation of domains with opposite sign that reduce the electrostatic energy more than the increase in elastic energy caused by the formation of domains and defect walls. The effect can be tuned through the addition of ions that reduce the electrostatic energy. —Marc S. Lavine Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are formed by achiral molecules with large dipole moments. Their three-dimensional orientational order is described as unidirectionally polar. We demonstrate that the ground state of a flat slab of a ferroelectric nematic unconstrained by externally imposed alignment directions is chiral, with left- and right-handed twists of polarization. Although the helicoidal deformations and defect walls that separate domains of opposite handedness increase the elastic energy, the twists reduce the electrostatic energy and become weaker when the material is doped with ions. This work shows that the polar orientational order of molecules could trigger chirality in soft matter with no chemically induced chiral centers.},

However, the process requires high temperature and pressure, and chemists continue to seek options for less demanding conditions. Zhang et al . report that suppressing magnetism in the catalyst may be a key to lower temperature operation (see the Perspective by Rupprechter). Combining theory and experiments, the authors showed that using lanthanum to quench the magnetic moment of adjacent cobalt centers enhances the cobalt’s catalytic activity for nitrogen cleavage well below the temperature where Haber iron catalysts operate. —Jake S. Yeston Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in developing catalysts to enable Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis under milder conditions than currently pertain. Rational catalyst design requires theoretical guidance and clear mechanistic understanding. Recently, a spin-mediated promotion mechanism was proposed to activate traditionally unreactive magnetic materials such as cobalt (Co) for ammonia synthesis by introducing hetero metal atoms bound to the active site of the catalyst surface. We combined theory and experiment to validate this promotion mechanism on a lanthanum (La)/Co system. By conducting model catalyst studies on Co single crystals and mass-selected Co nanoparticles at ambient pressure, we identified the active site for ammonia synthesis as the B 5 site of Co steps with La adsorption. The turnover frequency of 0.47 ± 0.03 per second achieved on the La/Co system at 350°C and 1 bar surpasses those of other model catalysts tested under identical conditions.},

Both alcohols react initially with a carbene at the oxygen, after which photoredox catalysis cleaves the C–O bonds to produce reactive radicals.

  abstract     = {Artificial chromosomes in bacteria and yeast have long served as the vehicles for synthetic biologists to use to write and rewrite genomes. Mammalian systems have been confined by limited chromosome tools. A quarter century after the first human artificial chromosomes (HACs) were developed, Gambogi et al . have developed a solution to the uncontrolled multimerization that accompanied prior versions (see the Perspective by Dawe). Their HAC is about 750 kilobases, much larger than prior HACs and sufficient to house the multidomain chromatin at the centromere required for inheritance through cell divisions. Along with streamlined cellular delivery methodologies, these developments provide the means to advance chromosome engineering in mammals and many other eukaryotes. —Di Jiang Large DNA assembly methodologies underlie milestone achievements in synthetic prokaryotic and budding yeast chromosomes. While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through ~125-base pair DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. We describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a ~750-kilobase construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells.},

  abstract     = {Liquid crystalline polymers can thread through covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and create nanofibril bridges that dissipate energy during fracture. Neumann et al . show that a molecularly woven COF stabilized by amide linkages was interpenetrated by polyimide, which was also chemically similar to this COF. However, polymethyl methacrylate, which is a brittle and amorphous polymer, only coated the COF particles and formed surface entanglements. The polyimide composite had greater fracture toughness and formed polyimide nanofibrils at the fracture surfaces. —Phil Szuromi The introduction of molecularly woven three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) crystals into polymers of varying types invokes different forms of contact between filler and polymer. Whereas the combination of woven COFs with amorphous and brittle polymethyl methacrylate results in surface interactions, the use of the liquid-crystalline polymer polyimide induces the formation of polymer-COF junctions. These junctions are generated by the threading of polymer chains through the pores of the nanocrystals, thus allowing for spatial arrangement of polymer strands. This offers a programmable pathway for unthreading polymer strands under stress and leads to the in situ formation of high-aspect-ratio nanofibrils, which dissipate energy during the fracture. Polymer-COF junctions also strengthen the filler-matrix interfaces and lower the percolation thresholds of the composites, enhancing strength, ductility, and toughness of the composites by adding small amounts (~1 weight %) of woven COF nanocrystals. The ability of the polymer strands to closely interact with the woven framework is highlighted as the main parameter to forming these junctions, thus affecting polymer chain penetration and conformation.},

One promising but experimentally challenging approach is to use an external reservoir to repeatedly remove excitations from the system under study, which effectively cools the system toward its correlated ground state. Mi et al . used this dissipative cooling method to prepare low-energy states of the transverse-field Ising model on a superconducting transmon quantum processor. Measuring long-range correlators of these states provided evidence of quantum correlations. —Jelena Stajic Engineered dissipative reservoirs have the potential to steer many-body quantum systems toward correlated steady states useful for quantum simulation of high-temperature superconductivity or quantum magnetism. Using up to 49 superconducting qubits, we prepared low-energy states of the transverse-field Ising model through coupling to dissipative auxiliary qubits. In one dimension, we observed long-range quantum correlations and a ground-state fidelity of 0.86 for 18 qubits at the critical point. In two dimensions, we found mutual information that extends beyond nearest neighbors. Lastly, by coupling the system to auxiliaries emulating reservoirs with different chemical potentials, we explored transport in the quantum Heisenberg model. Our results establish engineered dissipation as a scalable alternative to unitary evolution for preparing entangled many-body states on noisy quantum processors.},

Thermodynamic limits for propane dehydrogenation were exceeded by up to 40% with high selectivity by using membranes to remove the hydrogen by-product.

We also show that by introducing oxygen on the shell side of the catalyst-membrane system, we can couple the endothermic PDH reaction on the tube side with exothermic hydrogen oxidation on the shell side. This coupling results in higher rates of hydrogen transport, leading to further enhancements in the propane conversion as well as desired thermoneutral system operation.},

Stirling et al . identified a mechanism for the perception of the volatile compound (−)-germacrene D through a homolog of the Karrikin receptor KAI2 in petunia pistils. Genetic and biochemical experiments linked this perception with downstream signaling proteins and transcriptional targets. Perturbing the function of some of these components affected volatile-mediated communication and plant fitness. —Ankit Walia Plants are constantly exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are released during plant-plant communication, within-plant self-signaling, and plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, understanding VOC perception and downstream signaling is vital for unraveling the mechanisms behind information exchange in plants, which remain largely unexplored. Using the hormone-like function of volatile terpenoids in reproductive organ development as a system with a visual marker for communication, we demonstrate that a petunia karrikin-insensitive receptor, PhKAI2ia, stereospecifically perceives the (−)-germacrene D signal, triggering a KAI2-mediated signaling cascade and affecting plant fitness. This study uncovers the role(s) of the intermediate clade of KAI2 receptors, illuminates the involvement of a KAI2ia-dependent signaling pathway in volatile communication, and provides new insights into plant olfaction and the long-standing question about the nature of potential endogenous KAI2 ligand(s).},

  abstract     = {Many clinically used drugs are derived from natural microbial products that are assembled in a stepwise fashion by the condensation of amino acids or acyl groups. Using insights from evolutionary analysis, two independent groups now show that the cumbersome enzyme complexes that produce these molecules can be pieced together to create new products on demand—if one knows the right spot for joining the pieces. Working with nonribosomal peptide synthetases, Bozhüyük et al . developed an approach called XUT (“exchange unit between T domains”) and demonstrated the production of a proteasome inhibitor by an enzyme complex containing fragments of five separate systems. Mabesoone et al . worked with polyketide synthases, demonstrating facile deletion and insertion of conceptually similar exchange units, producing a large number of related polyketide products with diverse modifications. These approaches are an important step forward for rational engineering of large enzyme complexes for small-molecule drug discovery and production. —Michael A. Funk Bacterial multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are giant enzymes that generate a wide range of therapeutically important but synthetically challenging natural products. Diversification of polyketide structures can be achieved by engineering these enzymes. However, notwithstanding successes made with textbook cis -acyltransferase ( cis -AT) PKSs, tailoring such large assembly lines remains challenging. Unlike textbook PKSs, trans -AT PKSs feature an extraordinary diversity of PKS modules and commonly evolve to form hybrid PKSs. In this study, we analyzed amino acid coevolution to identify a common module site that yields functional PKSs. We used this site to insert and delete diverse PKS parts and create 22 engineered trans -AT PKSs from various pathways and in two bacterial producers. The high success rates of our engineering approach highlight the broader applicability to generate complex designer polyketides.},

  abstract     = {Owing to scientific advances, high-school and college science curricula in the US today barely resemble those of 50 years ago. Most science curricula are “modular”: Topics of emerging interest can be inserted as units, without major impact on the broader curriculum. Mathematics instruction, by contrast, is much the same as it was a half century ago—hierarchically organized and inflexible, with each building block taking up a semester or an entire year. Concerns persist around the role of such curricula in creating and perpetuating gaps in math education and subsequent opportunities and outcomes along racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines. These tensions lead to a false “equity versus excellence” dichotomy that has fueled recent flare-ups of decades-long “math wars” over curricula and instruction. We suggest that curricular modularity, by which all students can engage the same high-quality mathematics content together, can help resolve this false dichotomy.},

However, ammonia production requires high energy and is the source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the quest for more active ammonia synthesis catalysts, milder reaction conditions and less energy consumption are equally important, especially in times of climate change and a transition to sustainable energy ( 2 ). On page 1357 of this issue, Zhang et al. ( 3 ) report a promising catalyst that operates at atmospheric pressure and 350°C, and they also showcase how surface science, spectroscopy, and catalytic concepts merge to validate a catalyst that had been discovered earlier with computational catalysis ( 4 ).},

Early studies showed that when sequences from human centromeres were introduced along with a marker gene into cell lines, they formed stable artificial chromosomes ( 1 ). However, human artificial chromosomes (HACs) formed this way were often large concatenated (linked together) mixtures of the introduced DNA ( 1 – 3 ), reducing their usefulness for precision genome engineering. On page 1344 of this issue, Gambogi et al. ( 4 ) describe a substantially improved method that results in HACs that are small and structurally well defined. The work is likely to reinvigorate efforts to engineer artificial chromosomes in both animals and plants.},

Between geographical regions, a single species of Heliconius can have substantially different wing color patterns, while resembling local unrelated species. The speed with which these mimetic wing color patterns evolve can be accelerated if the butterflies’ mate preference coincides with the locally adapted wing color pattern (cue). Several genes involved in wing color pattern have been identified ( 2 ), but genes that underlie behavioral preferences ( 3 ), and the extent to which color pattern is genetically linked to mate preference in Heliconius, and animals in general, remain to be uncovered. On page 1368 of this issue, Rossi et al. ( 4 ) report the genetic basis for behavioral wing color preference in Heliconius butterflies.

  abstract     = {Filoviruses frequently emerge to cause terrifying outbreaks of often-fatal human disease. Treatment options so far have focused on monoclonal antibodies. Remdesivir is an adenosine analog that binds viral RNA polymerase to block replication by premature termination of RNA transcription. The drug has been successfully used intravenously for treating progressive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in humans. Cross et al . tested a related oral prodrug, obeldesivir (currently in phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment), in nonhuman primates for its therapeutic value against filoviruses (see the Perspective by Sprecher and Van Herp). When administered to the animals within 24 hours of virus exposure once daily for 10 days, the drug conferred complete protection against lethal infection with Sudan ebolavirus. Having an oral drug would be a major logistical advantage for use in the remote, resource-poor areas where filoviruses occur. —Caroline Ash Obeldesivir (ODV, GS-5245) is an orally administered prodrug of the parent nucleoside of remdesivir (RDV) and is presently in phase 3 trials for COVID-19 treatment. In this work, we show that ODV and its circulating parent nucleoside metabolite, GS-441524, have similar in vitro antiviral activity against filoviruses, including Marburg virus, Ebola virus, and Sudan virus (SUDV). We also report that once-daily oral ODV treatment of cynomolgus monkeys for 10 days beginning 24 hours after SUDV exposure confers 100% protection against lethal infection. Transcriptomics data show that ODV treatment delayed the onset of inflammation and correlated with antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. Our results offer promise for the further development of ODV to control outbreaks of filovirus disease more rapidly.},

  abstract     = {Degron tags enable rapid and tunable control of target protein levels using small molecules. The ability to develop tags with desirable properties could expand their use in research and biotechnology. Mercer et al . report a continuous evolution platform for generating high-affinity molecular glue complexes. Using this approach, the authors evolved a compact zinc-finger degron that engages the protein cereblon in the presence of thalidomide derivatives that avoid endogenous proteins, unlike the immunomodulatory drugs commonly used to trigger protein degradation. This work provides a compact orthogonal degron tag and a powerful system with which to engineer molecular glue interactions using diverse small molecules. —Di Jiang Conditional protein degradation tags (degrons) are usually &gt;100 amino acids long or are triggered by small molecules with substantial off-target effects, thwarting their use as specific modulators of endogenous protein levels. We developed a phage-assisted continuous evolution platform for molecular glue complexes (MG-PACE) and evolved a 36–amino acid zinc finger (ZF) degron (SD40) that binds the ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor cereblon in complex with PT-179, an orthogonal thalidomide derivative. Endogenous proteins tagged in-frame with SD40 using prime editing are degraded by otherwise inert PT-179. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of SD40 in complex with ligand-bound cereblon revealed mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of SD40’s activity and specificity. Our efforts establish a system for continuous evolution of molecular glue complexes and provide ZF tags that overcome shortcomings associated with existing degrons.},

  abstract     = {The guts of urbanized people worldwide are known to contain less microbial biodiversity than those of humans living rurally. The worry is that the loss of key species contributes to the increasing prevalence of poor metabolic health among urbanized people. By searching for key genes involved in cellulose degradation in metagenome-assembled genomes, Moraïs et al . discovered cellulolytic bacteria in humans. All candidate Ruminococcus species assembled active cellulosomes, enzyme complexes capable of degrading microcrystalline cellulose. Three species were distinguished with phylogenies indicating derivation from primate and ruminant hosts, and they showed specific host preferences and ongoing host adaptation. The occurrence of cellulolytic bacteria in humans reveals that a complicated process of dynamic co-evolution occurs in the gut and is possibly regulated by environment. —Caroline Ash Humans, like all mammals, depend on the gut microbiome for digestion of cellulose, the main component of plant fiber. However, evidence for cellulose fermentation in the human gut is scarce. We have identified ruminococcal species in the gut microbiota of human populations that assemble functional multienzymatic cellulosome structures capable of degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides. One of these species, which is strongly associated with humans, likely originated in the ruminant gut and was subsequently transferred to the human gut, potentially during domestication where it underwent diversification and diet-related adaptation through the acquisition of genes from other gut microbes. Collectively, these species are abundant and widespread among ancient humans, hunter-gatherers, and rural populations but are rare in populations from industrialized societies thus indicating potential disappearance in response to the westernized lifestyle.},

This Review highlights recent big data applications in three subdisciplines—hydrology, oceanography, and atmospheric science. We illustrate how big data relate to contemporary challenges in science: replicability and reproducibility and the transition from raw data to information products. Big data provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of Earth’s complex patterns and interactions.

  abstract     = {Some of Earth’s most biodiverse ecosystems are also its most stable over time, yet ecological theory predicts that communities become less stable when more species co-occur. The most commonly used models of species coexistence are derived from the Lotka-Volterra model, which assumes that populations follow logistic growth patterns and that self-regulation is required to allow multiple species to stably coexist. Hatton et al . show that an alternative model with sublinear population growth provides nearly identical predictions to generalized Lotka-Volterra models at the population level but very different predictions for communities. Under the sublinear model, diversity promotes stability. This model is consistent with published population time series and macroecological scaling relationships. —Bianca Lopez The worldwide loss of species diversity brings urgency to understanding how diverse ecosystems maintain stability. Whereas early ecological ideas and classic observations suggested that stability increases with diversity, ecological theory makes the opposite prediction, leading to the long-standing “diversity-stability debate.” Here, we show that this puzzle can be resolved if growth scales as a sublinear power law with biomass (exponent &lt;1), exhibiting a form of population self-regulation analogous to models of individual ontogeny. We show that competitive interactions among populations with sublinear growth do not lead to exclusion, as occurs with logistic growth, but instead promote stability at higher diversity. Our model realigns theory with classic observations and predicts large-scale macroecological patterns. However, it makes an unsettling prediction: Biodiversity loss may accelerate the destabilization of ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Traumatic events can lead to anxiety disorders often associated with generalized fear. When this occurs, context-associated fearful behavior generalizes to harmless situations, with adverse consequences on life quality and mental health. Li et al . investigated the mechanisms mediating fear generalization in mice using behavioral, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches (see the Perspective by Hen and Schacher). Fear generalization was found to be caused by a neurotransmitter switch in a subpopulation of serotoninergic neurons of the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe induced by modulation of the glucocorticoid receptor. Blocking this switch prevented fear generalization, suggesting that this mechanism could be targeted for preventing some of the deleterious consequences of acute stress. —Mattia Maroso Overgeneralization of fear to harmless situations is a core feature of anxiety disorders resulting from acute stress, yet the mechanisms by which fear becomes generalized are poorly understood. In this study, we show that generalized fear in mice results from a transmitter switch from glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in serotonergic neurons of the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe. Similar change in transmitter identity was found in the postmortem brains of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Overriding the transmitter switch in mice prevented the acquisition of generalized fear. Corticosterone release and activation of glucocorticoid receptors mediated the switch, and prompt antidepressant treatment blocked the cotransmitter switch and generalized fear. Our results provide important insight into the mechanisms involved in fear generalization.},

  abstract     = {Variation between individuals of a species is a requirement for evolution, and maintaining variation can allow for stability over time. Combining experiments and a mathematical model, Nell et al . showed that dispersal of both aphids and parasitoid wasps creates stable eco-evolutionary dynamics between them. Pea aphids rapidly evolve resistance to their specialist parasitoid, but resistance comes with reduced reproductive output. Even small levels of variability in parasitoid dispersal creates different selection pressure on aphids across space. Resistance is lost in scenarios where aphids can’t disperse, and homogenization occurs at high aphid dispersal. However, when dispersal is intermediate, aphids can move between high- and low-parasitism areas, maintaining genetic diversity and allowing both species to coexist over time. —Bianca Lopez When ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur on comparable timescales, persistence of the ensuing eco-evolutionary dynamics requires both ecological and evolutionary stability. This unites key questions in ecology and evolution: How do species coexist, and what maintains genetic variation in a population? In this work, we investigated a host-parasitoid system in which pea aphid hosts rapidly evolve resistance to Aphidius ervi parasitoids. Field data and mathematical simulations showed that heterogeneity in parasitoid dispersal can generate variation in parasitism-mediated selection on hosts through time and space. Experiments showed how evolutionary trade-offs plus moderate host dispersal across this selection mosaic cause host-parasitoid coexistence and maintenance of genetic variation in host resistance. Our results show how dispersal can stabilize both the ecological and evolutionary components of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

We used atomic-layer deposition to create an indium tin oxide substrate with a fully covalent hydroxyl-covered surface for SAM anchoring, as well as a SAM with a trimethoxysilane group that exhibited strong tridentate anchoring to the substrate.

It derives its properties from a branched rather than straight molecular structure, which requires an energy-intensive, high-pressure synthesis technique. Froese et al . report a distinct method to achieve long-chain branching under milder, solution-phase conditions. Their catalyst can assemble two chains at once, linked through the use of a small amount of diene mixed in with the ethylene, to create a ladder-like geometry. The resulting plastic has properties comparable to LDPE. —Jake S. Yeston In polyolefins, long-chain branching is introduced through an energy-intensive, high-pressure radical process to form low-density polyethylene (LDPE). In the current work, we demonstrated a ladder-like polyethylene architecture through solution polymerization of ethylene and less than 1 mole % of α,ω-dienes, using a dual-chain catalyst. The ladder-branching mechanism requires catalysts with two growing polymer chains on the same metal center, thus enchaining the diene without the requirement of a steady-state concentration of pendant vinyl groups. Molecular weight distributions lacking a high–molecular weight tail, distinctive Mark-Houwink signatures, nuclear magnetic resonance characterization, and shear and extensional rheology consistent with highly branched polyethylene architectures are described. This approach represents an industrially viable solution-polymerization process capable of producing controlled long-chain branched polyethylene with rheological properties comparable to those of LDPE or its blends with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).},

Liu et al . found that DNA replication forks are spatially coupled in human and murine cells, as evidenced by the dynamic chromatin interactions accompanying fork movement. This coupling arises from sister forks at the same origin or tightly associated chromatin loop anchors, ensuring precise replication, elongation, and termination. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting a hierarchical structure of the DNA replication machinery and suggest that replication termination is established during the replication initiation stage rather than being triggered by DNA polymerase collision. —Di Jiang DNA replication is initiated at multiple loci to ensure timely duplication of eukaryotic genomes. Sister replication forks progress bidirectionally, and replication terminates when two convergent forks encounter one another. To investigate the coordination of replication forks, we developed a replication-associated in situ HiC method to capture chromatin interactions involving nascent DNA. We identify more than 2000 fountain-like structures of chromatin contacts in human and mouse genomes, indicative of coupling of DNA replication forks. Replication fork interaction not only occurs between sister forks but also involves forks from two distinct origins to predetermine replication termination. Termination-associated chromatin fountains are sensitive to replication stress and lead to coupled forks–associated genomic deletions in cancers. These findings reveal the spatial organization of DNA replication forks within the chromatin context.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric cooling is an attractive solid-state method, but it currently relies on resource-limited telluride-based materials. Qin et al . discovered a relatively simple lead selenide–based material that has attractive cooling potential (see the Perspective by Jakhar and Ibáñez). They found compositions in which extra lead added to the system helped to fill in vacancies, thus improving the thermoelectric efficiency. By pairing this material with tin selenide, the authors built a cooling device that has relatively attractive performance and demonstrates the potential for tellurium-free cooling. —Brent Grocholski Thermoelectric cooling technology has important applications for processes such as precise temperature control in intelligent electronics. The bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 )–based coolers currently in use are limited by the scarcity of Te and less-than-ideal cooling capability. We demonstrate how removing lattice vacancies through a grid-design strategy switched PbSe from being useful as a medium-temperature power generator to a thermoelectric cooler. At room temperature, the seven-pair device based on n-type PbSe and p-type SnSe produced a maximum cooling temperature difference of ~73 kelvin, with a single-leg power generation efficiency approaching 11.2%. We attribute our results to a power factor of &gt;52 microwatts per centimeter per square kelvin, which was achieved by boosting carrier mobility. Our demonstration suggests a path for commercial applications of thermoelectric cooling based on Earth-abundant Te-free selenide-based compounds.},

  abstract     = {Improved electron injection through passivation of defects at the titanium oxide interface has boosted the efficiency of mesoporous perovskite solar cells. In these devices, a layered mesoporous scaffold of carbon, titanium dioxide, and zirconium dioxide filled with perovskite has a band alignment that separates charges without a hole-transporter layer. Liu et al . passivated defects on titanium dioxide with ammonium phosphate to improve electron injection. The resulting decrease in charge recombination boosted the power-conversion efficiency to about 22%. Devices maintained 97% of their initial efficiency after 750 hours of maximum power point tracking at 55°C. —Phil Szuromi Printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p-MPSCs) do not require the added hole-transport layer needed in traditional p-n junctions but have also exhibited lower power conversion efficiencies of about 19%. We performed device simulation and carrier dynamics analysis to design a p-MPSC with mesoporous layers of semiconducting titanium dioxide, insulating zirconium dioxide, and conducting carbon infiltrated with perovskite that enabled three-dimensional injection of photoexcited electrons into titanium dioxide for collection at a transparent conductor layer. Holes underwent long-distance diffusion toward the carbon back electrode, and this carrier separation reduced recombination at the back contact. Nonradiative recombination at the bulk titanium dioxide/perovskite interface was reduced by ammonium phosphate modification. The resulting p-MPSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency of 22.2% and maintained 97% of their initial efficiency after 750 hours of maximum power point tracking at 55 ± 5°C.},

Many 2D materials are made by slicing (exfoliating) bulk-layered structures to their thinnest layer of only a few atoms in thickness ( 1 , 2 ). However, without a full understanding of the interactions between the layers of atoms, simple trial-and-error experiments lead to slow progress in 2D materials discovery and substantial waste of resources from failed attempts. To circumvent these issues, a shift toward theory-driven experimental synthesis is essential. On page 1210 of this issue, Björk et al .

Regulation of this industry has been generally ignored despite its having made a mark on the lifestyle health and wellness market. Yet companies’ claims of having the ability to detect “abnormal” microbiomes are not substantiated by research; the testing processes lack analytical validity, and the results have no demonstrated clinical validity. As a result, consumers may be financially exploited or harmed by inappropriate use of test results that neither they nor their doctors understand.

  abstract     = {In November of 2023, a massive dike formed in Iceland that subsequently resulted in the Sundhnúkur eruption. Sigmundsson et al . used a variety of geophysical observations to model the formation of the dike and magma transport. They found that the subsurface magma flow rate peaked at an incredibly fast 7400 cubic meters per second. Tectonic stresses and fracturing were important factors beyond the pressure from the magma source itself. Overall, the authors demonstrate a high hazard potential for this system that likely applies to other dike intrusions with similar features. —Brent Grocholski Many examples of exposed giant dike swarms can be found where lateral magma flow has exceeded hundreds of kilometers. We show that massive magma flow into dikes can be established with only modest overpressure in a magma body if a large enough pathway opens at its boundary and gradual buildup of high tensile stress has occurred along the dike pathway prior to the onset of diking. This explains rapid initial magma flow rates, modeled up to about 7400 cubic meters per second into a dike ~15-kilometers long, which propagated under the town of Grindavík, Southwest Iceland, in November 2023. Such high flow rates provide insight into the formation of major dikes and imply a serious hazard potential for high–flow rate intrusions that propagate to the surface and transition into eruptions.},

  abstract     = {Hormones are small mobile signaling molecules that control growth and development. Zhang et al . studied how a hormone signaling pathway acts in a precise spatiotemporal manner (i.e., cell- and tissue-specific signaling) to enhance grain number in rice. They identified a brassinosteroid catabolism gene that is the causative gene underlying enhanced grain number in Clustered-Spikelet rice through a signaling cascade and downstream gene expression of a key transcription factor. This work paves the way to understanding how spatial regulation of brassinosteroid hormonal pathways in secondary branch meristems enhances panicle branching and grain number, crucial traits for enhancing rice yields. —Ankit Walia Crop yield potential is constrained by the inherent trade-offs among traits such as between grain size and number. Brassinosteroids (BRs) promote grain size, yet their role in regulating grain number is unclear. By deciphering the clustered-spikelet rice germplasm, we show that activation of the BR catabolic gene BRASSINOSTEROID-DEFICIENT DWARF3 ( BRD3 ) markedly increases grain number. We establish a molecular pathway in which the BR signaling inhibitor GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE KINASE2 phosphorylates and stabilizes OsMADS1 transcriptional factor, which targets TERMINAL FLOWER1 -like gene RICE CENTRORADIALIS2 . The tissue-specific activation of BRD3 in the secondary branch meristems enhances panicle branching, minimizing negative effects on grain size, and improves grain yield. Our study showcases the power of tissue-specific hormonal manipulation in dismantling the trade-offs among various traits and thus unleashing crop yield potential in rice.},

  abstract     = {Vocalizations in mammals need to coordinate with breathing because vocal sounds are produced in the airway. Earlier work has identified brain nuclei that regulate vocalization, but the neurons responsible for vocal cord adduction and vocal-breathing coordination are still unknown. Park et al . investigated the neuronal circuit directly mediating vocal production and vocal-respiratory coupling in mice (see the Perspective by Hage). The authors identified vocalization-specific laryngeal premotor neurons located in the retroambiguus nucleus (Ram VOC ) as being the key control node for driving vocal cord closure, thus coordinating expiration effort and sound production. Suppression of these neurons by the preBötzinger complex underlies the inspiration gating of vocalization. Vocal syllables are thus produced by RAm VOC excitation of laryngeal motoneurons, which are periodically interrupted by preBötzinger complex–mediated rhythmic inhibition. —Peter Stern Phonation critically depends on precise controls of laryngeal muscles in coordination with ongoing respiration. However, the neural mechanisms governing these processes remain unclear. We identified excitatory vocalization-specific laryngeal premotor neurons located in the retroambiguus nucleus (RAm VOC ) in adult mice as being both necessary and sufficient for driving vocal cord closure and eliciting mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The duration of RAm VOC activation can determine the lengths of both USV syllables and concurrent expiration periods, with the impact of RAm VOC activation depending on respiration phases. RAm VOC neurons receive inhibition from the preBötzinger complex, and inspiration needs override RAm VOC -mediated vocal cord closure. Ablating inhibitory synapses in RAm VOC neurons compromised this inspiration gating of laryngeal adduction, resulting in discoordination of vocalization with respiration. Our study reveals the circuits for vocal production and vocal-respiratory coordination.},

In doing so, they enter a state of “lineage plasticity” and are able to express previous and new fates. Tierney et al . found that vitamin A restricts lineage plasticity and must be suppressed to switch fates in mouse hair follicle stem cells. Manipulating retinoid availability in skin and in culture allowed the authors to direct stem cells to heal wounds or to make hair. Learning how stem cells can be guided to make the right fate decisions has implications for regenerative medicine, wound repair, and cancer treatment. —Stella M. Hurtley Lineage plasticity—a state of dual fate expression—is required to release stem cells from their niche constraints and redirect them to tissue compartments where they are most needed. In this work, we found that without resolving lineage plasticity, skin stem cells cannot effectively generate each lineage in vitro nor regrow hair and repair wounded epidermis in vivo. A small-molecule screen unearthed retinoic acid as a critical regulator. Combining high-throughput approaches, cell culture, and in vivo mouse genetics, we dissected its roles in tissue regeneration. We found that retinoic acid is made locally in hair follicle stem cell niches, where its levels determine identity and usage. Our findings have therapeutic implications for hair growth as well as chronic wounds and cancers, where lineage plasticity is unresolved.},

These structures are among the largest synapses in the central nervous system and can therefore be studied to address many basic questions about synaptic transmission. Recent technical advances have offered opportunities to understand this connection in unprecedented detail. Vandael and Jonas reviewed the enormous progress that has been made in the past few years in our understanding of the structure, biophysics, and network function of hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. —Peter Stern The hippocampal mossy fiber synapse, formed between axons of dentate gyrus granule cells and dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, is a key synapse in the trisynaptic circuitry of the hippocampus. Because of its comparatively large size, this synapse is accessible to direct presynaptic recording, allowing a rigorous investigation of the biophysical mechanisms of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Furthermore, because of its placement in the very center of the hippocampal memory circuit, this synapse seems to be critically involved in several higher network functions, such as learning, memory, pattern separation, and pattern completion. Recent work based on new technologies in both nanoanatomy and nanophysiology, including presynaptic patch-clamp recording, paired recording, super-resolution light microscopy, and freeze-fracture and “flash-and-freeze” electron microscopy, has provided new insights into the structure, biophysics, and network function of this intriguing synapse.

Typically, a “guide star” is required, and a deformable mirror or spatial light modulator corrects the distortions in the propagating wavefront, resulting in a sharp image. However, not all samples or imaging systems are amenable to a guide star. Cameron et al . show that entangled photons can be used in adaptive optics, demonstrating the ability to remove aberrations in biological samples without the need for a guide star. Such quantum adaptive optics is a powerful tool for imaging biological samples in the presence of aberrations. —Ian S. Osborne Adaptive optics (AO) has revolutionized imaging in fields from astronomy to microscopy by correcting optical aberrations. In label-free microscopes, however, conventional AO faces limitations because of the absence of a guide star and the need to select an optimization metric specific to the sample and imaging process. Here, we propose an AO approach leveraging correlations between entangled photons to directly correct the point spread function. This guide star–free method is independent of the specimen and imaging modality. We demonstrate the imaging of biological samples in the presence of aberrations using a bright-field imaging setup operating with a source of spatially entangled photon pairs. Our approach performs better than conventional AO in correcting specific aberrations, particularly those involving substantial defocus. Our work improves AO for label-free microscopy and could play a major role in the development of quantum microscopes.},

Increased regulations are urgent, because the potential for most sharks to recover from such declines is limited due to their slow development and reproduction. —Sacha Vignieri The deep ocean is the last natural biodiversity refuge from the reach of human activities. Deepwater sharks and rays are among the most sensitive marine vertebrates to overexploitation. One-third of threatened deepwater sharks are targeted, and half the species targeted for the international liver-oil trade are threatened with extinction. Steep population declines cannot be easily reversed owing to long generation lengths, low recovery potentials, and the near absence of management. Depth and spatial limits to fishing activity could improve conservation when implemented alongside catch regulations, bycatch mitigation, and international trade regulation.

Climate change and species traits have been implicated in both past and current extinctions. Malanoski et al . investigated what factors explain which species went extinct across the Phanerozoic using data on marine invertebrates from the Paleobiology Database. By reconstructing the past climate, the authors found that species with narrower thermal niche breadths, smaller geographic ranges, or smaller bodies were more likely to go extinct, as were those living in hotter places that experienced more drastic climate change. Although traits are important predictors of extinction risk, species with narrow thermal niches near the poles or equator were at the greatest risk of extinction. —Bianca Lopez Anthropogenic climate change is increasing rapidly and already impacting biodiversity. Despite its importance in future projections, understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which climate mediates extinction remains limited. We present an integrated approach examining the role of intrinsic traits versus extrinsic climate change in mediating extinction risk for marine invertebrates over the past 485 million years. We found that a combination of physiological traits and the magnitude of climate change is necessary to explain marine invertebrate extinction patterns.

Ochs et al . determined the stoichiometry of cohesin by imaging single molecules bound to the chromatin of intact human cells. Although many complexes appeared dimeric, those engaged in sister chromatid cohesion were exclusively monomeric, as predicted by the notion that cohesion arises from the co-entrapment of sister DNAs inside individual cohesin rings. Understanding the mechanistic basis of sister chromatid cohesion is especially important for understanding the etiology of age-related infertility and aneuploidy-driven diseases. —Di Jiang Eukaryotic genomes are organized by loop extrusion and sister chromatid cohesion, both mediated by the multimeric cohesin protein complex. Understanding how cohesin holds sister DNAs together, and how loss of cohesion causes age-related infertility in females, requires knowledge as to cohesin’s stoichiometry in vivo. Using quantitative super-resolution imaging, we identified two discrete populations of chromatin-bound cohesin in postreplicative human cells. Whereas most complexes appear dimeric, cohesin that localized to sites of sister chromatid cohesion and associated with sororin was exclusively monomeric. The monomeric stoichiometry of sororin:cohesin complexes demonstrates that sister chromatid cohesion is conferred by individual cohesin rings, a key prediction of the proposal that cohesion arises from the co-entrapment of sister DNAs.},

  abstract     = {Many arthropods carry symbiotic bacteria. Some, including Wolbachia strains, have the capacity to cause male sterility in a process called cytoplasmic incompatibility, and thereby have influenced the evolutionary trajectory of some insect lineages. One symbiont strain called w Mel has been successfully redeployed at scale for mosquito control. Kaur et al . delved into the mechanism that causes cytoplasmic incompatibility, finding that a combination of w Mel bacteriophage proteins enter sperm nuclei and act in a cascade of reactions to block embryo development. One protein is an RNase that depletes an insect long noncoding RNA that is required for the transformation of histone to protamine during sperm development. Both proteins can also nick DNA to compromise insect DNA integrity in late spermatids, which ultimately causes unrepairable embryo damage and sterility. —Caroline Ash The extent to which prophage proteins interact with eukaryotic macromolecules is largely unknown. In this work, we show that cytoplasmic incompatibility factor A (CifA) and B (CifB) proteins, encoded by prophage WO of the endosymbiont Wolbachia, alter long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and DNA during Drosophila sperm development to establish a paternal-effect embryonic lethality known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CifA is a ribonuclease (RNase) that depletes a spermatocyte lncRNA important for the histone-to-protamine transition of spermiogenesis. Both CifA and CifB are deoxyribonucleases (DNases) that elevate DNA damage in late spermiogenesis. lncRNA knockdown enhances CI, and mutagenesis links lncRNA depletion and subsequent sperm chromatin integrity changes to embryonic DNA damage and CI. Hence, prophage proteins interact with eukaryotic macromolecules during gametogenesis to create a symbiosis that is fundamental to insect evolution and vector control.},

Mailho-Fontana et al . describe an egg-laying caecilian species that produces an oviductal milk and feeds it to its offspring through its vent, likely in response to stimulation from the offspring (see the Perspective by Wake). —Sacha Vignieri Among vertebrates, the yolk is commonly the only form of nutritional investment offered by the female to the embryo. Some species, however, have developed parental care behaviors associated with specialized food provisioning essential for offspring survival, such as the production of lipidic-rich parental milk in mammals. Here, we show that females of the egg-laying caecilian amphibian Siphonops annulatus provide similarly lipid-rich milk to altricial hatchlings during parental care. We observed that for 2 months, S. annulatus babies ingested milk released through the maternal vent seemingly in response to tactile and acoustic stimulation by the babies. The milk, composed mainly of lipids and carbohydrates, originates from the maternal oviduct epithelium’s hypertrophied glands. Our data suggest lactation in this oviparous nonmammalian species and expand the knowledge of parental care and communication in caecilians.},

  abstract     = {Determining the mechanisms guiding axon pathfinding during development is critical for understanding how neuronal circuits develop in a dynamic milieu without fixed targets. Agi et al . studied the developing visual system in fruit flies to determine how thousands of axons form the intricate wiring pattern of the visual map. In contrast to the accepted idea of target-dependent guidance of axonal growth cones, the authors showed that depleting the target neurons does not prevent correct axonal growth. Axonal growth thus follows a self-organizing principle in the fly visual map. These results pave the way for further work in other systems to determine whether the self-organizing principle of axonal growth is a general phenomenon during brain development in the absence of fixed targets. —Mattia Maroso The idea of guidance toward a target is central to axon pathfinding and brain wiring in general. In this work, we show how several thousand axonal growth cones self-pattern without target-dependent guidance during neural superposition wiring in Drosophila . Ablation of all target lamina neurons or loss of target adhesion prevents the stabilization but not the development of the pattern. Intravital imaging at the spatiotemporal resolution of growth cone dynamics in intact pupae and data-driven dynamics simulations reveal a mechanism by which &gt;30,000 filopodia do not explore potential targets, but instead simultaneously generate and navigate a dynamic filopodial meshwork that steers growth directions. Hence, a guidance mechanism can emerge from the interactions of the axons being guided, suggesting self-organization as a more general feature of brain wiring.},

  abstract     = {Optical microresonators provide a versatile platform for the development of integrated photonic devices, including lasers and frequency combs. However, the device operation tends to be fixed once fabricated. Ji et al . designed and fabricateed a multifunctional photonic device with two coupled optical microresonators (see the Perspective by Rolland and Heffernan). By controlling the coupling between the microresonators, the authors showed that operation of the device could be switched between different functions on demand. The device can operate as a laser and as a bright- and dark-frequency comb. Such multifunctional behavior and tunability should provide flexibility for integrated photonics. —Ian S. Osborne High- Q microresonators are indispensable components of photonic integrated circuits and offer several useful operational modes. However, these modes cannot be reconfigured after fabrication because they are fixed by the resonator’s physical geometry. In this work, we propose a Moiré speedup dispersion tuning method that enables a microresonator device to operate in any of three modes. Electrical tuning of Vernier coupled rings switches operating modality to Brillouin laser, bright microcomb, and dark microcomb operation on demand using the same hybrid-integrated device. Brillouin phase matching and microcomb operation across the telecom C-band is demonstrated. Likewise, by using a single-pump wavelength, the operating mode can be switched. As a result, one universal design can be applied across a range of applications. The device brings flexible mixed-mode operation to integrated photonic circuits.},

  abstract     = {The role of erosion in the modulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been challenging to untangle because increased weathering fluxes do not always result in the drawdown of this greenhouse gas. Bufe et al . found that carbon dioxide drawdown peaks at a range of erosion rates that are much lower than the most active mountain belts. Peak drawdown occurs in various places on the planet, but very actively eroding landscapes are likely contributing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This observation helps to reconcile conflicting data on the role of weathering and atmospheric carbon dioxide. —Brent Grocholski Uplift and erosion modulate the carbon cycle over geologic timescales by exposing minerals to chemical weathering. However, the erosion sensitivity of mineral weathering remains difficult to quantify. Solute-chemistry datasets from mountain streams in different orogens isolate the impact of erosion on silicate weathering—a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sink—and coupled sulfide and carbonate weathering—a CO 2 source. Contrasting erosion sensitivities of these reactions produce a CO 2 -drawdown maximum at erosion rates of ~0.07 millimeters per year. Thus, landscapes with moderate uplift rates bolster Earth’s inorganic CO 2 sink, whereas more rapid uplift decreases or even reverses CO 2 sequestration. This concept of an “erosion optimum” for CO 2 drawdown reconciles conflicting views on the impact of mountain building on the carbon cycle and permits estimates of geologic CO 2 fluxes dependent upon tectonic changes.},

However, many frogs, salamanders, and especially caecilians have developed distinct and complex modes of egg protection and nutrition. Brooding developing embryos in pouches or pits on a maternal female’s back, in her stomach, in her oviducts, or in a paternal male’s vocal sacs, and eating of a mother’s skin are but a few examples.

As a result, vocal utterances are properly aligned and embedded within respiratory cycles, usually during expiration; otherwise, a lack of coordination could result in vocal cord dysfunction or breathing problems ( 1 , 2 ).

The frequencies that propagate and the difference between these frequencies are determined by the dispersion of the microresonator—that is, the speed at which different frequencies travel through the resonator. Because dispersion is determined by the resonator&#39;s material properties and geometry, it can be tuned only subtly after fabrication. On page 1080 of this issue, Ji et al .

  abstract     = {The low intensity of attosecond pulses remains one of the main challenges in conducting true attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments that could directly observe electron dynamics in real time when all nuclear motions are frozen. Using a recently upgraded x-ray free-electron laser that enables the production and synchronization of two-color attosecond x-ray pulse pairs, Li et al . performed all x-ray attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on an important condensed phase process: the initial electronic response to valence ionization in liquid water. This work experimentally resolves a long-standing debate around the interpretation of the 1b 1 x-ray emission doublet. The presented technique could resolve many complex condensed phase issues for which nuclear motions need to be frozen to capture the information content of the probe signal. —Yury Suleymanov Attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments have long been sought as the most straightforward method for observing electron dynamics in real time. Although there has been much success with overlapped near-infrared femtosecond and extreme ultraviolet attosecond pulses combined with theory, true attosecond-pump/attosecond-probe experiments have been limited. We used a synchronized attosecond x-ray pulse pair from an x-ray free-electron laser to study the electronic response to valence ionization in liquid water through all x-ray attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AX-ATAS). Our analysis showed that the AX-ATAS response is confined to the subfemtosecond timescale, eliminating any hydrogen atom motion and demonstrating experimentally that the 1b 1 splitting in the x-ray emission spectrum is related to dynamics and is not evidence of two structural motifs in ambient liquid water.},

  abstract     = {Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively manages HIV infection by inhibiting the ability of the virus to replicate, it cannot completely eradicate the latent viral reservoir, frustrating the ultimate clinical goal of a functional cure. Lim et al . used broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV-1 envelope, along with a soluble interleukin-15 superagonist that activates and expands natural killer and CD8 + T cells, to treat rhesus macaques infected with SIV-HIV chimeric virus after the discontinuation of ART. This combined superagonist-antibody treatment induced long-term viral control in more than 70% of infected animals primarily through enhanced CD8 + T cell responses, suggesting that the complete eradication of the HIV reservoir may not be needed for sustained remission after discontinuation of ART. —Seth Thomas Scanlon The eradication of the viral reservoir represents the major obstacle to the development of a clinical cure for established HIV-1 infection. Here, we demonstrate that the administration of N-803 (brand name Anktiva) and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) results in sustained viral control after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in simian-human AD8 (SHIV-AD8)–infected, ART-suppressed rhesus macaques. N-803+bNAbs treatment induced immune activation and transient viremia but only limited reductions in the SHIV reservoir. Upon ART discontinuation, viral rebound occurred in all animals, which was followed by durable control in approximately 70% of all N-803+bNAb–treated macaques. Viral control was correlated with the reprogramming of CD8 + T cells by N-803+bNAb synergy. Thus, complete eradication of the replication-competent viral reservoir is likely not a prerequisite for the induction of sustained remission after discontinuation of ART.},

  abstract     = {Synaptic plasticity is the critical mechanism supporting learning, memory, and many other neurophysiological processes during brain development and in adulthood. The GTPase-activating protein SynGAP has been shown to be necessary for synaptic plasticity, and mutations have been associated with autism and other intellectual disabilities. Araki et al . found that the GAP activity of SynGAP is not required for synaptic plasticity (see the Perspective by Choquet). Instead, the protein modulates synaptic plasticity by competing with the AMPA receptor–TARP complex at excitatory synapses, influencing the formation of molecular condensates and ultimately regulating the recruitment of AMPA receptors during plasticity. These results will help in the development of treatments for SynGAP-mediated neurological disorders. —Mattia Maroso SynGAP is an abundant synaptic GTPase-activating protein (GAP) critical for synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and cognition. Mutations in SYNGAP1 in humans result in intellectual disability, autistic-like behaviors, and epilepsy. Heterozygous Syngap1 -knockout mice display deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory and exhibit seizures. It is unclear whether SynGAP imparts structural properties at synapses independently of its GAP activity. Here, we report that inactivating mutations within the GAP domain do not inhibit synaptic plasticity or cause behavioral deficits. Instead, SynGAP modulates synaptic strength by physically competing with the AMPA-receptor-TARP excitatory receptor complex in the formation of molecular condensates with synaptic scaffolding proteins. These results have major implications for developing therapeutic treatments for SYNGAP1 -related neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Materna et al . examined 10 patients with rare biallelic loss-of-function PTCRA variants. Despite having small thymi and low circulating naïve αβ T cell counts, the memory αβ T cell counts in these patients were normal, suggesting that the pre-TCRα may not be absolutely required for αβ T cell development in humans. The authors also identified two common hypomorphic PTCRA variants that were responsible for partial pre-TCRα deficiency in homozygotes in about one in 4000 individuals from the Middle East and South Asia, resulting in high circulating naïve γδ T cell counts and a significantly increased incidence of autoimmunity. —Seth Thomas Scanlon We describe humans with rare biallelic loss-of-function PTCRA variants impairing pre–α T cell receptor (pre-TCRα) expression. Low circulating naive αβ T cell counts at birth persisted over time, with normal memory αβ and high γδ T cell counts. Their TCRα repertoire was biased, which suggests that noncanonical thymic differentiation pathways can rescue αβ T cell development. Only a minority of these individuals were sick, with infection, lymphoproliferation, and/or autoimmunity. We also report that 1 in 4000 individuals from the Middle East and South Asia are homozygous for a common hypomorphic PTCRA variant. They had normal circulating naive αβ T cell counts but high γδ T cell counts. Although residual pre-TCRα expression drove the differentiation of more αβ T cells, autoimmune conditions were more frequent in these patients compared with the general population.},

  abstract     = {Plants often throw out offspring with different chromosome numbers (ploidy). This phenomenon can create bigger flowers and fruits or provide environmental resilience, and it has become a target in plant breeding for crop improvement. Westermann et al . investigated why de novo polyploids show reduced fertility compared with established descendant polyploid plants. Fertility loss was originally thought to result primarily from issues relating to segregation of multiple chromosomes during meiosis, but this is not the only obstacle. In a survey of genes under selection, the authors identified two: AGC1 , which is important for pollen tube growth, and ACA8 , a calcium transporter, both of which are known to affect pollen tube structure. Experiments verified the role that adaptations in the expression of these genes play in correcting defective pollen tube growth after ploidy generation. —Caroline Ash and Ankit Walia Genome duplication (generating polyploids) is an engine of novelty in eukaryotic evolution and a promising crop improvement tool. Yet newly formed polyploids often have low fertility. Here we report that a severe fertility-compromising defect in pollen tube tip growth arises in new polyploids of Arabidopsis arenosa . Pollen tubes of newly polyploid A. arenosa grow slowly, have aberrant anatomy and disrupted physiology, often burst prematurely, and have altered gene expression. These phenotypes recover in evolved polyploids. We also show that gametophytic (pollen tube) genotypes of two tip-growth genes under selection in natural tetraploid A. arenosa are strongly associated with pollen tube performance in the tetraploid. Our work establishes pollen tube tip growth as an important fertility challenge for neo-polyploid plants and provides insights into a naturally evolved multigenic solution.},

Considering these changes is important for managing this critical resource in an ever-more challenging environment. —H. Jesse Smith In recent decades, climate change and other anthropogenic activities have substantially affected groundwater systems worldwide. These impacts include changes in groundwater recharge, discharge, flow, storage, and distribution. Climate-induced shifts are evident in altered recharge rates, greater groundwater contribution to streamflow in glacierized catchments, and enhanced groundwater flow in permafrost areas. Direct anthropogenic changes include groundwater withdrawal and injection, regional flow regime modification, water table and storage alterations, and redistribution of embedded groundwater in foods globally. Notably, groundwater extraction contributes to sea level rise, increasing the risk of groundwater inundation in coastal areas.

Zhu et al . performed genetic, biochemical, and structural experiments to reveal how this large protein complex is formed and to understand how it functions to protect cells from intracellular infection. Cryo–electron tomography revealed that dimers of GBP1 form an even coating on bacteria, and medium-resolution reconstructions suggested that an extended conformation allows the protein to insert into and disrupt the bacterial outer membrane. —Michael A. Funk and Stella M. Hurtley All living organisms deploy cell-autonomous defenses to combat infection. In plants and animals, large supramolecular complexes often activate immune proteins for protection. In this work, we resolved the native structure of a massive host-defense complex that polymerizes 30,000 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) over the surface of gram-negative bacteria inside human cells. Construction of this giant nanomachine took several minutes and remained stable for hours, required guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis, and recruited four GBPs plus caspase-4 and Gasdermin D as a cytokine and cell death immune signaling platform. Cryo–electron tomography suggests that GBP1 can adopt an extended conformation for bacterial membrane insertion to establish this platform, triggering lipopolysaccharide release that activated coassembled caspase-4.

The intervention, which hinges on a bulky phosphine ligand on Pd and a P-based electrophilic N source, offers a simple means of diversifying existing Suzuki reactant libraries. —Jake S.

A combination of a bulky ancillary phosphine ligand on palladium and a commercially available amination reagent enables efficient reactivity across aryl halides and pseudohalides, boronic acids and esters, and many functional groups and heterocycles.

Wang et al . used in situ observations of monthly average river flow from 1965 to 2014, combined with modeling, to show that human effects on climate have already caused a reduction of river flow seasonality at latitudes above 50° N. Understanding these changes is necessary for ensuring that freshwater ecosystems maintain their essential functions, for securing sustainable water resources, and for determining allocations for irrigation or hydropower generation. —H. Jesse Smith Riverine ecosystems have adapted to natural discharge variations across seasons. However, evidence suggesting that climate change has already impacted magnitudes of river flow seasonality is limited to local studies, mainly focusing on changes of mean or extreme flows. This study introduces the use of apportionment entropy as a robust measure to assess flow-volume nonuniformity across seasons, enabling a global analysis. We found that ~21% of long-term river gauging stations exhibit significant alterations in seasonal flow distributions, but two-thirds of these are unrelated to trends in annual mean discharge. By combining a data-driven runoff reconstruction with state-of-the-art hydrological simulations, we identified a discernible weakening of river flow seasonality in northern high latitudes (above 50°N), a phenomenon directly linked to anthropogenic climate forcing.},

  abstract     = {How does random turbulence organize to form large-scale structures in planetary atmospheres? Such a process implies the existence of an inverse energy cascade, an idea that has been suggested but not yet demonstrated for Earth’s atmosphere. Alexakis et al . conducted numerical simulations at high spatial resolutions to show that rotating and stratified flows can support a three-dimensional, bidirectional cascade of energy under conditions applicable to those on Earth. These results explain how spontaneous order can arise in a dry atmosphere through an inverse cascade of energy to large spatial scales. —H. Jesse Smith How turbulent convective fluctuations organize to form larger-scale structures in planetary atmospheres remains a question that eludes quantitative answers. The assumption that this process is the result of an inverse cascade was suggested half a century ago in two-dimensional fluids, but its applicability to atmospheric and oceanic flows remains heavily debated, hampering our understanding of the energy balance in planetary systems. We show using direct numerical simulations with spatial resolutions of 12288 2 × 384 points that rotating and stratified flows can support a bidirectional cascade of energy, in three dimensions, with a ratio of Rossby to Froude numbers comparable to that of Earth’s atmosphere. Our results establish that, in dry atmospheres, spontaneous order can arise through an inverse cascade to the largest spatial scales.},

We present a strategy for designing stable single-atom catalysts by harnessing a second metal to anchor the noble metal atom inside zeolite channels. A single-atom rhodium-indium cluster catalyst is formed inside zeolite silicalite-1 through in situ migration of indium during alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional stability against coke formation for 5500 hours in continuous pure propane dehydrogenation with 99% propylene selectivity and propane conversions close to the thermodynamic equilibrium value at 550°C.

  abstract     = {Touch sensation is mediated by mechanically activated ion channels. Although some of these channels have been identified, the mechanosensitivity of sensory neurons is likely to involve multiple types of mechanically gated channels. Chakrabarti et al . identified a putative ion channel, ELKIN1, that is activated by mechanical force and is necessary for normal touch sensation in mice. Deletion of Elkin1 reduced the activation of low-threshold, mechanically activated currents. A similar reduction was observed in induced human sensory neurons upon small interfering RNA–mediated reduction in ELKIN1. The identification of ELKIN1’s contribution to touch sensation expands our understanding of the molecular basis of cutaneous sensation. —Mattia Maroso Touch perception is enabled by mechanically activated ion channels, the opening of which excites cutaneous sensory endings to initiate sensation. In this study, we identify ELKIN1 as an ion channel likely gated by mechanical force, necessary for normal touch sensitivity in mice. Touch insensitivity in Elkin1 −/− mice was caused by a loss of mechanically activated currents (MA currents) in around half of all sensory neurons activated by light touch (low-threshold mechanoreceptors). Reintroduction of Elkin1 into sensory neurons from Elkin1 −/− mice restored MA currents. Additionally, small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of ELKIN1 from induced human sensory neurons substantially reduced indentation-induced MA currents, supporting a conserved role for ELKIN1 in human touch. Our data identify ELKIN1 as a core component of touch transduction in mice and potentially in humans.},

  abstract     = {During their formation process, young stars are surrounded by a protoplanetary disk of gas and dust within which planets can form. Stars mostly form in clusters, and bright, high-mass stars irradiate the disks around low-mass stars with ultraviolet light. Berné et al . combined infrared, submillimeter, and optical observations of a protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula to determine the effect of ultraviolet irradiation. The authors found that the heating and ionization induced by the ultraviolet photons caused gas to be lost. They measured the loss rate and discuss the implications for planet formation in the disk. —Keith T. Smith Most low-mass stars form in stellar clusters that also contain massive stars, which are sources of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. Theoretical models predict that this FUV radiation produces photodissociation regions (PDRs) on the surfaces of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, which affects planet formation within the disks. We report James Webb Space Telescope and Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations of a FUV-irradiated protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula. Emission lines are detected from the PDR; modeling their kinematics and excitation allowed us to constrain the physical conditions within the gas. We quantified the mass-loss rate induced by the FUV irradiation and found that it is sufficient to remove gas from the disk in less than a million years. This is rapid enough to affect giant planet formation in the disk.},

Although it has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, path dependence is difficult to demonstrate in natural systems because of a lack of independent replicates. Here, we show that two types of distributed visual systems recently evolved twice within chitons, demonstrating rapid and path-dependent evolution of a complex trait. The type of visual system that a chiton lineage can evolve is constrained by the number of openings for sensory nerves in its shell plates. Lineages with more openings evolve visual systems with thousands of eyespots, whereas those with fewer openings evolve visual systems with hundreds of shell eyes. These macroevolutionary outcomes shaped by path dependence are both deterministic and stochastic because possibilities are restricted yet not entirely predictable.},

Understanding the influence of humans on body size in fishes is also challenging given that data on marine species often come from fishery-based activities. Letessier et al . deployed more than 17,000 remotely operated baited devices to collect data on fish size and abundance as related to habitat (pelagic or benthic), human activities, and marine protected areas. Pelagic species were strongly influenced by human pressures and protection. The authors concluded that benthic species could be effectively protected even near markets, whereas only more remote protected areas will effectively safeguard large pelagic species. —Sacha Vignieri Animal body-size variation influences multiple processes in marine ecosystems, but habitat heterogeneity has prevented a comprehensive assessment of size across pelagic (midwater) and benthic (seabed) systems along anthropic gradients. In this work, we derive fish size indicators from 17,411 stereo baited-video deployments to test for differences between pelagic and benthic responses to remoteness from human pressures and effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). From records of 823,849 individual fish, we report divergent responses between systems, with pelagic size structure more profoundly eroded near human markets than benthic size structure, signifying greater vulnerability of pelagic systems to human pressure. Effective protection of benthic size structure can be achieved through MPAs placed near markets, thereby contributing to benthic habitat restoration and the recovery of associated fishes. By contrast, recovery of the world’s largest and most endangered fishes in pelagic systems requires the creation of highly protected areas in remote locations, including on the High Seas, where protection efforts lag.},

This method is achieved using a variance sum rule that connects changes in positions with the forces required to restore those positions. The approach was verified using high-resolution experimental data on optically trapped Brownian particles and red blood cells, including stretching of the cells and contour fluctuations, a measure of the cells’ metabolic activity. —Marc S. Lavine Entropy production is the hallmark of nonequilibrium physics, quantifying irreversibility, dissipation, and the efficiency of energy transduction processes. Despite many efforts, its measurement at the nanoscale remains challenging. We introduce a variance sum rule (VSR) for displacement and force variances that permits us to measure the entropy production rate σ in nonequilibrium steady states. We first illustrate it for directly measurable forces, such as an active Brownian particle in an optical trap. We then apply the VSR to flickering experiments in human red blood cells. We find that σ is spatially heterogeneous with a finite correlation length, and its average value agrees with calorimetry measurements. The VSR paves the way to derive σ using force spectroscopy and time-resolved imaging in living and active matter.},

However, whether DSI occurs in vivo and if it contributes to physiological function have needed more investigation. Dudok et al . now demonstrate that a subpopulation of cells in the hippocampus, which fire in specific locations called place cells, trigger endocannabinoid signaling in their place field that can be detected both in the postsynaptic membrane and the presynaptic inhibitory axons. The authors show that inhibiting the endocannabinoid signaling alters place cell firing. These results reveal that a form of DSI-like plasticity occurs in vivo and plays an important role in shaping hippocampal spatial representation. —Mattia Maroso Endocannabinoid (eCB)–mediated suppression of inhibitory synapses has been hypothesized, but this has not yet been demonstrated to occur in vivo because of the difficulty in tracking eCB dynamics and synaptic plasticity during behavior. In mice navigating a linear track, we observed location-specific eCB signaling in hippocampal CA1 place cells, and this was detected both in the postsynaptic membrane and the presynaptic inhibitory axons. All-optical in vivo investigation of synaptic responses revealed that postsynaptic depolarization was followed by a suppression of inhibitory synaptic potentials. Furthermore, interneuron-specific cannabinoid receptor deletion altered place cell tuning. Therefore, rapid, postsynaptic, activity-dependent eCB signaling modulates inhibitory synapses on a timescale of seconds during behavior.},

Do organisms simply stumble around the adaptive landscape, or are they “channeled” along certain paths or trajectories? The emergence of convergent traits, whereby the same phenotypes evolve from different origins, spotlights this question. However, it is notoriously difficult to answer, particularly at macroevolutionary scales. On page 983 of this issue, Varney et al . ( 1 ) characterize “critical junctions” as the moments in evolutionary time when the trajectory toward one of several observed phenotypes is set, using the visual systems of chitons, a class of benthic marine mollusk. Their findings highlight an apparently crucial prerequisite to vision and a fundamental divide that appears to predate the evolution of either eyes or eyespots, which implicates a strong role for path dependence in the origin of complex traits over geological timescales.},

  abstract     = {The synaptic Ras/Rap guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein (SynGAP) plays substantial, albeit still elusive, roles in synaptic function ( 1 ). SynGAP has attracted considerable attention owing to its pivotal role in modulating excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission and neuronal development and because loss-of-function mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene account for up to 1% of genetically based intellectual disabilities. SynGAP comprises two primary functional domains: the GAP domain and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The GAP domain negatively regulates small G protein signaling, which may be crucial for activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength, whereas the CTD binds to postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), but the functional consequences of this are unclear. On page 963 of this issue, Araki et al . ( 2 ) reveal that contrary to common belief, GAP domain activity is dispensable for many SynGAP functions and that the CTD is important for the plasticity of synaptic transmission. This suggests that potential therapeutics targeting the GAP domain should be reconsidered.},

More often than not, governments rely on policies focused on energy supply to enhance energy security while generally ignoring demand-side possibilities. Further, the indicators traditionally used to measure energy security are also tilted toward the supply side; this fails to capture the full spectrum of vulnerability to energy crises. Energy security assessments need to reflect the wider benefits of security-related interventions more accurately. To that end, we develop a systematic approach to measuring the energy security impacts of policy interventions that explicitly considers energy demand (buildings, transport, and industry). We determine that demand-side actions outperform conventional supply-side approaches at making countries more resilient.},

  abstract     = {Where meiotic recombination occurs in the genome varies across species. In humans and some other mammals, binding sites of the protein PRDM9 determine recombination hotspot locations, whereas in other species without PRDM9, these tend to occur in CpG islands and near promoters. Hoge et al . identified historic patterns of linkage disequilibrium and crossover events from pedigrees in the corn snake, which has a single intact ortholog of PRDM9. They found that crossover events occurred at both PRDM9-determined hotspots as well as promoter-like regions. This suggests that multiple processes, rather than the presence of PRDM9 alone, underlie the recombination landscape in a species. —Corinne Simonti In some mammals, notably humans, recombination occurs almost exclusively where the protein PRDM9 binds, whereas in vertebrates lacking an intact PRDM9 , such as birds and canids, recombination rates are elevated near promoter-like features. To determine whether PRDM9 directs recombination in nonmammalian vertebrates, we focused on an exemplar species with a single, intact PRDM9 ortholog, the corn snake ( Pantherophis guttatus ). Analyzing historical recombination rates along the genome and crossovers in pedigrees, we found evidence that PRDM9 specifies the location of recombination events, but we also detected a separable effect of promoter-like features. These findings reveal that the uses of PRDM9 and promoter-like features need not be mutually exclusive and instead reflect a tug-of-war that is more even in some species than others.},

  abstract     = {The ability to detect food at a molecular level is crucial for identifying high-quality sources of nutrition. Humans use canonical G protein–coupled receptors for taste, but insects are known to have distantly related gustatory receptors that function as ligand-gated ion channels. Ma et al . determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of two gustatory receptors from the fruit fly Drosophila that bind and respond to either monosaccharides or disaccharides, as confirmed by accompanying electrophysiology measurements. The structures revealed a tetrameric ion channel with a sugar-binding site near the extracellular face in a deep, hydrophilic pocket. A mutant with constitutive activity enabled visualization of an open state of one of the channels with a wide pore consistent with nonselective cation conduction. —Michael A. Funk Insects rely on a family of seven transmembrane proteins called gustatory receptors (GRs) to encode different taste modalities, such as sweet and bitter. We report structures of Drosophila sweet taste receptors GR43a and GR64a in the apo and sugar-bound states. Both GRs form tetrameric sugar-gated cation channels composed of one central pore domain (PD) and four peripheral ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Whereas GR43a is specifically activated by the monosaccharide fructose that binds to a narrow pocket in LBDs, disaccharides sucrose and maltose selectively activate GR64a by binding to a larger and flatter pocket in LBDs. Sugar binding to LBDs induces local conformational changes, which are subsequently transferred to the PD to cause channel opening. Our studies reveal a structural basis for sugar recognition and activation of GRs.},

Krishna et al . performed an immunogenetic analysis of associations between HLA class II loci and lung cancer risk. They analyzed two large population-level datasets, one from the UK Biobank and the other from Finland’s FinnGen. Heterozygosity at HLA class II loci was found to be associated with reduced risk of developing lung cancer. Individuals who were current or former smokers benefited from this protective effect, but individuals who had never smoked did not. Smokers with lung cancer were found to have somatic loss of HLA class II heterozygosity, suggesting a functional role for HLA-related immune surveillance in cancer risk. —Priscilla N. Kelly Cancer risk is influenced by inherited mutations, DNA replication errors, and environmental factors. However, the influence of genetic variation in immunosurveillance on cancer risk is not well understood. Leveraging population-level data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we show that heterozygosity at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -II loci is associated with reduced lung cancer risk in smokers. Fine-mapping implicated amino acid heterozygosity in the HLA -II peptide binding groove in reduced lung cancer risk, and single-cell analyses showed that smoking drives enrichment of proinflammatory lung macrophages and HLA -II+ epithelial cells. In lung cancer, widespread loss of HLA -II heterozygosity (LOH) favored loss of alleles with larger neopeptide repertoires. Thus, our findings nominate genetic variation in immunosurveillance as a critical risk factor for lung cancer.},

  abstract     = {In non-Abelian (non-commutative) systems, the final state is dependent on the exact sequence of steps performed getting there. Research on non-Abelian phenomena has recently undergone rapid developments in photonics and acoustics, introducing a new perspective on controlling light and sound at the fundamental level. Such manipulation also provides a versatile platform for studying non-Abelian physics more generally and exploiting the effect for possible applications. Yang et al . summarize the fundamentals, highlight recent advances, and discuss the future directions of non-Abelian physics in photonics and acoustics. — Ian S. Osborne Non-Abelian phenomena arise when the sequence of operations on physical systems influences their behaviors. By possessing internal degrees of freedom such as polarization, light and sound can be subjected to various manipulations, including constituent materials, structured environments, and tailored source conditions. These manipulations enable the creation of a great variety of Hamiltonians, through which rich non-Abelian phenomena can be explored and observed. Recent developments have constituted a versatile testbed for exploring non-Abelian physics at the intersection of atomic, molecular, and optical physics; condensed matter physics; and mathematical physics. These fundamental endeavors could enable photonic and acoustic devices with multiplexing functionalities. Our review aims to provide a timely and comprehensive account of this emerging topic. Starting from the foundation of matrix-valued geometric phases, we address non-Abelian topological charges, non-Abelian gauge fields, non-Abelian braiding, non-Hermitian non-Abelian phenomena, and their realizations with photonics and acoustics and conclude with future prospects.},

  abstract     = {Acute kidney injury from a variety of causes can be temporary and followed by tissue recovery or it can result in long-term damage, fibrosis, and eventual progression to chronic kidney disease. It was not known what determines the outcome of this process, but some previous work implicated a transcription factor called SOX9 as a possible culprit. Using mouse models of acute kidney injury, Aggarwal et al . identified a SOX9 switch, showing that regenerating kidney cells transiently activate SOX9, but then some of these cells deactivate it and some do not. This subsequent deactivation, or lack thereof, with resulting fibroproliferative effects through the WNT signaling pathway, is what distinguishes cells making a healthy recovery from those undergoing fibrosis and long-term injury. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The steps governing healing with or without fibrosis within the same microenvironment are unclear. After acute kidney injury (AKI), injured proximal tubular epithelial cells activate SOX9 for self-restoration. Using a multimodal approach for a head-to-head comparison of injury-induced SOX9 lineages, we identified a dynamic SOX9 switch in repairing epithelia. Lineages that regenerated epithelia silenced SOX9 and healed without fibrosis (SOX9 on-off ). By contrast, lineages with unrestored apicobasal polarity maintained SOX9 activity in sustained efforts to regenerate, which were identified as a SOX9 on-on Cadherin6 pos cell state. These reprogrammed cells generated substantial single-cell WNT activity to provoke a fibroproliferative response in adjacent fibroblasts, driving AKI to chronic kidney disease. Transplanted human kidneys displayed similar SOX9/CDH6/WNT2B responses. Thus, we have uncovered a sensor of epithelial repair status, the activity of which determines regeneration with or without fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Snakes are important members of today’s ecosystems and, together with lizards, make up one-third of the vertebrate biota. Their iconic status largely comes from their morphology and role as impressive and varied predators. Title et al . looked at the evolution of the group and used a large number of natural history diet observations to explore their role in ecosystems. They found that a pulse of evolutionary innovation that occurred at the origin of snakes more than 150 million years ago led to an expansion of diet in squamate reptiles, which had cascading impacts on ecosystems that persist today. —Sacha Vignieri Snakes and lizards (Squamata) represent a third of terrestrial vertebrates and exhibit spectacular innovations in locomotion, feeding, and sensory processing. However, the evolutionary drivers of this radiation remain poorly known. We infer potential causes and ultimate consequences of squamate macroevolution by combining individual-based natural history observations (&gt;60,000 animals) with a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny that we anchored with genomic data (5400 loci) from 1018 species. Due to shifts in the dynamics of speciation and phenotypic evolution, snakes have transformed the trophic structure of animal communities through the recurrent origin and diversification of specialized predatory strategies. Squamate biodiversity reflects a legacy of singular events that occurred during the early history of snakes and reveals the impact of historical contingency on vertebrate biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {Pantetheine is an essential chemical moiety within enzymes and coenzyme A that serves as a handle for reactions involving thioesters, a key species in many biochemical transformations. Because it is strictly conserved and has such a central role in metabolism, pantetheine may have originated alongside other prebiotic components from simple organic and inorganic precursors. Fairchild et al . identified a set of reactions that selectively yield pantetheine in water under dilute conditions that may be reasonable for an early Earth setting. The route uses nitrile chemistry common to other prebiotic syntheses and thus fits into a broader picture for prebiotic cyanosulfidic reactions that are likely candidates for the chemistry that gave rise to life on early Earth. —Michael A. Funk Coenzyme A (CoA) is essential to all life on Earth, and its functional subunit, pantetheine, is important in many origin-of-life scenarios, but how pantetheine emerged on the early Earth remains a mystery. Earlier attempts to selectively synthesize pantetheine failed, leading to suggestions that “simpler” thiols must have preceded pantetheine at the origin of life. In this work, we report high-yielding and selective prebiotic syntheses of pantetheine in water. Chemoselective multicomponent aldol, iminolactone, and aminonitrile reactions delivered spontaneous differentiation of pantoic acid and proteinogenic amino acid syntheses, as well as the dihydroxyl, gem-dimethyl, and β-alanine-amide moieties of pantetheine in dilute water. Our results are consistent with a role for canonical pantetheine at the outset of life on Earth.},

Song et al . show that for one-memristor-one-transistor arrays, most of the VMM can be performed to arbitrarily high precision before being output as a digital result (see the Perspective by Aimone and Agarwal). After a computation step by an array, subarrays dynamically compensate for residual errors of the previously programmed array. This method was used experimentally to solve partial differential equations with remarkable precision (&lt;10 −15 error) and with higher energy efficiency than digital computing. —Phil Szuromi In-memory computing represents an effective method for modeling complex physical systems that are typically challenging for conventional computing architectures but has been hindered by issues such as reading noise and writing variability that restrict scalability, accuracy, and precision in high-performance computations. We propose and demonstrate a circuit architecture and programming protocol that converts the analog computing result to digital at the last step and enables low-precision analog devices to perform high-precision computing. We use a weighted sum of multiple devices to represent one number, in which subsequently programmed devices are used to compensate for preceding programming errors.

Fransson et al . observed a remnant of SN 1987A using near- and mid-infrared integral field spectroscopy. They identified emission lines of ionized argon that appear only near the center of the remnant. Photoionization models show that the line ratios and velocities can be explained by ionizing radiation from a neutron star illuminating gas from the inner parts of the exploded star. —Keith T. Smith The nearby Supernova 1987A was accompanied by a burst of neutrino emission, which indicates that a compact object (a neutron star or black hole) was formed in the explosion. There has been no direct observation of this compact object. In this work, we observe the supernova remnant with JWST spectroscopy, finding narrow infrared emission lines of argon and sulfur. The line emission is spatially unresolved and blueshifted in velocity relative to the supernova rest frame. We interpret the lines as gas illuminated by a source of ionizing photons located close to the center of the expanding ejecta. Photoionization models show that the line ratios are consistent with ionization by a cooling neutron star or a pulsar wind nebula.

To address this, we introduce a method to record transient cellular events for later analysis. We designed proteins that become labeled in the presence of both a specific cellular activity and a fluorescent substrate. The recording period is set by the presence of the substrate, whereas the cellular activity controls the degree of the labeling. The use of distinguishable substrates enabled the recording of successive periods of activity. We recorded protein-protein interactions, G protein–coupled receptor activation, and increases in intracellular calcium.

Our new reconstruction of temperature change over the past 4.5 million years includes two phases of long-term cooling, with the second phase of accelerated cooling during the Middle Pleistocene Transition (1.5 to 0.9 million years ago) being accompanied by a transition from dominant 41,000-year low-amplitude periodicity to dominant 100,000-year high-amplitude periodicity.

Dial et al . linked tree line advance to declines in Arctic Ocean sea ice. Combining field and remotely sensed measurements from northern Alaska with published data from 60 other Arctic sites, the authors found that distance to sea ice predicted tree growth and recruitment, as well as the probability of forest advance. —Bianca Lopez Climate-induced northward advance of boreal forest is expected to lessen albedo, alter carbon stocks, and replace tundra, but where and when this advance will occur remains largely unknown. Using data from 19 sites across 22 degrees of longitude along the tree line of northern Alaska, we show a stronger temporal correlation of tree ring growth with open water uncovered by retreating Arctic sea ice than with air temperature. Spatially, our results suggest that tree growth, recruitment, and range expansion are causally linked to open water through associated warmer temperatures, deeper snowpacks, and improved nutrient availability. We apply a meta-analysis to 82 circumarctic sites, finding that proportionally more tree lines have advanced where proximal to ongoing sea ice loss.

  abstract     = {Classic microtubules are formed from a ring of 13 tubulin dimers extended in a helical tube. In cells, this stoichiometry is generated upon nucleation by the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ TuRC), a ~2.2-megadalton collection of proteins arranged in an asymmetrical cone that forms the terminal end of a growing microtubule. Using a tubulin mutant and an engineered end-capping protein to maintain short and stable nascent microtubules, Brito et al . determined the high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of human γ TuRC under nucleation conditions. The authors propose that γ TuRC transitions from an open conformation, which is seen in previous structures but is too wide, to a closed conformation that matches well to the dimensions of the nascent microtubule and enforces the standard composition. —Michael A. Funk Microtubules are essential for intracellular organization and chromosome segregation. They are nucleated by the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC). However, isolated vertebrate γTuRC adopts an open conformation that deviates from the microtubule structure, raising the question of the nucleation mechanism. In this study, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of human γTuRC bound to a nascent microtubule. Structural changes of the complex into a closed conformation ensure that γTuRC templates the 13-protofilament microtubules that exist in human cells. Closure is mediated by a latch that interacts with incorporating tubulin, making it part of the closing mechanism. Further rearrangements involve all γTuRC subunits and the removal of the actin-containing luminal bridge. Our proposed mechanism of microtubule nucleation by human γTuRC relies on large-scale structural changes that are likely the target of regulation in cells.},

  abstract     = {Forestation is considered a good way to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and cool climate, but its impact on climate is more complex than just its effects through carbon capture. Weber et al . explored the impacts of forestation on climate by quantifying its influence on surface albedo and atmospheric composition (see the Perspective by Hayman). They found that the combination of decreased reflection and increased aerosol scattering of incident sunlight offsets about one-third of the cooling by carbon dioxide removal that forestation produces. —H. Jesse Smith Forestation is widely proposed for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) removal, but its impact on climate through changes to atmospheric composition and surface albedo remains relatively unexplored. We assessed these responses using two Earth system models by comparing a scenario with extensive global forest expansion in suitable regions to other plausible futures. We found that forestation increased aerosol scattering and the greenhouse gases methane and ozone following increased biogenic organic emissions. Additionally, forestation decreased surface albedo, which yielded a positive radiative forcing (i.e., warming). This offset up to a third of the negative forcing from the additional CO 2 removal under a 4°C warming scenario. However, when forestation was pursued alongside other strategies that achieve the 2°C Paris Agreement target, the offsetting positive forcing was smaller, highlighting the urgency for simultaneous emission reductions.},

  abstract     = {In all-perovskite tandem solar cells, a lead-tin perovskite is used instead of silicon as the narrow band gap cell, but nonuniform nucleation and fast crystallization has limited film quality and device efficiency.

The authors achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 24.5% for a 20-square-centimeter module made by blade-coating the layers. —Phil Szuromi Scalable fabrication of all-perovskite tandem solar cells is challenging because the narrow-bandgap subcells made of mixed lead-tin (Pb-Sn) perovskite films suffer from nonuniform crystallization and inferior buried perovskite interfaces. We used a dopant from Good’s list of biochemical buffers, aminoacetamide hydrochloride, to homogenize perovskite crystallization and used it to extend the processing window for blade-coating Pb-Sn perovskite films and to selectively passivate defects at the buried perovskite interface. The resulting all-perovskite tandem solar module exhibited a certified power conversion efficiency of 24.5% with an aperture area of 20.25 square centimeters.},

  abstract     = {The securamine and securine alkaloids, which are biosynthesized by small marine invertebrates, stand out for their dense core of fused heterocycles and both chlorine and bromine substituents. Alexander et al . report chemical syntheses of eight members of this natural product family. Key to the approach is the initial assembly of a macrocycle that undergoes a remarkably selective cascade of internal modifications upon exposure to anhydrous hydrochloric acid. Finely tuned oxidative photocyclizations of advanced intermediates then deliver the various differentiated final products. —Jake S. Yeston Securines and securamines are cytotoxic alkaloids that contain reactive alkene and heterocyclic residues embedded in skeletons comprising four to six oxidized rings. This structural complexity imparts a rich chemistry to the isolates but has impeded synthetic access to the structures in the nearly three decades since their isolation. We present a flexible route to eight isolates that exemplify the three skeletal classes of metabolites. The route proceeds by the modular assembly of the advanced azides 38 and 49 (13 steps, 6 to 10% yield), sequential oxidative photocyclizations, and late-stage functional group manipulations. With this approach, the targets were obtained in 17 to 19 steps, 12 to 13 purifications, and 0.5 to 3.5% overall yield. The structure of an advanced intermediate was elucidated by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) analysis. The route will support structure-function and target identification studies of the securamines.},

Breaking this efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells could be achieved with tandem solar cells, where thermalization loss is reduced and solar spectrum utilization range is broadened ( 2 ). Small-area all-perovskite tandem cells can reach an efficiency of &gt;28% ( 3 ).

Yang et al . found that some NLR pairs heterodimerize and are kept in this inactive state by receptor-like kinases such as BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1). On activation, the heterodimers can oligomerize, which is required to initiate downstream responses. The authors provide mechanistic insight into how paired NLRs activate plant immunity. —Madeleine Seale Plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) analyzed to date oligomerize and form resistosomes upon activation to initiate immune responses. Some NLRs are encoded in tightly linked co-regulated head-to-head genes whose products function together as pairs. We uncover the oligomerization requirements for different Arabidopsis paired CHS3-CSA1 alleles. These pairs form resting-state heterodimers that oligomerize into complexes distinct from NLRs analyzed previously. Oligomerization requires both conserved and allele-specific features of the respective CHS3 and CSA1 Toll-like interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. The receptor kinases BAK1 and BIRs inhibit CHS3-CSA1 pair oligomerization to maintain the CHS3-CSA1 heterodimer in an inactive state. Our study reveals that paired NLRs hetero-oligomerize and likely form a distinctive “dimer of heterodimers” and that structural heterogeneity is expected even among alleles of closely related paired NLRs.},

  abstract     = {The storage of nutrients after food consumption requires an appropriate balance, with the liver helping to direct incoming glucose toward the production of glycogen and/or fat. An excess of fat production can contribute to the development of fatty liver disease and inflammation, so this process requires careful regulation. Chen et al . found that the metabolite uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG), which is produced during glycogenesis, is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it blocks a protease called S1P and thereby inhibits lipogenesis. In both human organoids and a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, treatment with UDPG promoted glycogenesis and reduced the accumulation of lipids, suggesting a potential for therapeutic applications. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The identification of mechanisms to store glucose carbon in the form of glycogen rather than fat in hepatocytes has important implications for the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and other chronic metabolic diseases. In this work, we show that glycogenesis uses its intermediate metabolite uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) to antagonize lipogenesis, thus steering both mouse and human hepatocytes toward storing glucose carbon as glycogen. The underlying mechanism involves transport of UDPG to the Golgi apparatus, where it binds to site-1 protease (S1P) and inhibits S1P-mediated cleavage of sterol regulatory element–binding proteins (SREBPs), thereby inhibiting lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Consistent with this mechanism, UDPG administration is effective at treating NAFLD in a mouse model and human organoids. These findings indicate a potential opportunity to ameliorate disordered fat metabolism in the liver.},

The lipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) is highly expressed by B cells found within GCs, but its function was previously unknown. Using mouse models, Sharma et al . found that elevated levels of Gb3 in B cells promoted the formation of high-affinity antibodies; augmented responses to weaker, subdominant epitopes; and promoted antibody responses that were protective between different strains of influenza virus. Moreover, exogenous Gb3 acted as a vaccine adjuvant in mice. —Sarah H. Ross Influenza viruses escape immunity owing to rapid antigenic evolution, which requires vaccination strategies that allow for broadly protective antibody responses. We found that the lipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) expressed on germinal center (GC) B cells is essential for the production of high-affinity antibodies. Mechanistically, Gb3 bound and disengaged CD19 from its chaperone CD81, permitting CD19 to translocate to the B cell receptor complex to trigger signaling. Moreover, Gb3 regulated major histocompatibility complex class II expression to increase diversity of T follicular helper and GC B cells reactive with subdominant epitopes. In influenza infection, elevating Gb3, either endogenously or exogenously, promoted broadly reactive antibody responses and cross-protection. These data demonstrate that Gb3 determines the affinity and breadth of B cell immunity and has potential as a vaccine adjuvant.},

  abstract     = {The Serengeti migrations consist of millions of herbivores sharing food resources. For decades, there has been interest in understanding how these resources are divided up and what drives the division. Anderson et al . used ecological and animal movement data, fecal DNA, and “natural experiments” driven by rain and fire to characterize the divisions among the three main herbivores within the migration: zebra, wildebeest, and gazelle. They found that competition pushes zebra ahead of the other larger species, wildebeest. Herbivory by wildebeest then facilitates the development of newer growth, which gazelle take advantage of as they trail the other two. —Sacha Vignieri Competition, facilitation, and predation offer alternative explanations for successional patterns of migratory herbivores. However, these interactions are difficult to measure, leaving uncertainty about the mechanisms underlying body-size-dependent grazing—and even whether succession occurs at all. We used data from an 8-year camera-trap survey, GPS-collared herbivores, and fecal DNA metabarcoding to analyze the timing, arrival order, and interactions among migratory grazers in Serengeti National Park. Temporal grazing succession is characterized by a “push-pull” dynamic: Competitive grazing nudges zebra ahead of co-migrating wildebeest, whereas grass consumption by these large-bodied migrants attracts trailing, small-bodied gazelle that benefit from facilitation. “Natural experiments” involving intense wildfires and rainfall respectively disrupted and strengthened these effects. Our results highlight a balance between facilitative and competitive forces in co-regulating large-scale ungulate migrations.},

Scaling patterns throughout ecosystems are well documented and tend to obey a 3/4 exponent, yet the mechanisms by which they emerge are poorly understood. Starting with the premise that micro-level scaling constrains macro-ecology and even evolution, Wickman et al . used a mechanistic eco-evolutionary model to explore relationships such as prey and predator biomass and community productivity. The authors conclude that for marine plankton assemblages, scaling in consumption, growth, and predation gives rise to the higher levels of biological organization that underpin ecosystem function. —Caroline Ash Macroecological scaling patterns, such as between prey and predator biomass, are fundamental to our understanding of the rules of biological organization and ecosystem functioning. Although these scaling patterns are ubiquitous, how they arise is poorly understood. To explain these patterns, we used an eco-evolutionary predator–prey model parameterized using data for phytoplankton and zooplankton. We show that allometric scaling relationships at lower levels of biological organization, such as body-size scaling of nutrient uptake and predation, give rise to scaling relationships at the food web and ecosystem levels. Our predicted macroecological scaling exponents agree well with observed values across ecosystems. Our findings explicitly connect scaling relationships at different levels of biological organization to ecological and evolutionary mechanisms, yielding testable hypotheses for how observed macroecological patterns emerge.},

It remains a challenge to assemble nanoplatelets of these materials at room temperature into in-plane isotropic, free-standing sheets.

The in-plane room temperature electrical conductivity reached 1423 siemens per centimeter, and volumetric specific capacity reached 828 coulombs per cubic centimeter.

If telomerase were to add telomeres to broken DNA ends, then genes distal to the break could be lost. Kinzig et al . found that human telomerase can act at broken DNA ends, thereby threatening genome integrity (see the Perspective by Arnoult and Cech). They show that this genome-destabilizing aspect of telomerase is averted by the ATR kinase component of the DNA damage response. —Di Jiang Telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomeres at natural chromosome ends, should be repressed at double-strand breaks (DSBs), where neotelomere formation can cause terminal truncations. We developed an assay to detect neotelomere formation at Cas9- or I-SceI–induced DSBs in human cells. Telomerase added telomeric repeats to DSBs, leading to interstitial telomeric repeat insertions or the formation of functional neotelomeres accompanied by terminal deletions. The threat that telomerase poses to genome integrity was minimized by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase signaling, which inhibited telomerase at resected DSBs. In addition to acting at resected DSBs, telomerase used the extruded strand in the Cas9 enzyme-product complex as a primer for neotelomere formation. We propose that although neotelomere formation is detrimental in normal human cells, it may allow cancer cells to escape from breakage-fusion-bridge cycles.},

The strategy was also effective in accelerating a Friedel-Crafts acylation, suggesting that it may have broad applicability to acid-catalyzed chemistry. —Jake S. Yeston Electric fields play a key role in enzymatic catalysis and can enhance reaction rates by 100,000-fold, but the same rate enhancements have yet to be achieved in thermochemical heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we probe the influence of catalyst potential and interfacial electric fields on heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysis. We observed that variations in applied potential of ~380 mV led to a 100,000-fold rate enhancement for 1-methylcyclopentanol dehydration, which was catalyzed by carbon-supported phosphotungstic acid. Mechanistic studies support a model in which the interfacial electrostatic potential drop drives quasi-equilibrated proton transfer to the adsorbed substrate prior to rate-limiting C–O bond cleavage. Large increases in rate with potential were also observed for the same reaction catalyzed by Ti/TiO y H x and for the Friedel Crafts acylation of anisole with acetic anhydride by carbon-supported phosphotungstic acid.},

Given the complex electronic structure and multiple product channels, roaming should be more common in highly excited electronic states, but experimental evidence has been lacking. Li et al . demonstrated that roaming is important for sulfur dioxide photodissociation from highly excited states. The experimental data were supported by full-dimensional dynamics simulations. The present work confirms that roaming should be expected to be a fairly common phenomenon in dynamics of highly excited states. —Yury Suleymanov Chemical reactions are generally assumed to proceed from reactants to products along the minimum energy path (MEP). However, straying from the MEP—roaming—has been recognized as an unconventional reaction mechanism and found to occur in both the ground and first excited states. Its existence in highly excited states is however not yet established. We report a dissociation channel to produce electronically excited fragments, S( 1 D)+O 2 (a 1 Δ g ), from SO 2 photodissociation in highly excited states. The results revealed two dissociation pathways: One proceeds through the MEP to produce vibrationally colder O 2 (a 1 Δ g ) and the other yields vibrationally hotter O 2 (a 1 Δ g ) by means of a roaming pathway involving an intramolecular O abstraction during reorientation motion. Such roaming dynamics may well be the rule rather than the exception for molecular photodissociation through highly excited states.},

  abstract     = {In most solid electrolytes, the conduction pathways have a single coordination geometry. Han et al . designed electrolytes based on a Li 7 Si 2 S 7 I chemistry with ion arrangements similar to those in intermetallic systems. This leads to anion packing that alternates between hexagonal close packed structures and sheared face-centered cubic-like motifs to accommodate sulfur and iodine complexes, analogous to the structure of nickel-zirconium. The resulting materials have an interconnected set of 15 crystallographically separate lithium sites with a variety of geometries and anion coordination, providing a diverse path of conduction pathways for lithium ions and thus high conductivity. —Marc S. Lavine Fast cation transport in solids underpins energy storage. Materials design has focused on structures that can define transport pathways with minimal cation coordination change, restricting attention to a small part of chemical space. Motivated by the greater structural diversity of binary intermetallics than that of the metallic elements, we used two anions to build a pathway for three-dimensional superionic lithium ion conductivity that exploits multiple cation coordination environments. Li 7 Si 2 S 7 I is a pure lithium ion conductor created by an ordering of sulphide and iodide that combines elements of hexagonal and cubic close-packing analogously to the structure of NiZr. The resulting diverse network of lithium positions with distinct geometries and anion coordination chemistries affords low barriers to transport, opening a large structural space for high cation conductivity.},

  abstract     = {Many plant pathogens release cell wall–degrading enzymes to facilitate access into the cell. When cell walls degrade, short-chain wall fragments suppress immune responses, and long-chain fragments can enhance plant immunity. Using biochemical assays and protein structural analysis, Xiao et al . established how a plant polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) interacts with a fungal polygalacturonase enzyme (see the Perspective by Thynne and Kobe). They found that this interaction alters how the fungus binds to cell wall polysaccharides and influences substrate preferences and the types of degradation products generated to increase immunity. Proteins from two different species combine to make an enzymatic complex with different behavior from either alone. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the potential for engineering by modifying a related but inactive PGIP to become active. —Madeleine Seale Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) interact with pathogen-derived polygalacturonases to inhibit their virulence-associated plant cell wall–degrading activity but stimulate immunity-inducing oligogalacturonide production. Here we show that interaction between Phaseolus vulgaris PGIP2 (PvPGIP2) and Fusarium phyllophilum polygalacturonase (FpPG) enhances substrate binding, resulting in inhibition of the enzyme activity of FpPG. This interaction promotes FpPG-catalyzed production of long-chain immunoactive oligogalacturonides, while diminishing immunosuppressive short oligogalacturonides. PvPGIP2 binding creates a substrate binding site on PvPGIP2-FpPG, forming a new polygalacturonase with boosted substrate binding activity and altered substrate preference. Structure-based engineering converts a putative PGIP that initially lacks FpPG-binding activity into an effective FpPG-interacting protein. These findings unveil a mechanism for plants to transform pathogen virulence activity into a defense trigger and provide proof of principle for engineering PGIPs with broader specificity.},

  abstract     = {The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in the ocean is an inverse function of its temperature, a fact with worrisome implications for global warming. How oxygen is distributed in the ocean also matters for the health of the organisms that need it. Moretti et al . have shown that oxygen availability in the shallow subsurface waters of the tropical North Pacific actually rose during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a warm interval that has been considered a geologic analog to anthropogenic warming. This effect may have helped to prevent a mass extinction during the PETM. —H. Jesse Smith The global ocean’s oxygen inventory is declining in response to global warming, but the future of the low-oxygen tropics is uncertain. We report new evidence for tropical oxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a warming event that serves as a geologic analog to anthropogenic warming. Foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotopes indicate that the tropical North Pacific oxygen-deficient zone contracted during the PETM. A concomitant increase in foraminifera size implies that oxygen availability rose in the shallow subsurface throughout the tropical North Pacific. These changes are consistent with ocean model simulations of warming, in which a decline in biological productivity allows tropical subsurface oxygen to rise even as global ocean oxygen declines. The tropical oxygen increase may have helped avoid a mass extinction during the PETM.},

  abstract     = {Many small-molecule antibiotics target the bacterial ribosome, and there are many corresponding ribosome modifications that confer resistance by reducing the binding affinity of these molecules. One way to boost their affinity would be to lock these molecules in an ideal conformation for binding. Wu et al . used insights from structural analysis of ribosomes bound to previously developed antibiotics to design a conformationally restricted molecule, dubbed cresomycin, that adopts the exact conformation necessary for binding. Computational, structural, and biochemical experiments confirmed the expected binding mode. Cresomycin potently inhibits Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant strains, both in vitro and in a mouse infection model. —Michael A. Funk We report the design conception, chemical synthesis, and microbiological evaluation of the bridged macrobicyclic antibiotic cresomycin (CRM), which overcomes evolutionarily diverse forms of antimicrobial resistance that render modern antibiotics ineffective. CRM exhibits in vitro and in vivo efficacy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We show that CRM is highly preorganized for ribosomal binding by determining its density functional theory–calculated, solution-state, solid-state, and (wild-type) ribosome-bound structures, which all align identically within the macrobicyclic subunits. Lastly, we report two additional x-ray crystal structures of CRM in complex with bacterial ribosomes separately modified by the ribosomal RNA methylases, chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance (Cfr) and erythromycin-resistance ribosomal RNA methylase (Erm), revealing concessive adjustments by the target and antibiotic that permit CRM to maintain binding where other antibiotics fail.},

  abstract     = {Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection reduces plasma virus levels such that clinical assays for viremia are negative. Because of unexpected cooperativity in dose-response relationships and drug synergies, ART completely inhibits new infection events, halting viral evolution and disease progression ( 1 ). However, ART is not curative owing to a persistent latent reservoir of HIV-1, the half-life of which is long enough to guarantee lifetime persistence, even with optimal ART ( 2 ). Within weeks, interruption of ART leads to rebound viremia, with subsequent disease progression toward fatal immunodeficiency. Therefore, lifelong ART is necessary. People who acquire HIV-1 during their 20s face 50 to 60 years of continuous treatment with multiple antiretroviral drugs. Children infected perinatally face a lifetime of treatment. Thus, there is a pressing need for a cure, which, in a practical sense, amounts to preventing viral rebound after ART interruption. Present efforts focus on eliminating the reservoir.},

Broken chromosomes require repair, but telomeres need to be protected from repair because joining two telomeres would result in disastrous chromosome fusions. Telomerase is the enzyme that maintains chromosome ends by adding repeated DNA sequences. If directed to a DNA break, telomerase would erroneously create a new telomere, precipitating the loss of essential genetic material distal from the break site. Although extensive research has elucidated how telomeres evade DNA repair pathways, the question of telomerase’s misguided activity at DNA breaks in human cells has remained enigmatic. On page 763 of this issue, Kinzig et al . ( 1 ) report that telomerase can cause harmful neotelomere formation in human cells. They also show that such events are kept to a minimum by the naturally low prevalence of telomerase and the intervention of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) cellular signaling pathway.},

Although there is acknowledgment that forest landscape restoration (FLR) promoting tree planting should not cause the loss or conversion of open, nonforested ecosystems (i.e., they should not be afforested) ( 1 ), concerns have been raised that the focus on tree-based restoration combined with misclassification of grassy ecosystems could lead to misplaced restoration and destruction of intact, ancient ecosystems ( 2 ). Yet, the potential scale of the issue, or whether concerns are playing out in practice, are unknown. To understand the potential scale of tree planting in savannas and grasslands, we examined restoration pledges under the African Forest Restoration Initiative (AFR100) and on-the-ground projects, finding that tree planting is widespread across nonforest systems.},

Most health care providers in India know that oral rehydration salts (ORS) are an inexpensive, lifesaving treatment for child diarrhea, yet they are widely underused. Wagner et al . undertook randomized controlled trials involving standardized patients (actors trained to seek care for a child’s diarrhea) who visited 2282 private health care providers in India. Trials were designed to identify three barriers driving underutilization: assuming patients lack interest in ORS, incentives to prescribe more lucrative (but inappropriate) medicines, and incentives to sell non-ORS medicines in stock when ORS are unavailable. The dominant barrier was assuming that patients were uninterested, showing that simple interventions could save many lives. —Ekeoma Uzogara Most health care providers in developing countries know that oral rehydration salts (ORS) are a lifesaving and inexpensive treatment for child diarrhea, yet few prescribe it. This know-do gap has puzzled experts for decades. Using randomized experiments in India, we estimated the extent to which ORS underprescription is driven by perceptions that patients do not want ORS, provider’s financial incentives, and ORS stock-outs (out-of-stock events). Patients expressing a preference for ORS increased ORS prescribing by 27 percentage points. Eliminating stock-outs increased ORS provision by 7 percentage points. Removing financial incentives did not affect ORS prescribing on average but did increase ORS prescribing at pharmacies. We estimate that perceptions that patients do not want ORS explain 42% of underprescribing, whereas stock-outs and financial incentives explain only 6 and 5%, respectively.},

HT is a poorly understood process, so Gardner et al . designed experimental models to study the molecular events that underlie the conversion of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to neuroendocrine small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (see the Perspective by Berns). Switching certain genes on and off in either alveolar type 2 cells (the precursors of LUAD) or in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (precursors of SCLC) led to HT that mimicked that observed in human cancer. Neuroendocrine SCLC transformation was only observed when tumor cells reworked their oncogenic driver program from EGFR to the Myc oncogene. —Priscilla N. Kelly Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are thought to originate from different epithelial cell types in the lung. Intriguingly, LUAD can histologically transform into SCLC after treatment with targeted therapies. In this study, we designed models to follow the conversion of LUAD to SCLC and found that the barrier to histological transformation converges on tolerance to Myc, which we implicate as a lineage-specific driver of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. Histological transformations are frequently accompanied by activation of the Akt pathway. Manipulating this pathway permitted tolerance to Myc as an oncogenic driver, producing rare, stem-like cells that transcriptionally resemble the pulmonary basal lineage. These findings suggest that histological transformation may require the plasticity inherent to the basal stem cell, enabling tolerance to previously incompatible oncogenic driver programs.},

  abstract     = {Plants are highly responsive to photoperiodic cues, and in many parts of the world, daylength varies considerably throughout the year. Complex signaling networks have been identified that regulate the timing of flowering in response to daylength. Wang et al . found that a parallel mechanism exists to regulate vegetative growth (see the Perspective by Buckley and Haydon). Whereas flowering time primarily depends on light signaling, vegetative growth is controlled by photosynthetic and metabolic cues that change according to photoperiod. The authors found that photosynthetic control of vegetative growth is partially dependent on the production of myo-inositol, a precursor for many other molecules involved in plant growth. —Madeleine Seale Plants measure daylength (photoperiod) to regulate seasonal growth and flowering. Photoperiodic flowering has been well studied, but less is known about photoperiodic growth. By using a mutant with defects in photoperiodic growth, we identified a seasonal growth regulation pathway that functions in long days in parallel to the canonical long-day photoperiod flowering mechanism. This is achieved by using distinct mechanisms to detect different photoperiods: The flowering pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of light intensity, whereas the growth pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of photosynthetic activity (photosynthetic period). Plants can then independently control expression of genes required for flowering or growth. This demonstrates that seasonal flowering and growth are dissociable, allowing them to be coordinated independently across seasons.},

  abstract     = {The corpora cavernosa are masses of vascular tissue that can fill with blood and thereby enlarge upon stimulation, creating the structure needed for penile erection. By studying the underlying mechanism for this process in mice, Guimaraes et al . determined that perivascular fibroblasts in the corpora cavernosa play a key role in erection physiology (see the Perspective by Ryu and Koh). Norepinephrine is a vasoconstrictor that restricts penile blood flow at baseline, whereas vasodilators released by sexual arousal counteract its effects, allowing an erection to take place. Recurrent erectile activity down-regulates Notch signaling, thereby increasing the numbers of perivascular fibroblasts, and these fibroblasts then suppress vasoconstrictive norepinephrine signaling. Conversely, aging is associated with a decrease in these fibroblasts, contributing to the risk of erectile dysfunction. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Penile erection is mediated by the corpora cavernosa, a trabecular-like vascular bed that enlarges upon vasodilation, but its regulation is not completely understood. Here, we show that perivascular fibroblasts in the corpora cavernosa support vasodilation by reducing norepinephrine availability. The effect on penile blood flow depends on the number of fibroblasts, which is regulated by erectile activity. Erection dynamically alters the positional arrangement of fibroblasts, temporarily down-regulating Notch signaling. Inhibition of Notch increases fibroblast numbers and consequently raises penile blood flow. Continuous Notch activation lowers fibroblast numbers and reduces penile blood perfusion. Recurrent erections stimulate fibroblast proliferation and limit vasoconstriction, whereas aging reduces the number of fibroblasts and lowers penile blood flow. Our findings reveal adaptive, erectile activity-dependent modulation of penile blood flow by fibroblasts.},

These data show that the Proterozoic climate was temperate until temperatures began to fall during the early Paleozoic, around 500 million years ago. This drop in temperature occurred in concert with a decline in clay authigenesis and the rise of siliceous life, both of which would have contributed to declining levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. —H. Jesse Smith Earth’s persistent habitability since the Archean remains poorly understood. Using an oxygen isotope ensemble approach—comprising shale, iron oxide, carbonate, silica, and phosphate records—we reconcile a multibillion-year history of seawater δ 18 O, temperature, and marine and terrestrial clay abundance. Our results reveal a rise in seawater δ 18 O and a temperate Proterozoic climate distinct to interpretations of a hot early Earth, indicating a strongly buffered climate system. Precambrian sediments are enriched in marine authigenic clay, with prominent reductions occurring in concert with Paleozoic and Cenozoic cooling, the expansion of siliceous life, and the radiation of land plants. These findings support the notion that shifts in the locus and extent of clay formation contributed to seawater 18 O enrichment, clement early Earth conditions, major climate transitions, and climate stability through the reverse weathering feedback.},

They tested this hypothesis by modeling topographic dynamics on Madagascar over the past 45 million years and found high plant species richness and diversification rates along the landward-shifting continental rift escarpment, with low north-south connectivity and high rates of local endemism. This work shows how relatively small-scale, transient landscape evolution can shape long-term biodiversity patterns. —Bianca Lopez Madagascar exhibits high endemic biodiversity that has evolved with sustained and stable rates of speciation over the past several tens of millions of years. The topography of Madagascar is dominated by a mountainous continental rift escarpment, with the highest plant diversity and rarity found along the steep, eastern side of this geographic feature. Using a process-explicit model, we show that precipitation-driven erosion and landward retreat of this high-relief topography creates transient habitat organization through multiple mechanisms, including catchment expansion, isolation of highland remnants, and formation of topographic barriers. Habitat isolation and reconnection on a million-year timescale serves as an allopatric speciation pump creating the observed biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {During reproduction, flowering plants undergo two fertilization events to form the embryo and the nutritive endosperm. After gametes fuse, they must then resume cell cycle progression to allow them to divide and develop. Simonini et al . found that a protein called RBR1 holds the female endosperm precursor cell in stasis, preventing full DNA replication. During fertilization, the sperm cell delivers a D-type cyclin to the female cell to reactivate the cell cycle. These results give insight into the communication between parental cells to enable coordination of subsequent development. —Madeleine Seale In multicellular organisms, sexual reproduction relies on the formation of highly differentiated cells, the gametes, which await fertilization in a quiescent state. Upon fertilization, the cell cycle resumes. Successful development requires that male and female gametes are in the same phase of the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms that reinstate cell division in a fertilization-dependent manner are poorly understood in both animals and plants. Using Arabidopsis , we show that a sperm-derived signal induces the proliferation of a female gamete, the central cell, precisely upon fertilization. The central cell is arrested in S phase by the activity of the RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED1 (RBR1) protein. Upon fertilization, delivery of the core cell cycle component CYCD7;1 causes RBR1 degradation and thus S phase progression, ensuring the formation of functional endosperm and, consequently, viable seeds.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion provides the opportunity to make custom-built metal structures, but these objects can have undesirable variability in mechanical properties. Zhang et al . addressed the origin of this issue, unwanted metastable phases and columnar-shaped crystals, by adding molybdenum submicrometer particles to a common titanium alloy (see the Perspective by Zhang and Wang). The particles both encouraged the growth of symmetric grains and suppressed the formation of unwanted phases. The resulting samples made from laser powder bed fusion have much better mechanical properties, showing the promise of this design strategy. —Brent Grocholski Coarse columnar grains and heterogeneously distributed phases commonly form in metallic alloys produced by three-dimensional (3D) printing and are often considered undesirable because they can impart nonuniform and inferior mechanical properties. We demonstrate a design strategy to unlock consistent and enhanced properties directly from 3D printing. Using Ti−5Al−5Mo−5V−3Cr as a model alloy, we show that adding molybdenum (Mo) nanoparticles promotes grain refinement during solidification and suppresses the formation of phase heterogeneities during solid-state thermal cycling. The microstructural change because of the bifunctional additive results in uniform mechanical properties and simultaneous enhancement of both strength and ductility. We demonstrate how this alloy can be modified by a single component to address unfavorable microstructures, providing a pathway to achieve desirable mechanical characteristics directly from 3D printing.},

  abstract     = {One of the recipes for realizing topological superconductivity calls for interfacing a topological insulator with a superconductor. In a variant of that approach, Yi et al . grew a heterostructure consisting of layers of a magnetic topological insulator, (Bi,Sb) 2 Te 3 doped with chromium, and antiferromagnetic iron telluride. Neither of these materials is superconducting, but iron telluride is a parent compound for a family of iron-based superconductors. Interfacing the layers led to the appearance of superconductivity in the presence of ferromagnetism and topological band structure. This combination of properties makes the heterostructure a promising, although not yet proven, platform for observing chiral topological superconductivity. —Jelena Stajic The interface between two different materials can show unexpected quantum phenomena. In this study, we used molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize heterostructures formed by stacking together two magnetic materials, a ferromagnetic topological insulator (TI) and an antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide (FeTe). We observed emergent interface-induced superconductivity in these heterostructures and demonstrated the co-occurrence of superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and topological band structure in the magnetic TI layer—the three essential ingredients of chiral topological superconductivity (TSC). The unusual coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity is accompanied by a high upper critical magnetic field that exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit for conventional superconductors at low temperatures. These magnetic TI/FeTe heterostructures with robust superconductivity and atomically sharp interfaces provide an ideal wafer-scale platform for the exploration of chiral TSC and Majorana physics.},

The researchers used radiofrequency spectroscopy to map out local changes to the temperature. Above the superfluid transition, heat propagated diffusively, but below the transition, wave-like propagation characteristic of second sound was observed. —Jelena Stajic Heat transport can serve as a fingerprint identifying different states of matter. In a normal liquid, a hotspot diffuses, whereas in a superfluid, heat propagates as a wave called “second sound.” Direct imaging of heat transport is challenging, and one usually resorts to detecting secondary effects. In this study, we establish thermography of a strongly interacting atomic Fermi gas, whose radio-frequency spectrum provides spatially resolved thermometry with subnanokelvin resolution. The superfluid phase transition was directly observed as the sudden change from thermal diffusion to second-sound propagation and is accompanied by a peak in the second-sound diffusivity.

However, natural sources of hydrogen are rare and producing it is energy intensive. Truche et al . found a large natural source of hydrogen gas emitting from deep within the Bulqizë chromite mine. This large hydrogen flux is likely from long-term accumulation within a faulted reservoir. Places with similar geology should be good targets for finding other natural sources of hydrogen. —Brent Grocholski Deep crustal production of hydrogen (H 2 ) is a potential source of primary energy if recoverable accumulations in geological formations are sufficiently large. We report direct measurements of an elevated outgassing rate of 84% (by volume) of H 2 from the deep underground Bulqizë chromite mine in Albania. A minimum of 200 tons of H 2 is vented annually from the mine’s galleries, making it one of the largest recorded H 2 flow rates to date. We cannot attribute the flux solely to the release of paleo-fluids trapped within the rocks or to present-day active and pervasive serpentinization of ultramafic rocks; rather, our results demonstrate the presence of a faulted reservoir deeply rooted in the Jurassic ophiolite massif. This discovery suggests that certain ophiolites may host economically useful accumulations of H 2 gas.},

  abstract     = {Because proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids occur in just one of two mirror-image geometries in nature, it is likewise essential for chemists to make just one of the mirror images, or enantiomers, of many pharmaceutical compounds. Currently, the most common means of distinguishing enantiomers is by separating them with chromatography. Zhou et al . report a technique to determine enantiomeric ratios by mass spectrometry alone. The method relies on alternating current excitations of the ions to induce rotational trajectories in which each enantiomer experiences distinct collision behavior, leading to sufficient separation for high-resolution quantification. —Jake S. Yeston Conventional mass spectrometry does not distinguish between enantiomers, or mirror-image isomers. Here we report a technique to break the chiral symmetry and to differentiate enantiomers by inducing directional rotation of chiral gas-phase ions. Dual alternating current excitations were applied to manipulate the motions of trapped ions, including the rotation around the center of mass and macro movement around the center of the trap. Differences in collision cross section were induced, which could be measured by ion cloud profiling at high resolutions above 10,000. High-field ion mobility and tandem mass spectrometry analyses of the enantiomers were combined and implemented by using a miniature ion trap mass spectrometer. The effectiveness of the developed method was demonstrated with a variety of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, and several drug molecules, as well as a proof-of-principle ligand optimization study for asymmetric hydrogenation.},

  abstract     = {Chemical pollutants not only reduce animal survival and reproduction, but can also disrupt their senses, changing their behavior and interactions with other species. Common air pollutants such as ozone degrade floral scents, potentially affecting insects’ ability to locate and pollinate flowers. Chan et al . tested the effects of ozone and nitrate radicals (NO 3 ) on nocturnal hawkmoth pollination of a desert plant. Both pollutants decreased concentrations of monoterpenes, but NO 3 had a stronger effect. Degradation of scent molecules by NO 3 led to a decline in hawkmoth visitations in wind tunnel and field experiments, with predicted reductions in fruit set and plant fitness. A global model suggests that many urban areas have sufficient pollution to significantly reduce the distances at which pollinators can sense flowers. —Bianca Lopez There is growing concern about sensory pollutants affecting ecological communities. Anthropogenically enhanced oxidants [ozone (O 3 ) and nitrate radicals (NO 3 )] rapidly degrade floral scents, potentially reducing pollinator attraction to flowers. However, the physiological and behavioral impacts on pollinators and plant fitness are unknown. Using a nocturnal flower-moth system, we found that atmospherically relevant concentrations of NO 3 eliminate flower visitation by moths, and the reaction of NO 3 with a subset of monoterpenes is what reduces the scent’s attractiveness. Global atmospheric models of floral scent oxidation reveal that pollinators in certain urban areas may have a reduced ability to perceive and navigate to flowers. These results illustrate the impact of anthropogenic pollutants on an animal’s olfactory ability and indicate that such pollutants may be critical regulators of global pollination.},

  abstract     = {There are two main classes of lung cancer: non–small-cell lung cancer, which is predominantly the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) subtype that originates from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), for which pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are the main cell of origin. SCLC has the poorest prognosis, killing over 200,000 patients each year worldwide. Remarkably, ~10% of patients that present with LUAD driven by mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and receiving EGFR targeted therapy become refractory to the treatment through histological transformation (HT) into SCLC ( 1 ). A similar conversion to neuroendocrine tumors is occasionally observed in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma receiving androgen deprivation therapy ( 2 ). The drivers of these HTs and the transition stages involved have remained an enigma. On page 603 of this issue, Gardner et al . ( 3 ) identified the consecutive stages LUAD cells go through in HT to SCLC in mice, which helps to uncover this difficult-tostudy conversion in human cancer.},

  abstract     = {Daylength varies across the year and provides a cue for plants to respond to changing seasons. Photoperiodism, the ability to measure daylength, is critical for fitness and survival because of its influence on plant physiology and behavior. The timing of numerous developmental processes is controlled by daylength, including flowering, growth, dormancy, and senescence ( 1 ). Thus, photoperiodism has important implications for the regional adaptation of crops and migration of plant populations in response to climate change ( 2 ). Seasonal control of flowering occurs by a well-defined molecular pathway that measures photoperiod as the duration of light, as detected by photoreceptors. On page 605 of this issue, Wang et al. ( 3 ) describe a new mechanism of daylength measurement that detects the duration of photosynthetic output and is required for rapid growth during long summer days. The study demonstrates that plants use multiple, independent mechanisms to measure daylength that can differentially influence distinct developmental processes.},

  abstract     = {Sexual well-being in men depends on the ability to attain penile erection, which can be compromised by aging and chronic conditions, including diabetes and atherosclerosis ( 1 ). Penile erection results from acetylcholine-and nitric oxide–induced dilation of the supplying arteries and sponge-like corpora cavernosa tissue and relaxation of smooth muscle ( 2 ). The extent and duration of penile erection is determined by the balance between these vasodilators and the vasoconstrictor norepinephrine ( 3 , 4 ). On page 604 of this issue, Linck Guimaraes et al. ( 5 ) report that perivascular fibroblasts expressing the high-affinity amino acid transporter SLC1A3 (solute carrier family 1, member 3) are essential for penile erection in mice because they reduce norepinephrine availability, thereby promoting dilation of the corpora cavernosa. The number of SLC1A3 + perivascular fibroblasts decreased in aged mice, which reduced penile blood flow. Because the mechanisms of penile erection are similar in mice and humans ( 4 ), these findings may be relevant to erectile dysfunction in aged men.},

  abstract     = {Chemical total synthesis of paclitaxel, an important anticancer drug originally derived from yew bark, has been an important challenge for organic chemists, but the material used for drug production comes from isolation of the natural product or semisynthesis from precursors. It is therefore important to fully understand the biosynthetic pathway in plants. Jiang et al . identified a cytochrome P450 enzyme that generates a key chemical feature in the final products, a four-membered oxetane ring. The authors found that a parallel epoxidation is off pathway and not an essential intermediate. Along the way, they characterized another oxidation enzyme and ultimately reconstituted nine total enzymes in tobacco to demonstrate a minimal pathway to a key intermediate product: baccatin III. —Michael A. Funk Paclitaxel is a well known anticancer compound. Its biosynthesis involves the formation of a highly functionalized diterpenoid core skeleton (baccatin III) and the subsequent assembly of a phenylisoserinoyl side chain. Despite intensive investigation for half a century, the complete biosynthetic pathway of baccatin III remains unknown. In this work, we identified a bifunctional cytochrome P450 enzyme [taxane oxetanase 1 (TOT1)] in Taxus mairei that catalyzes an oxidative rearrangement in paclitaxel oxetane formation, which represents a previously unknown enzyme mechanism for oxetane ring formation. We created a screening strategy based on the taxusin biosynthesis pathway and uncovered the enzyme responsible for the taxane oxidation of the C9 position (T9αH1). Finally, we artificially reconstituted a biosynthetic pathway for the production of baccatin III in tobacco.},

Jammal Salameh et al . discovered a subpopulation of neurons within the olfactory bulb that can directly sense cardiovascular pressure pulsations (see the Perspective by Hamill). The modulation of their excitability is transduced by mechanosensitive ion channels. Thus, there exists a fast pathway for the interoception of heartbeat whereby arterial pressure pulsations within the brain modulate neuronal activity. —Peter Stern The transmission of the heartbeat through the cerebral vascular system causes intracranial pressure pulsations. We discovered that arterial pressure pulsations can directly modulate central neuronal activity. In a semi-intact rat brain preparation, vascular pressure pulsations elicited correlated local field oscillations in the olfactory bulb mitral cell layer. These oscillations did not require synaptic transmission but reflected baroreceptive transduction in mitral cells. This transduction was mediated by a fast excitatory mechanosensitive ion channel and modulated neuronal spiking activity. In awake animals, the heartbeat entrained the activity of a subset of olfactory bulb neurons within ~20 milliseconds. Thus, we propose that this fast, intrinsic interoceptive mechanism can modulate perception—for example, during arousal—within the olfactory bulb and possibly across various other brain areas.},

Many projectome subtypes were enriched in specific HIP subdomains defined by spatial transcriptomic profiles. Furthermore, we delineated comprehensive wiring diagrams for HIP neurons projecting exclusively within the HIP formation (HPF) and for those projecting to both intra- and extra-HPF targets.

  abstract     = {Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a protein that is critical for the survival of immune cells called B lymphocytes. Inhibitors of BTK have demonstrated clinical efficacy for patients with B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, drug resistance can develop when tumors acquire mutations in BTK. Montoya et al . found mutations that alter BTK function in tumors, some of which conferred a new function of BTK that does not require its kinase activity (see the Perspective by Davis and Westin). This discovery led to the development of NX-2127, a drug that could degrade both wild-type and mutant forms of the BTK protein. In a phase 1 clinical trial, NX-2127 showed clinical benefit in CLL patients and may provide a means of treating those tumors resistant to current BTK inhibitors. —Priscilla N. Kelly Increasing use of covalent and noncovalent inhibitors of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has elucidated a series of acquired drug-resistant BTK mutations in patients with B cell malignancies. Here we identify inhibitor resistance mutations in BTK with distinct enzymatic activities, including some that impair BTK enzymatic activity while imparting novel protein-protein interactions that sustain B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Furthermore, we describe a clinical-stage BTK and IKZF1/3 degrader, NX-2127, that can bind and proteasomally degrade each mutant BTK proteoform, resulting in potent blockade of BCR signaling. Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with NX-2127 achieves &gt;80% degradation of BTK in patients and demonstrates proof-of-concept therapeutic benefit.

  abstract     = {Ribozymes are RNA-based enzymes that typically catalyze self-cleavage or splicing reactions. Liu et al . have now discovered hydrolytic endonucleolytic ribozymes (HYERs), which have the capability to precisely manipulate DNA. These ribozymes operate independently of proteins and can edit genes in both bacteria and human cells, offering a potential alternative to CRISPR and other gene-editing tools. A critical aspect of their function is that some HYERs adopt a homodimer structure that recognizes DNA through a complementary target recognition sequence and cleaves the DNA hydrolytically. Using reprogramming, the authors were able to redirect HYERs to new DNA targets, enhancing their precision and versatility. —Di Jiang Ribozymes are catalytic RNAs with diverse functions including self-splicing and polymerization. This work aims to discover natural ribozymes that behave as hydrolytic and sequence-specific DNA endonucleases, which could be repurposed as DNA manipulation tools. Focused on bacterial group II-C introns, we found that many systems without intron-encoded protein propagate multiple copies in their resident genomes. These introns, named HYdrolytic Endonucleolytic Ribozymes (HYERs), cleaved RNA, single-stranded DNA, bubbled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and plasmids in vitro. HYER1 generated dsDNA breaks in the mammalian genome. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis revealed a homodimer structure for HYER1, where each monomer contains a Mg 2+ -dependent hydrolysis pocket and captures DNA complementary to the target recognition site (TRS). Rational designs including TRS extension, recruiting sequence insertion, and heterodimerization yielded engineered HYERs showing improved specificity and flexibility for DNA manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Hippocampal phase precession is a potential mechanism for the generation of theta sequences involved in learning places and events. As an animal passes through a place field, pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and associated regions fire at progressively earlier theta phases. It is still unclear whether theta-phase precession generation occurs within individual place cells or if it is inherited from other regions. Sloin et al . induced artificial place fields by optogenetically stimulating pyramidal cells and found that artificially generated place fields exhibited theta-phase precession. These results rule out the hypothesis that theta-phase precession in hippocampal area CA1 is driven by other inputs. —Peter Stern Hippocampal theta-phase precession is involved in spatiotemporal coding and in generating multineural spike sequences, but how precession originates remains unresolved. To determine whether precession can be generated directly in hippocampal area CA1 and disambiguate multiple competing mechanisms, we used closed-loop optogenetics to impose artificial place fields in pyramidal cells of mice running on a linear track. More than one-third of the CA1 artificial fields exhibited synthetic precession that persisted for a full theta cycle. By contrast, artificial fields in the parietal cortex did not exhibit synthetic precession. These findings are incompatible with precession models based on inheritance, dual-input, spreading activation, inhibition-excitation summation, or somato-dendritic competition. Thus, a precession generator resides locally within CA1.},

  abstract     = {Tempering through controlled heating and cooling cycles is used to adjust the microstructure of a range of materials, including many metals and even chocolate. Boynton et al . extended this idea to reversible transformations of the mechanical properties in a single polymer system (see the Perspective by McAllister and Kalow). This method was achieved through the inclusion of thia-Michael bonds that are relatively weak and capable of reshuffling at lower temperatures compared with the covalent bonds in the polymer. At higher tempering temperatures, the cross-link density of the thia-Michael network decreases, resulting in a lower stiffness of the material, whereas tempering at lower temperatures creates a stiffer material. The material exhibits shape memory properties attributed to the dynamic reaction–induced phase separation caused by the change in bound and unbound cross-links. —Marc S. Lavine Pluripotency, which is defined as a system not fixed as to its developmental potentialities, is typically associated with biology and stem cells. Inspired by this concept, we report synthetic polymers that act as a single “pluripotent” feedstock and can be differentiated into a range of materials that exhibit different mechanical properties, from hard and brittle to soft and extensible. To achieve this, we have exploited dynamic covalent networks that contain labile, dynamic thia-Michael bonds, whose extent of bonding can be thermally modulated and retained through tempering, akin to the process used in metallurgy. In addition, we show that the shape memory behavior of these materials can be tailored through tempering and that these materials can be patterned to spatially control mechanical properties.},

Nonetheless, site selectivity in alkyl chains remains a challenge. Wang et al . used an iron chloride photocatalyst to prompt a reversible hydrogen atom transfer process that samples sites along the chain and ultimately appends boronic esters to the end carbon with high selectivity. A flow system enabled efficient reactivity at multigram scale. —Jake S. Yeston Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes can overcome the strong bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of inert C(sp 3 )–H bonds and thereby convert feedstock alkanes into value-added fine chemicals. Nevertheless, the high reactivity of HAT reagents, coupled with the small differences among various C(sp 3 )–H bond strengths, renders site-selective transformations of straight-chain alkanes a great challenge. Here, we present a photocatalytic intermolecular radical sampling process for the iron-catalyzed borylation of terminal C(sp 3 )–H bonds in substrates with small steric hindrance, including unbranched alkanes. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that the reaction proceeds through a reversible HAT process, followed by a selective borylation of carbon radicals.

Due to extirpations of many large herbivorous mammals and the spread of others by people, many ecosystems host megaherbivores that did not coevolve with the local plant species. Lundgren et al . investigated whether introduced species therefore have stronger and more negative effects on plant abundance and diversity (see the Perspective by Buckley and Torsney). In their meta-analysis of more than 200 studies, they found no differences between introduced and native megaherbivore impacts or evidence for stronger impacts of functionally novel species. Instead, large-bodied herbivores and those with selective diets had a stronger effect on vegetation (e.g., grass feeders reducing graminoid diversity), suggesting a stronger role for species’ traits than origins in determining their impacts. —Bianca Lopez Large mammalian herbivores (megafauna) have experienced extinctions and declines since prehistory. Introduced megafauna have partly counteracted these losses yet are thought to have unusually negative effects on plants compared with native megafauna. Using a meta-analysis of 3995 plot-scale plant abundance and diversity responses from 221 studies, we found no evidence that megafauna impacts were shaped by nativeness, “invasiveness,” “feralness,” coevolutionary history, or functional and phylogenetic novelty. Nor was there evidence that introduced megafauna facilitate introduced plants more than native megafauna. Instead, we found strong evidence that functional traits shaped megafauna impacts, with larger-bodied and bulk-feeding megafauna promoting plant diversity. Our work suggests that trait-based ecology provides better insight into interactions between megafauna and plants than do concepts of nativeness.},

This route minimizes impurity ions such as calcium that form charge carrier traps. For inverted solar cells, a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.3% was obtained, and 94% of this efficiency was retained after 1000 hours of continuous operation at 50ºC. —Phil Szuromi High-purity precursor materials are vital for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to reduce defect density caused by impurities in perovskite. In this study, we present aqueous synthesized perovskite microcrystals as precursor materials for PSCs. Our approach enables kilogram-scale mass production and synthesizes formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI 3 ) microcrystals with up to 99.996% purity, with an average value of 99.994 ± 0.0015%, from inexpensive, low-purity raw materials. The reduction in calcium ions, which made up the largest impurity in the aqueous solution, led to the greatest reduction in carrier trap states, and its deliberate introduction was shown to decrease device performance. With these purified precursors, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6% (25.3% certified) in inverted PSCs and retained 94% of the initial PCE after 1000 hours of continuous simulated solar illumination at 50°C.},

However, computational analyses have neglected sign languages (SLs) and the history of the marginalized deaf communities who use them. Abner et al . examined two continents, Europe and Asia, using computational phylogenetics to understand SL relatedness and did not find evidence of long-term contact between continents. Among European SLs, cues of the geopolitical history of people that established deaf education schools surfaced. Two subfamilies of Asian SLs emerged that reflected intergenerational language transmission. SLs are critical for the intellectual development of deaf people, and these advances can contribute to their inclusion in society and to equitable historical recordkeeping. —Ekeoma Uzogara Sign languages are naturally occurring languages. As such, their emergence and spread reflect the histories of their communities. However, limitations in historical recordkeeping and linguistic documentation have hindered the diachronic analysis of sign languages. In this work, we used computational phylogenetic methods to study family structure among 19 sign languages from deaf communities worldwide. We used phonologically coded lexical data from contemporary languages to infer relatedness and suggest that these methods can help study regular form changes in sign languages. The inferred trees are consistent in key respects with known historical information but challenge certain assumed groupings and surpass analyses made available by traditional methods. Moreover, the phylogenetic inferences are not reducible to geographic distribution but do affirm the importance of geopolitical forces in the histories of human languages.},

  abstract     = {A recurring theme in prokaryotic immune systems including CRISPR-Cas is the strategy of an infected host to sacrifice itself to save the population from being infected. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems use highly diverse signal transduction mechanisms to achieve this end. Steens et al . studied a sophisticated type III system from the myxobacterium Haliangium ochraceum . They found that target recognition triggered the allosteric activation of a caspase-like protease (SAVED-CHAT) that specifically cleaved and activated yet another caspase-like protease (PCaspase). The latter enzyme had a broad substrate specificity that resulted in dormancy or death of the infected host cell. —Di Jiang The generation of cyclic oligoadenylates and subsequent allosteric activation of proteins that carry sensory domains is a distinctive feature of type III CRISPR-Cas systems. In this work, we characterize a set of associated genes of a type III-B system from Haliangium ochraceum that contains two caspase-like proteases, SAVED-CHAT and PCaspase (prokaryotic caspase), co-opted from a cyclic oligonucleotide–based antiphage signaling system (CBASS). Cyclic tri–adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–induced oligomerization of SAVED-CHAT activates proteolytic activity of the CHAT domains, which specifically cleave and activate PCaspase. Subsequently, activated PCaspase cleaves a multitude of proteins, which results in a strong interference phenotype in vivo in Escherichia coli. Taken together, our findings reveal how a CRISPR-Cas–based detection of a target RNA triggers a cascade of caspase-associated proteolytic activities.},

This hotly debated question in early language acquisition has been traditionally examined in laboratories, limiting generalizability to real-world settings. Vong et al . investigated the question in an unprecedented, longitudinal manner using head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experiences in naturalistic settings. By applying machine learning, they introduced the Child’s View for Contrastive Learning (CVCL) model, pairing video frames that co-occurred with uttered words, and embedded the images and words in shared representational spaces. CVCL represents sets of visually similar things from one concept (e.g., puzzles) through distinct subclusters (animal versus alphabet puzzles). It combines associative and representation learning that fills gaps in language acquisition research and theories. —Ekeoma Uzogara Starting around 6 to 9 months of age, children begin acquiring their first words, linking spoken words to their visual counterparts. How much of this knowledge is learnable from sensory input with relatively generic learning mechanisms, and how much requires stronger inductive biases? Using longitudinal head-mounted camera recordings from one child aged 6 to 25 months, we trained a relatively generic neural network on 61 hours of correlated visual-linguistic data streams, learning feature-based representations and cross-modal associations. Our model acquires many word-referent mappings present in the child’s everyday experience, enables zero-shot generalization to new visual referents, and aligns its visual and linguistic conceptual systems. These results show how critical aspects of grounded word meaning are learnable through joint representation and associative learning from one child’s input.},

The outcome is analogous to the well-known Pauson-Khand reaction that couples unsaturated compounds with carbon monoxide, although in that case a cobalt catalyst is necessary. The authors posit that the triplet nature of the nitrene guides the ensuing reactivity of the pair of double bonds. —Jake S.

Coupling two unsaturated bonds with carbon monoxide, the transformation remains limited to CO as a C 1 building block. Herein we report analogous cycloaddition reactions with nitrenes as an N 1 unit. The reaction of a nonconjugated diene with a nitrene precursor produces bicyclic bioisosteres of common saturated heterocycles such as piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies support relaying of the diradical nature of triplet nitrene into the π-system.

  abstract     = {In December 2022, China selected 49 locations for national park development, with the goal of creating a large national park system, and construction is now beginning. The sites include three sea locations and two land-sea areas (1). China’s current 271 marine protected areas (MPAs) account for about 4.1% of the total sea area under China’s jurisdiction (2). Although they help to protect coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, bays, islands, and rare and endangered marine species (2, 3), they provide inadequate connectivity among species and habitats. The five proposed marine national parks will achieve incremental improvements. As China expands its terrestrial national park system, it should also create a vast marine national park system, including existing, proposed, and future MPAs that can effectively protect intact ecosystems and maintain continuous ecological processes, such as food chains and migrations (4, 5).},

  abstract     = {Many governments and industries are relying on future large-scale, land-based carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) removal (CDR) to avoid making necessary steep greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts today ( 1 , 2 ). Not only does this risk locking us into a high overshoot above 1.5°C ( 3 ), but it will also increase biodiversity loss, imperiling the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) goals ( 4 ). Such CDR deployments also pose major economic, technological, and social feasibility challenges; threaten food security and human rights; and risk overstepping multiple planetary boundaries, with potentially irreversible consequences ( 1 , 5 , 6 ). We propose three ways to build on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) analyses of CDR mitigation potential by assessing sustainability risks associated with land-use change and biodiversity loss: estimate the sustainable CDR budget based on socioecological thresholds; identify viable mitigation pathways that do not overstep these thresholds; and reframe governance around allocating limited CDR supply to the most legitimate uses.},

These oscillations are important because by moving the neuronal resting membrane potential toward and away from the spike threshold, they can synchronize spike activity in local and remote neural networks. All three classes of oscillation are dependent on synaptic transmission; have been recorded in other brain regions, most notably in the human cerebral cortex and hippocampus; and are considered fundamental to how the brain normally processes information ( 2 ).

Our open-source platform combines a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, inexpensive Internet of Things devices, and an in-line benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to enable automated, data-rich optimization with a closed-loop Bayesian optimization strategy. A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily monitor, analyze, and improve photocatalytic reactions with respect to both continuous and discrete variables.

In an enduring experiment, 12 lineages of Escherichia coli have been maintained for more than 75,000 generations, with each generation sampled and preserved. Couce et al . made transposon insertion libraries in ancestral and evolved strains taken at the 50,000 generation point and measured fitness in competition experiments using these samples. The numbers of beneficial mutations rapidly tailed off during long-term passage, with parallel changes in fitness cost and gene essentiality occurring across the lineages. The authors found nonessential genes that became essential and essential genes that became nonessential in all lineages. Predictability stemmed from the importance of loss-of-function mutations that scale with the length of the target genes. —Caroline Ash The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations shapes evolution, but it is challenging to observe how it changes as organisms adapt. Using Escherichia coli lineages spanning 50,000 generations of evolution, we quantify the fitness effects of insertion mutations in every gene. Macroscopically, the fraction of deleterious mutations changed little over time whereas the beneficial tail declined sharply, approaching an exponential distribution. Microscopically, changes in individual gene essentiality and deleterious effects often occurred in parallel; altered essentiality is only partly explained by structural variation. The identity and effect sizes of beneficial mutations changed rapidly over time, but many targets of selection remained predictable because of the importance of loss-of-function mutations. Taken together, these results reveal the dynamic—but statistically predictable—nature of mutational fitness effects.},

The transcription factor RAM1 is required for AM symbioses and regulates lipid provisioning. Ivanov and Harrison found another mechanism by which plants control lipid production and transport to fungi. This system involves two cyclin-dependent kinase–like proteins that operate both in parallel and in conjunction with the established RAM1 pathway. This work gives insight into a regulatory process fundamental to plant nutrition and growth. —Madeleine Seale The mutualistic association between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi requires intracellular accommodation of the fungal symbiont and maintenance by means of lipid provisioning. Symbiosis signaling through lysin motif (LysM) receptor-like kinases and a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS 2 (DMI2) activates transcriptional programs that underlie fungal passage through the epidermis and accommodation in cortical cells. We show that two Medicago truncatula cortical cell–specific, membrane-bound proteins of a CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE-LIKE (CKL) family associate with, and are phosphorylation substrates of, DMI2 and a subset of the LysM receptor kinases. CKL1 and CKL2 are required for AM symbiosis and control expression of transcription factors that regulate part of the lipid provisioning program. Onset of lipid provisioning is coupled with arbuscule branching and with the REDUCED ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA 1 (RAM1) regulon for complete endosymbiont accommodation.},

  abstract     = {Methylsiloxanes are organosilicon compounds produced by humans for use in a wide range of consumer products. Because they are not naturally found in nature, they are not readily degraded by organisms and some also have the potential to bioaccumulate. Sarai et al . identified a cytochrome P450 enzyme that can perform a hydroxylation on the methyl groups of linear methylsiloxanes. They then expanded this activity using directed evolution, creating variants that were more efficient and also functioned on cyclic methylsiloxanes. Mechanistic experiments suggested that a second oxidation and an enzyme-facilitated rearrangement can lead to cleavage of the carbon–silicon bond and release of formaldehyde. —Michael A. Funk Volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS) are man-made, nonbiodegradable chemicals produced at a megaton-per-year scale, which leads to concern over their potential for environmental persistence, long-range transport, and bioaccumulation. We used directed evolution to engineer a variant of bacterial cytochrome P450 BM3 to break silicon-carbon bonds in linear and cyclic VMS. To accomplish silicon-carbon bond cleavage, the enzyme catalyzes two tandem oxidations of a siloxane methyl group, which is followed by putative [1,2]-Brook rearrangement and hydrolysis. Discovery of this so-called siloxane oxidase opens possibilities for the eventual biodegradation of VMS.},

The influence of these displaced species on the existing ecology of their new location can vary from damaging to positive, and many of their impacts may be much more subtle than one might predict. For example, the big-headed ant, originally described in Mauritius, has spread throughout much of the subtropical and tropical world. Kamaru et al . characterized how its presence at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya disrupted a mutualism between native ants and acacia trees that led to increased herbivory by elephants and ultimately a shift in lion prey species from zebra to buffalo (see the Perspective by Gaynor). —Sacha Vignieri Mutualisms often define ecosystems, but they are susceptible to human activities. Combining experiments, animal tracking, and mortality investigations, we show that the invasive big-headed ant ( Pheidole megacephala ) makes lions ( Panthera leo ) less effective at killing their primary prey, plains zebra ( Equus quagga ). Big-headed ants disrupted the mutualism between native ants ( Crematogaster spp.) and the dominant whistling-thorn tree ( Vachellia drepanolobium ), rendering trees vulnerable to elephant ( Loxodonta africana ) browsing and resulting in landscapes with higher visibility. Although zebra kills were significantly less likely to occur in higher-visibility, invaded areas, lion numbers did not decline since the onset of the invasion, likely because of prey-switching to African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer ). We show that by controlling biophysical structure across landscapes, a tiny invader reconfigured predator-prey dynamics among iconic species.},

  abstract     = {Air pollution from gaseous organic compounds generated by petrochemical extraction typically is estimated using measurements of a subset of those species, volatile organic compounds. He et al . showed that this approach can vastly underestimate the true magnitude of the problem. Their aircraft-based measurements of total gas-phase organic carbon concentrations over the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, revealed that emissions from that region alone were much larger than estimates made on the basis of more limited arrays of species by as much as a factor of 64. The underreported species included abundant precursors to secondary air pollution that must be included in organic carbon pollution monitoring and reporting. —H. Jesse Smith Anthropogenic organic carbon emissions reporting has been largely limited to subsets of chemically speciated volatile organic compounds. However, new aircraft-based measurements revealed total gas-phase organic carbon emissions that exceed oil sands industry–reported values by 1900% to over 6300%, the bulk of which was due to unaccounted-for intermediate-volatility and semivolatile organic compounds. Measured facility-wide emissions represented approximately 1% of extracted petroleum, resulting in total organic carbon emissions equivalent to that from all other sources across Canada combined. These real-world observations demonstrate total organic carbon measurements as a means of detecting unknown or underreported carbon emissions regardless of chemical features. Because reporting gaps may include hazardous, reactive, or secondary air pollutants, fully constraining the impact of anthropogenic emissions necessitates routine, comprehensive total organic carbon monitoring as an inherent check on mass closure.},

  abstract     = {Mutations introduced when copying the genomic DNA of an organism can be selected for if they provide an advantage to the offspring, but high levels of mutation in the genome can cause catastrophic defects and are selected against. Thus, organisms acquire new functions very slowly. Tian et al . introduced user-defined DNA into an Escherichia coli cell in such a way that it is selectively copied and rapidly mutated by distinct replication machinery without affecting the organism’s genome (see the Perspective by Williams and Liu). This approach massively accelerates the evolution of new function from user-defined DNA sequences without passing on catastrophic defects to offspring. —Di Jiang The evolution of new function in living organisms is slow and fundamentally limited by their critical mutation rate. Here, we established a stable orthogonal replication system in Escherichia coli. The orthogonal replicon can carry diverse cargos of at least 16.5 kilobases and is not copied by host polymerases but is selectively copied by an orthogonal DNA polymerase (O-DNAP), which does not copy the genome. We designed mutant O-DNAPs that selectively increase the mutation rate of the orthogonal replicon by two to four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the utility of our system for accelerated continuous evolution by evolving a 150-fold increase in resistance to tigecycline in 12 days. And, starting from a GFP variant, we evolved a 1000-fold increase in cellular fluorescence in 5 days.},

  abstract     = {Age-associated B cells (ABCs) are a distinct subset of B cells that accumulate as we age and during some chronic infections. ABCs also contribute to the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. Dai et al . report that the transcription factor ZEB2 is critical in driving ABC formation and pathogenicity in both mice and humans. ZEB2 promotes the gene signature, phenotype (e.g., CD11c expression), and function (e.g., phagocytic ability) of ABCs. Moreover, ZEB2 represses MEF2B, a transcription factor that instructs germinal center development, which consequently steers ABCs toward an extrafollicular response. ZEB2’s regulation of ABCs also requires JAK-STAT signaling, which suggests that targeting this pathway may reduce ABCs in autoimmune disease. —Seth Thomas Scanlon Age-associated B cells (ABCs) accumulate during infection, aging, and autoimmunity, contributing to lupus pathogenesis. In this study, we screened for transcription factors driving ABC formation and found that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is required for human and mouse ABC differentiation in vitro. ABCs are reduced in ZEB2 haploinsufficient individuals and in mice lacking Zeb2 in B cells. In mice with toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)–driven lupus, ZEB2 is essential for ABC formation and autoimmune pathology. ZEB2 binds to +20-kb myocyte enhancer factor 2b ( Mef2b )’s intronic enhancer, repressing MEF2B-mediated germinal center B cell differentiation and promoting ABC formation. ZEB2 also targets genes important for ABC specification and function, including Itgax . ZEB2-driven ABC differentiation requires JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription), and treatment with JAK1/3 inhibitor reduces ABC accumulation in autoimmune mice and patients. Thus, ZEB2 emerges as a driver of B cell autoimmunity.},

We train a deep learning model using aerial imagery and geophysical data to predict 150,000 jurisdictional determinations from the Army Corps of Engineers, each deciding regulation for one water resource. Under a 2006 Supreme Court ruling, the Clean Water Act protects two-thirds of US streams and more than half of wetlands; under a 2020 White House rule, it protects less than half of streams and a fourth of wetlands, implying deregulation of 690,000 stream miles, 35 million wetland acres, and 30% of waters around drinking-water sources.

  abstract     = {Quasars contain an accreting supermassive black hole that ejects a jet of plasma moving at relativistic speeds. The acceleration process in relativistic jets is poorly understood. The H.E.S.S. Collaboration observed SS 433, a nearby stellar-mass analog to distant quasars, in teraelectron volt gamma rays and spatially resolved gamma-ray emission at different energies, finding a different distribution from previous x-ray observations (see the Perspective by Bosch-Ramon). By modeling the emission mechanism from plasma moving along the jet, the authors showed that electrons were accelerated to high energies at a shock front located several parsecs from the black hole. The same process might operate in other relativistic jets. —Keith T. Smith SS 433 is a microquasar, a stellar binary system that launches collimated relativistic jets. We observed SS 433 in gamma rays using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and found an energy-dependent shift in the apparent position of the gamma-ray emission from the parsec-scale jets. These observations trace the energetic electron population and indicate that inverse Compton scattering is the emission mechanism of the gamma rays. Our modeling of the energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology constrains the location of particle acceleration and requires an abrupt deceleration of the jet flow. We infer the presence of shocks on either side of the binary system, at distances of 25 to 30 parsecs, and that self-collimation of the precessing jets forms the shocks, which then efficiently accelerate electrons.},

  abstract     = {To the untrained eye, the Claisen rearrangement’s manner of swapping connectivity between carbon and oxygen atoms in a six-atom framework looks almost like a magic trick. The reaction is also a challenge to control, because there no obvious binding points for a catalyst or modes for acceleration. Zhang et al . now report that a chiral phosphorus-based catalyst can induce enantioselectivity in the Eschenmoser-Claisen variation to produce amides with quaternary stereocenters. Key to the activation protocol is an imine reduction to form a phosphorus–nitrogen bond that sets up the requisite geometry and is later cleaved by a silane to achieve turnover. —Jake S. Yeston An important challenge in enantioselective catalysis is developing strategies for the precise synthesis of neighboring congested all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. The well-defined transition states of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements and their underlying stereospecificity render them powerful tools for the synthesis of such arrays. However, this type of pericyclic reaction remains notoriously difficult to catalyze, especially in an enantioselective fashion. Herein, we describe an enantioselective reductive Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement catalyzed by chiral 1,3,2-diazaphospholene-hydrides. This developed transformation enables full control of the two newly formed acyclic stereogenic centers, leading to amides with vicinal all-carbon quaternary-tertiary or quaternary-quaternary carbon atoms.},

Zhang et al . found a new phase in the strontium aluminum oxide system capable of producing free-standing oxide films that are crack free across relatively large areas. The substrates are water soluble, allowing for an easy method with which to release the oxide films of interest. The material should enable the production of relatively high-quality films for a wide variety of potential applications. —Brent Grocholski Identifying a suitable water-soluble sacrificial layer is crucial to fabricating large-scale freestanding oxide membranes, which offer attractive functionalities and integrations with advanced semiconductor technologies. Here, we introduce a water-soluble sacrificial layer, “super-tetragonal” Sr 4 Al 2 O 7 (SAO T ). The low-symmetric crystal structure enables a superior capability to sustain epitaxial strain, allowing for broad tunability in lattice constants. The resultant structural coherency and defect-free interface in perovskite ABO 3 /SAO T heterostructures effectively restrain crack formation during the water release of freestanding oxide membranes. For a variety of nonferroelectric oxide membranes, the crack-free areas can span up to a millimeter in scale. This compelling feature, combined with the inherent high water solubility, makes SAO T a versatile and feasible sacrificial layer for producing high-quality freestanding oxide membranes, thereby boosting their potential for innovative device applications.},

Studying interactions in such systems can lead to both improved clock precision and insights into many-body physics. Hutson et al . investigated strontium-87 atoms placed in a cubic optical lattice and measured the effects of resonant dipole-dipole interactions. They found that the interactions caused a tiny clock shift, the magnitude of which could be controlled by varying the relative orientation of the probe light and the atomic dipoles. —Jelena Stajic Collective couplings of atomic dipoles to a shared electromagnetic environment produce a wide range of many-body phenomena. We report on the direct observation of resonant electric dipole-dipole interactions in a cubic array of atoms in the many-excitation limit. The interactions produce spatially dependent cooperative Lamb shifts when spectroscopically interrogating the millihertz-wide optical clock transition in strontium-87. We show that the ensemble-averaged shifts can be suppressed below the level of evaluated systematic uncertainties for optical atomic clocks. Additionally, we demonstrate that excitation of the atomic dipoles near a Bragg angle can enhance these effects by nearly an order of magnitude compared with nonresonant geometries. Our work demonstrates a platform for precise studies of the quantum many-body physics of spins with long-range interactions mediated by propagating photons.},

Finding an invasive cancer while it is still localized and without clinically detectable metastatic spread provides the best chance at eradicating the primary tumor through surgery and/or radiation and killing any disseminated microscopic cells through therapeutic drugs. The recent development of blood-based multicancer detection (MCD) assays, together with advances in imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, have the potential to transform early cancer detection.

Collectively, cities drive global change at an unprecedented scale, transforming land cover, hydrological systems, climate, biogeochemistry, and habitats. Cities are the nucleus from which humanities’ impact on all Earth systems can be observed. One would thus expect urban dynamics and impacts to be at the top of global governance agendas. We argue that one key factor that contributes to this lack of recognition is the absence of a global-level urban science advisory system, which could support the United Nations (UN) and regional multilateral groups with international policy-making. Achieving such a system requires the acknowledgment of three things: aggregate or cumulative impacts of urbanization globally, urban blind spots in present international policy-making, and diversity and potential contributions of urban science.},

However, the factors underpinning these health issues, called Long Covid, are poorly understood. Comparing the blood of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with that of uninfected controls, Cervia-Hasler et al . found that patients experiencing Long COVID exhibited changes to blood serum proteins indicating activation of the immune system’s complement cascade, altered coagulation, and tissue injury (see the Perspective by Ruf). At the cellular level, Long Covid was linked to aggregates comprising monocytes and platelets. These findings provide a resource of potential biomarkers for diagnosis and may inform directions for treatments. —Sarah H. Ross Long Covid is a debilitating condition of unknown etiology. We performed multimodal proteomics analyses of blood serum from COVID-19 patients followed up to 12 months after confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Analysis of &gt;6500 proteins in 268 longitudinal samples revealed dysregulated activation of the complement system, an innate immune protection and homeostasis mechanism, in individuals experiencing Long Covid. Thus, active Long Covid was characterized by terminal complement system dysregulation and ongoing activation of the alternative and classical complement pathways, the latter associated with increased antibody titers against several herpesviruses possibly stimulating this pathway. Moreover, markers of hemolysis, tissue injury, platelet activation, and monocyte–platelet aggregates were increased in Long Covid. Machine learning confirmed complement and thromboinflammatory proteins as top biomarkers, warranting diagnostic and therapeutic interrogation of these systems.},

  abstract     = {Liquid biopsy for tumor analysis offers the potential for noninvasive access using a blood draw instead of a surgical procedure. In addition, sampling the blood can detect tumor DNA even when the location of a tumor is unknown. However, circulating tumor DNA is usually scarce, and it can be difficult to collect enough blood for adequate detection, especially in cases where tumors are small. Martin-Alonso et al . addressed this difficulty by developing two different types of priming agents that protect circulating DNA from destruction (see the Perspective by Moser and Heitzer). With these agents, more DNA remains in the bloodstream and is easier to detect even in small blood volumes. In mouse models of cancer, both approaches greatly increased the sensitivity of liquid biopsies. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Liquid biopsies enable early detection and monitoring of diseases such as cancer, but their sensitivity remains limited by the scarcity of analytes such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood. Improvements to sensitivity have primarily relied on enhancing sequencing technology ex vivo. We sought to transiently augment the level of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in a blood draw by attenuating its clearance in vivo. We report two intravenous priming agents given 1 to 2 hours before a blood draw to recover more ctDNA. Our priming agents consist of nanoparticles that act on the cells responsible for cfDNA clearance and DNA-binding antibodies that protect cfDNA. In tumor-bearing mice, they greatly increase the recovery of ctDNA and improve the sensitivity for detecting small tumors.},

  abstract     = {Highly variable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules bind and present a diverse range of antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, thereby eliciting an immune response. Maternally and paternally derived HLA molecules may bind very similarly to radically different sets of peptides. Viard et al . developed a method that estimates the difference in types of peptides bound between the pairs of HLA variants, which they termed “functional divergence.” It is proposed that individuals with high functional divergence present a broader range of peptides and elicit stronger immune responses compared with people having low functional divergence. Accordingly, HIV-infected individuals with the highest functional divergence develop less severe disease relative to those with the lowest functional divergence. A similar effect might be observed for other diseases in which HLA plays a central role. —Priscilla N. Kelly Heterozygosity of Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) class I genes is linked to beneficial outcomes after HIV infection, presumably through greater breadth of HIV epitope presentation and cytotoxic T cell response. Distinct allotype pairs, however, differ in the extent to which they bind shared sets of peptides. We developed a functional divergence metric that measures pairwise complementarity of allotype-associated peptide binding profiles. Greater functional divergence for pairs of HLA-A and/or HLA-B allotypes was associated with slower AIDS progression and independently with enhanced viral load control. The metric predicts immune breadth at the peptide level rather than gene level and redefines HLA heterozygosity as a continuum differentially affecting disease outcome. Functional divergence may affect response to additional infections, vaccination, immunotherapy, and other diseases where HLA heterozygote advantage occurs.},

  abstract     = {Although nanocrystals with well-defined polyhedral shapes can be assembled into ordered lattices with long DNA linkers, the large linkers often do not preserve the packing shape. Zhou et al . have shown that placing a flexible spacer between the rigid DNA anchor strand and the single-stranded DNA sticky end decouples the binding of sticky ends from the nanocrystal shape. This approach allows imperfect polyhedral building blocks to assemble into highly ordered space-filling structures and for non–space-filling nanocrystals to co-pack as complementary shapes. —Phil Szuromi Generating space-filling arrangements of most discrete polyhedra nanostructures of the same shape is not possible. However, if the appropriate individual building blocks are selected (e.g., cubes), or multiple shapes of the appropriate dimensions are matched (e.g., octahedra and tetrahedra) and their pairing interactions are subsequently forced, space-filled architectures may be possible. With flexible molecular ligands (polyethylene glycol–modified DNA), the shape of a polyhedral nanoparticle can be deliberately altered and used to realize geometries that favor space tessellation. In this work, 10 new colloidal crystals were synthesized from DNA-modified nanocrystal building blocks that differed in shapes and sizes, designed to form space-filling architectures with micron-scale dimensions. The insights and capabilities provided by this new strategy substantially expand the scope of colloidal crystals possible and provide an expanded tool kit for researchers interested in designing metamaterials.},

The bilateral rupture of event 2 also presents distinct sub- and supershear velocities. The dynamic stress of the branch fault rupture triggered the Pazarcık segment initial rupture at a point 9 kilometers west of the junction of these two faults, boosting the supershear rupture of the Pazarcık segment of the main fault.

Although some of these plant species have become ubiquitous, others are endemic to certain locations, where they have specific cultural uses. Pironon et al . studied where plants used by people occur and how their hotspots of diversity and endemism overlap with broader patterns of plant diversity and the locations of protected areas. They found that utilized species diversity is correlated with overall plant diversity, suggesting that prioritizing biodiversity hotspots for conservation could protect many of these species. However, current protected areas are inadequate for conserving these species and their associated biocultural diversity. —Bianca Lopez Plants sustain human life. Understanding geographic patterns of the diversity of species used by people is thus essential for the sustainable management of plant resources. Here, we investigate the global distribution of 35,687 utilized plant species spanning 10 use categories (e.g., food, medicine, material). Our findings indicate general concordance between utilized and total plant diversity, supporting the potential for simultaneously conserving species diversity and its contributions to people. Although Indigenous lands across Mesoamerica, the Horn of Africa, and Southern Asia harbor a disproportionate diversity of utilized plants, the incidence of protected areas is negatively correlated with utilized species richness.

  abstract     = {Quantum computers under development are at the intermediate size scale and are already demonstrating quantum advantage over classical systems for specific tasks. Going to larger scale systems is challenging for some solid-state platforms. Optics provides a possible route, but optical systems require engineered photonic states to mitigate for loss and to run error correction codes. Konno et al . demonstrate the generation of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, or grid states, in which the wavefunction resembles a sharp-peaked two-dimensional array (see the Perspective by Pfister). These states have been predicted to be fault tolerant, allowing quantum error correction codes to be readily implemented. Realizing such engineered photonic states will be important in the development of large-scale optical quantum computers. —Ian S. Osborne To harness the potential of a quantum computer, quantum information must be protected against error by encoding it into a logical state that is suitable for quantum error correction. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit is a promising candidate because the required multiqubit operations are readily available at optical frequency. To date, however, GKP qubits have been demonstrated only at mechanical and microwave frequencies. We realized a GKP state in propagating light at telecommunication wavelength and verified it through homodyne measurements without loss corrections. The generation is based on interference of cat states, followed by homodyne measurements. Our final states exhibit nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity, including the trident shape of faint instances of GKP states. Improvements toward brighter, multipeaked GKP qubits will be the basis for quantum computation with light.},

  abstract     = {The mutual neutralization of the hydronium cation and hydroxide anion to form neutral water molecules is one of the most basic chemical processes. It therefore has attracted considerable interest, but direct experimental probing of the underlying reaction mechanisms has been lacking. By realizing the interaction in merged beams of two ionic species with near-zero relative velocity, Bogot et al . directly visualized the neutral products of these reactions and reported three different product channels. Two channels were attributed to a predominant electron-transfer mechanism, and a smaller channel was associated with proton transfer. The two-beam collision experiment is an important step toward understanding the quantum dynamics of this fundamental reaction. —Yury Suleymanov Mutual neutralization of hydronium (H 3 O + ) and hydroxide (OH − ) ions is a very fundamental chemical reaction. Yet, there is only limited experimental evidence about the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, we report three-dimensional imaging of coincident neutral products of mutual-neutralization reactions at low collision energies of cold and isolated ions in the cryogenic double electrostatic ion-beam storage ring (DESIREE). We identified predominant H 2 O + OH + H and 2OH + H 2 product channels and attributed them to an electron-transfer mechanism, whereas a minor contribution of H 2 O + H 2 O with high internal excitation was attributed to proton transfer. The reported mechanism-resolved internal product excitation, as well as collision-energy and initial ion-temperature dependence, provide a benchmark for modeling charge-transfer mechanisms.},

This mass gap carries information about how both types of object form during supernovae (see the Perspective by Fishbach).

They found that the pulsar’s binary companion is an object in the mass gap, but could not determine whether it is an unusually high-mass neutron star or an unusually low-mass black hole. Either way, the authors argue that it formed by the earlier merger of two other neutron stars. —Keith T. Smith Some compact objects observed in gravitational wave events have masses in the gap between known neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). The nature of these mass gap objects is unknown, as is the formation of their host binary systems. We report pulsar timing observations made with the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT) of PSR J0514−4002E, an eccentric binary millisecond pulsar in the globular cluster NGC 1851. We found a total binary mass of 3.887 ± 0.004 solar masses ( M ⊙ ), and multiwavelength observations show that the pulsar’s binary companion is also a compact object. The companion’s mass (2.09 to 2.71 M ⊙ , 95% confidence interval) is in the mass gap, indicating either a very massive NS or a low-mass BH.

For the latter, quantum information is encoded in the amplitudes of light fields (qumodes), which can take a continuous range of values rather than just two distinct values as in qubits. Although qumode-based platforms for quantum information processing allow outstanding scalability compared with that of qubit platforms, they also make error correction much less intuitive than over qubits.

In recent years, ctDNA approaches have continuously been expanded to earlier disease stages. However, a persistent challenge of cancer screening and the molecular detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) has been the need to increase sensitivity, allowing for the detection of minute amounts of ctDNA with unprecedented accuracy. Most attempts to enhance sensitivity have focused on ex vivo strategies, such as sampling, analytical parts (e.g., library preparation), and bioinformatics.

In South Asia, more than 500,000 small stand-alone pumps have already been installed (see the figure). In Sub-Saharan Africa, solar pumps are gaining traction to expand food production and alleviate poverty. There is optimism about solar-powered irrigation helping LMICs meet their climatechange mitigation obligations, but insights from behavioral sciences, and early evidence, suggest that such emissions reductions are complex to calculate and likely lower than assumed. Groundwater pumping is likely to increase. Moving from siloed accounting of land, water, and energy use to integrated assessment frameworks can help manage unintended risks to land and water resources ( 1 ) and prevent lock-ins. By assessing social costs and benefits of solar-powered groundwater pumping, policy-makers can navigate tradeoffs where irrigation expands food production and alleviates poverty but has unintended or unaccounted consequences for groundwater depletion and carbon emissions.},

However, for widespread adoption, the levelized cost of electricity from tandems must be lower than that of mainstream silicon technology. Aydin et al . reviewed the efforts needed to commercialize these devices, including issues with stability, process scale-up and throughput, cell-to-module integration, and field performance evaluation. —Phil Szuromi Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells offer a promising route to increase the power conversion efficiency of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells beyond the theoretical single-junction limitations at an affordable cost. In the past decade, progress has been made toward the fabrication of highly efficient laboratory-scale tandems through a range of vacuum- and solution-based perovskite processing technologies onto various types of c-Si bottom cells. However, to become a commercial reality, the transition from laboratory to industrial fabrication will require appropriate, scalable input materials and manufacturing processes. In addition, perovskite/silicon tandem research needs to increasingly focus on stability, reliability, throughput of cell production and characterization, cell-to-module integration, and accurate field-performance prediction and evaluation. This Review discusses these aspects in view of contemporary solar cell manufacturing, offers insights into the possible pathways toward commercial perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics, and highlights research opportunities to realize this goal.},

  abstract     = {Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell population in the body. Although different types of neutrophils frequently gather in the tumor microenvironment, it is currently unclear how they might coordinate to support tumor growth. Using an experimental model of pancreatic cancer, Ng et al . report populations of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils that converged to develop into a single long-lived “T3” cell subset. T3 neutrophils prompted the growth of new blood vessels, which enhanced tumor survival in areas with low oxygen and limited nutrients. Depleting T3 neutrophils or inhibiting their angiogenic function reduced tumor growth. The researchers suggest that neutrophils could be reprogrammed within the tumor microenvironment into a single functional state, and modulation of protumoral neutrophil responses may have therapeutic potential. —Priscilla N. Kelly Neutrophils are increasingly recognized as key players in the tumor immune response and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances characterizing the diversity of neutrophil states in cancer, common trajectories and mechanisms governing the ontogeny and relationship between these neutrophil states remain undefined. Here, we demonstrate that immature and mature neutrophils that enter tumors undergo irreversible epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic modifications to converge into a distinct, terminally differentiated dcTRAIL-R1 + state. Reprogrammed dcTRAIL-R1 + neutrophils predominantly localize to a glycolytic and hypoxic niche at the tumor core and exert pro-angiogenic function that favors tumor growth. We found similar trajectories in neutrophils across multiple tumor types and in humans, suggesting that targeting this program may provide a means of enhancing certain cancer immunotherapies.},

Finning bans had little impact, but fishing regulations did reduce mortality. —Sacha Vignieri Over the past two decades, sharks have been increasingly recognized among the world’s most threatened wildlife and hence have received heightened scientific and regulatory scrutiny. Yet, the effect of protective regulations on shark fishing mortality has not been evaluated at a global scale. Here we estimate that total fishing mortality increased from at least 76 to 80 million sharks between 2012 and 2019, ~25 million of which were threatened species. Mortality increased by 4% in coastal waters but decreased by 7% in pelagic fisheries, especially across the Atlantic and Western Pacific. By linking fishing mortality data to the global regulatory landscape, we show that widespread legislation designed to prevent shark finning did not reduce mortality but that regional shark fishing or retention bans had some success. These analyses, combined with expert interviews, highlight evidence-based solutions to reverse the continued overexploitation of sharks.},

They classified over 80% of endemic species as threatened and 13 species as possibly extinct. Data to estimate population reductions, which are not available in many tropical areas, were key to assessing threatened status for many species. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity is declining globally, yet many biodiversity hotspots still lack comprehensive species conservation assessments. Using multiple International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria to evaluate extinction risks and millions of herbarium and forest inventory records, we present automated conservation assessments for all tree species of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, including ~1100 heretofore unassessed species. About 65% of all species and 82% of endemic species are classified as threatened. We rediscovered five species classified as Extinct on the IUCN Red List and identified 13 endemics as possibly extinct. Uncertainties in species information had little influence on the assessments, but using fewer Red List criteria severely underestimated threat levels.

  abstract     = {Epitaxial growth of a crystalline film normally proceeds from one substrate. Cui et al . report that two molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) layers can both impose orientation effects on gold. The authors grew gold nanoparticle layers on one MoS 2 substrate and then covered the nanoparticles with a second MoS 2 film. Upon heating, the nanoparticles flattened to nanodisks. For small twist angles between the two substrates (about 7 degrees), the nanometer-thick gold nanodisks adopted an orientation intermediate to both substrates. This alignment was driven in part by the chemical interaction of gold with sulfur. —Phil Szuromi We expand the concept of epitaxy to a regime of “twisted epitaxy” with the epilayer crystal orientation between two substrates influenced by their relative orientation. We annealed nanometer-thick gold (Au) nanoparticles between two substrates of exfoliated hexagonal molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) with varying orientation of their basal planes with a mutual twist angle ranging from 0° to 60°. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that Au aligns midway between the top and bottom MoS 2 when the twist angle of the bilayer is small (&lt;~7°). For larger twist angles, Au has only a small misorientation with the bottom MoS 2 that varies approximately sinusoidally with twist angle of the bilayer MoS 2 . Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis further reveals a periodic strain variation (&lt;|±0.5%|) in the Au nanodisks associated with the twisted epitaxy, consistent with the Moiré registry of the two MoS 2 twisted layers.},

  abstract     = {Plasma cells generate antibodies at considerable rates, often over the course of many years. Although antibody production is a well-regulated process, little is known about how the plasma cell’s translational machinery adapts to this formidable task. Giguère et al . report that transfer RNA (tRNA) and codon usage are congruently optimized as B cells differentiate from a naïve phenotype to plasma cells (see the Perspective by Alvarez and James). The tRNA pool in plasma cells is enriched in inosine (I34) –modifiable anticodons, which allows one tRNA to decode multiple synonymous codons by “wobble” (non–Watson-Crick) base-pairing. These findings suggest that codon usage and cell-specific tRNA pools may be an attractive future target for both the exogenous production of pharmaceutical antibodies and the rational design of vaccines. —Seth Thomas Scanlon Antibodies are produced at high rates to provide immunoprotection, which puts pressure on the B cell translational machinery. Here, we identified a pattern of codon usage conserved across antibody genes. One feature thereof is the hyperutilization of codons that lack genome-encoded Watson-Crick transfer RNAs (tRNAs), instead relying on the posttranscriptional tRNA modification inosine (I34), which expands the decoding capacity of specific tRNAs through wobbling. Antibody-secreting cells had increased I34 levels and were more reliant on I34 for protein production than naïve B cells. Furthermore, antibody I34-dependent codon usage may influence B cell passage through regulatory checkpoints. Our work elucidates the interface between the tRNA pool and protein production in the immune system and has implications for the design and selection of antibodies for vaccines and therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {Friction is ubiquitous but surprisingly difficult to determine outside of trial and error methods for many applications. Aymard et al . developed a general strategy that should allow the frictional relationship to be designed in advance (see the Perspective by Slesarenko and Pastewka). The strategy requires understanding the behavior of individual bumps called asperities and then modeling how groups of those bumps affect friction. The authors provide several examples of tuning the frictional response in a model system. The strategy should be broadly applicable across different material combinations and scales. —Brent Grocholski Many devices, including touchscreens and robotic hands, involve frictional contacts. Optimizing these devices requires fine control of the interface’s friction law. We lack systematic methods to create dry contact interfaces whose frictional behavior satisfies preset specifications. We propose a generic surface design strategy to prepare dry rough interfaces that have predefined relationships between normal and friction forces. Such metainterfaces circumvent the usual multiscale challenge of tribology by considering simplified surface topographies as assemblies of spherical asperities. Optimizing the individual asperities’ heights enables specific friction laws to be targeted. Through various centimeter-scaled elastomer-glass metainterfaces, we illustrate three types of achievable friction laws, including linear laws with a specified friction coefficient and unusual nonlinear laws. This design strategy represents a scale- and material-independent, chemical-free pathway toward energy-saving and adaptable smart interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Cancers develop mechanisms to evade detection and subsequent killing by the immune system. One such strategy involves suppressing the presentation of tumor-associated antigens. Sharma et al . report that a protein called prosaposin is key for triggering immunity against tumors. Immune sentinels called dendritic cells (DCs) engulf dead cancer cells and use prosaposin to process tumor-derived antigens for subsequent display and activation of protective T lymphocytes. Tumor growth results in the addition of complex sugar chains to prosaposin molecules in DCs, leading to prosaposin secretion and the depletion of lysosomal saposins. Targeting tumor DCs with an engineered form of prosaposin enhances the antitumor immune response and improves tumor control. —Priscilla N. Kelly Tumors develop strategies to evade immunity by suppressing antigen presentation. In this work, we show that prosaposin (pSAP) drives CD8 T cell–mediated tumor immunity and that its hyperglycosylation in tumor dendritic cells (DCs) leads to cancer immune escape. We found that lysosomal pSAP and its single-saposin cognates mediated disintegration of tumor cell–derived apoptotic bodies to facilitate presentation of membrane-associated antigen and T cell activation. In the tumor microenvironment, transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) induced hyperglycosylation of pSAP and its subsequent secretion, which ultimately caused depletion of lysosomal saposins. pSAP hyperglycosylation was also observed in tumor-associated DCs from melanoma patients, and reconstitution with pSAP rescued activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Targeting DCs with recombinant pSAP triggered tumor protection and enhanced immune checkpoint therapy. Our studies demonstrate a critical function of pSAP in tumor immunity and may support its role in immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {When intact, the Amazonian forest is dense and difficult to penetrate, both on foot and with scanning technologies. Over the past several years, however, improved light detection and ranging scans have begun to penetrate the forest canopy, revealing previously unknown evidence of past Amazonian cultures. Rostain et al . describe evidence of such an agrarian Amazonian culture that began more than 2000 years ago. They describe more than 6000 earthen platforms distributed in a geometic pattern connected by roads and intertwined with agricultural landscapes and river drainages in the Upano Valley. Previous efforts have described mounds and large monuments in Amazonia, but the complexity and extent of this development far surpasses these previous sites. —Sacha Vignieri A dense system of pre-Hispanic urban centers has been found in the Upano Valley of Amazonian Ecuador, in the eastern foothills of the Andes. Fieldwork and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) analysis have revealed an anthropized landscape with clusters of monumental platforms, plazas, and streets following a specific pattern intertwined with extensive agricultural drainages and terraces as well as wide straight roads running over great distances. Archaeological excavations date the occupation from around 500 BCE to between 300 and 600 CE. The most notable landscape feature is the complex road system extending over tens of kilometers, connecting the different urban centers, thus creating a regional-scale network. Such extensive early development in the Upper Amazon is comparable to similar Maya urban systems recently highlighted in Mexico and Guatemala.},

  abstract     = {Although elemental oxygen is an extremely common reactant in both biological and synthetic chemistry, it is comparatively rare for both O atoms from O 2 to end up in molecules of the target product. Instead, one of them is typically diverted to a co-product to facilitate the primary reaction. Hoque et al . now show that an electrochemical approach can improve atom economy in this context. Specifically, they paired oxygen reduction with water oxidation to produce manganese oxo species at each electrode, which in turn oxidized thioethers to sulfoxides. The net reaction transferred both O atoms without electron consumption. —Jake S. Yeston The reactivity of molecular oxygen is crucial to clean energy technologies and green chemical synthesis, but kinetic barriers complicate both applications. In synthesis, dioxygen should be able to undergo oxygen atom transfer to two organic molecules with perfect atom economy, but such reactivity is rare. Monooxygenase enzymes commonly reductively activate dioxygen by sacrificing one of the oxygen atoms to generate a more reactive oxidant. Here, we used a manganese-tetraphenylporphyrin catalyst to pair electrochemical oxygen reduction and water oxidation, generating a reactive manganese-oxo at both electrodes. This process supports dioxygen atom transfer to two thioether substrate molecules, generating two equivalents of sulfoxide with a single equivalent of dioxygen. This net dioxygenase reactivity consumes no electrons but uses electrochemical energy to overcome kinetic barriers.},

Being able to modulate the beam to access spatiotemporal information about the sample would be extremely useful but is technically challenging. Yang et al . demonstrate that the nonlinear optical states induced in a microresonator can interact with the electron beam and imprint the nonlinear optical states onto the beam (see the Perspective by Polman and García de Abajo). This interaction provides access to ultrafast modulation of the electron beam and broadens the application of electron microscopes for spatiotemporal imaging and spectroscopy. —Ian S.

Recently, electron-photon interactions have enabled new optical manipulation schemes for electron beams. In this work, we demonstrate the interaction of electrons with nonlinear optical states inside a photonic chip–based microresonator. Optical parametric processes give rise to spatiotemporal pattern formation corresponding to coherent or incoherent optical frequency combs. We couple such “microcombs” to electron beams, demonstrate their fingerprints in the electron spectra, and achieve ultrafast temporal gating of the electron beam.

  abstract     = {A central promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is that large datasets can be mined to predict and identify the best course of care for future patients. Unfortunately, we do not know how these models would perform on new patients because they are rarely tested prospectively on truly independent patient samples. Chekroud et al . showed that machine learning models routinely achieve perfect performance in one dataset even when that dataset is a large international multisite clinical trial (see the Perspective by Petzschner). However, when that exact model was tested in truly independent clinical trials, performance fell to chance levels. Even when building what should be a more robust model by aggregating across a group of similar multisite trials, subsequent predictive performance remained poor. —Peter Stern It is widely hoped that statistical models can improve decision-making related to medical treatments. Because of the cost and scarcity of medical outcomes data, this hope is typically based on investigators observing a model’s success in one or two datasets or clinical contexts. We scrutinized this optimism by examining how well a machine learning model performed across several independent clinical trials of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. Models predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy within the trial in which the model was developed but performed no better than chance when applied out-of-sample. Pooling data across trials to predict outcomes in the trial left out did not improve predictions. These results suggest that models predicting treatment outcomes in schizophrenia are highly context-dependent and may have limited generalizability.},

  abstract     = {Climate-related financial risk is the dominant frame through which many companies, investors, and regulators engage with climate change. We argue that developments in legal action mean that the basis for these assessments, which focus on physical and transition risks ( 1 ), is no longer accurate. Accounting for the legal system substantially alters the distribution of climate-related risk between firms, governments, and the public. Drawing on analysis of climate litigation, regulatory enforcement, and other legal action, we propose a framework that accounts for how legal action shifts or amplifies physical and transition risk exposures and creates additional climate risk exposures. We then preview five qualitative and quantitative approaches that can be applied to assess the implications of legal action for firms’ climate-related risk exposure.},

Little resistance is desired when pedaling bikes, yet the expectation of pulling the brakes is to stop moving. Overall, machines use 20% of the world’s energy production to overcome frictional resistance ( 1 ). Present-day strategies to tune friction, derived from more than a century of engineering insights, often involve the lubrication of interfaces with oils or greases. On page 200 of this issue, Aymard et al . ( 2 ) report an alternative strategy of rationally designing the frictional properties of interfaces.

Machine learning models have been heralded as the tools to accelerate precision medicine by sifting through large amounts of complex data to pinpoint the genetic, sociodemographic, or biological markers that predict the right treatment for the right person at the right time. However, the initial enthusiasm for these advanced predictive tools is now facing a sobering reality check. On page 164 of this issue, Chekroud et al . ( 1 ) show that machine learning models that predict treatment response to antipsychotic medication among individuals with schizophrenia in one clinical trial failed to generalize to data from new, unseen clinical trials.

Specifically, in photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy (PINEM), intense light fields bring an electron into multiple energy states simultaneously—a quantum-mechanical superposition state—which are then measured with an electron spectrometer.

A recent transition from egg-laying to live-bearing in marine snails ( Littorina spp.) provides the opportunity to study the genetic architecture of an innovation that has evolved repeatedly across animals. Individuals do not cluster by reproductive mode in a genome-wide phylogeny, but local genealogical analysis revealed numerous small genomic regions where all live-bearers carry the same core haplotype. Candidate regions show evidence for live-bearer–specific positive selection and are enriched for genes that are differentially expressed between egg-laying and live-bearing reproductive systems. Ages of selective sweeps suggest that live-bearer–specific alleles accumulated over more than 200,000 generations. Our results suggest that new functions evolve through the recruitment of many alleles rather than in a single evolutionary step.},

Combined with biochemical, cellular, and biophysical experiments, these structural snapshots allow the visualization of atypical engagement of βarrs with 7TMRs and also reveal a structural transition in the carboxyl terminus of βarr2 from a β strand to an α helix upon activation by D6R.

Adding a silane afterward could reduce these products to more highly substituted amine, if desired.

The direct carbonylative coupling of alkenes and amines holds promise as a perfectly atom-economical approach to amide synthesis, but general methods remain underdeveloped. Herein, we report an alkene hydroaminocarbonylation catalyzed by unmodified, inexpensive cobalt carbonyl under mild conditions and low pressure promoted by light. Silane addition after the reaction enables sequential cobalt-catalyzed amide reduction, constituting a formal alkene hydroaminomethylation. These methods exhibit exceptional scope across both alkene and amine components with high chemo- and regioselectivity and proceed efficiently even in the absence of solvent.

  abstract     = {Many block copolymers will phase separate into distinct regions, where the minority component might form spheres, cylinders, or layers inside the majority component, depending on the strength of the interactions between the two components and their relative proportions. Some metastable phases are also possible, including the bicontinuous “plumber’s nightmare. ” Lee et al . show that it is possible to make this phase a stable one in a diblock copolymer by adjusting the interactions of the chain ends (see the Perspective by Nedoma). The strength of end-group interactions is shown to modulate the curvature of the adjacent polymer, imposing significant frustration when the adjacent polymer is crystalline. By developing a series of design rules, the authors show a controlled way to reversibly make complex structures. —MSL Block copolymer self-assembly affords diverse nanostructures, spanning from spheres and cylinders to networks, offering meticulous control over properties and functionalities at the nanoscale. However, creating thermodynamically stable network structures with high packing frustration remains a challenge. In this study, we report a methodology to access diverse network structures such as gyroid, diamond, and primitive phases from diblock copolymers using end group and linker chemistry. The stability of the medial packing of polymer chain ends (plumber’s nightmare structure) over skeletal aggregation (gyroid) is attributed to the interplay between the strength of the end-end interactions and the initial shape of the curvature. Our study establishes an approach to develop tailored network structures from block copolymers, providing an important platform for using block copolymers in nanotechnology applications.},

  abstract     = {Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors blocks negative signals of T cell activation to mount an immune response against tumors but can also lead to immunopathologies. Colitis is a frequent and severe adverse event in patients treated with antibodies targeting the checkpoint inhibitor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4), but the underlying mechanisms leading to this reaction remain unclear. Lo et al . demonstrate that CTLA-4 blockade–induced colitis in mice is dependent on gut microbiota composition and is driven by the unrestrained activation of T cells and the concurrent depletion of a subset of regulatory T cells in the gut by receptors recognizing the Fc domain of the anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Anti-CTLA-4 nanobodies lacking the Fc domain were found to stimulate antitumor immunity without inducing colitis. These findings may support the development of next-generation CTLA-4 inhibitors with reduced inflammatory toxicities. —STS Immune checkpoint inhibitors can stimulate antitumor immunity but can also induce toxicities termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Colitis is a common and severe irAE that can lead to treatment discontinuation. Mechanistic understanding of gut irAEs has been hampered because robust colitis is not observed in laboratory mice treated with checkpoint inhibitors. We report here that this limitation can be overcome by using mice harboring the microbiota of wild-caught mice, which develop overt colitis following treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Intestinal inflammation is driven by unrestrained activation of IFNγ-producing CD4 + T cells and depletion of peripherally induced regulatory T cells through Fcγ receptor signaling. Accordingly, anti-CTLA-4 nanobodies that lack an Fc domain can promote antitumor responses without triggering colitis. This work suggests a strategy for mitigating gut irAEs while preserving antitumor stimulating effects of CTLA-4 blockade.},

  abstract     = {Decision-making to select between high risk–high return and low risk–low return choices is critical not only in economic activities such as investing, but also in many daily life situations. However, the underlying neural circuits remain largely elusive. Sasaki et al . identified two subsystems of the brain’s mesofrontal pathways that control risk-dependent decision-making in macaques (see the Perspective by Stuphorn). Stimulation of the pathway from the ventral tegmental area to the ventral aspect of the ventral Brodmann area 6 (area 6V) resulted in stronger preference for high risk–high return choices. By contrast, activation of the circuit from the ventral tegmental area to the dorsal aspect of area 6V led to low risk–low return inclination. Repetitive stimulation of these distinct pathways over time resulted in stimulus-independent long-term enhancement or reduction of preferences. —PRS Decision-making is always coupled with some level of risk, with more pathological forms of risk-taking decisions manifesting as gambling disorders. In macaque monkeys trained in a high risk–high return (HH) versus low risk–low return (LL) choice task, we found that the reversible pharmacological inactivation of ventral Brodmann area 6 (area 6V) impaired the risk dependency of decision-making. Selective optogenetic activation of the mesofrontal pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral aspect of 6V resulted in stronger preference for HH, whereas activation of the pathway from the VTA to the dorsal aspect of 6V led to LL preference. Finally, computational decoding captured the modulations of behavioral preference. Our results suggest that VTA inputs to area 6V determine the decision balance between HH and LL.},

A potentially safer method uses electrochemistry to oxidize propylene with water, but catalyst stability is a persistent challenge. Chung et al . report that by alloying palladium with platinum, they could generate an electrocatalyst that delivered &gt;60% Faradaic efficiency toward propylene epoxidation by water oxidation. Initially focusing on acetonitrile as a cosolvent, the authors went on to explore purely aqueous media and discuss the prospects of improving propylene throughput in the face of low solubility. —JSY Direct electrochemical propylene epoxidation by means of water-oxidation intermediates presents a sustainable alternative to existing routes that involve hazardous chlorine or peroxide reagents. We report an oxidized palladium-platinum alloy catalyst (PdPtO x /C), which reaches a Faradaic efficiency of 66 ± 5% toward propylene epoxidation at 50 milliamperes per square centimeter at ambient temperature and pressure. Embedding platinum into the palladium oxide crystal structure stabilized oxidized platinum species, resulting in improved catalyst performance. The reaction kinetics suggest that epoxidation on PdPtO x /C proceeds through electrophilic attack by metal-bound peroxo intermediates. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for selective electrochemical oxygen-atom transfer from water, without mediators, for diverse oxygenation reactions.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials that exhibit a moiré effect typically have complicated electronic band structures. To study them, researchers can apply magnetic fields and look for oscillations in transport properties. Thermodynamic properties such as magnetization should also exhibit quantum oscillations, but these are tricky to detect in the very small 2D material samples typically available. Bocarsly et al . used a very sensitive magnetometer—a superconducting quantum interference device—placed on the apex of a sharp pipette to scan a sample of moiré graphene. The authors detected patterns of magnetization oscillations and used the data to reconstruct an intricate band structure. —JSt Quantum oscillations originating from the quantization of electron cyclotron orbits provide sensitive diagnostics of electron bands and interactions. We report on nanoscale imaging of the thermodynamic magnetization oscillations caused by the de Haas–van Alphen effect in moiré graphene. Scanning by means of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)–on-tip in Bernal bilayer graphene crystal axis-aligned to hexagonal boron nitride reveals large magnetization oscillations with amplitudes reaching 500 Bohr magneton per electron in weak magnetic fields, unexpectedly low frequencies, and high sensitivity to superlattice filling fraction. The oscillations allow us to reconstruct the complex band structure, revealing narrow moiré bands with multiple overlapping Fermi surfaces separated by unusually small momentum gaps. We identified sets of oscillations that violate the textbook Onsager Fermi surface sum rule, signaling formation of broad-band particle-hole superposition states induced by coherent magnetic breakdown.},

Attitude toward risk is strongly influenced by context, but very little is known about the underlying neuronal circuitry. On page 55 of this issue, Sasaki et al .

The goal of autoimmune disease therapy is to restore tolerance to the self-antigen that causes the pathology by targeting autoreactive T cells while preserving immune competence to prevent infections and malignancies. The main challenge of this endeavor resides in choosing the mode by which the disease-driving antigen is delivered so that it can initiate the removal or reprogramming of the autoreactive T cells or the induction and/or expansion of antigen-specific regulatory T (T reg ) cells to suppress autoreactive T cells.
