Arner et al. investigated the activation and contribution of a specific AKT isoform in pancreatic cancer. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylated and activated AKT3 in vitro downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. In mouse pancreatic cancer cells, TBK1 was required for the increase in the abundance of EMT markers in response to AKT3 activation. Inhibiting AKT3 reduced the metastasis of pancreatic cancer in mice. Thus, the specific targeting of AKT3 may be useful in limiting pancreatic cancer metastasis. —Amy E. Baek The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL promotes tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance through the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we found that activation of AXL resulted in the phosphorylation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and the downstream activation of AKT3 and Snail, a transcription factor critical for EMT. Mechanistically, we showed that TBK1 directly bound to and phosphorylated AKT3 in a manner dependent on the multiprotein complex mTORC1. Upon activation, AKT3 interacted with and promoted the nuclear accumulation of Snail, which led to increased EMT as assessed by marker abundance. In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissue, nuclear AKT3 colocalized with Snail and correlated with worse clinical outcomes. Primary mouse pancreatic cancer cells deficient in AKT3 showed reduced metastatic spread in vivo, suggesting selective AKT3 inhibition as a potential therapeutic avenue for targeting EMT in aggressive cancers.},

  abstract     = {Crohn’s disease is associated with imbalances in the microbiota and increases in bile acids in the colon. Holani et al. investigated whether bile acids were linked to intestinal colonization by Enterobacteriaceae, a family of potentially pathogenic bacteria that are frequently increased in patients with Crohn’s disease. Bile acids reduced mitochondrial respiration in human colonic epithelial cells and promoted oxygen-dependent colonization of the mouse intestine by Enterobacteriaceae. Analysis of samples from patients with Crohn’s disease showed that Enterobacteriaceae abundance was associated with increases in bile acids and reductions in transcripts related to mitochondrial function. Thus, bile acids promote Enterobacteriaceae colonization of the intestine by increasing oxygen availability. —Annalisa M. VanHook Bile acids (BAs) affect the growth of potentially pathogenic commensals, including those from the Enterobacteriaceae family, which are frequently overrepresented in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). BAs are normally reabsorbed in the ileum for recycling and are often increased in the colonic lumina of patients with IBD, including those with Crohn’s disease (CD). Here, we investigated the influence of BAs on gut colonization by Enterobacteriaceae. We found increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in the colonic mucosae of patients with CD with a concomitant decrease in the transporters that resorb BAs in the ileum. The increase in Enterobacteriaceae colonization was greater in the colons of patients who had undergone terminal ileum resection compared with those with intact ileum, leading us to hypothesize that BAs promote intestinal colonization by Enterobacteriaceae. Exposure of human colonic epithelial cell lines to BAs reduced mitochondrial respiration, increased oxygen availability, and enhanced the epithelial adherence of several Enterobacteriaceae members. In a publicly available human dataset, mucosal Enterobacteriaceae was negatively associated with the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function. In a murine model, increased intestinal BA availability enhanced colonization by Escherichia coli in a manner that depended on bacterial respiration. Together, our findings demonstrate that BAs reduce mitochondrial respiration in the colon, leading to an increase in oxygen availability that facilitates Enterobacteriaceae colonization. This identification of BAs as facilitators of host-commensal interactions may be relevant to multiple intestinal diseases.},

  abstract     = {Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) does not respond to androgen deprivation, is highly aggressive, and has a poor prognosis for patients. Celada et al . found a pharmacological approach to restore the sensitivity of CRPC to androgen signaling–targeted therapy. Inhibiting the enzyme SKP2, which is a component of a cell cycle regulatory complex, induced autophagy that subsequently initiated cell death. Cotreatment with an androgen receptor inhibitor enhanced those effects and suppressed tumor growth in mice. The findings suggest that this combination approach may be effective for treating CRPC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Resistance to androgen receptor (AR)–targeted therapies for prostate cancer (PCa) is characteristic of an aggressive subtype called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and is often associated with tumor relapse. Both relapse and poor prognosis in patients with CRPC are associated with increased abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic potential of combined inhibition of AR and SKP2 for CRPC. We found that combined targeting of AR and SKP2 with small-molecule inhibitors decreased proliferation in two CRPC cell lines in culture and in xenografts in humanized mice. Furthermore, combined therapy in mice markedly decreased the growth of Pten/Trp53 double-knockout tumors, a particularly invasive model of CRPC, whereas disruption of either AR or SKP2 alone only modestly suppressed their growth. Mechanistically, the inhibition of SKP2 in CRPC cells induced autophagy-dependent apoptosis and promoted luminal-associated phenotypes, which promoted responsiveness to AR-targeted therapy. These effects were further enhanced by coinhibition of AR and were not induced by the AR inhibitor alone. Our findings indicate that targeting both AR and SKP2 signaling pathways is necessary to treat CRPC.},

  abstract     = {Amyloid plaque deposition in the brain and decreased activity of the enzyme SIRT6 are associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Cheng et al. mechanistically link these phenomena by showing that SIRT6 deacetylated the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to promote its degradation. Treating aged mice and Alzheimer’s disease model mice with a chemical activator of SIRT6 reduced amyloid plaque burden, preserved neurons, and improved cognitive performance. The findings suggest that pharmacological activators of SIRT6 may ameliorate amyloid-associated pathology and symptoms in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an aging-related neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressively impaired memory and is often associated with amyloid plaques. Previous studies implicate the deacetylases SIRT1 and SIRT2 in regulating the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Here, we investigated whether APP is regulated by the related deacetylase SIRT6, which shows aging-associated decreases in activity. We found that the abundance of SIRT6 was reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of aged and AD model mice and negatively correlated with that of APP. In mouse hippocampal neurons and transfected human cells, SIRT6 interacted with and deacetylated APP at three consecutive Lys residues (Lys 649 , Lys 650 , and Lys 651 ). This deacetylation, in turn, increased the ubiquitylation of APP, leading to its proteasomal degradation. SIRT6 abundance in neurons was reduced by oxidative stress and DNA damage, both of which are implicated in neurodegenerative pathology. Systemic pharmacological activation of SIRT6 ameliorated both amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of AD. The findings demonstrate that the activity of SIRT6 destabilizes APP and suggest that activating SIRT6 has therapeutic potential to reduce amyloid-associated pathology in patients with AD.},

  abstract     = {Binding of immunoglobulin E (IgE) to its high-affinity receptor FcεRI on mast cells and basophils stimulates allergic reactions. The limited number of antibody-based therapies to treat allergies could be expanded by a better understanding of the IgE-bound receptor complex (see the Focus by Sutton). By solving the cryo-EM structures of human and mouse FcεRI bound to IgE-Fc, Zhang et al. found species-specific differences in interactions between IgE and the extracellular domains of the receptors. Unexpectedly, the binding of IgE-Fc to mouse FcεRI caused no conformational changes in the receptor. Together, these findings may inform the development of improved inhibitors of IgE-mediated allergic responses. —John F. Foley The high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (FcεRI) drives type I hypersensitivity in response to allergen-specific IgE. FcεRI is a multimeric complex typically composed of one α, one β, and two disulfide-linked γ subunits. The α subunit binds to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of IgE (Fcε), whereas the β and γ subunits mediate signaling through their intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine–based activation motifs (ITAMs). Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the apo state of FcεRI and of FcεRI bound to Fcε. At the transmembrane domain (TMD), the α and γ subunits associate to form a tightly packed, three-helix bundle (αγ 2 bundle) with pseudo-threefold symmetry through extensive hydrophobic and polar interactions. The αγ 2 bundle further assembles with the β subunit to complete the TMD, from which multiple ITAMs might extend into the cytoplasm for downstream signaling. The apo mouse FcεRI essentially forms an identical structure to that of the Fcε-bound sensitized form, suggesting that the binding of Fcε to FcεRI does not alter the overall conformation of the receptor. Furthermore, the juxtamembrane interaction between the extracellular domains (ECDs) of mouse FcεRIα and FcεRIβ is not observed between their human counterparts, which implies potential species-specific differences in receptor stability and activation. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the general structural principles underlying Fc receptor assembly, the signaling mechanism underlying type I hypersensitivity, and the design of efficient antiallergic therapeutics.},

An inverse agonist for GPR6 that is currently in clinical trials ameliorates locomotor deficits related to Parkinson’s disease. The authors’ data provide the structural basis for the high basal activity of GPR6 and how other inverse agonists targeting GPR6 could be designed to provide a nondopaminergic treatment option for patients with Parkinson’s disease. —Wei Wong GPR6 is an orphan G protein–coupled receptor with high constitutive activity found in D2-type dopamine receptor–expressing medium spiny neurons of the striatopallidal pathway, which is aberrantly hyperactivated in Parkinson’s disease. Here, we solved crystal structures of GPR6 without the addition of a ligand (a pseudo-apo state) and in complex with two inverse agonists, including CVN424, which improved motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease in clinical trials. In addition, we obtained a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the signaling complex between GPR6 and its cognate G s heterotrimer. The pseudo-apo structure revealed a strong density in the orthosteric pocket of GPR6 corresponding to a lipid-like endogenous ligand. A combination of site-directed mutagenesis, native mass spectrometry, and computer modeling suggested potential mechanisms for high constitutive activity and inverse agonism in GPR6 and identified a series of lipids and ions bound to the receptor. The structures and results obtained in this study could guide the rational design of drugs that modulate GPR6 signaling.},

Mice lacking Them1 in thermogenic adipocytes did not limit thermogenesis and gained less weight when fed a high fat diet. These results identify a transcriptional mechanism that ensures the suppression of thermogenesis by Them1 under chronic stress, a mechanism that becomes maladaptive with nutrient excess and that could be targeted to treat obesity. —Wei Wong Activation of thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducible beige adipose tissue (BeAT) is triggered by environmental or metabolic stimuli, including cold ambient temperatures and nutrient stress. Thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1), a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase that is enriched in BAT, suppresses acute cold-induced thermogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that Them1 expression was induced in BAT and BeAT by the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) in response to chronic cold exposure or to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by nutrient excess. Under either condition, Them1 suppressed energy expenditure. Consequently, mice lacking Them1 in BAT and BeAT exhibited resistance to obesity and glucose intolerance induced by feeding with a high-fat diet. During chronic cold exposure or ISR activation, Them1 accumulated in the nucleus, where it interacted with ChREBP and reduced the expression of its target genes, including those encoding enzymes that mediate glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis. These findings demonstrate that in response to chronic cold- or nutrient-induced stress, the induction of Them1 by ChREBP limits thermogenesis while coordinately reducing glucose utilization and lipid biosynthesis through its distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear activities. Targeted inhibition of Them1 could be a potential therapeutic approach to increase the activity of BAT and BeAT to enhance energy expenditure in the management of obesity-associated metabolic disorders.},

  abstract     = {The integrated stress response (ISR) enables tumor cells to adapt quickly to their tissue environment, thus supporting cell survival and tumor progression. Cordova et al. found that inhibiting the ISR kinase GCN2 kills prostate cancer cells deficient in the transcription factor p53. GCN2 inhibition decreased the availability of amino acids that are used in purine nucleotide synthesis. In turn, this nucleotide deficiency was survivable only with p53 signaling, which induced cell cycle arrest and senescence. In mice, although inhibiting GCN2 slowed the growth of p53-functional tumors, it did so to a greater extent and induced cell death in p53-deficient tumors. The loss of p53 typically makes killing tumor cells challenging, and these findings indicate a way to take advantage of those mutations. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Cancers invoke various pathways to mitigate external and internal stresses to continue their growth and progression. We previously reported that the eIF2 kinase GCN2 and the integrated stress response are constitutively active in prostate cancer (PCa) and are required to maintain amino acid homeostasis needed to fuel tumor growth. However, although loss of GCN2 function reduces intracellular amino acid availability and PCa growth, there is no appreciable cell death. Here, we discovered that the loss of GCN2 in PCa induces prosenescent p53 signaling. This p53 activation occurred through GCN2 inhibition–dependent reductions in purine nucleotides that impaired ribosome biogenesis and, consequently, induced the impaired ribosome biogenesis checkpoint. p53 signaling induced cell cycle arrest and senescence that promoted the survival of GCN2-deficient PCa cells. Depletion of GCN2 combined with loss of p53 or pharmacological inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis reduced proliferation and enhanced cell death in PCa cell lines, organoids, and xenograft models. Our findings highlight the coordinated interplay between GCN2 and p53 regulation during nutrient stress and provide insight into how they could be targeted in developing new therapeutic strategies for PCa.},

  abstract     = {High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is aggressive and lacks durably effective treatments. Forskolin can suppress cancer cell proliferation but cannot be used clinically. Knarr et al . found that colforsin daropate, a forskolin derivative, specifically induced cell death in HGSOC cells but not normal fallopian or ovarian cells and inhibited HGSOC invasion in part by attenuating MYC signaling. Colforsin daropate synergized with cisplatin, a standard ovarian cancer chemotherapeutic, and resensitized cisplatin-resistant tumors in mice. Because colforsin daropate is already approved to treat acute heart failure, it could potentially be repurposed to treat HGSOC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is one of the deadliest cancers for women, with a low survival rate, no early detection biomarkers, a high rate of recurrence, and few therapeutic options. Forskolin, an activator of cyclic AMP signaling, has several anticancer activities, including against HGSOC, but has limited use in vivo. Its water-soluble derivative, colforsin daropate, has the same mechanism of action as forskolin and is used to treat acute heart failure. Here, we investigated the potential of colforsin daropate as a treatment for HGSOC. We found that colforsin daropate induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cultured HGSOC cells and spheroids but had negligible cytotoxicity in immortalized, nontumorigenic fallopian tube secretory cells and ovarian surface epithelial cells. Colforsin daropate also prevented HGSOC cells from invading ovarian surface epithelial cell layers in culture. In vivo, colforsin daropate reduced tumor growth, synergized with cisplatin (a standard chemotherapy in ovarian cancer care), and improved host survival in subcutaneous and intraperitoneal xenograft models. These antitumor effects of colforsin daropate were mediated in part by its reduction in the abundance and transcriptional activity of the oncoprotein c-MYC, which is often increased in HGSOC. Our findings demonstrate that colforsin daropate may be a promising therapeutic that could be combined with conventional therapies to treat HGSOC.},

The Janus kinases TYK2 and JAK1 are recruited to the IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively, cross-phosphorylating each other and STAT proteins to transduce IFN signals. However, in experiments with synthetic IFNARs and JAK-deficient cell lines, Zoler et al . found that multiple JAKs bound competitively to IFNARs to mediate signaling depending on their relative abundances. Other type I and II cytokine receptors exhibited promiscuous JAK recruitment, suggesting that competition among JAKs should be considered when developing JAK inhibitors as therapies to modulate cytokine signaling. —John F. Foley Janus kinases (JAKs) bind to class I and II cytokine receptors, activating signaling and regulating gene transcription through signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Type I interferons (IFNs) require the JAK members TYK2 and JAK1, which bind to the receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively. We investigated the role of JAKs in regulating IFNAR signaling activity. Synthetic IFNARs in which the extracellular domains of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are replaced with nanobodies had near-native type I IFN signaling, whereas the homomeric variant of IFNAR2 initiated much weaker signaling, despite harboring docking sites for JAKs and STATs. Cells with JAK1 and TYK2 knockout (KO) showed residual signaling, suggesting partial complementation by the remaining JAKs, particularly when they were overexpressed. Live-cell micropatterning experiments confirmed the promiscuous binding of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and their recruitment correlated with their relative cellular abundances. However, each JAK had a different efficacy in inducing cross-phosphorylation and downstream signaling. JAK binding was also promiscuous for other cytokine receptors, including IFN-L1, IL-10Rβ, TPOR, and GHR, but not for EPOR, which activated different downstream signaling pathways. These findings suggest that competitive binding of JAKs to cytokine receptors together with the varying absolute and relative abundances of the JAKs in different cell types can account for the cell type–dependent signaling pleiotropy of cytokine receptors.},

Watanabe et al. found that this vulnerability can be broadened to tumors lacking BRCA mutations using small-molecule inhibitors of mitochondrial metabolism. Treating BRCA –wild-type, HR-proficient breast cancer cells in culture with inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration—which included the approved antidiabetic drug metformin—caused the cells to switch from aerobic respiration to glycolysis. Lactate produced as a result of glycosis led to epigenetic repression of HR-associated gene expression. The resulting HR deficiency created sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and to mechanistically related ATR inhibitors. This effect was not seen in normal breast epithelial cells, demonstrating the potential to make these tumor-selective therapies more broadly effective. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Metabolic reprogramming from oxidative respiration to glycolysis is generally considered to be advantageous for tumor initiation and progression. However, we found that breast cancer cells forced to perform glycolysis acquired a vulnerability to PARP inhibitors. Small-molecule inhibition of mitochondrial respiration—using glyceollin I, metformin, or phenformin—induced overproduction of the oncometabolite lactate, which acidified the extracellular milieu and repressed the expression of homologous recombination (HR)–associated DNA repair genes. These serial events created so-called “BRCAness,” in which cells exhibit an HR deficiency phenotype despite lacking germline mutations in HR genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 , and, thus, sensitized the cancer cells to clinically available poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. The increase in lactate repressed HR-associated gene expression by decreasing histone acetylation. These effects were selective to breast cancer cells; normal epithelial cells retained HR proficiency and cell viability. These mechanistic insights into the BRCAness-prone properties of breast cancer cells support the therapeutic utility and cancer cell–specific potential of mitochondria-targeting drugs.},

Enzyme-based, proximity-dependent approaches, such as biotin identification (BioID), combined with mass spectrometry have begun to illuminate the landscape of proximal protein interactions within intracellular compartments. To extend the potential of these approaches to study the extracellular environment, we developed extracellular TurboID (ecTurboID), a method designed to profile the interactions between proteins on the surfaces of living cells over short timescales using the fast-acting biotin ligase TurboID. After optimizing our experimental and data analysis strategies to capture extracellular proximity interactions, we used ecTurboID to reveal the proximal interactomes of several plasma membrane proteins, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We found that EGF stimulation induced an association between EGFR and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and changed the interactome of LDLR by increasing its proximity with proteins that regulate EGFR signaling.

  abstract     = {In contrast to the neonatal mammalian heart, in which cardiomyocyte proliferation can enable complete repair, cardiomyocytes in the adult mammalian heart must be induced to reenter the cell cycle to achieve regeneration. Increases in purine availability are required to support enhanced DNA and RNA synthesis during proliferation, leading Li et al. to investigate how cardiac regeneration is affected by Adssl1, a critical enzyme in de novo purine synthesis. Cardiac regeneration after injury in neonatal mouse heart was limited by genetic ablation of Adssl1. In contrast, the damage and impairment in cardiac function induced by myocardial infarction in adult mice were limited by overexpression of Adssl1, which promoted cell cycle reentry and proliferation in cardiomyocytes. This effect was mimicked by treatment with inosine, a purine nucleoside whose amounts were increased by Adssl1 overexpression and that is in clinical use. Thus, increasing de novo purine synthesis could be explored as a potential strategy to promote cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction and other insults to the heart. —Wei Wong There is a short window during which the neonatal heart has the proliferative capacity to completely repair damage, an ability that is lost in adulthood. Inducing proliferation in adult cardiomyocytes by reactivating cell cycle reentry after myocardial infarction (MI) improves cardiac function. De novo purine synthesis is a critical source of nucleotides for cell proliferation. Here, using loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches, we explored the role of the muscle-specific de novo purine synthesis enzyme Adssl1 in cardiac regeneration. Deletion of Adssl1 in mouse neonatal hearts reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and attenuated heart regeneration after apical resection. Conversely, cardiomyocyte-specific Adssl1 overexpression extended the postnatal regenerative window and induced robust cell cycle reentry after MI, which decreased fibrotic scar size and improved cardiac function. RNA sequencing analysis suggested that Adssl1 overexpression induced strong dedifferentiation and cell cycle entry. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that Adssl1 overexpression was associated with increased amounts of purine metabolites, including inosine, which is in clinical use. Administration of exogenous inosine promoted cardiac repair after MI in adult mice. At a molecular level, the increase in purine metabolite production mediated by Adssl1 enhanced the activity of the proliferation-promoting mTORC1 pathway. Our study identifies a role for Adssl1 in supporting cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration.},

Patients with WHIM syndrome, a rare congenital immunodeficiency caused by mutations that prevent desensitization of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, have an excess of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Here, we investigated the effects of increased CXCR4 signaling on the localization and fate of MPPs. Knock-in mice bearing a WHIM syndrome–associated CXCR4 mutation ( CXCR4 1013 ) phenocopied the myeloid skewing of bone marrow in patients. Whereas MPP4 cells in wild-type mice differentiated into lymphoid cells, MPP4s in CXCR4 1013 knock-in mice differentiated into myeloid cells. This myeloid rewiring of MPP4s in CXCR4 1013 knock-in mice was associated with enhanced signaling mediated by the kinase mTOR and increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). MPP4s also localized further from arterioles in the bone marrow of knock-in mice compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that the loss of extrinsic cues from the perivascular niche may also contribute to their myeloid skewing. Chronic treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin restored the lymphoid potential of MPP4s in knock-in mice. Thus, CXCR4 desensitization drives the lymphoid potential of MPP4 cells by dampening the mTOR-dependent metabolic changes that promote myeloid differentiation.},

  abstract     = {The appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin promotes hepatic lipid accumulation. Zhang et al. investigated the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis by Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel that is activated when food ingestion stretches the stomach and that suppresses ghrelin production. Mice lacking Piezo1 in ghrelin-producing cells in the stomach developed hepatic steatosis, which was reversed by pharmacologically blocking the ghrelin receptor. Gastric bead implantation, which mimicked the mechanical stretch induced by food intake, reduced hepatic steatosis in control mice on a normal diet or with diet-induced obesity but not in the conditional knockout mice. Thus, Piezo1 in ghrelin-producing cells could be targeted to treat metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, the most prevalent liver disorder worldwide. —Wei Wong Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide released by gastric ghrelin cells that contributes to obesity and hepatic steatosis. The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in gastric ghrelin cells inhibits the synthesis and secretion of ghrelin in response to gastric mechanical stretch. We sought to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism by manipulating Piezo1 in gastric ghrelin cells. Mice with a ghrelin cell–specific deficiency of Piezo1 ( Ghrl-Piezo1 −/− ) had hyperghrelinemia and hepatic steatosis when fed a low-fat or high-fat diet. In these mice, hepatic lipid accumulation was associated with changes in gene expression and in protein abundance and activity expected to increase hepatic fatty acid synthesis and decrease lipid β-oxidation. Pharmacological inhibition of the ghrelin receptor improved hepatic steatosis in Ghrl-Piezo1 −/− mice, thus confirming that the phenotype of these mice was due to overproduction of ghrelin caused by inactivation of Piezo1. Gastric implantation of silicone beads to induce mechanical stretch of the stomach inhibited ghrelin synthesis and secretion, thereby helping to suppress fatty liver development induced by a high-fat diet in wild-type mice but not in Ghrl-Piezo1 −/− mice. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which Piezo1 in gastric ghrelin cells regulate hepatic lipid accumulation, providing insights into potential treatments for fatty liver.},

  abstract     = {Activated T cells must ramp up ribosomal biogenesis in nucleoli to support protein synthesis required for proliferation. Rosenlehner et al. investigated the interplay among T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, ribosomal biosynthesis, and mTORC1, a multiprotein complex implicated in cell growth and proliferation. mTORC1 was required for the rapid cell cycling of proliferating activated T cells. In addition, mTORC1 heightened the antigen sensitivity of the TCR, promoted ribosomal RNA synthesis, and increased the number and size of nucleoli. These effects were not seen with the related mTORC2 complex. In turn, the activity of mTORC1 correlated with that of the TCR and with ribosomal RNA transcription mediated by RNA polymerase I. These results uncover the reciprocal regulation between signaling pathways and cellular processes that enable the proliferation of activated T cells. —Wei Wong Ribosomal biosynthesis in nucleoli is an energy-demanding process driven by all RNA polymerases and hundreds of auxiliary proteins. We investigated how this process is regulated in activated T lymphocytes by T cell receptor (TCR) signals and the multiprotein complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, both of which contain the kinase mTOR. Deficiency in mTORC1 slowed the proliferation of T cells, with further delays in each consecutive division, an effect not seen with deficiency in mTORC2. mTORC1 signaling was stimulated by components of conventional TCR signaling, and, reciprocally, TCR sensitivity was decreased by mTORC1 inhibition. The substantial increase in the amount of RNA per cell induced by TCR activation was reduced by 50% by deficiency in mTORC1, but not in mTORC2 or in S6 kinases 1 and 2, which are activated downstream of mTORC1. RNA-seq data showed that mTORC1 deficiency reduced the abundance of all RNA biotypes, although rRNA processing was largely intact in activated T cells. Imaging cytometry with FISH probes for nascent pre-rRNA revealed that deletion of mTORC1, but not that of mTORC2, reduced the number and expansion of nucleolar sites of active transcription. Protein translation was consequently decreased by 50% in the absence of mTORC1. Inhibiting RNA polymerase I blocked not only proliferation but also mTORC1 signaling. Our data show that TCR signaling, mTORC1 activity, and ribosomal biosynthesis in the nucleolus regulate each other during biomass production in clonally expanding T cells.},

AhR activation prolonged the IL-4–induced activation of the transcription factor STAT6 and increased the duration of STAT6 binding to the promoter of a gene encoding one of these transcripts. These findings identify a mechanism through which metabolites or other AhR ligands can influence the response of monocytes to cytokines. —Annalisa M. VanHook Cytokines induce functional and metabolic adaptations in immune cells, typically through transcriptional responses that can be influenced by other extracellular signals and by intracellular factors. The binding of the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) to its receptor induces the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor STAT6. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor activated by various endogenous and microbe-derived metabolites, modulates the responses of immune cells to danger signals or inflammatory mediators such as cytokines. Here, we investigated cross-talk between the AhR and signaling stimulated by IL-4 in human and mouse monocytes. AhR activation was required for a subset of IL-4–induced transcriptional responses and inhibited the IL-4–induced metabolic switch to fatty acid β-oxidation. The promoters of the genes that were induced by IL-4 in an AhR-dependent manner lacked canonical AhR binding sites, implying a nongenomic mechanism of AhR action. Mechanistically, AhR activation reduced the activity of SHP-1, a phosphatase that targets and inhibits STAT6, and prolonged STAT6 phosphorylation and binding to specific target loci, thus extending the duration of STAT6 activity. Our results identify AhR as a key player in the molecular control of responses to IL-4 in monocytes and suggest a nongenomic mechanism through which AhR ligands may influence the functional responses of cells to IL-4.},

Siah3 prevented mitophagy in axons by binding to parkin, thereby promoting axon pruning.

Here, we found that mitophagy suppression by the protein Siah3 promoted developmental axonal remodeling in mice. Siah3-deficient mice displayed increased peripheral sensory innervation. Cultured Siah3-deficient sensory neurons exhibited delays in both axonal degeneration and caspase-3 activation in response to withdrawal of nerve growth factor. Mechanistically, Siah3 was transcriptionally induced by the loss of trophic support and formed a complex with the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, a core component of mitophagy, in transfected cells. Axons of Siah3-deficient neurons mounted profound mitophagy upon initiation of degeneration but not under basal conditions. Neurons lacking both Siah3 and parkin did not exhibit the delay in trophic deprivation–induced axonal degeneration or the induction of axonal mitophagy that was seen in Siah3-deficient neurons.

  abstract     = {The limitations of current drugs available for treating chronic pain show that different approaches are needed to find new options. Using data from mouse and human sensory nerve tissues, Nascimento et al. built protein-protein interaction networks according to protein binding domain sequences and structures. In addition to known pain signaling complexes (such as PSD-95 and NMDAR), the networks indicated previously unknown pairs, such as the E3 ligase CBL with the growth factor receptor FGFR and its adaptors. The potential of these pairs to occur and function in pain signaling was supported by their coincident detection in nociceptive neurons. The findings set the groundwork for developing analgesics to target selective protein-protein interactions rather than general enzymatic activities. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The development of new analgesics has been challenging. Candidate drugs often have limited clinical utility due to side effects that arise because many drug targets are involved in signaling pathways other than pain transduction. Here, we explored the potential of targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that mediate pain signaling as an approach to developing drugs to treat chronic pain. We reviewed the approaches used to identify small molecules and peptide modulators of PPIs and their ability to decrease pain-like behaviors in rodent animal models. We analyzed data from rodent and human sensory nerve tissues to build associated signaling networks and assessed both validated and potential interactions and the structures of the interacting domains that could inform the design of synthetic peptides and small molecules. This resource identifies PPIs that could be explored for the development of new analgesics, particularly between scaffolding proteins and receptors for various growth factors and neurotransmitters, as well as ion channels and other enzymes. Targeting the adaptor function of CBL by blocking interactions between its proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain and its SH3-domain–containing protein partners, such as GRB2, could disrupt endosomal signaling induced by pain-associated growth factors. This approach would leave intact its E3-ligase functions, which are mediated by other domains and are critical for other cellular functions. This potential of PPI modulators to be more selective may mitigate side effects and improve the clinical management of pain.},

  abstract     = {Early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and enhanced neuronal excitability, and loss of inhibitory G protein–gated K + (GIRK) channel activity has been implicated in rodent AD models. Luo et al. identified a sex-dependent mechanism by which Aβ oligomers suppressed GIRK channel activity in hippocampal neurons. Whereas this mechanism was evident before onset of cognitive deficits only in male AD model mice, genetic enhancement of GIRK channel activity improved cognitive performance in older male and female mice. Thus, GIRK channels may be a sex-dependent driver of early AD pathology but a potential sex-independent target for therapy in later-stage patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid plaques and cognitive decline, the latter of which is thought to be driven by soluble oligomeric amyloid-β (oAβ). The dysregulation of G protein–gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK; also known as Kir3) channels has been implicated in rodent models of AD. Here, seeking mechanistic insights, we uncovered a sex-dependent facet of GIRK-dependent signaling in AD-related amyloid pathophysiology. Synthetic oAβ 1–42 suppressed GIRK-dependent signaling in hippocampal neurons from male mice, but not from female mice. This effect required cellular prion protein, the receptor mGluR5, and production of arachidonic acid by the phospholipase PLA 2 . Although oAβ suppressed GIRK channel activity only in male hippocampal neurons, intrahippocampal infusion of oAβ or genetic suppression of GIRK channel activity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons impaired performance on a memory test in both male and female mice. Moreover, genetic enhancement of GIRK channel activity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons blocked oAβ-induced cognitive impairment in both male and female mice. In APP/PS1 AD model mice, GIRK-dependent signaling was diminished in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from only male mice before cognitive deficit was detected. However, enhancing GIRK channel activity rescued cognitive deficits in older APP/PS1 mice of both sexes. Thus, whereas diminished GIRK channel activity contributes to cognitive deficits in male mice with increased oAβ burden, enhancing its activity may have therapeutic potential for both sexes.},

In flies, neurons expressing the variant or a mutant lacking the WAVE-binding region failed to extend axons properly to and across the body midline, demonstrating how the variant may underlie CMM. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The axon guidance cue netrin-1 signals through its receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) to attract commissural axons to the midline. Variants in DCC are frequently associated with congenital mirror movements (CMMs). A CMM-associated variant in the cytoplasmic tail of DCC is located in a conserved motif predicted to bind to a regulator of actin dynamics called the WAVE (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein–family verprolin homologous protein) regulatory complex (WRC). Here, we explored how this variant affects DCC function and may contribute to CMM. We found that a conserved WRC-interacting receptor sequence (WIRS) motif in the cytoplasmic tail of DCC mediated the interaction between DCC and the WRC. This interaction was required for netrin-1–mediated axon guidance in cultured rodent commissural neurons. Furthermore, the WIRS motif of Fra, the Drosophila DCC ortholog, was required for attractive signaling in vivo at the Drosophila midline. The CMM-associated R1343H variant of DCC, which altered the WIRS motif, prevented the DCC-WRC interaction and impaired axon guidance in cultured commissural neurons and in Drosophila . The findings reveal the WRC as a pivotal component of netrin-1–DCC signaling and uncover a molecular mechanism explaining how a human genetic variant in the cytoplasmic tail of DCC may lead to CMM.},

  abstract     = {Neuron growth and survival are supported by neurotrophic factors. However, increases in the immature forms of neurotrophic factors—called proneurotrophins—are associated with neurodegeneration. Dasgupta et al. found that signaling by the proneurotrophin proNGF at the axon induced the retrograde degeneration of basal forebrain neurons. This degeneration from the axon to the cell body was mediated by local protein synthesis of amyloid precursor protein (APP), axon-to-soma vesicular transport, and activation of the kinase JNK. The findings place APP, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases, in an axonal mechanism of basal forebrain neuron loss. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) extend long projections to multiple regions in the brain to regulate cognitive functions. Degeneration of BFCNs is seen with aging, after brain injury, and in neurodegenerative disorders. An increase in the amount of the immature proform of nerve growth factor (proNGF) in the cerebral cortex results in retrograde degeneration of BFCNs through activation of proNGF receptor p75 NTR . Here, we investigated the signaling cascades initiated at the axon terminal that mediate proNGF-induced retrograde degeneration. We found that local axonal protein synthesis and retrograde transport mediated proNGF-induced degeneration initiated from the axon terminal. Analysis of the nascent axonal proteome revealed that proNGF stimulation of axonal terminals triggered the synthesis of numerous proteins within the axon, and pathway analysis showed that amyloid precursor protein (APP) was a key upstream regulator in cultured BFCNs and in mice. Our findings reveal a functional role for APP in mediating BFCN axonal degeneration and cell death induced by proNGF.},

Naffaa and Yin elucidated the signaling cascade that links the activity of the cholinergic neurons located near these neural stem cells to the proliferation of the neural stem cells. Activation of the cholinergic neurons stimulated muscarinic M3 receptors on quiescent neural stem cells, leading to the activation of proteins that mediate increases in intracellular Ca 2+ and that respond to Ca 2+ . These results identify how quiescent neural stem cells in the lateral ventricles can be activated and induced to proliferate, a process that could contribute to olfactory processing and learning. —Wei Wong Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) located along the lateral ventricles (LVs) of the mammalian brain continue to self-renew to produce new neurons after birth and into adulthood. Quiescent LV cells, which are situated close to the ependymal cells lining the LVs, are activated by choline acetyltransferase–positive (ChAT + ) neurons within the subependymal (subep) region of the SVZ when these neurons are stimulated by projections from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Here, we uncovered a signaling pathway activated by the ACC-subep-ChAT + circuit responsible for the activation and proliferation of quiescent LV NSCs specifically in the ventral area of the SVZ. This circuit activated muscarinic M3 receptors on quiescent LV NSCs, which subsequently induced signaling mediated by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1). Downstream of IP3R1 activation, which would be expected to increase intracellular Ca 2+ , Ca 2+ -/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δ and the MAPK10 signaling pathway were stimulated and required for the proliferation of quiescent LV NSCs in the SVZ. These findings reveal the mechanisms that regulate quiescent LV NSCs and underscore the critical role of projections from the ACC in promoting their proliferative activity within the ventral SVZ.},

Afshar-Sterle et al . found that mutating the kinase domain of DCLK1 or inhibiting its kinase activity reduced tumor growth, abundance of markers of stromal remodeling, and induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic effects of DCLK1 at least partially depended on increased amounts of CXCL12, which correlated with DCLK1 abundance and acted downstream of DCLK1. These results shed light on the mechanistic contribution of DCLK1 in shaping gastric cancer progression. —Amy E. Baek Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a proposed driver of gastric cancer (GC) that phosphorylates serine and threonine residues. Here, we showed that the kinase activity of DCLK1 orchestrated cancer cell–intrinsic and–extrinsic processes that led to pro-invasive and pro-metastatic reprogramming of GC cells. Inhibition of the kinase activity of DCLK1 reduced the growth of subcutaneous xenograft tumors formed from MKN1 human gastric carcinoma cells in mice and decreased the abundance of the stromal markers α-Sma, vimentin, and collagen. Similar effects were seen in mice with xenograft tumors formed from MKN1 cells expressing a kinase-inactive DCLK1 mutant (MKN1 D511N ). MKN1 D511N cells also had reduced in vitro migratory potential and stemness compared with control cells. Mice orthotopically grafted with MKN1 cells overexpressing DCLK1 (MKN1 DCLK1 ) showed increased invasiveness and had a greater incidence of lung metastases compared with those grafted with control MKN1 cells. Mechanistically, we showed that the chemokine CXCL12 acted downstream of DCLK1 in cultured MKN1 cells and in mice subcutaneously implanted with gastric tumors formed by MKN1 DCLK1 cells. Moreover, inhibition of the kinase activity of DCLK1 or the expression of DCLK1 D511N reversed the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic phenotype. Together, this study establishes DCLK1 as a broadly acting and potentially targetable promoter of GC.},

Funahashi et al. delineated the signaling pathway downstream of NMDARs that mediated aversive learning, which enables the identification, prediction, and avoidance of dangerous situations. The authors characterized the proteins phosphorylated in response to NMDAR activation and the kinases responsible. Dendritic spine growth and aversive learning were attenuated when the cytoskeleton-regulating kinase ROCK was pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated or when the ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of a specific substrate, the scaffolding protein SHANK3, was blocked in the nucleus accumbens. Thus, the phosphorylation of SHANK3 by ROCK is crucial for the changes in the neuronal actin cytoskeleton that support aversive learning. —Wei Wong Structural plasticity of dendritic spines in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is crucial for learning from aversive experiences. Activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) stimulates Ca 2+ -dependent signaling that leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, mediated by the Rho family of GTPases, resulting in postsynaptic remodeling essential for learning. We investigated how phosphorylation events downstream of NMDAR activation drive the changes in synaptic morphology that underlie aversive learning. Large-scale phosphoproteomic analyses of protein kinase targets in mouse striatal/accumbal slices revealed that NMDAR activation resulted in the phosphorylation of 194 proteins, including RhoA regulators such as ARHGEF2 and ARHGAP21. Phosphorylation of ARHGEF2 by the Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinase CaMKII enhanced its RhoGEF activity, thereby activating RhoA and its downstream effector Rho-associated kinase (ROCK/Rho-kinase). Further phosphoproteomic analysis identified 221 ROCK targets, including the postsynaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3, which is crucial for its interaction with NMDARs and other postsynaptic scaffolding proteins. ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of SHANK3 in the NAc was essential for spine growth and aversive learning.

Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (USP1) stabilized the transcription factor ATF4, which promoted CD98hc expression. Knocking out CD98hc in tumor cells and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) sensitized cells to PEG-asp treatment, whereas CD98hc-enriched sEVs suppressed the effects of PEG-asp in mice, suggesting that targeting CD98hc may be explored in the treatment of ENKTL. —Amy E. Baek Extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) shows a high rate of recurrence after chemoradiotherapy. Drug resistance can be mediated by the cargo of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Here, we show that high abundance of the transmembrane glycoprotein CD98hc in tumor cells and serum sEVs was associated with ENKTL progression and drug resistance. Mechanistically, PEGylated-asparaginase (PEG-asp) treatment, a common therapy against ENKTL, promoted the translocation of the transcription factor ATF4 to the nucleus, where it was stabilized by USP1 and subsequently increased CD98hc expression. CD98hc delivered in tumor cell–derived sEVs increased tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance in a cultured human NK lymphoma cell line, animal models, and samples from patients with refractory/relapse ENKTL. Moreover, inhibiting both USP1 and EV secretion synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of PEG-asp.

  abstract     = {The kinase GSK-3β is a potential therapeutic target in various neurodegenerative diseases. After phosphorylation of the Wnt signaling component β-catenin by an upstream kinase (phosphopriming), β-catenin is subsequently phosphorylated by GSK-3β and targeted for degradation. Enos et al . determined structures of GSK-3β bound to phosphoprimed or phosphomimetic β-catenin and to the scaffold Axin, which showed that substrate positioning from these interactions was not sufficient for optimal catalysis. However, phosphorylation of phosphoprimed β-catenin was more rapid than that of the phosphomimetic peptide, highlighting the importance of native substrate phosphopriming for catalytic function. —John F. Foley Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) targets specific signaling pathways in response to distinct upstream signals. We used structural and functional studies to dissect how an upstream phosphorylation step primes the Wnt signaling component β-catenin for phosphorylation by GSK-3β and how scaffolding interactions contribute to this reaction. Our crystal structure of GSK-3β bound to a phosphoprimed β-catenin peptide confirmed the expected binding mode of the phosphoprimed residue adjacent to the catalytic site. An aspartate phosphomimic in the priming site of β-catenin adopted an indistinguishable structure but reacted approximately 1000-fold slower than the native phosphoprimed substrate. This result suggests that substrate positioning alone is not sufficient for catalysis and that native phosphopriming interactions are necessary. We also obtained a structure of GSK-3β with an extended peptide from the scaffold protein Axin that bound with greater affinity than that of previously crystallized Axin fragments. This structure neither revealed additional contacts that produce the higher affinity nor explained how substrate interactions in the GSK-3β active site are modulated by remote Axin binding. Together, our findings suggest that phosphopriming and scaffolding produce small conformational changes or allosteric effects, not captured in the crystal structures, that activate GSK-3β and facilitate β-catenin phosphorylation. These results highlight limitations in our ability to predict catalytic activity from structure and have potential implications for the role of natural phosphomimic mutations in kinase regulation and phosphosite evolution.},

  abstract     = {Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is highly prevalent and rapidly spreads throughout an infected host, in part because HCMV can infect blood monocytes without initiating lytic replication. Mahmud et al. investigated how HCMV subverts host signaling pathways to set up a nonlytic, quiescent infection. The authors found that during the early stages of infection, delivery of a protein called US28 by viral particles was critical for limiting the activation of the receptor EGFR. Consequently, the downstream activation of the kinase Akt was restricted in infected monocytes, which enabled a quiescent infection to be established. Thus, limiting the induction of Akt activity by US28 during early infection ensures the survival of HCMV-infected monocytes and prevents the initiation of lytic replication. —Wei Wong Establishing a nonproductive, quiescent infection within monocytes is essential for the spread of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). We investigated the mechanisms through which HCMV establishes a quiescent infection in monocytes. US28 is a virally encoded G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that is essential for silent infections within cells of the myeloid lineage. We found that preformed US28 was rapidly delivered to monocytes by HCMV viral particles, whereas the de novo synthesis of US28 was delayed for several days. A recombinant mutant virus lacking US28 (US28Δ) was unable to establish a quiescent infection, resulting in a fully productive lytic infection able to produce progeny virus. Infection with US28Δ HCMV resulted in the phosphorylation of the serine and threonine kinase Akt at Ser 473 and Thr 308 , in contrast with the phosphorylation of Akt only at Ser 473 after WT viral infection. Inhibiting the dual phosphorylation of Akt prevented the lytic replication of US28Δ, and ectopic expression of a constitutively phosphorylated Akt variant triggered lytic replication of wild-type HCMV. Mechanistically, we found that US28 was necessary and sufficient to attenuate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling induced during the entry of WT virus, which led to the site-specific phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 . Thus, particle-delivered US28 fine-tunes Akt activity by limiting HCMV-induced EGFR activation during viral entry, enabling quiescent infection in monocytes.},

  abstract     = {The chemokine CXCL13 induces cytoskeletal changes that enable B cells to migrate to sites of inflammation. Hwang et al. identified the activation of the kinase WNK1 as an early signaling event triggered by CXCL13 in B cells. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of WNK1 prevented CXCL13-induced cytoskeletal changes and migration in primary mouse B cells and B cell lines. Pharmacological inhibition of WNK1 also reduced B cell motility in mouse lymph nodes. Thus, suppressing B cell responses to CXCL13 could be a side effect of inhibiting WNK1, which is a potential therapeutic target in cancer and hypertension. —Wei Wong Ligand-engaged chemokine receptors trigger nucleotide exchange in heterotrimeric Gα i proteins, which stimulates cytoskeletal reorganization and cell polarity changes. To better understand the signaling events responsible for these cellular changes, we focused on early changes in F-actin dynamics after engagement of the chemokine receptor CXCR5 in murine splenic B cells. Within 10 seconds of exposure to the CXCR5 ligand CXCL13, three-dimensional lamellar-like pseudopods and F-actin–rich ridges appeared. The transient F-actin increase depended on Gα i2/3 signaling, the PI3K/AKT pathway, ERK activation, phospholipase C activity, and Rac1/2 activation mediated by Dock2 (dedicator of cytokinesis 2). Immunoblot analyses identified the kinase WNK1 (with no lysine kinase 1) as a potential early AKT effector. Treating B cells with specific WNK inhibitors disrupted F-actin dynamics and impaired B cell polarity, motility, and chemotaxis. These changes were mimicked in a murine B cell line by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of Wnk1 , which also suggested that WNK1 contributed to B cell proliferation. Administration of a single dose of a WNK inhibitor transiently reduced B cell motility and polarity in the lymph nodes of live mice. These results indicate that WNK1 signaling maintains B cell responsiveness to CXCL13 and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of WNK1, which is involved in cancer progression and blood pressure regulation, may affect humoral immunity.},

  abstract     = {For a coronavirus to enter and infect cells, its spike protein must be sequentially processed at priming and activating sites by host proteases. Kim et al. found that the secreted protease KLK5 cleaved both sites in betacoronavirus spike proteins. KLK5 abundance increased in human airway cells infected with betacoronaviruses, and knockdown or inhibition of KLK5 reduced betacoronavirus replication in cells. KLK5 inhibitors also reduced lung inflammation in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV, suggesting that they could be used to treat diseases caused by known and emerging coronaviruses. —Annalisa M. VanHook Coronaviruses rely on host proteases to activate the viral spike protein, which facilitates fusion with the host cell membrane and the release of viral genomic RNAs into the host cell cytoplasm. The distribution of specific host proteases in the host determines the host, tissue, and cellular tropism of these viruses. Here, we identified the kallikrein (KLK) family member KLK5 as a major host protease secreted by human airway cells and exploited by multiple human betacoronaviruses. KLK5 cleaved both the priming (S1/S2) and activation (S2′) sites of spike proteins from various human betacoronaviruses in vitro. In contrast, KLK12 and KLK13 displayed preferences for either the S2′ or S1/S2 site, respectively. Whereas KLK12 and KLK13 worked in concert to activate SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV spike proteins, KLK5 by itself efficiently activated spike proteins from several human betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Infection of differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) with human betacoronaviruses induced an increase in KLK5 that promoted virus replication. Furthermore, ursolic acid and other related plant-derived triterpenoids that inhibit KLK5 effectively suppressed the replication of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in HBECs and mitigated lung inflammation in mice infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. We propose that KLK5 is a pancoronavirus host factor and a promising therapeutic target for current and future coronavirus-induced diseases.},

Gareri et al . investigated the role of phosphorylation barcodes in signaling by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). AT1R elicits both G protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment in response to the endogenous agonist AngII but stimulates only β-arrestin recruitment in response to a synthetic biased agonist. The authors identified patterns of serine and threonine phosphorylation that stabilized specific conformations of β-arrestin and were necessary for β-arrestin function. These findings demonstrate the importance of phosphorylation barcodes in determining the consequences of AT1R activation. —Annalisa M. VanHook Different ligands stabilize specific conformations of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) that direct distinct signaling cascades mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins or β-arrestin. These different active conformations are thought to engage distinct intracellular transducers because of differential phosphorylation patterns in the receptor C-terminal tail (the “barcode” hypothesis). Here, we identified the AT1R barcodes for the endogenous agonist AngII, which stimulates both G protein activation and β-arrestin recruitment, and for a synthetic biased agonist that only stimulates β-arrestin recruitment. The endogenous and β-arrestin–biased agonists induced two different ensembles of phosphorylation sites along the C-terminal tail. The phosphorylation of eight serine and threonine residues in the proximal and middle portions of the tail was required for full β-arrestin functionality, whereas phosphorylation of the serine and threonine residues in the distal portion of the tail had little influence on β-arrestin function. Similarly, molecular dynamics simulations showed that the proximal and middle clusters of phosphorylated residues were critical for stable β-arrestin–receptor interactions. These findings demonstrate that ligands that stabilize different receptor conformations induce different phosphorylation clusters in the C-terminal tail as barcodes to evoke distinct receptor-transducer engagement, receptor trafficking, and signaling.},

Using neurons derived from patients, Dong et al . found that repeats of glycine-arginine (poly-GR) encoded by mutant C9ORF72 RNA stalled the translational machinery, which caused ribosomes to collide. The resulting ribotoxic stress response induced neuronal death. Blocking this response by inhibiting the kinases ZAKα or p38 MAPK increased the survival of patient-derived neurons in culture. The approach might have therapeutic potential to preserve neurons in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is the most frequent inherited cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The expansion results in multiple dipeptide repeat proteins, among which arginine-rich poly-GR proteins are highly toxic to neurons and decrease the rate of protein synthesis. We investigated whether the effect on protein synthesis contributes to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. We found that the expression of poly-GR proteins inhibited global translation by perturbing translation elongation. In iPSC-differentiated neurons, the translation of transcripts with relatively slow elongation rates was further slowed, and stalled, by poly-GR. Elongation stalling increased ribosome collisions and induced a ribotoxic stress response (RSR) mediated by ZAKα that increased the phosphorylation of the kinase p38 and promoted cell death. Knockdown of ZAKα or pharmacological inhibition of p38 ameliorated poly-GR–induced toxicity and improved the survival of iPSC–derived neurons from patients with C9ORF72 -ALS/FTD.

Chemogenetic approaches in mice revealed that the activation of dopamine release from ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons increased the abundance and activity of the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin and reduced the amount of Aβ deposits in the prefrontal cortex in a neprilysin-dependent manner. Aged mice had less dopamine and neprilysin in the anterior cortex, a decrease that was accentuated in AD model mice.

We investigated the mechanism of this association in a mouse model of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) that mimics the repetitive hypoxemias of OSA. After 14 days of CIH, both male and female mice exhibited behaviors indicative of persistent pain, with biochemical markers in the spinal cord dorsal horn and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia consistent with hyperalgesic priming. CIH, but not sleep fragmentation alone, induced an increase in macrophage recruitment to peripheral sensory tissues (sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia), an increase in inflammatory cytokines in the circulation, and nociceptor sensitization.

Here, we developed chimeric adaptor proteins (CAPs) and CAR tyrosine kinases (CAR-TKs) in which the intracellular ζ T cell receptor (TCRζ) chain was replaced with intracellular protein domains to stimulate signaling downstream of the TCRζ chain. CAPs contain adaptor domains and the kinase domain of ZAP70, whereas CAR-TKs contain only ZAP70 domains. We hypothesized that CAPs and CAR-TKs would be more potent than CARs because they would bypass both the steps that define the signaling threshold of TCRζ and the inhibitory regulation of upstream molecules. CAPs were too potent and exhibited high tonic signaling in vitro. In contrast, CAR-TKs exhibited high antitumor efficacy and significantly enhanced long-term tumor clearance in leukemia-bearing NSG mice as compared with the conventional CD19-28ζ-CAR-T cells. CAR-TKs were activated in a manner independent of the kinase Lck and displayed slower phosphorylation kinetics and prolonged signaling compared with the 28ζ-CAR. Lck inhibition attenuated CAR-TK cell exhaustion and improved long-term function. The distinct signaling properties of CAR-TKs may therefore be harnessed to improve the in vivo efficacy of T cells engineered to express an antitumor chimeric receptor.},

  abstract     = {The strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling determines whether naïve T cells differentiate into proinflammatory T H 17 cells or anti-inflammatory T reg cells. Anannya et al. investigated whether the kinase ITK, which is activated by TCR engagement, influenced these cell fates in mice. ITK inhibition increased the T reg :T H 17 ratio in the lungs during allergic inflammation. Furthermore, ITK inhibition of naïve T cells cultured under T H 17-inducing conditions differentiated into cells that resembled T reg cells functionally and transcriptionally. This switch in cell fate depended on the capacity of ITK to induce Ca 2+ signaling. Thus, an ITK-dependent, Ca 2+ -mediated switch fine-tunes the balance of T H 17 and T reg cells. —Annalisa M. VanHook The balance of proinflammatory T helper type 17 (T H 17) and anti-inflammatory T regulatory (T reg ) cells is crucial for immune homeostasis in health and disease. The differentiation of naïve CD4 + T cells into T H 17 and T reg cells depends on T cell receptor (TCR) signaling mediated, in part, by interleukin-2–inducible T cell kinase (ITK), which stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Ca 2+ signaling. Here, we report that, in the absence of ITK activity, naïve murine CD4 + T cells cultured under T H 17-inducing conditions expressed the T reg transcription factor Foxp3 and did not develop into T H 17 cells. Furthermore, ITK inhibition in vivo during allergic inflammation increased the T reg :T H 17 ratio in the lung. These switched Foxp3 + T reg -like cells had suppressive function, and their transcriptomic profile resembled that of differentiated, induced T reg (iT reg ) cells, but their chromatin accessibility profiles were intermediate between T H 17 and iT reg cells. Like iT reg cells, switched Foxp3 + T reg -like cells had reductions in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, in the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and in the abundance of the T H 17 pioneer transcription factor BATF. This ITK-dependent switch between T H 17 and T reg cells depended on Ca 2+ signaling but not on MAPKs. These findings suggest potential strategies for fine-tuning TCR signal strength through ITK to control the balance of T H 17 and T reg cells.},

Carden et al. identified a role for the voltage-gated K + channel K v 1.3 in B cells in the lytic phase of KSHV, during which active viral replication occurs. KSHV increased the abundance and activity of K v 1.3 channels during lytic replication. Overexpression of the KSHV-encoded early protein RTA was sufficient to induce the transcription of K v 1.3-encoding mRNA. K v 1.3 maintained a hyperpolarized membrane potential that allowed Ca 2+ influx, which was required for KSHV lytic replication. These results suggest that K v 1.3 is a potential target in treating KSHV-driven malignancies. —Amy E. Baek Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that is linked directly to the development of Kaposi’s sarcoma. KSHV establishes a latent infection in B cells, which can be reactivated to initiate lytic replication, producing infectious virions. Using pharmacological and genetic silencing approaches, we showed that the voltage-gated K + channel K v 1.3 in B cells enhanced KSHV lytic replication. The KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA) protein increased the abundance of K v 1.3 and led to enhanced K + channel activity and hyperpolarization of the B cell membrane. Enhanced K v 1.3 activity promoted intracellular Ca 2+ influx, leading to the Ca 2+ -driven nuclear localization of KSHV RTA and host nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) proteins and subsequently increased the expression of NFAT1 target genes. KSHV lytic replication and infectious virion production were inhibited by K v 1.3 blockers or silencing. These findings highlight K v 1.3 as a druggable host factor that is key to the successful completion of KSHV lytic replication.},

  abstract     = {The inflammatory cytokine IL-1β is secreted by monocytes upon activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Raulien et al. found that the NLRP3 inflammasome was activated by glucose-oxygen deprivation, which is common during infection and inflammation. Glucose-oxygen deprivation inhibited the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in human monocytes, which perturbed the lipid modification of the GTPase Rac1, resulting in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production. Cells from patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency had an enhanced inflammatory response to glucose-oxygen deprivation, suggesting that prenylation of Rac1 might be targeted to treat this autoimmune disorder. —John F. Foley Hypoxia and low glucose abundance often occur simultaneously at sites of inflammation. In monocytes and macrophages, glucose-oxygen deprivation stimulates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome to generate the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. We found that concomitant glucose deprivation and hypoxia activated the NLRP3 inflammasome by constraining the function of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate kinase pathway. HMGCR is involved in the synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is required for the prenylation and lipid membrane integration of proteins. Under glucose-oxygen deprivation, GGPP synthesis was decreased, leading to reduced prenylation of the small GTPase Rac1, increased binding of nonprenylated Rac1 to the scaffolding protein IQGAP1, and enhanced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In response to restricted oxygen and glucose supply, patient monocytes with a compromised mevalonate pathway due to mevalonate kinase deficiency or Muckle-Wells syndrome released more IL-1β than did control monocytes. Thus, reduced GGPP synthesis due to inhibition of HMGCR under glucose-oxygen deprivation results in proinflammatory innate responses, which are normally kept in check by the prenylation of Rac1. We suggest that this mechanism is also active in inflammatory autoimmune conditions.},

Jackson et al. developed an antibody that specifically bound to the latent form of TGF-β1 presented in the extracellular matrix and prevented its release. The antibody did not have toxic effects in mice and did not bind to latent complexes of TGF-β2 or TGF-β3 or to the latent forms of TGF-β1 presented on immune cells. In two rodent models of kidney fibrosis, systemic treatment with the antibody reduced fibrosis. The specificity of this approach may enable the safe targeting of TGF-β to treat fibrotic diseases (see also the Focus by Hinz). —Annalisa M. VanHook Inhibitors of the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) pathway are potentially promising antifibrotic therapies, but nonselective simultaneous inhibition of all three TGF-β homologs has safety liabilities. TGF-β1 is noncovalently bound to a latency-associated peptide that is, in turn, covalently bound to different presenting molecules within large latent complexes. The latent TGF-β–binding proteins (LTBPs) present TGF-β1 in the extracellular matrix, and TGF-β1 is presented on immune cells by two transmembrane proteins, glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) and leucine-rich repeat protein 33 (LRRC33). Here, we describe LTBP-49247, an antibody that selectively bound to and inhibited the activation of TGF-β1 presented by LTBPs but did not bind to TGF-β1 presented by GARP or LRRC33. Structural studies demonstrated that LTBP-49247 recognized an epitope on LTBP-presented TGF-β1 that is not accessible on GARP- or LRRC33-presented TGF-β1, explaining the antibody’s selectivity for LTBP-complexed TGF-β1. In two rodent models of kidney fibrosis of different etiologies, LTBP-49247 attenuated fibrotic progression, indicating the central role of LTBP-presented TGF-β1 in renal fibrosis. In mice, LTBP-49247 did not have the toxic effects associated with less selective TGF-β inhibitors.

  abstract     = {The transcriptional cofactor YAP is usually associated with tumor progression. However, Li et al. found that YAP has a tumor-suppressive role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) by outcompeting another transcription factor for a binding partner. The proliferation of ccRCC cells was driven by the NF-κB subunit p65 in complex with the cofactor TEAD. YAP competed for TEAD binding, displacing p65 and preventing its transcriptional activity. Activating YAP repressed tumor growth in mice, suggesting the potential of this counterintuitive approach to stall primary ccRCC growth in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The Hippo pathway is generally understood to inhibit tumor growth by phosphorylating the transcriptional cofactor YAP to sequester it to the cytoplasm and reduce the formation of YAP-TEAD transcriptional complexes. Aberrant activation of YAP occurs in various cancers. However, we found a tumor-suppressive function of YAP in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using cell cultures, xenografts, and patient-derived explant models, we found that the inhibition of upstream Hippo-pathway kinases MST1 and MST2 or expression of a constitutively active YAP mutant impeded ccRCC proliferation and decreased gene expression mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB. Mechanistically, the NF-κB subunit p65 bound to the transcriptional cofactor TEAD to facilitate NF-κB–target gene expression that promoted cell proliferation. However, by competing for TEAD, YAP disrupted its interaction with NF-κB and prompted the dissociation of p65 from target gene promoters, thereby inhibiting NF-κB transcriptional programs. This cross-talk between the Hippo and NF-κB pathways in ccRCC suggests that targeting the Hippo-YAP axis in an atypical manner—that is, by activating YAP—may be a strategy for slowing tumor growth in patients.},

  abstract     = {Mini-G proteins are engineered forms of Gα subunits that stably interact with activated G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are often used to investigate GPCR signaling from specific subcellular compartments. Manchanda et al. found that mini-G proteins interfered with GPCR internalization and compartmentalized signaling. Overexpression of a mini-G protein derived from Gα s prevented agonist-induced β-arrestin 2 recruitment to the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), which inhibited receptor internalization and signaling at endosomes. Other GPCRs also showed reduced internalization when the mini-G versions of their cognate Gα subunits were overexpressed. These potentially confounding effects indicate that results from experiments using mini-G proteins to measure compartmentalized GPCR signaling should be interpreted cautiously. —Annalisa M. VanHook Mini-G proteins are engineered, thermostable variants of Gα subunits designed to stabilize G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in their active conformations. Because of their small size and ease of use, they are popular tools for assessing GPCR behaviors in cells, both as reporters of receptor coupling to Gα subtypes and for cellular assays to quantify compartmentalized signaling at various subcellular locations. Here, we report that overexpression of mini-G proteins with their cognate GPCRs disrupted GPCR endocytic trafficking and associated intracellular signaling. In cells expressing the Gα s -coupled GPCR glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), coexpression of mini-G s , a mini-G protein derived from Gα s , blocked β-arrestin 2 recruitment and receptor internalization and disrupted endosomal GLP-1R signaling. These effects did not involve changes in receptor phosphorylation or lipid nanodomain segregation. Moreover, we found that mini-G proteins derived from Gα i and Gα q also inhibited the internalization of GPCRs that couple to them. Finally, we developed an alternative intracellular signaling assay for GLP-1R using a nanobody specific for active Gα s :GPCR complexes (Nb37) that did not affect GLP-1R internalization. Our results have important implications for designing methods to assess intracellular GPCR signaling.},

  abstract     = {Biased agonists of GPCRs stimulate signaling through either G proteins or β-arrestins, which is clinically relevant if one pathway is therapeutic and the other produces side effects. Tóth et al. found that the endocytosis of the angiotensin II receptor AT 1 R and other GPCRs determined signaling strength through the β-arrestin pathway. Blocking endocytosis elicited responses from weak β-arrestin–biased agonists that resembled those generated by full agonists. As a result, ligand efficacy in β-arrestin signaling may be determined more by spatiotemporal regulation than by the induction of different receptor conformations at the plasma membrane by distinct agonists. These findings may guide the development of GPCR-targeting drugs that more effectively produce only the desired therapeutic response. —John F. Foley The stabilization of different active conformations of G protein–coupled receptors is thought to underlie the varying efficacies of biased and balanced agonists. Here, profiling the activation of signal transducers by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) agonists revealed that the extent and kinetics of β-arrestin binding exhibited substantial ligand-dependent differences, which were lost when receptor internalization was inhibited. When AT 1 R endocytosis was prevented, even weak partial agonists of the β-arrestin pathway acted as full or near-full agonists, suggesting that receptor conformation did not exclusively determine β-arrestin recruitment. The ligand-dependent variance in β-arrestin translocation was much larger at endosomes than at the plasma membrane, showing that ligand efficacy in the β-arrestin pathway was spatiotemporally determined. Experimental investigations and mathematical modeling demonstrated how multiple factors concurrently shaped the effects of agonists on endosomal receptor–β-arrestin binding and thus determined the extent of functional selectivity. Ligand dissociation rate and G protein activity had particularly strong, internalization-dependent effects on the receptor–β-arrestin interaction. We also showed that endocytosis regulated the agonist efficacies of two other receptors with sustained β-arrestin binding: the V 2 vasopressin receptor and a mutant β 2 -adrenergic receptor. In the absence of endocytosis, the agonist-dependent variance in β-arrestin2 binding was markedly diminished. Our results suggest that endocytosis determines the spatiotemporal bias in GPCR signaling and can aid in the development of more efficacious, functionally selective compounds.},

Numerous protein targets and many important roles have now been elucidated for Pin1. However, no tools are available to detect or target cis and trans conformation events in cells. The development of Pin1 inhibitors and stereo- and phospho-specific antibodies has revealed that cis and trans conformations have distinct and often opposing cellular functions. Aberrant conformational changes due to the dysregulation of Pin1 can drive pathogenesis but can be effectively targeted in age-related diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders.

These findings have the potential to improve the design of BRET-based assays to accurately determine GPCR functional selectivity. —Annalisa M. VanHook G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate cellular signaling processes by coupling to diverse combinations of heterotrimeric G proteins composed of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits. Biosensors based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) have advanced our understanding of GPCR functional selectivity. Some BRET biosensors monitor ligand-induced conformational changes in the receptor or G proteins, whereas others monitor the recruitment of downstream effectors to sites of G protein activation. Here, we compared the ability of conformation-and activation-based BRET biosensors to assess the coupling of various class A and B GPCRs to specific Gα proteins in cultured cells. These GPCRs included serotonin 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 7 receptors, the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and the M 3 muscarinic receptor. We observed different signaling profiles between the two types of sensors, highlighting how data interpretation could be affected by the nature of the biosensor. We also found that the identity of the Gβγ subunits used in the assay could differentially influence the selectivity of a receptor toward Gα subtypes, emphasizing the importance of the receptor-Gβγ pairing in determining Gα coupling specificity. Last, the addition of epitope tags to the receptor could affect stoichiometry and coupling selectivity and yield artifactual findings.

  abstract     = {Deficiency in the protein BAP1 is associated with increased metastatic progression of uveal melanoma (UM), an intraocular tumor. Chua et al . explored this connection in UM cell lines and patient samples. Loss of BAP1 or its deubiquitylase function decreased proliferation and signaling mediated by the protein S6 in UM cells and tumors. This loss of S6 signaling correlated with increased cell survival during amino acid starvation. Because nutrient deficiency is a type of stress common to the metastatic process, these findings suggest that BAP1 deficiency may support the survival of UM cells during metastasis. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Uveal melanoma (UM) is the deadliest form of eye cancer in adults. Inactivating mutations and/or loss of expression of the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) in UM tumors are associated with an increased risk of metastasis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this risk, we explored the functional consequences of BAP1 deficiency. UM cell lines expressing mutant BAP1 grew more slowly than those expressing wild-type BAP1 in culture and in vivo. The ability of BAP1 reconstitution to restore cell proliferation in BAP1-deficient cells required its deubiquitylase activity. Proteomic analysis showed that BAP1-deficient cells had decreased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 and its upstream regulator, p70S6K1, compared with both wild-type and BAP1 reconstituted cells. In turn, expression of p70S6K1 increased S6 phosphorylation and proliferation of BAP1-deficient UM cells. Consistent with these findings, BAP1 mutant primary UM tumors expressed lower amounts of p70S6K1 target genes, and S6 phosphorylation was decreased in BAP1 mutant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), which grew more slowly than wild-type PDXs in the liver (the main metastatic site of UM) in mice. BAP1-deficient UM cells were also more resistant to amino acid starvation, which was associated with diminished phosphorylation of S6. These studies demonstrate that BAP1 deficiency slows the proliferation of UM cells through regulation of S6 phosphorylation. These characteristics may be associated with metastasis by ensuring survival during amino acid starvation.},

Liu et al. uncovered a role for the putative Ca 2+ sensor MCTP1 in neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer. MCTP1 was abundant in human prostate tumors, and its expression in prostate cancer cells was stimulated by the transcription factors ZBTB46, FOXA2, and HIF1A in a hypoxia-dependent manner. MCTP1 expression promoted tumor progression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, thus suggesting that targeting MCTP1 could prevent neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer. —Amy E. Baek Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (PCa) (NEPC), an aggressive subtype that is associated with poor prognosis, may arise after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ADT induces neuroendocrine differentiation in advanced PCa. We found that transmembrane protein 1 (MCTP1), which has putative Ca 2+ sensing function and multiple Ca 2+ -binding C2 domains, was abundant in samples from patients with advanced PCa. MCTP1 was associated with the expression of the EMT-associated transcription factors ZBTB46, FOXA2, and HIF1A. The increased abundance of MCTP1 promoted PC3 prostate cancer cell migration and neuroendocrine differentiation and was associated with SNAI1-dependent EMT in C4-2 PCa cells after ADT. ZBTB46 interacted with FOXA2 and HIF1A and increased the abundance of MCTP1 in a hypoxia-dependent manner. MCTP1 stimulated Ca 2+ signaling and AKT activation to promote EMT and neuroendocrine differentiation by increasing the SNAI1-dependent expression of EMT and neuroendocrine markers, effects that were blocked by knockdown of MCTP1. These data suggest an oncogenic role for MCTP1 in the maintenance of a rare and aggressive prostate cancer subtype through its response to Ca 2+ and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target.},

  abstract     = {In addition to being activated by GPCRs, heterotrimeric G proteins can be transactivated by receptor tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Roy et al. investigated mechanisms of cross-talk between the GPCR CXCR4 and EGFR. Mass spectrometry analysis identified Gα i residues that were phosphorylated in response to EGF. Studies of Gα i proteins mutated at these sites showed that Gα i phosphorylation prevented it from subsequently coupling to CXCR4, in one case because of the cytosolic mislocalization of Gα i . Together, these findings suggest that cross-talk between growth factor receptors and GPCRs may be mediated at the level of Gα i phosphorylation. —John F. Foley A long-standing question in the field of signal transduction is how distinct signaling pathways interact with each other to control cell behavior. Growth factor receptors and G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the two major signaling hubs in eukaryotes. Given that the mechanisms by which they signal independently have been extensively characterized, we investigated how they may cross-talk with each other. Using linear ion trap mass spectrometry and cell-based biophysical, biochemical, and phenotypic assays, we found at least three distinct ways in which epidermal growth factor affected canonical G protein signaling by the G i -coupled GPCR CXCR4 through the phosphorylation of Gα i . Phosphomimicking mutations in two residues in the α E helix of Gα i (tyrosine-154/tyrosine-155) suppressed agonist-induced Gα i activation while promoting constitutive Gβγ signaling. Phosphomimicking mutations in the P loop (serine-44, serine-47, and threonine-48) suppressed G i activation entirely, thus completely segregating growth factor and GPCR pathways. As expected, most of the phosphorylation events appeared to affect intrinsic properties of Gα i proteins, including conformational stability, nucleotide binding, and the ability to associate with and to release Gβγ. However, one phosphomimicking mutation, targeting the carboxyl-terminal residue tyrosine-320, promoted mislocalization of Gα i from the plasma membrane, a previously uncharacterized mechanism of suppressing GPCR signaling through G protein subcellular compartmentalization. Together, these findings elucidate not only how growth factor and chemokine signals cross-talk through the phosphorylation-dependent modulation of Gα i but also how such cross-talk may generate signal diversity.},

Palamiuc et al. found that the phosphoinositide PI5P reinforced the inhibition of YAP by the Hippo pathway (see also the Focus by Hirsch et al. ). Conversely, the Hippo pathway kinases phosphorylated and suppressed the activity of PI5P4Ks, the phosphoinositide kinases that metabolize PI5P to a phosphoinositide that did not inhibit YAP. In various human tumor types, increased expression of PI5P4K-encoding genes correlated with increased expression of a YAP gene signature associated with cancer progression. These results identify a signaling role for a phosphoinositide in supporting Hippo signaling. —Wei Wong Phosphoinositides are essential signaling molecules. The PI5P4K family of phosphoinositide kinases and their substrates and products, PI5P and PI4,5P 2 , respectively, are emerging as intracellular metabolic and stress sensors. We performed an unbiased screen to investigate the signals that these kinases relay and the specific upstream regulators controlling this signaling node. We found that the core Hippo pathway kinases MST1/2 phosphorylated PI5P4Ks and inhibited their signaling in vitro and in cells. We further showed that PI5P4K activity regulated several Hippo- and YAP-related phenotypes, specifically decreasing the interaction between the key Hippo proteins MOB1 and LATS and stimulating the YAP-mediated genetic program governing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, we showed that PI5P interacted with MOB1 and enhanced its interaction with LATS, thereby providing a signaling connection between the Hippo pathway and PI5P4Ks. These findings reveal how these two important evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways are integrated to regulate metazoan development and human disease.},

  abstract     = {Detection of viral double-stranded RNA by OAS3 rapidly induces the activation of RNase L, which results in the degradation of all cellular RNA. Cusic and Burke investigated the regulation of RNase L activation in mammalian cells. Double-stranded RNA or infection with RNA viruses, such as dengue, Zika, or West Nile virus, induced the condensation of OAS3 and active RNase L into cytoplasmic granules. These granules were composed of an OAS3–double-stranded RNA core surrounded by a shell of RNase L, which dynamically exchanged with a cytoplasmic pool. In addition to rapidly activating RNase L, the condensation of RNase L and OAS3 may also set a threshold to prevent spurious activation and the shutdown of cellular processes that occur with mRNA degradation. —Wei Wong Oligoadenylate synthetase 3 (OAS3) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) are components of a pathway that combats viral infection in mammals. Upon detection of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), OAS3 synthesizes 2′-5′-oligo(A), which activates the RNase domain of RNase L by promoting the homodimerization and oligomerization of RNase L monomers. Activated RNase L rapidly degrades all cellular mRNAs, shutting off several cellular processes. We sought to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid activation of RNase L in response to viral infection. Through superresolution microscopy and live-cell imaging, we showed that OAS3 and RNase L concentrated into higher-order cytoplasmic complexes known as dsRNA-induced foci (dRIF) in response to dsRNA or infection with dengue virus, Zika virus, or West Nile virus. The concentration of OAS3 and RNase L at dRIF corresponded with the activation of RNase L–mediated RNA decay. We showed that dimerized/oligomerized RNase L concentrated in a liquid-like shell surrounding a core OAS3-dRIF structure and dynamically exchanged with the cytosol. These data establish that the condensation of dsRNA, OAS3, and RNase L into dRIF is a molecular switch that promotes the rapid activation of RNase L upon detection of dsRNA in mammalian cells.},

  abstract     = {Inhibitors of the Ras-MAPK pathway are used to treat cancers carrying RAS and BRAF mutations. Zhang et al. performed a CRISPR-based screen to find modulators of the MAPK pathway and found that protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) increased sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Deletion of the catalytic subunit of PP6 promoted the growth of KRAS - and BRAF -mutant cells in spheroid cultures and in mice in an NF-κB–dependent manner and increased their resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. These findings indicate that PP6 contributes to MAPK sensitivity in KRAS - and BRAF -mutant cells and suggest that the NF-κB pathway may be cotargeted in PP6C -mutant cells. —Amy E. Baek The Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a major target for cancer treatment. To better understand the genetic pathways that modulate cancer cell sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors, we performed a CRISPR knockout screen with MAPK pathway inhibitors on a colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line carrying mutant KRAS. Genetic deletion of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), encoded by PPP6C , rendered KRAS - and BRAF -mutant CRC and BRAF -mutant melanoma cells more resistant to these inhibitors. In the absence of MAPK pathway inhibition, PPP6C deletion in CRC cells decreased cell proliferation in two-dimensional (2D) adherent cultures but accelerated the growth of tumor spheroids in 3D culture and tumor xenografts in vivo. PPP6C deletion enhanced the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in CRC and melanoma cells and circumvented the cell cycle arrest and decreased cyclin D1 abundance induced by MAPK pathway blockade in CRC cells. Inhibiting NF-κB activity by genetic and pharmacological means restored the sensitivity of PPP6C -deficient cells to MAPK pathway inhibition in CRC and melanoma cells in vitro and in CRC cells in vivo. Furthermore, a R264 point mutation in PPP6C conferred loss of function in CRC cells, phenocopying the enhanced NF-κB activation and resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition observed for PPP6C deletion. These findings demonstrate that PP6 constrains the growth of KRAS - and BRAF -mutant cancer cells, implicates the PP6–NF-κB axis as a modulator of MAPK pathway output, and presents a rationale for cotargeting the NF-κB pathway in PPP6C -mutant cancer cells.},

Khudayberdiev et al. found that MRTF-SRF signaling in mouse cortical neurons was regulated by the cyclase-associated protein CAP1. Analysis of the cerebral cortices of Cap1 knockout mice and isolated cortical neurons showed that CAP1 bound to the actin cytoskeleton and increased the amount of actin monomers in the cytoplasm. These actin monomers bound to and sequestered MRTF in the cytoplasm, thereby reducing MRTF-dependent SRF transcriptional activity. The findings, which include a multiomic resource for further exploration, provide insight into the regulation of cytoskeleton-associated signaling in neuronal development and function. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Serum response factor (SRF) is an essential transcription factor for brain development and function. Here, we explored how an SRF cofactor, the actin monomer-sensing myocardin-related transcription factor MRTF, is regulated in mouse cortical neurons. We found that MRTF-dependent SRF activity in vitro and in vivo was repressed by cyclase-associated protein CAP1. Inactivation of the actin-binding protein CAP1 reduced the amount of actin monomers in the cytoplasm, which promoted nuclear MRTF translocation and MRTF-SRF activation. This function was independent of cofilin1 and actin-depolymerizing factor, and CAP1 loss of function in cortical neurons was not compensated by endogenous CAP2. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of cerebral cortex lysates from wild-type and Cap1 knockout mice supported the role of CAP1 in repressing MRTF-SRF–dependent signaling in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis identified likely MRTF-SRF target genes, which aligned with the transcriptomic and proteomic results. Together with our previous studies that implicated CAP1 in axonal growth cone function as well as the morphology and plasticity of excitatory synapses, our findings establish CAP1 as a crucial actin regulator in the brain relevant for formation of neuronal networks.},

Ferrarelli Signaling mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is supported by the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95, has antidepressant effects. Conversely, clinical depression is associated with reduced BDNF signaling. We found that peptidomimetic compounds that bind to PSD-95 promoted signaling by the BDNF receptor TrkB in the hippocampus and reduced depression-like behaviors in mice. The compounds CN2097 and Syn3 both bind to the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95, and Syn3 also binds to an α-helical region of the protein. Syn3 reduced depression-like behaviors in two mouse models of stress-induced depression; CN2097 had similar but less potent effects. In hippocampal neurons, application of Syn3 enhanced the formation of TrkB–Gα i1/3 –PSD-95 complexes and potentiated downstream PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. In mice subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS), systemic administration of Syn3 reversed the CMS-induced, depression-associated changes in PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, dendrite complexity, spine density, and autophagy in the hippocampus and reduced depression-like behaviors. Knocking out Gα i1/3 in hippocampal neurons prevented the therapeutic effects of Syn3, indicating dependence of these effects on the TrkB pathway.

Stepan et al . found that blocking Hippo signaling improved cognition in mice by enabling the redistribution of WWC1. In hippocampal neurons, WWC1 was bound to Hippo pathway kinases. Blocking the activation of these kinases released WWC1 to interact with AMPA-type glutamate receptor complexes. This treatment improved cognitive performance in aged and Alzheimer’s disease model mice, revealing that targeting Hippo pathway kinases may have potential for therapeutic development. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The localization, number, and function of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are crucial for synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate for learning and memory. The Hippo pathway member WWC1 is an important component of AMPAR-containing protein complexes. However, the availability of WWC1 is constrained by its interaction with the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1 and LATS2 (LATS1/2). Here, we explored the biochemical regulation of this interaction and found that it is pharmacologically targetable in vivo. In primary hippocampal neurons, phosphorylation of LATS1/2 by the upstream kinases MST1 and MST2 (MST1/2) enhanced the interaction between WWC1 and LATS1/2, which sequestered WWC1. Pharmacologically inhibiting MST1/2 in male mice and in human brain-derived organoids promoted the dissociation of WWC1 from LATS1/2, leading to an increase in WWC1 in AMPAR-containing complexes. MST1/2 inhibition enhanced synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal brain slices and improved cognition in healthy male mice and in male mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and aging. Thus, compounds that disrupt the interaction between WWC1 and LATS1/2 might be explored for development as cognitive enhancers.},

Compared with CD4 + T cells from healthy donors, those from patients with rheumatoid arthritis produced more TNF-α, showed increased Akt activation, and had increased mitochondrial mass within inflammatory cell subsets. These results suggest that TNF-α–mediated metabolic reprogramming is dysregulated during chronic inflammation. —John F. Foley Upon activation, T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the bioenergetic demands of clonal expansion and effector function. Because dysregulated T cell cytokine production and metabolic phenotypes coexist in chronic inflammatory disease, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we investigated whether inflammatory cytokines released by differentiating T cells amplified their metabolic changes. We found that tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) released by human naïve CD4 + T cells upon activation stimulated the expression of a metabolic transcriptome and increased glycolysis, amino acid uptake, mitochondrial oxidation of glutamine, and mitochondrial biogenesis. The effects of TNF-α were mediated by activation of Akt-mTOR signaling by the kinase ITK and did not require the NF-κB pathway. TNF-α stimulated the differentiation of naïve cells into proinflammatory T helper 1 (T H 1) and T H 17 cells, but not that of regulatory T cells. CD4 + T cells from patients with RA showed increased TNF-α production and consequent Akt phosphorylation upon activation. These cells also exhibited increased mitochondrial mass, particularly within proinflammatory T cell subsets implicated in disease.

  abstract     = {Pyroptosis is an inflammation-driven form of programmed cell death that depends on the activation of caspase-1. Assembly of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that is activated by various priming signals, is necessary to recruit and activate caspase-1. Nadjar et al. developed an optogenetic method of activating inflammasomes by inducing the oligomerization of the core inflammasome adaptor protein ASC in response to blue light. Clustering of ASC was sufficient to generate an inflammasome response and pyroptotic cell swelling. Thus, this tool may facilitate studies requiring temporal resolution of inflammasome-driven events. —Amy E. Baek Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that control caspase-1 activation, which process the inactive precursor forms of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, leading to an inflammatory type of programmed cell death called pyroptosis. Studying inflammasome-driven processes, such as pyroptosis-induced cell swelling, under controlled conditions remains challenging because the signals that activate pyroptosis also stimulate other signaling pathways. We designed an optogenetic approach using a photo-oligomerizable inflammasome core adapter protein, apoptosis-associated speck–like containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), to temporally and quantitatively manipulate inflammasome activation. We demonstrated that inducing the light-sensitive oligomerization of ASC was sufficient to recapitulate the classical features of inflammasomes within minutes. This system showed that there were two phases of cell swelling during pyroptosis. This approach offers avenues for biophysical investigations into the intricate nature of cellular volume control and plasma membrane rupture during cell death.},

  abstract     = {Cocaine use, addiction, and relapse are challenging to treat. Reward circuits in the brain activated by cocaine include the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the CNS. Mews et al. performed subcellular proteomics of the NAc in mice to explore the spatiotemporal protein landscape during chronic cocaine use, withdrawal, and reuse. The findings implicated plasma membrane–associated proteins and intranuclear protein shuttling during withdrawal, providing insight into the intricate protein dynamics from which therapeutic strategies might be developed. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic neuropsychiatric condition that results from enduring cellular and molecular adaptations. Among substance use disorders, CUD is notable for its rising prevalence and the lack of approved pharmacotherapies. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that is integral to the brain’s reward circuitry, plays a crucial role in the initiation and continuation of maladaptive behaviors that are intrinsic to CUD. Leveraging advancements in neuroproteomics, we undertook a proteomic analysis that spanned membrane, cytosolic, nuclear, and chromatin compartments of the NAc in a mouse model. The results unveiled immediate and sustained proteomic modifications after cocaine exposure and during prolonged withdrawal. We identified congruent protein regulatory patterns during initial cocaine exposure and reexposure after withdrawal, which contrasted with distinct patterns during withdrawal. Pronounced proteomic shifts within the membrane compartment indicated adaptive and long-lasting molecular responses prompted by cocaine withdrawal. In addition, we identified potential protein translocation events between soluble-nuclear and chromatin-bound compartments, thus providing insight into intracellular protein dynamics after cocaine exposure. Together, our findings illuminate the intricate proteomic landscape that is altered in the NAc by cocaine use and provide a dataset for future research toward potential therapeutics.},

Nguyen et al. found that EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of the tail of Fzd9b induced endocytosis of the Wnt9a-Fzd9b complex that was necessary for signaling. The adaptor protein EPS15, which promotes the endocytosis of EGFR and other receptors, was also required for Wnt9a-Fzd9b endocytosis in cells and for the development of hematopoietic stem cells in zebrafish. Thus, Wnt9a-Fzd9b complexes stimulate downstream signaling only after they are endocytosed in an EGFR- and EPS15-dependent manner. —Annalisa M. VanHook Cell-to-cell communication through secreted Wnt ligands that bind to members of the Frizzled (Fzd) family of transmembrane receptors is critical for development and homeostasis. Wnt9a signals through Fzd9b, the co-receptor LRP5 or LRP6 (LRP5/6), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to promote early proliferation of zebrafish and human hematopoietic stem cells during development. Here, we developed fluorescently labeled, biologically active Wnt9a and Fzd9b fusion proteins to demonstrate that EGFR-dependent endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex was required for signaling. In human cells, the Wnt9a-Fzd9b complex was rapidly endocytosed and trafficked through early and late endosomes, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. Using small-molecule inhibitors and genetic and knockdown approaches, we found that Wnt9a-Fzd9b endocytosis required EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of the Fzd9b tail, caveolin, and the scaffolding protein EGFR protein substrate 15 (EPS15). LRP5/6 and the downstream signaling component AXIN were required for Wnt9a-Fzd9b signaling but not for endocytosis. Knockdown or loss of EPS15 impaired hematopoietic stem cell development in zebrafish. Other Wnt ligands do not require endocytosis for signaling activity, implying that specific modes of endocytosis and trafficking may represent a method by which Wnt-Fzd specificity is established.},

However, it is effective only in a small subset of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Ribeiro et al. showed that blocking fatty acid synthase (FASN) led to an increase in DNA damage in prostate cancer cells in a manner dependent on increased ceramide production. Combined PARP and FASN inhibition increased cell death in human CRPC organoids. This work indicates that DNA repair–blocking drugs can be enhanced through FASN inhibition, which may increase the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in patients with CRPC. —Amy E. Baek Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the primary treatment for prostate cancer; however, resistance to ADT invariably develops, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Prostate cancer progression is marked by increased de novo synthesis of fatty acids due to overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), making this enzyme a therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Inhibition of FASN results in increased intracellular amounts of ceramides and sphingomyelin, leading to DNA damage through the formation of DNA double-strand breaks and cell death. We found that combining a FASNi with the poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib, which induces cell death by blocking DNA damage repair, resulted in a more pronounced reduction in cell growth than that caused by either drug alone. Human CRPC organoids treated with a combination of PARP and FASNi were smaller, had decreased cell proliferation, and showed increased apoptosis and necrosis. Together, these data indicate that targeting FASN increases the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors by impairing DNA damage repair, suggesting that combination therapies should be explored for CRPC.},

Wu et al. found that the transcription factor Miz1, previously implicated in regulating antibacterial responses, accumulated in IAV-infected mouse lung epithelial cells and blocked the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs. In IAV-infected mice, expression of an inactive mutant Miz1 resulted in increased type I IFN production and enhanced viral clearance, highlighting a previously unappreciated role for Miz1 in suppressing antiviral immunity. —John F. Foley Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical for the antiviral immune response, and fine-tuning type I IFN production is critical to effectively clearing viruses without causing harmful immunopathology. We showed that the transcription factor Miz1 epigenetically repressed the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs in mouse lung epithelial cells by recruiting histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the promoters of Ifna and Ifnb . Loss of function of Miz1 resulted in augmented production of these type I IFNs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection, leading to improved viral clearance in vitro and in vivo. IAV infection induced Miz1 accumulation by promoting the cullin-4B (CUL4B)–mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mule (Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3; also known as Huwe1 or Arf-BP1), which targets Miz1 for degradation. As a result, Miz1 accumulation limited type I IFN production and favored viral replication. This study reveals a previously unrecognized function of Miz1 in regulating antiviral defense and a potential mechanism for influenza viruses to evade host immune defense.},

  abstract     = {The multisubunit protein ferritin stores iron inside cells but is released into the circulation during acute hepatitis and in chronic liver disease. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are myofibroblasts that, when activated, drive the inflammation and fibrosis that lead to the progressive loss of liver function. Fernandez-Rojo et al. found that the ferritin heavy subunit (FTH) stimulated inflammasome activation in rat and human HSCs and in liver slices from mice. FTH bound to the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 on HSCs and was endocytosed, leading to the priming and activation of NLRP3-containing inflammasomes and subsequent secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. The findings suggest that FTH is a damage-induced molecular pattern that contributes to the hepatic inflammation that drives liver dysfunction. —Annalisa M. VanHook Serum ferritin concentrations increase during hepatic inflammation and correlate with the severity of chronic liver disease. Here, we report a molecular mechanism whereby the heavy subunit of ferritin (FTH) contributes to hepatic inflammation. We found that FTH induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) through intercellular adhesion molecule–1 (ICAM-1). FTH–ICAM-1 stimulated the expression of Il1b , NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the processing and secretion of IL-1β in a manner that depended on plasma membrane remodeling, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and lysosomal destabilization. FTH–ICAM-1 signaling at early endosomes stimulated Il1b expression, implying that this endosomal signaling primed inflammasome activation in HSCs. In contrast, lysosomal destabilization was required for FTH-induced IL-1β secretion, suggesting that lysosomal damage activated inflammasomes. FTH induced IL-1β production in liver slices from wild-type mice but not in those from Icam1 −/− or Nlrp3 −/− mice. Thus, FTH signals through its receptor ICAM-1 on HSCs to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We speculate that this pathway contributes to hepatic inflammation, a key process that stimulates hepatic fibrogenesis associated with chronic liver disease.},

Glucosylceramide accumulation in microglia induced the release of mitochondrial DNA and impaired lysosomal function. As a result, STING signaling was activated and the clearance of STING and damaged mitochondria was impaired, thereby fueling neurodegenerative inflammation. Treating mice with a STING inhibitor or an enhancer of lysosomal function was neuroprotective, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) are responsible for Gaucher disease (GD) and are considered the strongest genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). GCase deficiency leads to extensive accumulation of glucosylceramides (GCs) in cells and contributes to the neuropathology of GD, PD, and LBD by triggering chronic neuroinflammation. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which GC accumulation induces neuroinflammation. We found that GC accumulation within microglia induced by pharmacological inhibition of GCase triggered STING-dependent inflammation, which contributed to neuronal loss both in vitro and in vivo. GC accumulation in microglia induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage to the cytosol to trigger STING-dependent inflammation. Rapamycin, a compound that promotes lysosomal activity, improved mitochondrial function, thereby decreasing STING signaling. Furthermore, lysosomal damage caused by GC accumulation led to defects in the degradation of activated STING, further exacerbating inflammation mediated by microglia. Thus, limiting STING activity may be a strategy to suppress neuroinflammation caused by GCase deficiency.},

Chan et al. investigated the role of the myokine BDNF in post-exercise metabolic reprogramming and recovery in skeletal muscle. Mice with a muscle-specific deficiency in BDNF had reduced intramuscular lipid content, needed more time to recover from exercise, and did not show improvements in endurance capacity. Unexercised mice fed a bioavailable BDNF mimetic showed adaptations typically induced by exercise. Thus, BDNF generated by skeletal muscle promotes metabolic reprogramming that enables recovery after exercise. —Wei Wong Post-exercise recovery is essential to resolve metabolic perturbations and promote long-term cellular remodeling in response to exercise. Here, we report that muscle-generated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) elicits post-exercise recovery and metabolic reprogramming in skeletal muscle. BDNF increased the post-exercise expression of the gene encoding PPARδ (peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor δ), a transcription factor that is a master regulator of lipid metabolism. After exercise, mice with muscle-specific Bdnf knockout ( MBKO ) exhibited impairments in PPARδ-regulated metabolic gene expression, decreased intramuscular lipid content, reduced β-oxidation, and dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, MBKO mice required a longer period to recover from a bout of exercise and did not show increases in exercise-induced endurance capacity. Feeding naïve mice with the bioavailable BDNF mimetic 7,8-dihydroxyflavone resulted in effects that mimicked exercise-induced adaptations, including improved exercise capacity. Together, our findings reveal that BDNF is an essential myokine for exercise-induced metabolic recovery and remodeling in skeletal muscle.},

White et al . sought to deorphanize CXCL17 by screening a panel of chemokine receptors for CXCL17 binding. CXCL17 allosterically inhibited ligand binding to and activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in intact cells but did not affect the binding of CXCR4 to its agonist CXCL12 or its antagonists in dissociated membrane preparations. Disrupting putative glycosaminoglycan (GAG)–binding domains in CXCL17 reduced its interaction with and inhibition of CXCR4. Together, these findings suggest that CXCL17 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4 signaling in a manner dependent on GAG-binding proteins. —Amy E. Baek CXCL17 is a chemokine principally expressed by mucosal tissues, where it facilitates chemotaxis of monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages and has antimicrobial properties. CXCL17 is also implicated in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and progression of several cancers, and its expression is increased during viral infections of the lung. However, the exact role of CXCL17 in health and disease requires further investigation, and there is a need for confirmed molecular targets mediating CXCL17 functional responses. Using a range of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)–based assays, here we demonstrated that CXCL17 inhibited CXCR4-mediated signaling and ligand binding. Moreover, CXCL17 interacted with neuropillin-1, a VEGFR2 coreceptor. In addition, we found that CXCL17 only inhibited CXCR4 ligand binding in intact cells and demonstrated that this effect was mimicked by known glycosaminoglycan binders, surfen and protamine sulfate. Disruption of putative GAG binding domains in CXCL17 prevented CXCR4 binding. This indicated that CXCL17 inhibited CXCR4 by a mechanism of action that potentially required the presence of a glycosaminoglycan-containing accessory protein. Together, our results revealed that CXCL17 is an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4 and represents the next step in our understanding of the function of CXCL17 and regulation of CXCR4 signaling.},

  abstract     = {The STING pathway is activated in response to cytosolic DNA, resulting in the translocation of STING from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it stimulates an immune response. Luteijn et al . found that ACBD3, a Golgi-resident protein involved in the PI4KB-dependent generation of the phospholipid PI4P in the trans-Golgi network, was required for STING activation. Pharmacological manipulation to increase the abundance of PI4P in the trans-Golgi network resulted in increased STING activation. These findings suggest that therapeutically targeting PI4P signaling may modulate STING-dependent immune responses. —Amy E. Baek Activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident adaptor protein STING, a component of a cytosolic DNA–sensing pathway, induces the transcription of genes encoding type I interferons (IFNs) and other proinflammatory factors. Because STING is activated at the Golgi apparatus, control of the localization and activation of STING is important in stimulating antiviral and antitumor immune responses. Through a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we found that STING activation required the Golgi-resident protein ACBD3, which promotes the generation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the trans-Golgi network, as well as other PI4P-associated proteins. Appropriate localization and activation of STING at the Golgi apparatus required ACBD3 and the PI4P-generating kinase PI4KB. In contrast, STING activation was enhanced when the lipid-shuttling protein OSBP, which removes PI4P from the Golgi apparatus, was inhibited by the US Food and Drug Administration–approved antifungal itraconazole. The increase in the abundance of STING-activating phospholipids at the trans-Golgi network resulted in the increased production of IFN-β and other cytokines in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, a mutant STING that could not bind to PI4P failed to traffic from the ER to the Golgi apparatus in response to a STING agonist, whereas forced relocalization of STING to PI4P-enriched areas elicited STING activation in the absence of stimulation with a STING agonist. Thus, PI4P is critical for STING activation, and manipulating PI4P abundance may therapeutically modulate STING-dependent immune responses.},

Santi et al. investigated intercellular communication between endothelial cells in blood vessels and cancer-associated fibroblasts isolated from patients with breast cancer. Endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo took up proteins from extracellular vesicles, specifically matrix-bound vesicles, released by cancer-associated fibroblasts. Uptake of the membrane glycoprotein THY1 from cancer-associated fibroblasts increased the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts that released the most matrix-bound vesicles resembled myofibroblasts. Thus, identifying the proteins released by myofibroblast-like cancer-associated fibroblasts that alter endothelial cell function could yield potential targets for disrupting this intercellular communication. —Wei Wong Intercellular communication between different cell types in solid tumors contributes to tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. The secretome of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) plays major roles in these processes. Using human mammary CAFs, we showed that CAFs with a myofibroblast phenotype released extracellular vesicles that transferred proteins to endothelial cells (ECs) that affected their interaction with immune cells. Mass spectrometry–based proteomics identified proteins transferred from CAFs to ECs, which included plasma membrane receptors. Using THY1 as an example of a transferred plasma membrane–bound protein, we showed that CAF-derived proteins increased the adhesion of a monocyte cell line to ECs. CAFs produced high amounts of matrix-bound EVs, which were the primary vehicles of protein transfer. Hence, our work paves the way for future studies that investigate how CAF-derived matrix-bound EVs influence tumor pathology by regulating the function of neighboring cancer, stromal, and immune cells.},

  abstract     = {Isoforms of the protein synthesis factor eEF1A can either promote or suppress tumor growth. Treekitkarnmongkol et al . found that eEF1A2 teams up with the tumor suppressor PTEN to repress cell cycling. The interaction between eEF1A2 and PTEN resulted in the assembly of a complex of the kinase GSK3β, the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, and the ubiquitin ligase complex SCF in the pre-mitotic phases of the cell cycle. Phosphorylation at a specific site by GSK3β marked Aurora-A for degradation by the SCF complex, reducing progression through mitosis. Accordingly, Aurora-A was more stable and abundant in PTEN-deficient breast cancers, which showed increased proliferation. A two-drug combination that derepressed PTEN and inhibited Aurora-A suppressed tumor growth in mice, suggesting a potential treatment strategy for patients with PTEN-deficient breast tumors. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The translation elongation factor eEF1A promotes protein synthesis. Its methylation by METTL13 increases its activity, supporting tumor growth. However, in some cancers, a high abundance of eEF1A isoforms is associated with a good prognosis. Here, we found that eEF1A2 exhibited oncogenic or tumor-suppressor functions depending on its interaction with METTL13 or the phosphatase PTEN, respectively. METTL13 and PTEN competed for interaction with eEF1A2 in the same structural domain. PTEN-bound eEF1A2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of the mitosis-promoting Aurora kinase A in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. eEF1A2 bridged the interactions between the SKP1-CUL1-FBXW7 (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, the kinase GSK3β, and Aurora-A, thereby facilitating the phosphorylation of Aurora-A in a degron site that was recognized by FBXW7. Genetic ablation of Eef1a2 or Pten in mice resulted in a greater abundance of Aurora-A and increased cell cycling in mammary tumors, which was corroborated in breast cancer tissues from patients. Reactivating this pathway using fimepinostat, which relieves inhibitory signaling directed at PTEN and increases FBXW7 expression, combined with inhibiting Aurora-A with alisertib, suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation in culture and tumor growth in vivo. The findings demonstrate a therapeutically exploitable, tumor-suppressive role for eEF1A2 in breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are effective therapies against some cancers; however, a better understanding of their signaling pathways would help in enhancing their efficacy. Ritmeester-Loy et al . identified and quantified the protein-protein interactions induced by CAR stimulation in CAR T cells generated from healthy donors. As well as characterizing protein-protein interactions that were induced both by CARs and endogenous T cell receptors, the authors identified a set of protein-protein interactions specific to CARs. The extent of activation of CAR T cells varied from batch to batch but correlated with signaling strength, suggesting that variations in key signaling components may modulate CAR T cell performance. —John F. Foley Cells rely on activity-dependent protein-protein interactions to convey biological signals. For chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells containing a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, receptor engagement is thought to stimulate the formation of protein complexes similar to those stimulated by T cell receptor (TCR)–mediated signaling, but the number and type of protein interaction–mediating binding domains differ between CARs and TCRs. Here, we performed coimmunoprecipitation mass spectrometry analysis of a second-generation, CD19-directed 4-1BB:ζ CAR (referred to as bbζCAR) and identified 128 proteins that increased their coassociation after target engagement. We compared activity-induced TCR and CAR signalosomes by quantitative multiplex coimmunoprecipitation and showed that bbζCAR engagement led to the activation of two modules of protein interactions, one similar to TCR signaling that was more weakly engaged by bbζCAR as compared with the TCR and one composed of TRAF signaling complexes that was not engaged by the TCR. Batch-to-batch and interindividual variations in production of the cytokine IL-2 correlated with differences in the magnitude of protein network activation. Future CAR T cell manufacturing protocols could measure, and eventually control, biological variation by monitoring these signalosome activation markers.},

Cai et al. found that increased abundance of the leukotriene biosynthetic enzyme ALOX5 in circulating and synovium-infiltrating CD4 + T cells drove pyroptosis in these cells, which correlated with the clinical severity of RA. Leukotrienes generated by ALOX5 stimulated Ca 2+ influx through ORAI3 channels that led to inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. The FDA-approved ALOX5 inhibitor zileuton suppressed CD4 + T cell pyroptosis and reduced joint inflammation in rodent models of RA, suggesting ALOX5 as a potential therapeutic target in RA. —Annalisa M. VanHook Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, is linked to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying pyroptosis in T cells isolated from patients with RA. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with RA had more pyroptotic CD4 + T cells in blood and synovia, which correlated with clinical measures of disease activity. Moreover, the mRNA expression and protein abundance of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), which converts arachidonic acid to leukotriene A 4 (LTA 4 ), were increased in CD4 + T cells from patients with RA and, among patients with RA, were lowest in those in clinical remission. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ALOX5 suppressed CD4 + T cell pyroptosis and improved symptoms in two rodent models of RA. Mechanistically, the increase in ALOX5 activity in RA CD4 + T cells enhanced the production of the LTA 4 derivative LTB 4 , which stimulated Ca 2+ influx through ORAI3 channels, leading to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and pyroptosis. Our findings reveal a role for ALOX5 in RA and provide a molecular basis for further exploring the clinical utility of ALOX5 inhibition in RA and for using ALOX5 as a biomarker to distinguish active disease and remission in RA.},

  abstract     = {Degraders target specific proteins for proteasomal breakdown, which may circumvent the rewiring of signaling pathways that often occurs with catalytic inhibitor treatment of cancer cells. Erickson et al. generated and characterized the cellular effects of a second-generation degrader for the proliferation- and survival-promoting kinase AKT, whose activity is increased in many types of cancers. The second-generation degrader depleted AKT more rapidly than the first-generation degrader and was more effective at inhibiting signaling downstream of AKT and the growth of breast cancer cell lines than an AKT catalytic inhibitor. Multiple combined analyses revealed that breast cancer cell lines with the greatest sensitivity to the second-generation AKT degrader had basal activity of the stress-activated kinase JNK, thus providing a potential biomarker to predict sensitivity to this AKT degrader. —Wei Wong More than 50% of human tumors display hyperactivation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT. Despite evidence of clinical efficacy, the therapeutic window of the current generation of AKT inhibitors could be improved. Here, we report the development of a second-generation AKT degrader, INY-05-040, which outperformed catalytic AKT inhibition with respect to cellular suppression of AKT-dependent phenotypes in breast cancer cell lines. A growth inhibition screen with 288 cancer cell lines confirmed that INY-05-040 had a substantially higher potency than our first-generation AKT degrader (INY-03-041), with both compounds outperforming catalytic AKT inhibition by GDC-0068. Using multiomic profiling and causal network integration in breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that the enhanced efficacy of INY-05-040 was associated with sustained suppression of AKT signaling, which was followed by induction of the stress mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Further integration of growth inhibition assays with publicly available transcriptomic, proteomic, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) measurements established low basal JNK signaling as a biomarker for breast cancer sensitivity to AKT degradation. Together, our study presents a framework for mapping the network-wide signaling effects of therapeutically relevant compounds and identifies INY-05-040 as a potent pharmacological suppressor of AKT signaling.},

Lin et al. generated a fusion protein called A1M to promote both S1P and prostacyclin signaling. A1M consisted of ApoM and ApoA1, a structural component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that stabilizes prostacyclin. When bound to S1P or a prostacyclin analog, A1M suppressed inflammation and increased the barrier function of cultured endothelial cells. In mouse models of acute or systemic inflammation, S1P-loaded A1M suppressed neutrophil infiltration, increases in circulating proinflammatory factors, and cytokine storm. The ApoA1 moiety of A1M therefore provides additional benefits over previously engineered S1P chaperones. —Wei Wong High-density lipoprotein (HDL) nanoparticles promote endothelial cell (EC) function and suppress inflammation, but their utility in treating EC dysfunction has not been fully explored. Here, we describe a fusion protein named ApoA1-ApoM (A1M) consisting of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), the principal structural protein of HDL that forms lipid nanoparticles, and ApoM, a chaperone for the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). A1M forms HDL-like particles, binds to S1P, and is signaling competent. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the S1P-bound ApoM moiety in A1M efficiently activated EC surface receptors. Treatment of human umbilical vein ECs with A1M-S1P stimulated barrier function either alone or cooperatively with other barrier-enhancing molecules, including the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost, and suppressed cytokine-induced inflammation. A1M-S1P injection into mice during sterile inflammation suppressed neutrophil influx and inflammatory mediator secretion. Moreover, systemic A1M administration led to a sustained increase in circulating HDL-bound S1P and suppressed inflammation in a murine model of LPS-induced endotoxemia. We propose that A1M administration may enhance vascular endothelial barrier function, suppress cytokine storm, and promote resilience of the vascular endothelium.},

  abstract     = {Gain-of-function mutations in the transcription activator STAT3 cause an autoimmune disease called STAT3 GOF syndrome. A challenging feature of this syndrome is the phenotypic heterogeneity of the individual STAT3 mutations. By manipulating an upstream activator instead of STAT3 itself, Baumgartner et al . developed a mouse model that recapitulated more aspects of the disease. Mice with constitutive activation of the cytokine receptor subunit gp130 in T cells developed fatal, multi-organ inflammation with changes in T cell profiles and gene expression that were similar to those in patients with STAT3 GOF autoimmunity, suggesting that this model may be useful for investigating the disease and exploring therapeutic options. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The IL-6–gp130–STAT3 signaling axis is a major regulator of inflammation. Activating mutations in the gene encoding gp130 and germline gain-of-function mutations in STAT3 (STAT3 GOF ) are associated with multi-organ autoimmunity, severe morbidity, and adverse prognosis. To dissect crucial cellular subsets and disease biology involved in activated gp130 signaling, the gp130-JAK-STAT3 axis was constitutively activated using a transgene, L-gp130 , specifically targeted to T cells. Activating gp130 signaling in T cells in vivo resulted in fatal, early onset, multi-organ autoimmunity in mice that resembled human STAT3 GOF disease. Female mice had more rapid disease progression than male mice. On a cellular level, gp130 signaling induced the activation and effector cell differentiation of T cells, promoted the expansion of T helper type 17 (T H 17) cells, and impaired the activity of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiling of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from these mice revealed commonly dysregulated genes and a gene signature that, when applied to human transcriptomic data, improved the segregation of patients with transcriptionally diverse STAT3 GOF mutations from healthy controls. The findings demonstrate that increased gp130-STAT3 signaling leads to T H 17-driven autoimmunity that phenotypically resembles human STAT3 GOF disease.},

  abstract     = {Biased ligands stimulate G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) to preferentially activate G proteins or recruit the adaptor β-arrestin. Gardner et al . found that the distinct patterns of downstream signaling elicited by biased ligands of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 depended on the differential recruitment of GPCR kinases (GRKs) to the plasma membrane and endosomes. In cultured cells, different biased ligands recruited distinct subsets of GRKs to CXCR3 at each location, and, in turn, the GRKs determined receptor internalization, β-arrestin recruitment, and downstream signaling activity. Stimulation of other GPCRs also resulted in differential GRK recruitment to the plasma membrane and endosomes, suggesting that location-specific GRK recruitment shapes biased signaling across the GPCR superfamily. —Annalisa M. VanHook Some G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) demonstrate biased signaling such that ligands of the same receptor exclusively or preferentially activate certain downstream signaling pathways over others. This phenomenon may result from ligand-specific receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases (GRKs). GPCR signaling can also exhibit location bias because GPCRs traffic to and signal from subcellular compartments in addition to the plasma membrane. Here, we investigated whether GRKs contributed to location bias in GPCR signaling. GRKs translocated to endosomes after stimulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 or other GPCRs in cultured cells. GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, and GRK6 showed distinct patterns of recruitment to the plasma membrane and to endosomes depending on the identity of the biased ligand used to activate CXCR3. Analysis of engineered forms of GRKs that localized to either the plasma membrane or endosomes demonstrated that biased CXCR3 ligands elicited different signaling profiles that depended on the subcellular location of the GRK. Each GRK exerted a distinct effect on the regulation of CXCR3 engagement of β-arrestin, internalization, and activation of the downstream effector kinase ERK. Our work highlights a role for GRKs in location-biased GPCR signaling and demonstrates the complex interactions between ligands, GRKs, and cellular location that contribute to biased signaling.},

  abstract     = {The neuropeptide relaxin-3 binds to its G protein–coupled receptor RXFP3 to mediate functions such as anxiety, feeding, and cognition. Relaxin-3 is composed of an A chain linked to the B chain, with the A chain thought to act as a scaffold to present the B chain to the receptor. Jayakody et al. characterized the binding properties and functional responses of RXFP3 to relaxin-3 and analogs that were modified with hydrocarbon “staples,” and showed that two such analogs stimulated biased signaling by RXFP3 through G proteins in contrast to the unbiased relaxin-3. These agonists may help determine the signaling pathways used by RXFP3 to mediate its various functions and design targeted therapies. —John F. Foley The neuropeptide relaxin-3 is composed of an A chain and a B chain held together by disulfide bonds, and it modulates functions such as anxiety and food intake by binding to and activating its cognate receptor RXFP3, mainly through the B chain. Biased ligands of RXFP3 would help to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of G proteins and β-arrestins downstream of RXFP3 that lead to such diverse functions. We showed that the i, i+4 stapled relaxin-3 B chains, 14s18 and d(1-7)14s18, were Gα i/o -biased agonists of RXFP3. These peptides did not induce recruitment of β-arrestin1/2 to RXFP3 by GPCR kinases (GRKs), in contrast to relaxin-3, which enabled the GRK2/3-mediated recruitment of β-arrestin1/2 to RXFP3. Relaxin-3 and the previously reported peptide 4 (an i, i+4 stapled relaxin-3 B chain) did not exhibit biased signaling. The staple linker of peptide 4 and parts of both the A chain and B chain of relaxin-3 interacted with extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) of RXFP3, moving it away from the binding pocket, suggesting that unbiased ligands promote a more open conformation of RXFP3. These findings highlight roles for the A chain and the N-terminal residues of the B chain of relaxin-3 in inducing conformational changes in RXFP3, which will help in designing selective biased ligands with improved therapeutic efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Naive T cells in the periphery constitutively experience varying amounts of tonic T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Eggert et al. determined how this baseline TCR signaling affects the responsiveness of naive CD8 + T cells to antigens. High amounts of tonic TCR signaling resulted in hyporesponsiveness to agonist TCR stimulation, which was associated with increased abundance of the ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, an inhibitor of TCR signaling. Deficiency in Cbl-b partially restored responsiveness. These results uncover a negative feedback loop that restrains the responsiveness of naive T cells in the face of strong tonic TCR signaling. —Wei Wong Naive T cells experience tonic T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in response to self-antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in secondary lymphoid organs. We investigated how relatively weak or strong tonic TCR signals influence naive CD8 + T cell responses to stimulation with foreign antigens. The heterogeneous expression of Nur77-GFP, a transgenic reporter of tonic TCR signaling, in naive CD8 + T cells suggests variable intensities or durations of tonic TCR signaling. Although the expression of genes associated with acutely stimulated T cells was increased in Nur77-GFP HI cells, these cells were hyporesponsive to agonist TCR stimulation compared with Nur77-GFP LO cells. This hyporesponsiveness manifested as diminished activation marker expression and decreased secretion of IFN-γ and IL-2. The protein abundance of the ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, a negative regulator of TCR signaling, was greater in Nur77-GFP HI cells than in Nur77-GFP LO cells, and Cbl-b deficiency partially restored the responsiveness of Nur77-GFP HI cells. Our data suggest that the cumulative effects of previously experienced tonic TCR signaling recalibrate naive CD8 + T cell responsiveness. These changes include gene expression changes and negative regulation partially dependent on Cbl-b. This cell-intrinsic negative feedback loop may enable the immune system to restrain naive CD8 + T cells with higher self-reactivity.},

  abstract     = {The elongated morphology of neurons means that mitochondria must be trafficked over long distances to support energy-intensive processes in multiple subcellular compartments. Izquierdo-Villalba et al. found that mitochondrial trafficking in neurons required the interaction of the G protein Gα q with the mitochondrial protein Alex3. Gα q enhanced the binding of Alex3 to mitochondrial trafficking proteins that mediate anterograde traffic. Expression of a constitutively active form of Gα q in neurons from mice with a CNS-specific deficiency in Alex3 revealed that Gα q was necessary for the role of Alex3 in mitochondrial trafficking and distribution and dendritic arborization. These results raise the intriguing possibility that the activity of Gα q -coupled receptors can affect mitochondrial trafficking in neurons through the Gα q /Alex3 complex. —Wei Wong Mitochondrial dynamics and trafficking are essential to provide the energy required for neurotransmission and neural activity. We investigated how G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and G proteins control mitochondrial dynamics and trafficking. The activation of Gα q inhibited mitochondrial trafficking in neurons through a mechanism that was independent of the canonical downstream PLCβ pathway. Mitoproteome analysis revealed that Gα q interacted with the Eutherian-specific mitochondrial protein armadillo repeat–containing X-linked protein 3 (Alex3) and the Miro1/Trak2 complex, which acts as an adaptor for motor proteins involved in mitochondrial trafficking along dendrites and axons. By generating a CNS-specific Alex3 knockout mouse line, we demonstrated that Alex3 was required for the effects of Gα q on mitochondrial trafficking and dendritic growth in neurons. Alex3-deficient mice had altered amounts of ER stress response proteins, increased neuronal death, motor neuron loss, and severe motor deficits. These data revealed a mammalian-specific Alex3/Gα q mitochondrial complex, which enables control of mitochondrial trafficking and neuronal death by GPCRs.},

  abstract     = {Androgens promote bone formation by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. Kalyanaraman et al. found that the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activated both cytoplasmic- and membrane-associated forms of the androgen receptor (AR) in mouse osteoblasts. Activation of the membrane-associated AR triggered a signaling pathway that enhanced the ligand-induced nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic AR, culminating in gene expression required for osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. This mechanism was also required for DHT-dependent proliferation of human prostate cancer cells, suggesting that the enhancement of nuclear AR functions by AR signaling at the membrane may occur in multiple physiological contexts. —Annalisa M. VanHook Androgen binding to the androgen receptor (AR) in the cytoplasm induces the AR to translocate to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of target genes. Here, we found that androgens rapidly activated a plasma membrane–associated signaling node that enhanced nuclear AR functions. In murine primary osteoblasts, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binding to a membrane-associated form of AR stimulated plasma membrane–associated protein kinase G type 2 (PKG2), leading to the activation of multiple kinases, including ERK. Phosphorylation of AR at Ser 515 by ERK increased the nuclear accumulation and binding of AR to the promoter of Ctnnb1 , which encodes the transcription factor β-catenin. In male mouse osteoblasts and human prostate cancer cells, DHT induced the expression of Ctnnb1 and CTNN1B , respectively, as well as β-catenin target genes, stimulating the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of osteoblasts and the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in a PKG2-dependent fashion. Because β-catenin is a master regulator of skeletal homeostasis, these results explain the reported male-specific osteoporotic phenotype of mice lacking PKG2 in osteoblasts and imply that PKG2-dependent AR signaling is essential for maintaining bone mass in vivo. Our results suggest that widely used pharmacological PKG activators, such as sildenafil, could be beneficial for male and estrogen-deficient female patients with osteoporosis but detrimental in patients with prostate cancer.},

  abstract     = {Obesity induces endothelial dysfunction that can lead to hypertension. Wolpe et al. uncovered a role for Panx3 as a scaffolding protein that limits oxidative stress in the endothelium and hypertension. Panx3 bound to and stabilized the transcriptional repressor Bcl6, which suppressed the expression of Nox4 , the gene encoding a hydrogen peroxide–producing enzyme. Mice lacking Panx3 in endothelial cells or treated with a peptide that disrupted the Panx3-Bcl6 interaction showed greater oxidative stress in the endothelium and developed hypertension. Moreover, Panx3 mRNA expression and Bcl6 protein abundance were decreased and Nox4 mRNA expression was increased in mice with diet-induced obesity, but not in mice with pharmacologically induced hypertension. Endothelial Panx3 and Bcl6 abundance were reduced in hypertensive, obese individuals, suggesting that reductions in endothelial Panx3 may drive obesity-associated hypertension. —Wei Wong Targeted degradation regulates the activity of the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 and its ability to suppress oxidative stress and inflammation. Here, we report that abundance of endothelial Bcl6 is determined by its interaction with Golgi-localized pannexin 3 (Panx3) and that Bcl6 transcriptional activity protects against vascular oxidative stress. Consistent with data from obese, hypertensive humans, mice with an endothelial cell–specific deficiency in Panx3 had spontaneous systemic hypertension without obvious changes in channel function, as assessed by Ca 2+ handling, ATP amounts, or Golgi luminal pH. Panx3 bound to Bcl6, and its absence reduced Bcl6 protein abundance, suggesting that the interaction with Panx3 stabilized Bcl6 by preventing its degradation. Panx3 deficiency was associated with increased expression of the gene encoding the H 2 O 2 -producing enzyme Nox4, which is normally repressed by Bcl6, resulting in H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damage in the vasculature. Catalase rescued impaired vasodilation in mice lacking endothelial Panx3. Administration of a newly developed peptide to inhibit the Panx3-Bcl6 interaction recapitulated the increase in Nox4 expression and in blood pressure seen in mice with endothelial Panx3 deficiency. Panx3-Bcl6-Nox4 dysregulation occurred in obesity-related hypertension, but not when hypertension was induced in the absence of obesity. Our findings provide insight into a channel-independent role of Panx3 wherein its interaction with Bcl6 determines vascular oxidative state, particularly under the adverse conditions of obesity.},

  abstract     = {The normal development of primary cilia is necessary for signal transduction, particularly Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, and impaired ciliogenesis underlies various developmental disorders. Noting that the transmembrane protein TMEM216 is implicated in ciliogenesis in zebrafish, Wang et al. found that Tmem216 −/− mice had impaired ciliogenesis and reduced Hh signaling. TMEM216 competed with a negative regulator of Hh signaling, SUFU, for binding to GLI transcription factors, inhibiting the cleavage of GLI2/GLI3 into their repressor forms, thus promoting Hh signaling. Together, these findings delineate how TMEM216 promotes Hh signaling during ciliogenesis. —Amy E. Baek Primary cilia are enriched in signaling receptors, and defects in their formation or function can induce conditions such as polycystic kidney disease, postaxial hexadactyly, and microphthalmia. Mammalian Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is important in the development of primary cilia, and TMEM216, a transmembrane protein that localizes to the base of cilia, is also implicated in ciliogenesis in zebrafish. Here, we found that Tmem216 -deficient mice had impaired Hh signaling and displayed typical ciliopathic phenotypes. These phenomena were also observed in cells deficient in TMEM216. Furthermore, TMEM216 interacted with core Hh signaling proteins, including SUFU, a negative regulator of Hh, and GLI2/GLI3, transcription factors downstream of Hh. The competition between TMEM216 and SUFU for binding to GLI2/GLI3 inhibited the cleavage of GLI2/GLI3 into their repressor forms, which resulted in the nuclear accumulation of full-length GLI2 and the decreased nuclear localization of cleaved GLI3, ultimately leading to the activation of Hh signaling. Together, these data suggest that the TMEM216-SUFU-GLI2/GLI3 axis plays a role in TMEM216 deficiency–induced ciliopathies and Hh signaling abnormalities.},

  abstract     = {The formation of multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes is critical for innate immune responses to infection; however, inappropriate inflammasome activation underlies autoinflammatory disorders. Through a cytometry-based screen, Coombs et al. showed that whereas the NLRP3 and NLRP6 members of the NOD-like receptor family formed inflammasomes in cells, NLRP12 did not. Rather, NLRP12 acted as an endogenous inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome formation. A mutant form of NLRP12 implicated in autoinflammatory disease failed to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that NLRP3 inhibitors currently in clinical trials should be considered to treat NLRP12-associated autoinflammatory disorders. —John F. Foley Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that drive inflammation and contribute to protective immunity against pathogens and immune pathology in autoinflammatory diseases. Inflammasomes assemble when an inflammasome scaffold protein senses an activating signal and forms a signaling platform with the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC. The NLRP subfamily of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) includes inflammasome nucleators (such as NLRP3) and also NLRP12, which is genetically linked to familial autoinflammatory disorders that resemble diseases caused by gain-of-function NLRP3 mutants that generate a hyperactive NLRP3 inflammasome. We performed a screen to identify ASC inflammasome–nucleating proteins among NLRs that have the canonical pyrin-NACHT-LRR domain structure. Only NLRP3 and NLRP6 could initiate ASC polymerization to form “specks,” and NLRP12 failed to nucleate ASC polymerization. However, wild-type NLRP12 inhibited ASC inflammasome assembly induced by wild-type and gain-of-function mutant NLRP3, an effect not seen with disease-associated NLRP12 mutants. The capacity of NLRP12 to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome assembly was limited to human NLRP3 and was not observed for wild-type murine NLRP3. Furthermore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with an NLRP12 mutant–associated inflammatory disorder produced increased amounts of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in response to NLRP3 stimulation. Thus, our findings provide insights into NLRP12 biology and suggest that NLRP3 inhibitors in clinical trials for NLRP3-driven diseases may also be effective in treating NLRP12-associated autoinflammatory diseases.},

  abstract     = {Neurodevelopment is tightly regulated by guidance cues. The guidance cue receptor plexin-A4 regulates GTPase signaling to direct neurite outgrowth and the formation of neuronal circuits. Abushalbaq et al. uncovered how the GTPase Rnd1 promotes neurite outgrowth through plexin-A4. The guidance cue semaphorin 3A induced the binding of Rnd1 to plexin-A4, an interaction that stimulated Rnd1. The net effect that Rnd1 signaling had on two plexin-A4–associated GTPases with opposing effects on neurite outgrowth favored dendritic branching in cultured neurons and in the mouse brain. The findings expand and refine the interplay of GTPase signaling from this guidance receptor. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The precise development of neuronal morphologies is crucial to the establishment of synaptic circuits and, ultimately, proper brain function. Signaling by the axon guidance cue semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) and its receptor complex of neuropilin-1 and plexin-A4 has multifunctional outcomes in neuronal morphogenesis. Downstream activation of the RhoGEF FARP2 through interaction with the lysine-arginine-lysine motif of plexin-A4 and consequent activation of the small GTPase Rac1 promotes dendrite arborization, but this pathway is dispensable for axon repulsion. Here, we investigated the interplay of small GTPase signaling mechanisms underlying Sema3A-mediated dendritic elaboration in mouse layer V cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo. Sema3A promoted the binding of the small GTPase Rnd1 to the amino acid motif leucine-valine-serine (LVS) in the cytoplasmic domain of plexin-A4. Rnd1 inhibited the activity of the small GTPase RhoA and the kinase ROCK, thus supporting the activity of the GTPase Rac1, which permitted the growth and branching of dendrites. Overexpression of a dominant-negative RhoA, a constitutively active Rac1, or the pharmacological inhibition of ROCK activity rescued defects in dendritic elaboration in neurons expressing a plexin-A4 mutant lacking the LVS motif. Our findings provide insights into the previously unappreciated balancing act between Rho and Rac signaling downstream of specific motifs in plexin-A4 to mediate Sema3A-dependent dendritic elaboration in mammalian cortical neuron development.},

Similarly, ubiquitination of the RIP1-related kinase RIP2 with K63 or linear linkages was specifically detected with the RIP2-K63 and RIP2-Lin bispecific antibodies, respectively. Furthermore, using the RIP2-K63 and RIP2-Lin bispecific antibodies, we found prominent K63-linked and linear RIP2 ubiquitination in samples from patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. We also developed a bispecific antibody (K63-Lin) that simultaneously recognizes K63-linked and linear ubiquitination of components of various signaling pathways.

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic, chronic condition characterized by episodes of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) system describes a family of dimeric transcription factors. Canonical NF-κB signaling is stimulated by and enhances inflammation, whereas noncanonical NF-κB signaling contributes to immune organogenesis. Dysregulation of NF-κB factors drives various inflammatory pathologies, including IBD. Signals from many immune sensors activate NF-κB subunits in the intestine, which maintain an equilibrium between local microbiota and host responses. Genetic association studies of patients with IBD and preclinical mouse models confirm the importance of the NF-κB system in host defense in the gut. Other studies have investigated the roles of these factors in intestinal barrier function and in inflammatory gut pathologies associated with IBD. NF-κB signaling modulates innate and adaptive immune responses and the production of immunoregulatory proteins, anti-inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and other tolerogenic factors in the intestine. Furthermore, genetic studies have revealed critical cell type–specific roles for NF-κB proteins in intestinal immune homeostasis, inflammation, and restitution that contribute to the etiopathology of IBD-associated manifestations. Here, we summarize our knowledge of the roles of these NF-κB pathways, which are activated in different intestinal cell types by specific ligands, and their cross-talk, in fueling aberrant intestinal inflammation. We argue that an in-depth understanding of aberrant immune signaling mechanisms may hold the key to identifying predictive or prognostic biomarkers and developing better therapeutics against inflammatory gut pathologies.},

  abstract     = {Detection of RNA-based viruses by the receptor RIG-I induces the aggregation of the mitochondrial protein MAVS, which in turn stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines critical for host defenses. Sun et al. found that this antiviral response was enhanced by ALDH1B1, a mitochondrially localized aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in ethanol metabolism. ALDH1B1, whose abundance was increased by infection with clinically relevant RNA viruses, limited viral replication. Interaction of ALDH1B1 with MAVS enhanced its aggregation and its association with RIG-I. ALDH1B1-deficient mice had higher viral titers in the lung, developed more severe lung damage, and were less likely to survive infection with influenza A. Thus, ALDH1B1 promotes antiviral signaling pathways initiated by RIG-I and MAVS. —Wei Wong Type I interferons (IFNs) are produced by almost all cell types and play a vital role in host defense against viral infection. Infection with an RNA virus activates receptors such as RIG-I, resulting in the recruitment of the adaptor protein MAVS to the RIG-I–like receptor (RLR) signalosome and the formation of prion-like functional aggregates of MAVS, which leads to IFN-β production. Here, we identified the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) as a previously uncharacterized IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) product with critical roles in the antiviral response. Knockout of ALDH1B1 increased, whereas overexpression of ALDH1B1 restricted, the replication of RNA viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and influenza A virus (IAV). We found that ALDH1B1 localized to mitochondria, where it interacted with the transmembrane domain of MAVS to promote MAVS aggregation. ALDH1B1 was recruited to MAVS aggregates. In addition, ALDH1B1 also enhanced the interaction between activated RIG-I and MAVS, thus increasing IFN-β production and the antiviral response. Furthermore, Aldh1b1 −/− mice developed more severe symptoms than did wild-type mice upon IAV infection. Together, these data identify an aldehyde dehydrogenase in mitochondria that functionally regulates MAVS-mediated signaling and the antiviral response.},

  abstract     = {The phosphatase SHP-1 is a critical negative regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling because it dephosphorylates several components downstream of the TCR. Poirier et al. found that the kinase TAOK3 promoted TCR signaling by phosphorylating a threonine residue in the phosphatase domain of SHP-1, leading to SHP-1 ubiquitylation and degradation. The loss of TAOK3 reduced both tonic and ligand-dependent TCR signaling in mouse CD4 + T cells and in a human T cell line. Thus, TAOK3 sets the threshold for T cell activation by controlling SHP-1 abundance. —Annalisa M. VanHook Thousand-and-one–amino acid kinase 3 (TAOK3) is a serine and threonine kinase that belongs to the STE-20 family of kinases. Its absence reduces T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and increases the interaction of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, a major negative regulator of proximal TCR signaling, with the kinase LCK, a component of the core TCR signaling complex. Here, we used mouse models and human cell lines to investigate the mechanism by which TAOK3 limits the interaction of SHP-1 with LCK. The loss of TAOK3 decreased the survival of naïve CD4 + T cells by dampening the transmission of tonic and ligand-dependent TCR signaling. In mouse T cells, Taok3 promoted the secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in response to TCR activation in a manner that depended on Taok3 gene dosage and on Taok3 kinase activity. TCR desensitization in Taok3 −/− T cells was caused by an increased abundance of Shp-1, and pharmacological inhibition of Shp-1 rescued the activation potential of these T cells. TAOK3 phosphorylated threonine-394 in the phosphatase domain of SHP-1, which promoted its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The loss of TAOK3 had no effect on the abundance of SHP-2, which lacks a residue corresponding to SHP-1 threonine-394. Modulation of SHP-1 abundance by TAOK3 thus serves as a rheostat for TCR signaling and determines the activation threshold of T lymphocytes.},

Cooperation of ATAF1 and HY5 repressed the expression of genes that promote seedling elongation and maintain cotyledon closure. These findings elucidate a complex network of transcription factors that slow growth and stimulate cotyledon opening when seedlings reach light. —Annalisa M. VanHook The opening of the embryonic leaves (cotyledons) as seedlings emerge from the dark soil into the light is crucial to ensure the survival of the plant. Seedlings that sprout in the dark elongate rapidly to reach light but keep their cotyledons closed. During de-etiolation, the transition from dark to light growth, elongation slows and the cotyledons open. Here, we report that the transcription factor ACTIVATING FACTOR1 (ATAF1) participates in de-etiolation and facilitates light-induced cotyledon opening. The transition from dark to light rapidly induced ATAF1 expression and ATAF1 accumulation in cotyledons. Seedlings lacking or overexpressing ATAF1 exhibited reduced or enhanced cotyledon opening, respectively, and transcriptomic analysis indicated that ATAF1 repressed the expression of genes associated with growth and cotyledon closure. The activation of the photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) by far-red light induced its association with the ATAF1 promoter and stimulation of ATAF1 expression. The transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), which is also activated in response far-red light, cooperated with phyA to induce ATAF1 expression. ATAF1 and HY5 interacted with one another and cooperatively repressed the expression of growth-promoting and cotyledon closure genes. Together, our study reveals a mechanism through which far-red light promotes cotyledon opening.},
