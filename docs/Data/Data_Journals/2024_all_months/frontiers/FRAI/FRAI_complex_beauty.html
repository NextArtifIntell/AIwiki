  abstract     = {In the field of education, there is a growing interest in the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) to reshape the educational landscape. This Research Topic investigates the transformative potential of Generative AI in various aspects of education. The papers in this edited volume shed light on the latest discoveries, new insights, novel developments, and future challenges in this rapidly advancing field.By leveraging machine learning models, these intelligent systems extract useful insights from vast amounts of data, making them capable of delivering highly individualized content. They can analyze a learner&amp;#39;s proficiency level, learning style, and pace, and then tailor the study material accordingly. Generative AI can adapt its content generation strategies to meet distinct preferences and learners’ needs. This can increase student engagement and comprehension, highlighting its potential to transform traditional teaching methodologies.This Research Topic also explores the use of Generative AI as part of AI tutors, capable of tailoring instructions and feedback dynamically based on each learner&amp;#39;s progress. Acting as an ever-present mentor, Generative AI can offer learning aids beyond class hours, facilitating continuous learning and immediate doubt clarification. This can be crucial for learners encountering obstacles outside the typical school hours or during self-study periods. Anyway, to use Generative AI as a tutor, further research is needed to examine not only the accuracy of its answers but also their emotional content, as emotions play a crucial role in the learning process.This Research Topic includes 11 papers (Original Research: 6; Perspective: 2; Opinion: 2, and Mini-Review:1). These papers explore areas such as: (a) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate feedback, (b) the use and perceived usefulness of a Generative AI chatbot for schoolwork among adolescents, (c) the potential of Generative AI in supporting critical thinking and enhancing human interactions, (d) using ChatGPT to support pre-service mathematics teachers in constructing mathematical proofs, (e) opportunities and challenges of LLMs to model the “whole learner,” (h) exploring Generative AI for personalized educational assessment, (g) the use of AI-mentors in career exploration, (i) the responsible integration of AI in education, (j) the use of LLMs to automatically generate interactive listening tasks, (k) the potential of AI-enhanced robots to generate incorrect information and deceive students, and (l) a mini-review on Generative AI for supporting students&amp;#39; cognitive and emotional needs. The main contributions of these articles are described below.Comparing emotions in ChatGPT answers and human answers to the coding questions on Stack Overflow by Fatahi, Vassileva, and Roy (2024). This paper presents a study aimed to compare the emotional content in human and AI answers. Specifically, it examines the emotional aspects in answers from ChatGPT and humans to 2000 questions sourced from Stack Overflow, finding that ChatGPT&amp;#39;s answers tend to be more positive, while human responses often express anger and disgust. Additionally, human emotions exhibit a broader spectrum than ChatGPT. The authors suggest that ChatGPT shows promise as a virtual tutor for students by answering queries and fostering collaboration. However, further research is needed on the emotional aspects of responses.Adolescents’ use and perceived usefulness of generative AI for schoolwork: exploring their relationships with executive functioning and academic achievement by Klarin et al. (2024). The article explores adolescents’ frequency of use and perceived usefulness of generative AI chatbots for schoolwork, focusing on their relationship with executive functioning (EF) and academic achievement. Two studies were conducted with adolescents. Findings indicate that older students use Generative AI tools as more frequently. Also, students facing more EF challenges perceive Generative AI tools as more useful for completing assignments. However, no significant link was found between the use of Generative AI and academic achievement. Future work involves exploring additional Generative AI issues such as potential gender differences, implications for academic equity and the impact on adolescent cognitive development.Using Generative AI in education: the case for critical thinking by Lee and Low (2024). This opinion article makes the case for focusing the use of Generative AI in enhancing students’ critical thinking and human interactions. The authors describe two case studies: (a) teaching communication skills and (b) teaching data structures and algorithms with AI chatbots. The two cases illustrate the potential use of Generative AI to enhance teaching and learning. The authors discuss the benefits of AI-based personalized feedback in improving student engagement and fostering strategic and critical use of AI tools. The article encourages the ethical and responsible use of generative AI in education with potential implications for the workforce.Using large language models to support pre-service teachers&amp;#39; mathematical reasoning—an exploratory study on ChatGPT as an instrument for creating mathematical proofs in geometry by Herrmann and Dilling (2024). LLMs can be a great source to extract knowledge. It thus appears natural to expect them to generate the texts of classical mathematical proofs. The authors, Marc Herrmann and Frederik Dilling, explore how pre-service teachers employ them to produce proofs. Using the lens of instrumental genesis, their study shows a variety of usage patterns with limited knowledge about the inner workings of the models. It sketches the road to become a teacher support instrument.Large language models for whole-learner support: opportunities and challenges by Mannekote et al. (2024) examines the transformative potential of LLMs in education through the development of personalized learning environments that address both cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions of learners, including motivation and socioemotional needs. The authors underscore the necessity of enhancing the interpretability of LLMs to ensure accurate learner representations, leveraging adaptive technologies for customized pedagogical support, and refining methods for authoring and evaluating educational agents. However, the article also highlights significant challenges, such as model interpretability, ethical considerations, and privacy concerns, which must be resolved.Opportunities and challenges of using generative AI to personalize educational assessment by Arslan et al. (2024). The article explores the challenges and opportunities of integrating Generative AI in supporting personalized educational assessments. The authors describe potential benefits of Generative AI personalized assessments, such as increasing learner engagement, motivation, performance, and access. Challenges include ensuring validity, reliability, and fairness. Finally, potential solutions include implementing guidelines for the ethical use of AI, aligning the purpose of the assessment with the intended use of Generative AI, and deploying human-in-the-loop approaches.Navigating STEM careers with AI mentors: a new IDP journey by Chang et al. (2024). The MyIDP, a Web-based STEM career development-mentoring platform, is the synergistic outcome of experts from diverse associations and universities (Hobin, Fuhrmann, Lindstaedt, &amp;amp; Clifford, 2012). Concerned with time and resource capacities, Chang et al. (2024) investigate the efficacy of a comprehensive list of prompts, when students engage with human-Google Gemini mentors. Progress/achievements in the Assessment, Career Exploration, Create Plan and Implement Plan phases, are measured by SMART goals. Findings reveal the emergence of the sequential integration and concurrent collaboration interaction models, and the importance of human mentors in refining and personalizing Gemini&amp;#39;s more generic answers. Shaping integrity: why generative artificial intelligence does not have to undermine education by Toledo Tan and Tan Maravilla (2024) examines the role of Generative AI in promoting academic integrity. The authors argue that Generative AI can enhance learning by fostering intrinsic motivation, digital literacy, and knowledge construction. Moreover, its responsible integration can support personalized and interactive learning while upholding ethical standards. However, the paper also emphasizes the need for ethical guidelines, transparency, and thoughtful implementation to address challenges such as data privacy and algorithmic bias. Ultimately, the paper concludes that Generative AI is a tool to enrich education, preparing students for the complexities of a technologically advanced world with integrity and ethical awareness.A generative AI-driven interactive listening assessment task by Runge et al. (2024). This article discusses the development and evaluation of an interactive listening assessment task in the context of a large-scale assessment. LLMs are used to enhance automated item generation. A pilot study with 713 tasks demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing that AI-driven item generation can produce high-quality, diverse assessment content. The study highlights the potential of Generative AI and human-in-the loop to improve language testing by interactive assessment tasks.Deception Detection in Educational AI: Challenges for Japanese Middle School Students in Interacting with Generative AI Robots by Salem and Sumi (2024). The authors investigate whether twenty-two Japanese middle school students can detect different types of lies (lying, paltering, pandering, and bullshitting) via an anime face in contrast to a human-like face. Analyses from ten teaching sessions indicate that there are no significant differences in learning effectiveness, and in motivation and encouragement. However, most of the students are deceived. When comparing deception techniques, the bullshit technique evidenced significant differences. There is also a significant difference with regards to total belief. Exploring the Utilization and Deficiencies of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Students&amp;#39; Cognitive and Emotional Needs: A Systematic Mini-Review by mini-review Ortega-Ochoa et al. (2024) examines how Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, address students&amp;#39; cognitive and emotional needs in educational contexts. The paper reviews four empirical works and notes challenges in scalability and generalizability, emphasizing the need for improved accuracy, personalization, and ethical integration of Generative AI to support meaningful and adaptive learning experiences. Furthermore, the paper highlights Generative AI&amp;#39;s effectiveness in fostering engagement, emotional regulation, and instant feedback. However, it also identifies limitations, such as the inability to foster critical thinking, inconsistent response accuracy, and insufficient personalization to individual emotional and cognitive states.As a whole, this Research Topic provides interesting insights regarding the use of Generative AI in education. The papers collectively explore the multifaceted roles of generative AI in education, examining its impact on emotional engagement, academic achievement, critical thinking, personalized assessment, STEM career guidance, and ethical considerations, while also addressing the challenges and opportunities it presents in shaping the future of learning and assessment. Our contribution represents an early step towards a scientific approach away from the trendy statements. The volume identifies the potential benefits and opportunities for additional work in this area. We hope you find these articles informative and help inspire new work in this active area of research. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the reviewers who participated in this Research Topic as well as Professor Rita Orji (Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada), who served as the editor for one of the submitted manuscripts.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {The country&amp;#39;s energy infrastructure is a national asset inextricably linked to national progress [1]. Old grids are stiff, fail to balance loads, and have a significant risk of cascading failures, making them unsuitable for current times [2]. Other difficulties include interoperability and scalability, high costs, data privacy, and security. They also face legacy system dependencies, regulatory and compliance issues due to outmoded capabilities [3]. Transitioning to a smart grid enables dynamic solutions for load management, self-healing capabilities, and decentralized decision-making.As smart grids help us move away from legacy issues, the inclusion of new-generation technology makes the system prone to cyberattacks. In many developed and developing countries, smart grids bring hope for strengthening the sector by providing clean energy that meets future goals of both the political and economic classes. However, when negligence occurs while introducing these futuristic systems, they usually result in inheriting legacy issues along with vulnerabilities arising from cyberspace. In the context of Indian institutions, they often demonstrate a weak approach and inefficient environments, making them susceptible to attacks by adversaries on their energy sector [4].Espionage, an ancient form of warfare, becomes particularly lethal for an individual citizen and country as a whole, when combined with individually motivated attackers. Between 2021 and 2022, there were reports of Chinese government-linked hackers attempting to infiltrate and steal data from the Indian government as well as major players within the Indian power sector [3]. In 2019, Venezuela struggled with the attack not only on its technical aspects but also through cyberattacks, leaving the country in prolonged blackouts [4]. Similarly, in 2015, Russian hackers targeted Ukraine&amp;#39;s power grid [5], a pattern that continued during the 2023-24 conflict between the two nations.These attacks are often well-coordinated, synchronized, and executed with a high level of professionalism, leading to day-long outages. The effects go beyond economic losses, which range from millions to billions of dollars, and imperil lives.All of these precautions necessitate an understanding of the most prevalent security vulnerabilities that smart grids face, which can have serious consequences for their operation and integrity: Network Attacks: These mostly target network operators, power plants, and utility businesses. This is to disrupt utility delivery while causing disruption and potentially obtaining ransom payments.  Breaching Sensitive Customer Data: Sensitive client data may be compromised by adversaries, so posing significant privacy concerns.  Malware Propagation: Malware can readily permeate smart grid systems, potentially affecting operations and causing widespread disruption.  Distributed Control Devices: According to reports, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in distributed control devices to take over or impair grid operations without authorization.Smart grids have varying degrees of vulnerability; however, they are susceptible to many types of attacks: At the consumer access level, smart meters have the disadvantage of serving as a gateway for collecting and transmitting data about energy consumption. These meters, if infiltrated, would represent serious breaches of privacy or illegal access, allowing attackers to tamper with data or even disrupt services.  Another highly sought-after target site is the communication network level, which supports grid communication, whether through wireless networks [9]. Here, attacks might disrupt data transit and jeopardize grid control, resulting in operational pandemonium. Such attacks on SCADA systems, which are crucial to grid control, have the ability to destabilize and manipulate grid functionalities.  Decisions are made at the utility company and operator levels. A utility company&amp;#39;s system may fail, causing widespread disruptions in electricity distribution for customers and businesses. This type of multi-layered vulnerability framework has been shown to necessitate comprehensive security designs to protect smart grids from numerous and changing threats. It indicates that a deeper knowledge of these threats and vulnerabilities is critical to improving the security and resilience of smart grids and ensuring dependable operation while preventing potential disruptions.With the introduction of new methods and appropriate procedures, the system becomes more complex in its ability to safeguard itself. However, it is critical to understand that proper approach implementation is always necessary. A PSU or a large organization requires many recurring and multiple permissions, such as raising tickets for accessing ports with common channels, which can be critical to assuring security and compliance across organizations. But these processes often have numerous steps, such as risk assessments, security evaluations, and managerial approvals. However, the complexity and length of these processes usually results in delay resulting in irritation and frustration towards it among developers, architects, and other critical team players working on the project. This implies that such actors will need and ask for faster solutions that are or doesn&amp;#39;t include bureaucratic red tape that might inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities.The Holistic Cyber Defence Interaction (HCDI) technique introduction can solve these difficulties by creating a collaborative environment in which the entire business works together to develop the best answers. HCDI aims to combine human-AI interaction with powerful Deep Learning (DL) and graph-based algorithms to ensure that security measures are resilient, comprehensive, efficient, and streamlined. This would, to an extent, bring uniformity in the process resulting in decrease the number of approvals as the processes of risk assessment and security review are automated. These claims are on the basis of the Policy and Mechanisms written. Thus, making it less prone to human error and omission. HCDI will enable organizations to sustain robust cyber strengths while still maintaining pace and efficiencies in operations through a multi-dimensional concerted effort.The HCDI represents a pioneering approach that synergistically combines advanced methodologies from semisupervised anomaly detection, deep representation learning, graph-based specification analysis, adaptive real-time detection, and deep learning ensembles with attention mechanisms. It is designed in such a way that it bring enhancement of cybersecurity in smart grids and simplification in terms of robust Policies and Policy mechanisms to implement them without any leaks.The Holistic Cyber Defence Interaction Technique (HCDI) is a like wrapper around the best available Frameworks today. It focuses from the base to upliftment of the pillar. It includes and takes motivation from several available Frameworks which starts from data collection to development to scalability.Implementing HCDI involves several key steps to ensure effective deployment and integration within smart grid cybersecurity frameworks:To train anomaly detection models effectively for smart grids, datasets to be gathered must represent diverse operational data collected from various components of the smart grid, such as substations and SCADA systems. Some of the points to be considered include:1. Diverse Operational Scenarios: Datasets should represent various operational scenarios, including peak and off-peak hours, maintenance periods, different weather conditions, few to be mentioned. It is important to have such diversity in the features available in the dataset as it will help to create a robust model that can handle many real-world variabilities. 2. Historical Data: Having historical data in the collection is necessary to understand and capture longterm trends and patterns. Exploratory Data Analysis (or commonly abbreviated as EDA) for understanding the operational behaviour and identify the outliers or any important deviation which can help understand anomalies and limitation in the legacy systems. 3. Formulating Policies and Mechanisms: Before moving ahead from these steps it is important to formulate policies or what and what is not allowed. The mechanisms should be built around it such that it implements the policies without any gaps left out. The crucial step should also include a phase to maintain the access control matrix. 4. Real-Time Data Integration: Build mechanisms for real-time data gathering and integration. This will help in continuous updating of the dataset. This will be necessary and helpful for bringing in new operational data and newly detected anomalies, thus enhancing the adaptability of the model to the changing threats. 5. Anomaly Authorization: Use a mechanism for approving and verifying recently discovered anomalies before adding them to the dataset. This will guarantee that model training uses only pertinent and validated abnormalities, enhancing the accuracy and dependability of the detection system. 6. Data Sources: Making use of data from many sources inside the smart grid-such as sensors, meters, and communication networks-allows one to create This multi-source method will give a full picture of the operational situation on the grid. We should also consider additional factors that could lead to data source corruption and consequent loss of relevance for model development. Integrating the developed models and algorithms into the given smart grid infrastructure and cybersecurity frameworks so that information communication is uniform and harmonious between the detection systems, SCADA systems, and the different responding mechanisms of the cybersecurity framework. Advanced AI and ML techniques such as real-time threat identification and prediction include anomaly detection, clustering, and deep learning.TensorFlow and PyTorch can be used to create strong models based on Scikit-learn. Implement distributed computing platforms such as Apache Kafka and Apache Spark to process and analyze data efficiently. Additionally, use SIEM systems such as Splunk and ELK Stack for centralized collection of security data for further analysis and optimized response. From these tools and techniques, include support to further the overall resilience and responsiveness of the smart grid against cyber threats. A compliant organization with skillful employees will make successful and sustained implementation and maintenance of cybersecurity measures for smart grids, ensuring a secured and resilient operation.Design the implementation to be scalable across large-scale smart grid deployments. Plan for adaptation to evolving cyber threats and technological advancements in AI and cybersecurity. Here&amp;#39;s an example which outlines how AWS service and open-source tools can help here - Such procedures of implementation undertaken by the companies will ensure the successful integration of HCDI into businesses, smart grid security posture would increase, reduce the complexity to the approval process, and let effective collaboration prevail over cyber threats.This encapsulates the approach, that is hybrid or combined, which calls for advanced and legacy frameworks to unite and be driven by AI and ML to result in a resilient and elastic cybersecurity solution for smart grids. This strategy assures resilience against changing cyber threats and continuous improvement.This actually is an important step towards energy management, but simultaneously threatens critical infrastructure to potential advanced cyberattacks. In this regard, it is emphasized by the current study that the practice of extensive cybersecurity measures, in particular HCDI technique, should be obligatory. Thus, by integrating realtime detection with graph-based analysis, deep learning, the HCDI framework stands as a strong base for smart grid security. HCDI ensures timely, effective incident response by expediting approval procedures and encouraging cross-functional cooperation. When HCDI is well implemented, smart grids become more resilient and reliable in protecting national energy infrastructures against threats.},

  abstract     = {In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), are redefining how organizations operate, make decisions, and engage with customers. AI-driven technologies have become indispensable, providing businesses with powerful tools to streamline operations, derive actionable insights from vast data, and foster more meaningful customer interactions. For business leaders, scholars, and practitioners alike, understanding the transformative potential of AI isn’t just advantageous—it’s essential to staying competitive in an increasingly data-driven world.This editorial delves into recent scholarly advancements in LLM applications within business contexts, analyzing studies that explore AI’s potential across various domains, from decision support to creative industries. By introducing a structured framework, this editorial highlights key insights and contributions from recent studies, assessing their value to academia and industry. The following comparative analysis sheds light on how these innovations shape our understanding of AI’s role in business while pointing to future research directions.Puyt and Madsen&amp;#39;s (2024) study stands out as a foundational exploration of LLM accuracy, assessing ChatGPT-4&amp;#39;s ability to recount the history of the SWOT analysis-a vital business strategy tool. Their findings reveal that, while ChatGPT-4 effectively conveys general concepts, it struggles with detailed historical information, often producing inaccuracies or &amp;quot;hallucinations.&amp;quot; This gap underscores the need for LLMs to be trained with verified academic data, particularly for strategic business applications that demand precision. This study not only contributes to the literature by proposing methods to evaluate AI accuracy in historical contexts but also highlights the importance of rigorous information vetting in industry settings where reliability is crucial.In contrast, Raikov et al. (2024) explore a hybrid intelligence model that combines LLM capabilities with explainable AI (XAI) principles to enhance human-machine collaboration. Their approach emphasizes cognitive semantics, improving transparency and decision-making efficiency. The hybrid model&amp;#39;s real-time adaptability addresses the needs of complex, regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, where trust in AI decisions is paramount. Academically, this study provides a valuable addition to XAI literature by demonstrating how LLMs can bridge the gap between AI autonomy and human oversight, making it a model for future human-AI interactions in complex business environments.Another significant study by Mariotti and colleagues (2024) examines the integration of LLMs with enterprise knowledge graphs to enhance data-driven decision-making. By enabling organizations to leverage knowledge graphs for more accurate and scalable data retrieval, this research provides a robust framework for businesses seeking efficient knowledge management systems. The academic contribution here lies in advancing the dialogue between LLMs and knowledge graphs, emphasizing ethical data handling and quality standards essential for industry applications. For enterprises, the study offers practical solutions to achieve streamlined data management, balancing automation with privacy and security. 2024) take a different approach, investigating LLMs&amp;#39; role in creative industries, specifically within fashion design. They introduce a hybrid intelligence model that supports creative processes, allowing AI to complement rather than replace human ingenuity. While LLMs in this field demonstrate potential in automating repetitive design tasks and enhancing customer personalization, the study reveals limitations in AI&amp;#39;s ability to handle spatial and stylistic nuances. This study&amp;#39;s academic contribution lies in promoting human-AI co-creation, inspiring further research into AI applications across diverse creative sectors, including media and marketing.Collectively, these studies not only illuminate LLMs&amp;#39; transformative potential in business but also highlight critical ethical and operational considerations. Ensuring accuracy, transparency, and data privacy are vital to responsibly integrating AI into business workflows. Future research should focus on enhancing LLM accuracy, refining hybrid intelligence models, and exploring creative AI applications, all while maintaining ethical standards. As LLMs evolve, interdisciplinary collaborations will be essential to harness their full potential, making AI an ethical, effective, and innovative force in the business world.},

  abstract     = {The Indian energy grid, with a capacity of 250 GW, comprises five regional grids and operates on a single frequency. It consists of three functional blocks: Generation, Transmission, and Distribution. Each grid&amp;#39;s operation is overseen by the Regional load despatch center (RLDC), which works closely with the State load despatch center (SLDC) in each of its constituent states. The National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) oversees coordination between the five RLDCs and interregional and international exchange. Traditional grids in India face issues like longer fault clearing times, lack of automatic fault healing, voltage sag, voltage swell, and power theft. Converting the current grid into a smart grid could reduce these issues [1].Smart grid, which delivers electricity to consumers through two-way digital communication, is built on digital technologies. This system facilitates communication, analysis, control, and monitoring throughout the energy supply chain to improve efficiency, reduce energy prices and consumption, and raise transparency and dependability of the chain [2]- [5].The development of a smart grid is necessary because it can have a) Increased utilization of renewable energy sources b) Broad and efficient generation-to-consumer communication overlap c) Utilizing cutting-edge sensors and rapid control d) More operational effectiveness e) Enhanced ability to withstand attacks and natural catastrophes f) Fast power restoration and automated metering g) Increased consumer involvement. 4. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Limited (HPSEB), Himachal Pradesh: The project aims to enhance power quality management by installing advanced meters at 1,251 high-tension consumers, enabling swift identification and corrective actions to facilitate consumer decision-making. The functionality implemented is 80% similar to CESE. The benefits of same are shifting peak load, reduction in penalties and outages.5. Electricity Department-Puducherry (PED), Puducherry: The project, part of the RAPDRP Scheme, aims to enhance IT infrastructure and system for 34,000 domestic users, including a Common Meter Data Management System for data aggregation. 6. Tripura State Electricity Corporation Ltd (TSECL), Tripura: A pilot project, part of the RAPDRP Scheme, is being implemented to enhance IT infrastructure and strengthen the energy system. For effective energy management, Tariff schemes for Net Metering and Time of Use models are essential components. The implemented functionality, identical to AVVNL, offers benefits such as reduced distribution losses, reduced billing costs, and increased revenue collection efficiency. 7. Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL), Telangana: A pilot project targeting 45,290 consumers is underway for IT infrastructure development and system enhancement under the RAPDRP Scheme. The project explores innovative pricing mechanisms to optimize energy management and consumption patterns. The implemented functionality and benefits are identical to APDCL, resulting in lower AT&amp;amp;C losses and peak load usage, and billing cost reduction.8. Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (UHBVN), Haryana: A pilot project, part of the RAPDRP Scheme, is being implemented to enhance IT infrastructure and energy system efficiency for 11,000 consumers with an annual energy consumption of 70 MMU. The functionality implemented is 100% similar to APDCL and benefits are similar to TSSPDCL. 9. Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Limited (UGVCL), Gujarat: The pilot project in Naroda aims to improve energy supply efficiency and reliability for 22,230 consumers by improving utility-level functions such as asset management, peak power management, load forecasting, and outage management. The implemented functionality, identical to CESE, offers numerous benefits including reduced AT&amp;amp;C losses, peak power purchase costs, transformer failure rates, outages, meter reading costs, and payment collection costs. 10. West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL), West Bengal: The proposed project area, which serves 5,265 consumers, has an electrical infrastructure consisting of two 11kV feeders and 46 distribution transformers, consuming approximately 7.46 million units annually.

This project includes substation automation, rooftop solar PV integration, smart houses, IT infrastructure, renewable integration, advanced metering infrastructure and smart home management system. 12. Smart Grid Knowledge Centre (SGKC), Manesar: The Smart Grid Knowledge Centre will provide technical assistance to NSGM, enhancing workforce development, capacity enhancement, and outreach initiatives, fostering a supportive ecosystem for smart grid advancement. The project includes AMI, OMS, Micro Grid/Distributed Generation, EV charging, Home Energy Management Centre, Cyber Security &amp;amp; Training Infrastructure, and a laboratory platform for Smart Grid functionalities. The state-of-art methodologies play crucial role in advanced utilization of smart grid technology in US, EU, and China and are noted below [20]: Reviewing the overall purpose and goals, identifying functions, evaluating project characteristics, mapping each function onto a standardized set of benefits, setting baselines, gathering data, quantifying benefits, monetizing benefits, and estimating costs are all part of the state-of-art methodologies for the growth of smart grid technology. While some technologies, such as information and communication technology (ICT), distributed generation (DG), energy storage system (ESS), and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, have flourished, others, such as Wide Area Management Systems (WAMS), Distribution Automation (DA), Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), and Customer Technology (CT), and Smart Electricity Market (SEM) are not yet explored. The implementation of WAMS in China and US is 33%, while in EU it is only 25%. The maximum implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure is 84% in China, 50% in US, and 80% in EU. The minimum implementation for Customer Technology is 13% in China, 28% in the US, and 13% in the EU.Numerous issues with smart grid technologies need to be resolved [11] - [13]. Smart grids face numerous challenges such as demand, power transmission, forecasting, cybersecurity risks, infrastructure upgrades, data management, regulatory frameworks, public acceptance, workforce training, grid resilience, scalability, standardization, consumer engagement, renewable energy integration, grid modernization, and energy storage stability.After the execution of smart grid projects in India, some of the major challenges faced are [21]:The current grid infrastructure is inadequate for clean energy and distributed generation, presenting challenges in design, installation, operation, and maintenance. Cyber security is crucial to prevent security breaches. Smart grids integrate renewable energy sources for large-scale power generation but require storage solutions due to intermittent and renewable energy production. This paper investigates the current state of Indian electricity grid and the government&amp;#39;s plans to transform it into a smart grid. The partial focus given on the happening related to SG technologies in other countries like China, US, and EU. It outlines the essential requirements, features, challenges, and key constituents of smart grid system. The effectiveness of smart grid implementation is demonstrated through various pilot projects initiated by Indian government.The discussion concludes that smart grid technology provides numerous benefits, including reduced transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D) losses; peak load control; enhanced asset management; reduced power purchase prices; enhanced service quality and dependability; enhanced grid visibility and selfhealing capabilities; and alternatives like Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs, demand response schemes, and net metering. These improvements lead to higher customer satisfaction and financially stable utilities.The paper also presents government-implemented pilot projects supporting smart grid deployment.Moreover, the integration of AI into smart grids offers several benefits, including improved data privacy and security, significant investment in infrastructure upgrades, development of appropriate},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {With AI technologies driven by big data, many claim that we are now experiencing a global Fourth Industrial Revolution (MacGregor, 2024). Countries like Singapore (Chia, 2023) and America (MacGregor, 2024) are investing and rushing to develop AI talent and solutions. If one of the main roles of universities is to equip students for jobs of the future, there is no turning back from training students in the proficient and ethical use of generative AI (genAI). As mentioned by Heaven (2023), genAI tools are changing education, not destroying it. UNESCO (2023) has formulated guidance for policymakers on AI and education which has helped institutions of higher learning navigate the use of genAI. Research has found that university staff are aware that the use of genAI could result in better productivity and hence a majority are optimistic about its use (MacCormack, 2023). Students are also aware aboutof the benefits and challenges faced in the use of genAI. They are drawn to the unique insights and personalized feedback that genAI could offer 24/7, features which are useful with increasing class sizes (Dixon, 2023). Kakuchi&amp;#39;s study further found that 78% and 70% of students mentioned that genAI helped improve their writing and thinking respectively. However, they worry about unintentionally running afoul of university guidelines on its use as it becomes integrated in most software tools (Hodges &amp;amp; Ocak, 2023) and how an overreliance on genAI could influence the value of their university education (Chan &amp;amp; Hu, 2023).This opinion piece argues that as AI eventually becomes ubiquitous in education, educators should aim to use the technology to challenge students to hone their higher order thinking skillsthink critically and enhance their human interactions. This argument is supported by the findings from the World Economic Forum&amp;#39;s (2023) Future of Work report where creative thinking, analytical thinking and self-efficacy skills were rated as the top three skills.Two use cases from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), an applied learning university, are presented. to reflect how the use of genAI tools could be applied in a more human-centric manner.The first case relates to communication (soft) skills classes taught seminar style by the first author while the second case relates to large classes in to information technology (hard skills) taught by the second author. The two use cases reflect SIT&amp;#39;s position that genAI tools could enhance teaching and learning, and perhaps industry practices. Thus, students are encouraged to use genAI as tools rather than as primary sources of information (Rakshika &amp;amp; Lee, 2024). This aligns with the Singapore government&amp;#39;s initiative for students to be taught the ethical and responsible use of AI at different levels (Ang, 2024) and its Draft GenAI Governance Framework which aims to promote a systemic and balanced approach to facilitate innovation and address accountability issues in the use of genAI tools (Norton Rose Fullbright, 2024).Soft skills like communication skills are often taught seminar style in the classroom. In SIT, undergraduate students are taught to think critically and connectedly. take a core common module in Critical Thinking and Communicating in Year OneCritical thinking is taught using the Paul-Elder framework (2019 and) in a core common module &amp;quot;Critical Thinking and Communicating&amp;quot; in Year One and is reinforced in the Communicating Across the Curriculum (CAC) embedded workshops in various trimesters throughout their studies. The Paul-Elder framework aims to inculcate intellectual elements that help students question issues from multiple perspectives, while the intellectual standards focus on checking the quality of students&amp;#39; reasoning. Recently, students have also been taught systems thinking (Thinking Tools Studio, 2024) in some workshops to enhance their understanding on how issues are interrelated. This section presents insights gained from my adoption of genAI tools in the CAC workshops that I taught.Among the CAC workshops taught are Writing the Literature Review, Logbook Writing and Revising Penetration Testing Reports. The workshops catered to 119, 30, and 119 students respectively from the Information Technology program in the second trimester of 2023. The materials were developed based on the assignment brief provided by the respective module leads. The workshops were 3 hours, 6 hours and 3 hours long respectively and taught via zoom.The innovations in these workshops are the intentional teaching on how to use and evaluate outputs from ChatGPT 3.5 (a free genAI tool) using the Paul-Elder framework and systems thinking habits.The instructor demonstrated I used a genAI tool to teach workshops in writing literature review and logbook writing to work-study students and revising penetration testing reports for clarity to cybersecurity students. I found that the students were generally positive and aware about the benefits and limitations in using genAI. Some students liked the efficiency afforded by genAI while others preferred to be independent learners. Regardless of learning styles, the key thing was for me to demonstrate to the class how to use genAI ChatGPT on a parallel task in the workshop activities by teaching them how to use ChatGPT for various tasks related to the workshops, and , discover the limitations of genAI and providing them with feedback on the revisions needed in ChatGPT&amp;#39;s outputs using the Paul-Elder framework. Then, revise the genAI output with the class before the students performed a similar task using genAIChatGPT in groups of four to five in zoom breakout rooms. The students uploaded their drafts to the discussion forum in the LMS and the instructor led feedbackcum-questioning sessions with their peers on a few of the students&amp;#39; drafts. These activities sparked attempts by students to see what genAI can do well (or not) and they shared these with the class. For the logbook writing workshop, the students were also taught the 14 systems thinking habits aided by prompts from the flip cards (Thinking Tools Studio, 2024). The aim was to help students understand the implications of their decisions in the larger and dynamic contexts of a company and/or society.The feedback from the students was positive. The online surveys conducted at the end of the workshops showed that students were more aware about how to be strategic and critical when using ChatGPT in their learning. They liked the efficiency afforded by ChatGPT even though they needed to edit ChatGPT&amp;#39;s outputs. They also put in more effort to include key points in their writing which pre-empted questions from the instructor and their peers in class. The students also mentioned that they have gained more confidence in navigating the use of genAI tools for future assignments. Interestingly, even though the systems thinking habits were taught briefly in the logbook writing workshop, it resonated with the students, with ten out of the fourteen habits cited in the survey. These outcomes reflected The students realized that I was objective about the ethical use of genAI with an emphasis on them thinking critically and owning their learning. This created a positive and interactive learning environment, which encouraged discovery. Students shared their eureka moments, prompts and analytical strategies to revise genAI&amp;#39;s output with their group mates and/or class. They also mentioned that they have gained more confidence in navigating the use of genAI for future assignments. This was rewarding for me as an instructor as the learning environment has shifted from aided by discussions and questioning on ChatGPT&amp;#39;s outputs. one focused on keeping safe to one of curiousity.Teaching data structures and algorithms (DSA) presents significant challenges in computer science education due to the abstract and complex nature of these foundational topics. Students often struggle to grasp the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of DSA, which are crucial for effective problem-solving in various technological fields. Instructors face the difficult task of conveying these intricate concepts in a manner that is both engaging and comprehensible, particularly given the diverse learning paces and styles of students.In response to these challenges, we integrated AI chatbots into the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, which is a core component of several undergraduate degree programs. The course was delivered to a cohort of 178 students in the second trimester of 20234. It covered fundamental topics such as algorithm analysis, different data structures like stacks, queues, and trees, and algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimizing paths in graphs.A significant innovation in the course was the inclusion of a team project that required students to use AI chatbots as a learning tool. This project was introduced in the latter half of the course and aimed to enhance students&amp;#39; understanding of DSA through interaction with chatbots. Students were grouped into teams of four to five, and each team selected a specific data structure or algorithm to focus on. They interacted with AI chatbots to ask questions and assess the responses based on accuracy, completeness, clarity, and relevance. The assignment also required students to propose a real-world application for their chosen topic and document their findings and interactions in a detailed report.The feedback from the students on the use of AI chatbots in the team project was largely positive. Surveys conducted at the end of the trimester showed high ratings for the accuracy, clarity, and relevance of the chatbot responses. Students appreciated the interactive nature of the chatbots, noting that this approach made the learning process more engaging and contributed to a better understanding of complex DSA topics. The introduction of AI chatbots not only provided a more interactive and personalized learning experience but also sparked a deeper reflection among students on the human aspects of learning, such as creativity, highlighting a clear distinction in educational engagement compared to traditional methods without such technology. These outcomes suggest that AI chatbots, with further refinement, could become invaluable educational tools in computer science, helping to mitigate some of the traditional challenges associated with teaching DSA effectively.The current generation Z are digital natives. Thus, they take to genAI like fish to the water. Coffey (2023) further found that genAI is used daily by 50% of college students in helping them with their school assignments, with the number of users set to increase year on year. In addition, 30% of the students believe that they need to be well-versed in its use to gain employment. We have shared two use cases which demonstrated how genAI was used to promote students&amp;#39; curiosity and accountability and which empowered their humanity. We would like to suggest that instructors need to model the way in which students could use genAI meaningfully and ethically. Another suggestion could be to utilize formative assessments with clear guidelines for the use of genAI which focuses on the learning process rather than the product per se. Chan&amp;#39;s (2023) 3R framework encourages students to Report their use of genAI tools, Revise its output and lastly write a specific learning Reflection on the process. This framework recognizes AI-assisted writing as basic writing which leads to specific writing purposes. Having students declare the originality of their submissions could be another ethical safeguard as it has mostly been mostly effective in deterring academic dishonesty (Borup, 2023). Instructors have often wished for teaching assistants to help them manage increasing class sizes. With proper guidance, genAI, including recent advanced reasoning models such as OpenAI o1, could serve students in that role, offering students an interactive and personalized learning environment for their learning and alsoand possibly equip them for the future of work which utilizes genAI.The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.CC: Conception and design of the paper and literature search, communication skills use cases.

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in education has been met with both excitement and concern. According to a 2023 survey by the World Economic Forum, over 60% of educators in advanced economies are now using some form of artificial intelligence (AI) in their classrooms, a significant increase from just 20% five years ago (World Economic Forum, 2023). The rapid adoption of AI technologies in education highlights their potential to revolutionize the learning experience. AI tools, such as intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning platforms, offer personalized educational experiences that can meet the unique needs of each student. However, with this potential comes significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding academic integrity.The International Center for Academic Integrity reported that 58% of students admitted to using AI tools to complete assignments dishonestly, highlighting the urgency of addressing these ethical concerns (International Center for Academic Integrity, 2023). This statistic underscores a critical issue: while AI has the potential to enhance education, its misuse can undermine the very foundations of academic integrity. The rise of AI technology has raised concerns about academic integrity. With tools that can generate text, solve problems, and even assist with research, students may find it easier to engage in plagiarism or other forms of cheating. This shift challenges traditional educational values, as it blurs the lines between original work and AI-generated content (Mohammadkarimi, 2023). Curriculum designers are thus faced with the challenge of integrating AI in ways that uphold ethical standards and promote genuine learning. This requires balancing the innovative potential of AI tools with a commitment to academic integrity, ensuring that technology enhances rather than undermines the educational experience.To navigate this landscape responsibly, it is essential to revisit established ethical frameworks and educational theories. The ethical principles guiding our use of technology in education have remained consistent, even as the tools themselves have evolved. By referencing seminal works and foundational theories, we can demonstrate that the core values of honesty, fairness, and responsibility are timeless. For example, deontological ethics, as articulated by Immanuel Kant, emphasizes the importance of adhering to moral principles such as honesty and integrity, rather than the consequences of actions (Kant, 1785). In the context of AI in education, deontological ethics would require that the use of AI respects fundamental moral principles. For example, it would be crucial to ensure that AI systems are designed and implemented in ways that uphold students&amp;#39; rights to privacy, ensure fairness, and avoid deception. Adhering to these principles would be seen as morally obligatory, regardless of the potential benefits or drawbacks of AI in educational settings. Similarly, consequentialism, as articulated by John Stuart Mill, evaluates actions based on their outcomes. Mill&amp;#39;s version of consequentialism, known as utilitarianism, argues that the best actions are those that promote happiness or better well-being. In the context of AI in education, applying Mill&amp;#39;s consequentialist principles would involve assessing how the use of AI impacts educational outcomes. If AI can be used to enhance learning, provide personalized educational experiences, or address inequalities and inequities in education, then its use would be considered morally justified according to Mill&amp;#39;s framework, as it promotes overall well-being and positive outcomes for students.These ethical frameworks provide a robust foundation for the responsible use of GAI in modern educational settings. Moreover, educational theories such as constructivist learning and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) offer valuable insights into how AI can be used to enhance learning. Constructivist learning theory posits that students construct knowledge through active engagement with content, a process that can be greatly facilitated by AI tools. This approach emphasizes the importance of students&amp;#39; engagement in hands-on activities and interactions, which help them construct meaningful connections with new information (Hein, 1991). AI tools can significantly enhance this constructivist approach by providing personalized and interactive learning experiences. SDT, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in fostering intrinsic motivation among students (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Integrating AI tools that align with the principles of SDT can help create a more engaging and supportive learning environment among students. This discussion will explore how GAI can be integrated into education in ways that support rather than erode academic integrity. By examining the ethical frameworks of deontological ethics and consequentialism, and educational theories like constructivist learning and SDT, we will argue that AI, when used responsibly, can enhance digital literacy, foster intrinsic motivation, and support genuine knowledge construction. The principles discussed in older foundational papers remain relevant, proving that ethical guidelines established decades ago still hold value in today&amp;#39;s technologically advanced classrooms (Floridi &amp;amp; Taddeo, 2016;Ryan &amp;amp; Deci, 2017).The goal is to illustrate that the ethical use of GAI in education not only preserves but can also enhance academic integrity. Through responsible integration and ethical education, AI can empower students to become motivated, ethical, and engaged learners, well-prepared for the complexities of the modern world. By grounding our arguments in established ethical and educational theories, we can provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the potential benefits and challenges of AI in education.The integration of GAI in education raises significant concerns about its potential to disrupt traditional assessment methods. The ability of GAI to generate essays, problem solutions, and even creative works has sparked fears of plagiarism and academic dishonesty, challenging conventional forms of evaluation such as take-home exams, essays, or homework assignments. These concerns are valid, as the ease with which students can use AI-generated content without truly engaging in the learning process threatens to undermine academic integrity (Popenici and Kerr, 2017) .However, the disruptive nature of GAI also presents an opportunity to reimagine assessment practices in ways that prioritize authentic learning and deeper understanding. The rise of AI necessitates a shift away from traditional assessments focused on rote memorization and information recall, toward more authentic assessment methods that require students to demonstrate higher-order thinking skills. For example, project-based tasks, real-world problem-solving activities, oral presentations, and open-ended assignments that demand personal reflection and original insights can reduce the likelihood of misuse and encourage students to engage meaningfully with course material (Borenstein and Howard, 2020). Furthermore, GAI can play a constructive role in formative assessment by providing personalized feedback throughout the learning process. AI-driven tools can help students revise drafts, practice skills, and receive immediate guidance on areas needing improvement, fostering a deeper connection to the material. This approach transforms GAI from a potential threat to a valuable asset that supports continuous learning and skill development. Additionally, incorporating self-assessment and metacognitive practices, where students reflect on their progress and learning strategies, can ensure that AI augments rather than diminishes students&amp;#39; active participation in their education.It is also essential to address the ethical considerations involved in using AI for assessment. Concerns such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the fairness of AI-generated evaluations must be taken seriously (Borenstein and Howard, 2020) . Developing clear institutional policies that set boundaries on acceptable AI use in assessments can help maintain fairness and transparency. These policies should include guidelines for combining AI insights with human judgment to ensure that assessments reflect not only the outputs o AI but also the educator&amp;#39;s understanding of the student&amp;#39;s abilities and efforts.By embracing these strategies, educators and institutions can harness the potential of GAI to enhance assessments while maintaining academic integrity. This balanced approach allows for the responsible integration of AI in education, ensuring that it supports meaningful learning experiences and prepares students to navigate an AI-driven world with integrity.Constructivist learning theory posits that learners construct knowledge through experiences and reflections, actively engaging with content to build understanding. GAI, with its advanced capabilities, aligns well with this theory, offering tools that promote exploration, interaction, and personalized learning paths. Contrary to the belief that AI erodes academic integrity, some scholars argue that AI, when used thoughtfully, has the potential to enhance educational experiences by providing personalized learning opportunities and supporting students&amp;#39; individual learning needs (Weller, 2020). While Weller does not claim that AI inherently fosters critical thinking or deeper understanding, his discussion highlights the potential of AI in educational settings, suggesting that it could complement traditional teaching methods to improve learning outcomes.GAI tools, such as intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning platforms, provide students with tailored educational experiences. These systems analyze individual learning patterns and adapt content to meet specific needs, ensuring that students engage with material at an appropriate level of difficulty (Woolf, 2010). For instance, an AI-powered math tutor can identify a student&amp;#39;s weaknesses in algebra and offer targeted exercises to address these gaps. This personalized approach not only supports knowledge construction but also encourages students to take ownership of their learning journey (Shute &amp;amp; Zapata-Rivera, 2012).In a classroom setting, imagine a high school history class studying the Industrial Revolution. The educator integrates a GAI tool that generates interactive timelines and simulations based on historical data. Students can manipulate variables within these simulations to observe the effects on industrial growth, labor conditions, and economic development. Through this exploration, they construct a deeper understanding of the era&amp;#39;s complexities. Instead of passively receiving information, students actively engage with content, reflecting on the consequences of different actions and decisions (Kumar et. al., 2024).Another example is in language arts, where a GAI tool assists students in creative writing. By analyzing a student&amp;#39;s writing style and providing real-time feedback on grammar, tone, and narrative structure, the AI helps students refine their skills (Song &amp;amp; Song, 2023). Additionally, it can suggest plot developments or character traits, sparking students&amp;#39; creativity and encouraging them to think critically about their stories. This interactive process supports constructivist principles by allowing students to experiment, reflect, and build upon their ideas (Bereiter &amp;amp; Scardamalia, 1989).Critics argue that AI tools may encourage academic dishonesty by making it easier for students to produce work with minimal effort. However, this perspective overlooks the potential for AI to promote genuine learning when used appropriately. Rather than replacing student effort, AI can enhance the learning process by offering personalized support, immediate feedback, and adaptive content, which fosters deeper engagement and learning outcomes (Nazaretsky et al., 2022). For instance, in a science class, AI-powered lab assistants can guide students through virtual experiments, providing explanations and prompting them to hypothesize, analyze data, and draw conclusions. Such interactions encourage active learning and promote a deeper understanding of scientific concepts and processes, rather than merely supplying answers (de Jong &amp;amp; van Joolingen, 1998). Additionally, as Al Darayseh (2023) notes, AI tools designed with input from educators help align the technology with pedagogical objectives, embedding ethical considerations to reduce the risk of academic dishonesty. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that AI is transforming science education and pedagogy, and the ethical implementation of these tools must reflect this shift to support genuine learning experiences while safeguarding academic integrity (Holstein et al., 2018;Erduran, 2023) .Moreover, GAI can facilitate collaborative learning, another key aspect of constructivist theory. In a project-based learning environment, students can use AI tools to collaboratively develop presentations or reports. AI can assist by organizing information, suggesting relevant sources, and providing feedback on the clarity and coherence of their work (Kreijns et al., 2003). This collaborative process encourages students to engage in dialogue, share perspectives, and build knowledge collectively.To further illustrate, consider a classroom where students are tasked with developing a business plan. An AI tool can generate market analysis reports, financial projections, and strategic recommendations based on input from the students. As they interact with the AI and with each other, they learn to critically evaluate information, make informed decisions, and adapt their plans. This dynamic, interactive process is at the heart of constructivist learning, fostering not only knowledge construction but also critical thinking and problem-solving skills (Jonassen, 1995).At present, there are multiple AI powered tools that are being used by most students that have significant potential to enhance a constructivist learning experience. One example is the ChatGPT. According to Rasul et.al (2023), ChatGPT supports the constructivist principle that learners construct their own understanding of knowledge by enabling students to explore and experiment with ideas, ask questions, and receive immediate feedback. This interactive engagement helps students to deeply connect with the content, refine their comprehension, and apply their learning in meaningful ways, ultimately enriching their educational experience.Also, according to Mota-Valtierra et al (2019), a constructivist approach is a great fit for teaching AI topics because it emphasizes building on prior knowledge and encouraging active learning. Their article outlines an innovative approach to teaching artificial intelligence (AI) through a constructivist methodology, specifically focusing on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). After implementing it in different majors, the statistical analysis underscores the success of the proposed course methodology in enhancing student learning and providing a more consistent educational experience. The increase in average grades and the reduction in standard deviation highlight the effectiveness of the approach in improving both individual performance and overall learning outcomes.In conclusion, GAI aligns with constructivist learning theory by providing tools that facilitate exploration, interaction, and personalized learning. Rather than promoting dishonesty, AI can enhance academic integrity by supporting genuine learning experiences. Through personalized feedback, interactive simulations, and collaborative projects, AI empowers students to take an active role in their education, constructing knowledge in meaningful and engaging ways. By embracing these technologies, educators can create enriching learning environments that prepare students for the complexities of the modern world (Papert &amp;amp; Harel, 1991).The rise of GAI in education has sparked discussions on its ethical implications and the importance of fostering digital literacy. By examining ethical frameworks such as deontological ethics and consequentialism, we can argue that responsible use of GAI in the classroom can enhance students&amp;#39; digital literacy and prepare them to navigate the digital world ethically and effectively (Floridi &amp;amp; Taddeo, 2016;Stahl, 2012).Deontological ethics, which focuses on adherence to moral rules or duties, provides a foundation for integrating AI responsibly in education. This framework emphasizes the importance of principles such as honesty, fairness, and respect for others (Kant, 1785). In the context of GAI, this means ensuring that AI tools are used to support and enhance learning rather than replacing students&amp;#39; efforts or promoting dishonesty.For instance, in a high school history class studying the Industrial Revolution, an AI tool can generate interactive timelines and simulations based on historical data. Educators can emphasize the importance of using these tools ethically, encouraging students to engage with the material thoughtfully and critically. By adhering to principles of honesty and integrity, students learn to use AI as a supplementary resource that enhances their understanding rather than as a shortcut to completing assignments (Johnson, 2020). Consequentialism, as articulated by John Stuart Mill in Utilitarianism (1861), evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes. While Mill did not discuss AI, the principles of this framework can still be applied to contemporary debates about its use in education. By aiming to maximize positive outcomes-such as enhanced learning, critical thinking, and digital literacy-educators and curriculum designers can advocate for the responsible integration of AI. Emphasizing these benefits underscores how AI tools can contribute to better educational results and foster more informed digital citizens.In a language arts classroom, for example, a GAI tool can assist students in creative writing by providing real-time feedback on grammar, tone, and narrative structure. Educators can guide students to use this feedback to improve their writing skills, fostering a deeper understanding of language and storytelling. The positive outcomes of enhanced writing abilities and critical engagement with AI tools illustrate the ethical benefits of responsible AI use (Borenstein &amp;amp; Howard, 2020). To further promote digital literacy, it is crucial to educate students and educators on the ethical use of AI tools. This involves teaching them to understand how AI works, the potential biases and limitations of AI systems, and the importance of using AI responsibly (Brey, 2012). By fostering a culture of digital literacy, educators empower students to navigate the digital world with a critical and ethical mindset.Consider a science class where an AI-powered lab assistant guides students through virtual experiments. Educators can use this opportunity to discuss the ethical considerations of AI in scientific research, such as data privacy, bias, and the importance of accurate data interpretation. By engaging in these discussions, students develop a nuanced understanding of the role of AI in science and the ethical responsibilities of using AI in research (Floridi, 2013).Moreover, collaborative projects can further enhance digital literacy and ethical awareness. In a project-based learning environment, students can use AI tools to develop presentations or reports collaboratively. Educators can emphasize the importance of ethical collaboration, such as giving credit to sources, avoiding plagiarism, and ensuring that all team members contribute fairly. This approach not only enhances students&amp;#39; digital literacy but also instills ethical values that are essential in the digital age (Ess, 2015).For instance, in a business class where students are tasked with developing a business plan, an AI tool can generate market analysis reports and financial projections. Educators can guide students to critically evaluate the AI-generated data, discuss the ethical implications of using AI in business decision-making, and ensure transparency and accountability in their work. This process helps students understand the ethical dimensions of AI and develop skills to use AI responsibly in their future careers (Mittelstadt et al., 2016).The ethical frameworks of deontological ethics and consequentialism provide valuable insights into the responsible use of GAI in education. By emphasizing the importance of principles such as honesty, fairness, and positive outcomes, educators can foster digital literacy and ethical awareness among students. Teaching students to understand and navigate the ethical implications of AI tools prepares them to contribute positively to the digital world, ensuring that they use AI to enhance learning and uphold ethical standards. Through responsible AI integration and ethical education, we can create a generation of digitally literate and ethically aware individuals ready to thrive in a technologically advanced society (Moor, 1985).The integration of AI in education holds great promise for enhancing learning experiences but raises profound ethical questions. The need for careful ethical reflection is underscored in The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Practices, Challenges, and Debates, which argues that educators, researchers, and stakeholders must engage in ongoing dialogue to navigate the complexities of AI in educational contexts (Holmes and Porayska-Pomsta, 2022). Smuha (2022) points out that for AI in education to be ethically responsible, it must adhere to key principles such as fairness, accountability, and transparency. These principles are vital in mitigating biases and preventing AI from perpetuating or amplifying existing educational inequalities. Furthermore, the concept of Trustworthy AI, as discussed by Smuha, is crucial in ensuring that AI systems foster inclusivity and do not marginalize vulnerable student populations (Smuha, 2022). Similarly, Brossi et al. ( 2022) raise concerns about the uncertain impact of AI on learners&amp;#39; cognitive development and the risk of disempowering educators through over-automation of pedagogical processes, pointing to the need for ethical frameworks that avoid automating ineffective or inequitable practices. Williamson (2024) expands on this by highlighting the socio-political context of AI in education, warning against the assumption that technological innovations are inherently beneficial. Instead, he emphasizes that AI must be viewed as a socially embedded tool that could exacerbate educational inequities if not critically examined. The potential for AI to impact power dynamics, access, and social equity necessitates that educators and policymakers rigorously reflect on its broader implications, including how AI systems might reinforce or challenge existing educational structures. 2023) offer a practical step forward in addressing these concerns through their participatory futures approach, which is designed to help educators ethically integrate AI into their teaching environments. By using the Delphi method to gather diverse perspectives, their study presents hypothetical future scenarios that help educators and stakeholders reflect on the broader implications of AI in education. This approach ensures that the benefits of AI are balanced with ethical considerations related to privacy, bias, and the societal impacts of AI on education, promoting a thoughtful and inclusive implementation of AI technologies.Further supporting this ethical stance, the European Commission&amp;#39;s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (2019) lays out seven key requirements for Trustworthy AI, including human agency, privacy, transparency, and fairness. These guidelines align closely with the need to ensure that AI systems in education promote fairness and inclusivity, rather than exacerbating inequities in educational access and outcomes. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring and accountability to ensure AI systems remain aligned with these ethical principles. By stressing the importance of transparency, diversity, and non-discrimination, these guidelines reinforce the participatory frameworks put forth by Mouta et al. (2023), which advocate for an inclusive, ethical approach to AI integration in education .Further reinforcing these ethical considerations, Floridi et al. (2018) in their &amp;quot;AI4People&amp;quot; framework emphasize the importance of a principled approach to AI that integrates ethical foundations like beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. These principles align with the need for AI in education to promote well-being and inclusivity while avoiding harm, respecting user autonomy, ensuring fair access to AI benefits, and fostering transparency. The framework also highlights that the potential risks of AI can include the erosion of human agency and privacy, making it essential for educational AI systems to be designed in ways that support rather than undermine student autonomy and self-determination. By embedding these principles into the development and deployment of AI, educators and policymakers can more effectively navigate the ethical challenges posed by AI in educational contexts, ultimately fostering a &amp;quot;Good AI Society&amp;quot; that supports human flourishing.SDT posits that individuals are most motivated when their needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met. GAI, with its capability to provide personalized feedback and tailored learning resources, can significantly support SDT by fostering intrinsic motivation among students. By empowering students to take control of their learning, AI can enhance engagement and academic integrity (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000;Ryan &amp;amp; Deci, 2017).GAI can enhance students&amp;#39; sense of autonomy by offering them more control over their learning process. In a high school history class studying the Industrial Revolution, an AI tool can create interactive timelines and simulations. Students can explore these tools at their own pace, choosing which aspects of the Industrial Revolution to delve into more deeply. This self-directed exploration encourages students to take ownership of their learning, fostering a sense of autonomy (Reeve, 2006).For example, a student interested in labor conditions during the Industrial Revolution might use the AI tool to simulate different labor policies and observe their impacts. This personalized exploration helps students develop a deeper understanding of historical complexities, driven by their own curiosity and interests (Niemiec &amp;amp; Ryan, 2009).GAI tools can also support the need for competence by providing personalized feedback that helps students improve their skills and knowledge. In a language arts classroom, an AI-driven writing assistant can analyze a student&amp;#39;s work and provide targeted feedback on grammar, tone, and narrative structure. This real-time, individualized feedback helps students understand their strengths and areas for improvement, fostering a sense of competence (Black &amp;amp; Deci, 2000).Imagine a student writing a short story. The AI tool can suggest improvements in plot development and character interactions, guiding the student to refine their narrative. As students see their writing improve through this iterative process, they gain confidence in their abilities, which enhances their intrinsic motivation to engage with the subject matter (Vansteenkiste et al., 2004).GAI can also facilitate relatedness by enabling collaborative learning and providing opportunities for meaningful interactions. In a project-based learning environment, AI tools can help students work together on presentations or reports. For instance, in a science class, an AI-powered lab assistant can guide groups of students through virtual experiments, encouraging collaboration and discussion (Ryan &amp;amp; Powelson, 1991).Consider a group of students using AI to simulate a chemical reaction. The AI provides each group member with specific tasks and prompts them to share their findings and discuss results. This collaborative process fosters a sense of relatedness, as students work together to achieve common goals and learn from each other (Jang et al., 2016).By fostering intrinsic motivation through autonomy, competence, and relatedness, GAI can also promote academic integrity. When students are genuinely interested and engaged in their learning, they are less likely to resort to dishonest practices. Personalized learning experiences make education more relevant and enjoyable, reducing the temptation to cheat (Deci et al., 1991).In history class, for example, students using AI to explore the Industrial Revolution are likely to develop a genuine interest in the subject. This intrinsic motivation drives them to produce original work and engage deeply with the material. Similarly, in the language arts class, students motivated by the desire to improve their writing skills are more likely to take pride in their work and avoid plagiarism (Vansteenkiste &amp;amp; Ryan, 2013).In a business class where students develop business plans using AI-generated market analysis reports and financial projections, educators can emphasize the importance of ethical decision-making and transparency. The AI tool provides personalized insights, allowing students to explore various business strategies and their consequences. This hands-on learning approach fosters intrinsic motivation by making the subject matter relevant and engaging (Ryan &amp;amp; Deci, 2000).For instance, a student interested in starting a sustainable business can use AI to analyze the environmental impact of different business models. This personalized exploration helps the student develop a deeper understanding of sustainability in business, driven by their own interests and values (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2008). GAI, by supporting the principles of SDT, can foster intrinsic motivation among students. Through personalized feedback and tailored learning resources, AI empowers students to take control of their learning, enhancing their sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This intrinsic motivation not only increases engagement but also promotes academic integrity. By integrating AI tools in educational settings, educators can create enriching learning environments that prepare students for the complexities of the modern world, ensuring that they are motivated, ethical, and engaged learners (Ryan &amp;amp; Deci, 2019).The integration of GAI in education has sparked significant debate regarding its impact on academic integrity. Critics argue that AI tools facilitate dishonesty by providing easy shortcuts for students to complete assignments. However, a closer examination of established educational theories and ethical frameworks reveals a different perspective. When used responsibly, GAI can foster intrinsic motivation, enhance digital literacy, and support constructivist learning principles, thereby promoting academic integrity rather than eroding it.The integration of GAI in various educational fields, including computer science, engineering, medical education, and communication, is revolutionizing teaching and learning. The integration of AI technologies in computer science education, particularly through tools like GitHub Copilot, offers significant benefits in fostering creativity, enhancing learning efficiency, and supporting advanced projects. In engineering education, GAI offers numerous benefits, leveraging advanced chatbots and text-generation models to enhance learning and problem-solving capabilities. Cloud-based frameworks and social robots significantly enhance engineering education by providing scalable resources, interactive learning environments, and personalized support. Moreover, GAI has the potential to revolutionize medical education by enhancing clinical training, improving diagnostic accuracy, supporting personalized medicine, and advancing public health education. Also, GAI models hold great potential to enhance communication education across journalism, media, and healthcare fields. By supporting content generation, data analysis, creative development, and patient communication, GAI tools can provide valuable learning experiences and improve productivity (Bahroun et al, 2023). GAI holds immense potential to transform education by enhancing teaching, learning, and educational processes. However, to fully realize these benefits, it is essential to address issues of responsible and ethical usage, potential biases, and academic integrity. By developing comprehensive guidelines, promoting transparency, mitigating bias, and fostering critical thinking skills, educators and institutions can ensure that AI technologies contribute positively to a technologically advanced, inclusive, and effective educational landscape (Bahroun et al, 2023).SDT posits that students are most motivated when their needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met. GAI can significantly enhance these aspects, fostering intrinsic motivation among students. When students are intrinsically motivated, they are more likely to engage deeply with the material and maintain academic integrity. AI tools enhance autonomy by allowing students to control their learning process. In a history class, for instance, students can use AI-generated interactive timelines and simulations to explore different aspects of the Industrial Revolution at their own pace. This self-directed exploration encourages students to take ownership of their learning journey, which promotes a genuine interest in the subject matter. Such autonomy reduces the likelihood of dishonest behavior, as students are motivated by curiosity and a desire to learn.Moreover, AI tools support competence by providing personalized feedback that helps students improve their skills. In a language arts classroom, an AI-driven writing assistant can analyze a student&amp;#39;s work and offer specific suggestions for improvement. This real-time feedback not only enhances the student&amp;#39;s writing skills but also builds their confidence. When students see tangible improvements in their abilities, their intrinsic motivation to engage with the subject matter increases. This motivation fosters academic integrity, as students take pride in their work and are less inclined to plagiarize or cheat. GAI also facilitates relatedness by enabling collaborative learning. In project-based learning environments, AI tools can help students work together more effectively. For example, in a science class, an AI-powered lab assistant can guide groups through virtual experiments, encouraging discussion and collaboration. This collaborative process fosters a sense of community and shared purpose among students, which supports their intrinsic motivation to learn and succeed together. When students feel connected to their peers and their learning objectives, they are more likely to adhere to ethical standards and maintain academic integrity.Digital literacy is essential in today&amp;#39;s technology-driven world, and GAI can play a crucial role in fostering this skill. Ethical frameworks such as deontological ethics and consequentialism provide valuable insights into the responsible use of AI in education, emphasizing the importance of honesty, fairness, and positive outcomes.Deontological ethics, which focuses on adherence to moral principles, underscores the need for using AI tools responsibly. Educators can teach students to use AI ethically by emphasizing principles such as honesty and integrity. For instance, when using AI-generated simulations in a history class, educators can guide students to engage thoughtfully with the material, ensuring that their use of AI supports genuine learning rather than shortcuts. By instilling these ethical values, educators help students understand the importance of maintaining academic integrity.Consequentialism, which evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes, further supports the responsible use of AI in education. The ethical use of AI should aim to produce positive educational outcomes, such as enhanced learning, critical thinking, and digital literacy. In a language arts classroom, an AI writing assistant can provide constructive feedback that helps students refine their writing skills. This positive outcome not only improves their competence but also instills a sense of responsibility in using AI tools ethically. When students see the benefits of using AI to enhance their skills, they are more likely to use these tools responsibly, maintaining academic integrity.Moreover, educating students on the ethical use of AI tools is crucial for fostering digital literacy. In a science class, an AI-powered lab assistant can guide students through virtual experiments, prompting discussions on ethical considerations such as data privacy and accuracy. By engaging in these discussions, students develop a nuanced understanding of the role of AI in scientific research and the ethical responsibilities that come with it. This awareness empowers students to navigate the digital world ethically and effectively, reducing the likelihood of dishonest behavior.Constructivist learning theory emphasizes that students construct knowledge through experiences and reflections. GAI aligns well with this theory, offering tools that promote exploration, interaction, and personalized learning paths. By supporting constructivist principles, AI enhances academic integrity by encouraging deeper understanding and critical thinking.In a history class studying the Industrial Revolution, an AI tool that generates interactive timelines and simulations allows students to manipulate variables and observe outcomes. This hands-on exploration helps students construct a deeper understanding of historical complexities. Rather than passively receiving information, students actively engage with the content, reflecting on the consequences of different actions. This active engagement fosters a genuine interest in learning, reducing the temptation to cheat.Similarly, in a language arts classroom, a GAI tool that provides real-time feedback on writing helps students improve their narrative skills. By experimenting with different plot developments and character traits, students engage in a creative process that aligns with constructivist principles. This interactive learning experience encourages students to think critically about their stories, fostering a deeper understanding of language and storytelling. When students are genuinely invested in their learning process, they are less likely to engage in dishonest practices.Collaborative learning, another key aspect of constructivist theory, is also enhanced by GAI. In project-based learning environments, AI tools can facilitate collaboration by organizing information, suggesting relevant sources, and providing feedback on the clarity of students&amp;#39; work. For example, in a business class, an AI tool can help students develop a business plan by generating market analysis reports and financial projections. This collaborative process encourages students to engage in dialogue, share perspectives, and build knowledge collectively. When students work together to achieve common goals, they are more likely to adhere to ethical standards and maintain academic integrity.GAI, when integrated responsibly in education, does not erode academic integrity. Instead, it fosters intrinsic motivation, enhances digital literacy, and supports constructivist learning principles. By promoting autonomy, competence, and relatedness, AI tools help students develop a genuine interest in their subjects, reducing the likelihood of dishonest behavior. Ethical education and personalized feedback further empower students to navigate the digital world responsibly, ensuring that they use AI tools to enhance their learning rather than as shortcuts. Through interactive and collaborative learning experiences, GAI encourages deeper understanding and critical thinking, ultimately promoting academic integrity in today&amp;#39;s educational landscape.To provide practical guidance for using AI in education, we recommend focusing on integrating AI in ways that support established educational goals while adhering to ethical guidelines. Transparency is crucial in this process, as educators must actively involve students in understanding how AI tools are being used, what their limitations are, and why ethical use is important. This includes making the need to understand and actively utilize AI an explicit part of program objectives, course objectives, and learning outcomes, ensuring that its integration aligns with educational goals like developing digital literacy and critical thinking skills. By discussing potential biases, data privacy concerns, and limitations of AI-generated content, educators foster a culture of critical engagement where students learn to use AI responsibly and ethically rather than blindly relying on it. This proactive approach equips students with the discernment and integrity needed to navigate an AI-driven world.Professional development for educators is crucial for the effective integration of AI in education. Governments and administrative bodies must exert the necessarily sustained and concerted pressures to make this a priority. Alongside sustained and concerted pressures, they need to sufficiently invest in resources and provide support and encouragement to ensure that this training is effective and widespread. Training programs should equip educators with practical skills for using AI tools, while also covering ethical considerations like data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the limitations of AI-generated feedback. By mandating and funding professional development, policymakers and administrators can ensure that educators are well-prepared to navigate the potential risks and benefits of AI. This comprehensive support empowers educators to guide students in using AI tools responsibly, fostering genuine learning and upholding academic integrity, rather than allowing misuse or over-reliance on technology to take root.Finally, an iterative approach to integrating AI is crucial, and this must be encouraged at the policymaking level as well. Educators should continuously assess the impacts of AI on learning outcomes and be prepared to adjust their strategies accordingly. This involves collecting feedback from students, reviewing the effectiveness of AI tools, and making necessary changes to ensure AI contributes to meaningful educational experiences. Policymakers can support this process by implementing guidelines and providing resources that promote regular evaluation and adaptation of AI integration practices in schools. By emphasizing these practical steps at both the classroom and policy levels, educators can incorporate AI in ways that not only enhance learning but also foster responsible, ethical engagement with technology.},

  abstract     = {In-memory computing (IMC) with non-volatile memories (NVMs) has emerged as a promising approach to address the rapidly growing computational demands of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Mapping DNN layers spatially onto NVM-based IMC accelerators achieves high degrees of parallelism. However, two challenges that arise in this approach are the highly non-uniform distribution of layer processing times and high area requirements. We propose LRMP, a method to jointly apply layer replication and mixed precision quantization to improve the performance of DNNs when mapped to area-constrained IMC accelerators. LRMP uses a combination of reinforcement learning and mixed integer linear programming to search the replication-quantization design space using a model that is closely informed by the target hardware architecture. Across five DNN benchmarks, LRMP achieves 2.6–9.3× latency and 8–18× throughput improvement at minimal (&amp;lt;1%) degradation in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) places immense compute requirements on the underlying hardware platforms, expending large amounts of time and energy. An important factor contributing to the long training times is the increasing dataset complexity required to reach state-of-the-art performance in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we explore the use of input mixing, where multiple inputs are combined into a single composite input with an associated composite label for training. The goal is for training on the mixed input to achieve a similar effect as training separately on each the constituent inputs that it represents. This results in a lower number of inputs (or mini-batches) to be processed in each epoch, proportionally reducing training time. We find that naive input mixing leads to a considerable drop in learning performance and model accuracy due to interference between the forward/backward propagation of the mixed inputs. We propose two strategies to address this challenge and realize training speedups from input mixing with minimal impact on accuracy. First, we reduce the impact of inter-input interference by exploiting the spatial separation between the features of the constituent inputs in the network&#39;s intermediate representations. We also adaptively vary the mixing ratio of constituent inputs based on their loss in previous epochs. Second, we propose heuristics to automatically identify the subset of the training dataset that is subject to mixing in each epoch. Across ResNets of varying depth, MobileNetV2 and two Vision Transformer networks, we obtain upto 1.6 × and 1.8 × speedups in training for the ImageNet and Cifar10 datasets, respectively, on an Nvidia RTX 2080Ti GPU, with negligible loss in classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The world urgently needs new sources of clean energy due to a growing global population, rising energy use, and the effects of climate change. Nuclear energy is one of the most promising solutions for meeting the world’s energy needs now and in the future. One type of nuclear energy, Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), has gained interest as a potential clean energy source. Recent AI advancements create new ways to help research LENR and to comprehensively analyze the relationships between experimental parameters, materials, and outcomes across diverse LENR research endeavors worldwide. This study explores and investigates the effectiveness of modern AI capabilities leveraging embedding models and topic modeling techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and Top2Vec, in elucidating the underlying structure and prevalent themes within a large LENR research corpus. These methodologies offer unique perspectives on understanding relationships and trends within the LENR research landscape, thereby facilitating advancements in this crucial energy research area. Furthermore, the study presents LENRsim, an experimental machine learning tool to identify similar LENR studies, along with a user-friendly web interface for widespread adoption and utilization. The findings contribute to the understanding and progression of LENR research through data-driven analysis and tool development, enabling more informed decision-making and strategic planning for future research in this field. The insights derived from this study, along with the experimental tools we developed and deployed, hold the potential to significantly aid researchers in advancing their studies of LENR.},

  abstract     = {The development of computer technology has revolutionized how people live and interact in society. The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to transform healthcare delivery. Artificial intelligence has been used to improve the IoMT. Despite the significance of bibliometric analysis in a research area, to the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, based on searches conducted in academic databases, no bibliometric analysis on artificial intelligence (AI) for the IoMT has been conducted. To address this gap, this study proposes performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of AI applications in the IoMT. A bibliometric analysis of top literature sources, main disciplines, countries, prolific authors, trending topics, authorship, citations, author-keywords, and co-keywords was conducted. In addition, the structural development of AI in the IoMT highlights its growing popularity. This study found that security and privacy issues are serious concerns hindering the massive adoption of the IoMT. Future research directions on the IoMT, including perspectives on artificial general intelligence, generative artificial intelligence, and explainable artificial intelligence, have been outlined and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Survival prediction integrates patient-specific molecular information and clinical signatures to forecast the anticipated time of an event, such as recurrence, death, or disease progression. Survival prediction proves valuable in guiding treatment decisions, optimizing resource allocation, and interventions of precision medicine. The wide range of diseases, the existence of various variants within the same disease, and the reliance on available data necessitate disease-specific computational survival predictors. The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in crafting survival predictors has undoubtedly revolutionized this field. However, the ever-increasing demand for more sophisticated and effective prediction models necessitates the continued creation of innovative advancements. To catalyze these advancements, it is crucial to bring existing survival predictors knowledge and insights into a centralized platform. The paper in hand thoroughly examines 23 existing review studies and provides a concise overview of their scope and limitations. Focusing on a comprehensive set of 90 most recent survival predictors across 44 diverse diseases, it delves into insights of diverse types of methods that are used in the development of disease-specific predictors. This exhaustive analysis encompasses the utilized data modalities along with a detailed analysis of subsets of clinical features, feature engineering methods, and the specific statistical, machine or deep learning approaches that have been employed. It also provides insights about survival prediction data sources, open-source predictors, and survival prediction frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis also referred to as opinion mining, plays a significant role in automating the identification of negative, positive, or neutral sentiments expressed in textual data. The proliferation of social networks, review sites, and blogs has rendered these platforms valuable resources for mining opinions. Sentiment analysis finds applications in various domains and languages, including English and Arabic. However, Arabic presents unique challenges due to its complex morphology characterized by inflectional and derivation patterns. To effectively analyze sentiment in Arabic text, sentiment analysis techniques must account for this intricacy. This paper proposes a model designed using the transformer model and deep learning (DL) techniques. The word embedding is represented by Transformer-based Model for Arabic Language Understanding (ArabBert), and then passed to the AraBERT model. The output of AraBERT is subsequently fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, followed by feedforward neural networks and an output layer. AraBERT is used to capture rich contextual information and LSTM to enhance sequence modeling and retain long-term dependencies within the text data. We compared the proposed model with machine learning (ML) algorithms and DL algorithms, as well as different vectorization techniques: term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), ArabBert, Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), and skipGrams using four Arabic benchmark datasets. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation of Arabic sentiment analysis datasets, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach. The results underscore significant improvements in sentiment analysis accuracy, highlighting the potential of leveraging transformer models for Arabic Sentiment Analysis. The outcomes of this research contribute to advancing Arabic sentiment analysis, enabling more accurate and reliable sentiment analysis in Arabic text. The findings reveal that the proposed framework exhibits exceptional performance in sentiment classification, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of over 97%.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe deep echo state network (Deep-ESN) architecture, which comprises a multi-layered reservoir layer, exhibits superior performance compared to conventional echo state networks (ESNs) owing to the divergent layer-specific time-scale responses in the Deep-ESN. Although researchers have attempted to use experimental trial-and-error grid searches and Bayesian optimization methods to adjust the hyperparameters, suitable guidelines for setting hyperparameters to adjust the time scale of the dynamics in each layer from the perspective of dynamical characteristics have not been established. In this context, we hypothesized that evaluating the dependence of the multi-time-scale dynamical response on the leaking rate as a typical hyperparameter of the time scale in each neuron would help to achieve a guideline for optimizing the hyperparameters of the Deep-ESN.MethodFirst, we set several leaking rates for each layer of the Deep-ESN and performed multi-scale entropy (MSCE) analysis to analyze the impact of the leaking rate on the dynamics in each layer. Second, we performed layer-by-layer cross-correlation analysis between adjacent layers to elucidate the structural mechanisms to enhance the performance.ResultsAs a result, an optimum task-specific leaking rate value for producing layer-specific multi-time-scale responses and a queue structure with layer-to-layer signal transmission delays for retaining past applied input enhance the Deep-ESN prediction performance.DiscussionThese findings can help to establish ideal design guidelines for setting the hyperparameters of Deep-ESNs.},

  abstract     = {Simplifying summaries of scholarly publications has been a popular method for conveying scientific discoveries to a broader audience. While text summarization aims to shorten long documents, simplification seeks to reduce the complexity of a document. To accomplish these tasks collectively, there is a need to develop machine learning methods to shorten and simplify longer texts. This study presents a new Simplification Aware Text Summarization model (SATS) based on future n-gram prediction. The proposed SATS model extends ProphetNet, a text summarization model, by enhancing the objective function using a word frequency lexicon for simplification tasks. We have evaluated the performance of SATS on a recently published text summarization and simplification corpus consisting of 5,400 scientific article pairs. Our results in terms of automatic evaluation demonstrate that SATS outperforms state-of-the-art models for simplification, summarization, and joint simplification-summarization across two datasets on ROUGE, SARI, and CSS1. We also provide human evaluation of summaries generated by the SATS model. We evaluated 100 summaries from eight annotators for grammar, coherence, consistency, fluency, and simplicity. The average human judgment for all evaluated dimensions lies between 4.0 and 4.5 on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 means low and 5 means high.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on a rescue mission problem, particularly enabling agents/robots to navigate efficiently in unknown environments. Technological advances, including manufacturing, sensing, and communication systems, have raised interest in using robots or drones for rescue operations. Effective rescue operations require quick identification of changes in the environment and/or locating the victims/injuries as soon as possible. Several techniques have been developed in recent years for autonomy in rescue missions, including motion planning, adaptive control, and more recently, reinforcement learning techniques. These techniques rely on full knowledge of the environment or the availability of simulators that can represent real environments during rescue operations. However, in practice, agents might have little or no information about the environment or the number or locations of injuries, preventing/limiting the application of most existing techniques. This study provides a probabilistic/Bayesian representation of the unknown environment, which jointly models the stochasticity in the agent&#39;s navigation and the environment uncertainty into a vector called the belief state. This belief state allows offline learning of the optimal Bayesian policy in an unknown environment without the need for any real data/interactions, which guarantees taking actions that are optimal given all available information. To address the large size of belief space, deep reinforcement learning is developed for computing an approximate Bayesian planning policy. The numerical experiments using different maze problems demonstrate the high performance of the proposed policy.},

  abstract     = {Since the advent of deep learning (DL), the field has witnessed a continuous stream of innovations. However, the translation of these advancements into practical applications has not kept pace, particularly in safety-critical domains where artificial intelligence (AI) must meet stringent regulatory and ethical standards. This is underscored by the ongoing research in eXplainable AI (XAI) and privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), which seek to address some limitations associated with these opaque and data-intensive models. Despite brisk research activity in both fields, little attention has been paid to their interaction. This work is the first to thoroughly investigate the effects of privacy-preserving techniques on explanations generated by common XAI methods for DL models. A detailed experimental analysis is conducted to quantify the impact of private training on the explanations provided by DL models, applied to six image datasets and five time series datasets across various domains. The analysis comprises three privacy techniques, nine XAI methods, and seven model architectures. The findings suggest non-negligible changes in explanations through the implementation of privacy measures. Apart from reporting individual effects of PPML on XAI, the paper gives clear recommendations for the choice of techniques in real applications. By unveiling the interdependencies of these pivotal technologies, this research marks an initial step toward resolving the challenges that hinder the deployment of AI in safety-critical settings.},

While social science research indicates that individual differences play a crucial role in peoples&#39; nudgeability, there has been little research examining computational approaches that explore how individual differences affect user responses to nudges (especially in a learning context). Two studies were conducted to explore how individual differences, specifically focusing on personality, can affect nudge response in the context of healthcare education, where individuals use resources as a part of their informal learning and professional development. Different nudges, designed based on personality characteristics, were provided to draw individual users&#39; attention to educational resources to encourage user engagement. The findings indicate that personality insights can be a predictor for nudge selection, suggesting that different nudges may be more effective when recommending learning resources to people with different personality characteristics.},

This study introduces a novel approach to human activity recognition (HAR) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for individual sensor types to enhance the accuracy and address the challenge of diverse data shapes from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and barometers. Specific CNN models are constructed for each sensor type, enabling them to capture the characteristics of their respective sensors. These adapted CNNs are designed to effectively process varying data shapes and sensor-specific characteristics to accurately classify a wide range of human activities. The late-fusion technique is employed to combine predictions from various models to obtain comprehensive estimates of human activity. The proposed CNN-based approach is compared to a standard support vector machine (SVM) classifier using the one-vs-rest methodology. The late-fusion CNN model showed significantly improved performance, with validation and final test accuracies of 99.35 and 94.83% compared to the conventional SVM classifier at 87.07 and 83.10%, respectively. These findings provide strong evidence that combining multiple sensors and a barometer and utilizing an additional filter algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of identifying different human movement patterns.},

Time-to-event machine learning models utilizing self-reported questionnaires or existing data (e.g., electronic health records) may aid in creating efficient risk screening tools.MethodsA total of 4,222 U.S. Army Service members completed a self-report MSKI risk screen as part of their unit&#39;s standard in-processing. Additionally, participants&#39; MSKI and demographic data were abstracted from electronic health record data. Survival machine learning models (Cox proportional hazard regression (COX), COX with splines, conditional inference trees, and random forest) were deployed to develop a predictive model on the training data (75%; n = 2,963) for MSKI risk over varying time horizons (30, 90, 180, and 365 days) and were evaluated on the testing data (25%; n = 987). Probability of predicted risk (0.00–1.00) from the final model stratified Service members into quartiles based on MSKI risk.ResultsThe COX model demonstrated the best model performance over the time horizons. The time-dependent area under the curve ranged from 0.73 to 0.70 at 30 and 180 days. The index prediction accuracy (IPA) was 12% better at 180 days than the IPA of the null model (0 variables). Within the COX model, “other” race, more self-reported pain items during the movement screens, female gender, and prior MSKI demonstrated the largest hazard ratios. When predicted probability was binned into quartiles, at 180 days, the highest risk bin had an MSKI incidence rate of 2,130.82 ± 171.15 per 1,000 person-years and incidence rate ratio of 4.74 (95% confidence interval: 3.44, 6.54) compared to the lowest risk bin.ConclusionSelf-reported questionnaires and existing data can be used to create a machine learning algorithm to identify Service members&#39; MSKI risk profiles. Further research should develop more granular Service member-specific MSKI screening tools and create MSKI risk mitigation strategies based on these screenings.},

Optimization techniques can be employed to optimize the choice of network structure based not only on loss and accuracy but also on physical constraints. Additionally, constraints can be imposed during training to enhance the performance of networks in specific contexts. This study surveys the literature on the integration of constrained optimization with deep networks. Specifically, we examine the integration of hyper-parameter tuning with physical constraints, such as the number of FLOPS (FLoating point Operations Per Second), a measure of computational capacity, latency, and other factors. This study also considers the use of context-specific knowledge constraints to improve network performance. We discuss the integration of constraints in neural architecture search (NAS), considering the problem as both a multi-objective optimization (MOO) challenge and through the imposition of penalties in the loss function. Furthermore, we explore various approaches that integrate logic with deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we examine logic-neural integration through constrained optimization applied during the training of NNs and the use of semantic loss, which employs the probabilistic output of the networks to enforce constraints on the output.},

  abstract     = {Time series is a typical data type in numerous domains; however, labeling large amounts of time series data can be costly and time-consuming. Learning effective representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging task. Contrastive learning stands out as a promising method to acquire representations of unlabeled time series data. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised time-series representation learning framework via Time-Frequency Fusion Contrasting (TF-FC) to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, TF-FC combines time-domain augmentation with frequency-domain augmentation to generate the diverse samples. For time-domain augmentation, the raw time series data pass through the time-domain augmentation bank (such as jitter, scaling, permutation, and masking) and get time-domain augmentation data. For frequency-domain augmentation, first, the raw time series undergoes conversion into frequency domain data following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Then, the frequency data passes through the frequency-domain augmentation bank (such as low pass filter, remove frequency, add frequency, and phase shift) and gets frequency-domain augmentation data. The fusion method of time-domain augmentation data and frequency-domain augmentation data is kernel PCA, which is useful for extracting nonlinear features in high-dimensional spaces. By capturing both the time and frequency domains of the time series, the proposed approach is able to extract more informative features from the data, enhancing the model&#39;s capacity to distinguish between different time series. To verify the effectiveness of the TF-FC method, we conducted experiments on four time series domain datasets (i.e., SleepEEG, HAR, Gesture, and Epilepsy). Experimental results show that TF-FC significantly improves in recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.},

  abstract     = {The identification of plant leaf diseases is crucial in precision agriculture, playing a pivotal role in advancing the modernization of agriculture. Timely detection and diagnosis of leaf diseases for preventive measures significantly contribute to enhancing both the quantity and quality of agricultural products, thereby fostering the in-depth development of precision agriculture. However, despite the rapid development of research on plant leaf disease identification, it still faces challenges such as insufficient agricultural datasets and the problem of deep learning-based disease identification models having numerous training parameters and insufficient accuracy. This paper proposes a plant leaf disease identification method based on improved SinGAN and improved ResNet34 to address the aforementioned issues. Firstly, an improved SinGAN called Reconstruction-Based Single Image Generation Network (ReSinGN) is proposed for image enhancement. This network accelerates model training speed by using an autoencoder to replace the GAN in the SinGAN and incorporates a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the autoencoder to more accurately capture important features and structural information in the images. Random pixel Shuffling are introduced in ReSinGN to enable the model to learn richer data representations, further enhancing the quality of generated images. Secondly, an improved ResNet34 is proposed for plant leaf disease identification. This involves adding CBAM modules to the ResNet34 to alleviate the limitations of parameter sharing, replacing the ReLU activation function with LeakyReLU activation function to address the problem of neuron death, and utilizing transfer learning-based training methods to accelerate network training speed. This paper takes tomato leaf diseases as the experimental subject, and the experimental results demonstrate that: (1) ReSinGN generates high-quality images at least 44.6 times faster in training speed compared to SinGAN. (2) The Tenengrad score of images generated by the ReSinGN model is 67.3, which is improved by 30.2 compared to the SinGAN, resulting in clearer images. (3) ReSinGN model with random pixel Shuffling outperforms SinGAN in both image clarity and distortion, achieving the optimal balance between image clarity and distortion. (4) The improved ResNet34 achieved an average recognition accuracy, recognition precision, recognition accuracy (redundant as it’s similar to precision), recall, and F1 score of 98.57, 96.57, 98.68, 97.7, and 98.17%, respectively, for tomato leaf disease identification. Compared to the original ResNet34, this represents enhancements of 3.65, 4.66, 0.88, 4.1, and 2.47%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In oncology drug development, tumor dynamics modeling is widely applied to predict patients&#39; overall survival (OS) via parametric models. However, the current modeling paradigm, which assumes a disease-specific link between tumor dynamics and survival, has its limitations. This is particularly evident in drug development scenarios where the clinical trial under consideration contains patients with tumor types for which there is little to no prior institutional data. In this work, we propose the use of a pan-indication solid tumor machine learning (ML) approach whereby all three tumor metrics (tumor shrinkage rate, tumor regrowth rate and time to tumor growth) are simultaneously used to predict patients&#39; OS in a tumor type independent manner. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in a clinical trial of cancer patients treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, pralsetinib. We compared the parametric and ML models and the results showed that the proposed ML approach is able to adequately predict patient OS across RET-altered solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer as well as other solid tumors. While the findings of this study are promising, further research is needed for evaluating the generalizability of the ML model to other solid tumor types.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of surveillance technologies and identify commonalities and differences in perspectives among social media users and researchers. Data extraction was performed from two platforms: Scopus (for academic research papers) and platform X (formerly known as Twitter). The dataset included 88,989 tweets and 4,874 research papers. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning approach, was applied to analyze the content. The research results revealed that privacy received little attention across the datasets, indicating its relatively low prominence. The military applications and their usage have been documented in academic research articles as well as tweets. Based on the empirical evidence, it seems that contemporary surveillance technology may be accurately described as possessing a bi-directional nature, including both sousveillance and surveillance, which aligns with Deleuzian ideas on the Panopticon. The study’s findings also indicate that there was a greater level of interest in actual applications of surveillance technologies as opposed to more abstract concepts like ethics and privacy.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionBreast cancer is an extremely common and potentially fatal illness that impacts millions of women worldwide. Multiple criteria and inclinations must be taken into account when selecting the optimal treatment option for each patient.MethodsThe selection of breast cancer treatments can be modeled as a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem, in which a group of experts evaluate and rank alternative treatments based on multiple attributes. MAGDM methods can aid in enhancing the quality and efficacy of breast cancer treatment selection decisions. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of a 2-tuple linguistic interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (2TLIVq-ROFS), a new development in fuzzy set theory that incorporates the characteristics of interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (IVq-ROFS) and 2-tuple linguistic terms. It can express the quantitative and qualitative aspects of uncertain information, as well as the decision-makers&#39; level of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.ResultsThen, the 2TLIVq-ROF weighted average (2TLIVq-ROFWA) operator and the 2TLIVq-ROF weighted geometric (2TLIVq-ROFWJ) operator are introduced as two new aggregation operators. In addition, the multi-attribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method is extended to solve the MAGDM problem with 2TLIVq-ROF information.DiscussionTo demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of the suggested model, a case study of selecting the optimal breast cancer treatment is presented. The results of the computations show that the suggested MAGDM model is able to handle imprecision and subjectivity in complicated decision-making scenarios and opens new research scenarios for scholars.},

  abstract     = {The health inequalities experienced by ethnic minorities have been a persistent and global phenomenon. The diagnosis of different types of skin conditions, e.g., melanoma, among people of color is one of such health domains where misdiagnosis can take place, potentially leading to life-threatening consequences. Although Caucasians are more likely to be diagnosed with melanoma, African Americans are four times more likely to present stage IV melanoma due to delayed diagnosis. It is essential to recognize that additional factors such as socioeconomic status and limited access to healthcare services can be contributing factors. African Americans are also 1.5 times more likely to die from melanoma than Caucasians, with 5-year survival rates for African Americans significantly lower than for Caucasians (72.2% vs. 89.6%). This is a complex problem compounded by several factors: ill-prepared medical practitioners, lack of awareness of melanoma and other skin conditions among people of colour, lack of information and medical resources for practitioners’ continuous development, under-representation of people of colour in research, POC being a notoriously hard to reach group, and ‘whitewashed’ medical school curricula. Whilst digital technology can bring new hope for the reduction of health inequality, the deployment of artificial intelligence in healthcare carries risks that may amplify the health disparities experienced by people of color, whilst digital technology may provide a false sense of participation. For instance, Derm Assist, a skin diagnosis phone application which is under development, has already been criticized for relying on data from a limited number of people of color. This paper focuses on understanding the problem of misdiagnosing skin conditions in people of color and exploring the progress and innovations that have been experimented with, to pave the way to the possible application of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and user-centred technology to reduce health inequalities among people of color.},

  abstract     = {While encrypting information with color images, most encryption schemes treat color images as three different grayscale planes and encrypt each plane individually. These algorithms produce more duplicated operations and are less efficient because they do not properly account for the link between the various planes of color images. In addressing the issue, we propose a scheme that thoroughly takes into account the relationship between pixels across different planes in color images. First, we introduce a new 1D chaotic system. The performance analysis shows the system has good chaotic randomness. Next, we employ a shortest-path cross-plane scrambling algorithm that utilizes an enhanced Dijkstra algorithm. This algorithm effectively shuffles pixels randomly within each channel of a color image. To accomplish cross-plane diffusion, our approach is then integrated into the adaptive diffusion algorithm. The security analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the approach can tackle the issue of picture loss in telemedicine by encrypting color images without any loss of quality. Furthermore, the images we utilize are suitable for both standard RGB and medical images. They incorporate more secure and highly sensitive keys, robustly withstanding various typical ciphertext analysis attacks. This ensures a reliable solution for encrypting original images.},

  abstract     = {The European Union and some of its institutions have taken significant steps to address the challenges posed by the development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various contexts. The ubiquity of AI applications in everyday life, affecting both citizens and professionals, has made AI a common topic of discussion. However, as is evident from the documents analyzed here, concerns have been raised about the possible negative social consequences of AI, in particular discriminatory bias, making it a particularly relevant issue if people-centred, rights-based AI is to be implemented. This article aims to examine the challenges of defining, identifying and mitigating discriminatory bias in AI systems from two perspectives: (1) to conduct an ethical and normative review of European Commission documents from the last 8 years (from GDPR to AI Act regulation); and (2) to expose recommendations for key stakeholders, including designers, end-users and public authorities, to minimize/mitigate this risk. The document review was carried out on 21 EU regulatory and ethical guidelines in the field of AI, from which 152 measures were extracted, differentiated between design, governance and organizational measures. It has also been observed that there is no clear conceptual framework on the issue at the European level, showing a clear problem in providing definitions of algorithmic bias and discrimination, but not in assessing their potential negative impact on individuals. Secondly, these gaps may affect the concreteness and detail of the possible mitigation/minimization measures proposed and, subsequently, their application in different contexts. Finally, the last section of this paper presents a brief discussion and conclusions on possible issues related to the implementation of the measures extracted and certain limitations of the study.},

We developed two sophisticated algorithms based on deep learning techniques, DCNN and VGG19. By optimizing the hyperparameters of our models, we analyze context and body language to improve our understanding of human emotions in images. We merge the 26 discrete emotional categories with the three continuous emotional dimensions to identify emotions in context.

  abstract     = {IntroductionOsteoporosis, characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), is an increasingly serious public health issue. So far, several traditional regression models and machine learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed for predicting osteoporosis risk. However, these models have shown relatively low accuracy in clinical implementation. Recently proposed deep learning (DL) approaches, such as deep neural network (DNN), which can discover knowledge from complex hidden interactions, offer a new opportunity to improve predictive performance. In this study, we aimed to assess whether DNN can achieve a better performance in osteoporosis risk prediction.MethodsBy utilizing hip BMD and extensive demographic and routine clinical data of 8,134 subjects with age more than 40 from the Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS), we developed and constructed a novel DNN framework for predicting osteoporosis risk and compared its performance in osteoporosis risk prediction with four conventional ML models, namely random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM), as well as a traditional regression model termed osteoporosis self-assessment tool (OST). Model performance was assessed by area under ‘receiver operating curve’ (AUC) and accuracy.ResultsBy using 16 discriminative variables, we observed that the DNN approach achieved the best predictive performance (AUC = 0.848) in classifying osteoporosis (hip BMD T-score ≤ −1.0) and non-osteoporosis risk (hip BMD T-score &amp;gt; −1.0) subjects, compared to the other approaches. Feature importance analysis showed that the top 10 most important variables identified by the DNN model were weight, age, gender, grip strength, height, beer drinking, diastolic pressure, alcohol drinking, smoke years, and economic level. Furthermore, we performed subsampling analysis to assess the effects of varying number of sample size and variables on the predictive performance of these tested models. Notably, we observed that the DNN model performed equally well (AUC = 0.846) even by utilizing only the top 10 most important variables for osteoporosis risk prediction. Meanwhile, the DNN model can still achieve a high predictive performance (AUC = 0.826) when sample size was reduced to 50% of the original dataset.ConclusionIn conclusion, we developed a novel DNN model which was considered to be an effective algorithm for early diagnosis and intervention of osteoporosis in the aging population.},

  abstract     = {Cardiac disease is considered as the one of the deadliest diseases that constantly increases the globe’s mortality rate. Since a lot of expertise is required for an accurate prediction of heart disease, designing an intelligent predictive system for cardiac diseases remains to be complex and tricky. Internet of Things based health regulation systems are a relatively recent technology. In addition, novel Edge and Fog device concepts are presented to advance prediction results. However, the main problem with the current systems is that they are unable to meet the demands of effective diagnosis systems due to their poor prediction capabilities. To overcome this problem, this research proposes a novel framework called HAWKFOGS which innovatively integrates the deep learning for a practical diagnosis of cardiac problems using edge and fog computing devices. The current datasets were gathered from different subjects using IoT devices interfaced with the electrocardiography and blood pressure sensors. The data are then predicted as normal and abnormal using the Logistic Chaos based Harris Hawk Optimized Enhanced Gated Recurrent Neural Networks. The ablation experiments are carried out using IoT nodes interfaced with medical sensors and fog gateways based on Embedded Jetson Nano devices. The suggested algorithm’s performance is measured. Additionally, Model Building Time is computed to validate the suggested model’s response. Compared to the other algorithms, the suggested model yielded the best results in terms of accuracy (99.7%), precision (99.65%), recall (99.7%), specificity (99.7%). F1-score (99.69%) and used the least amount of Model Building Time (1.16 s) to predict cardiac diseases.},

As they can lead to malfunctions and other anomalous behavior, which may be safety-critical in many scenarios, detecting and analyzing concept drift is crucial. In this study, we provide a literature review focusing on concept drift in unsupervised data streams. While many surveys focus on supervised data streams, so far, there is no work reviewing the unsupervised setting. However, this setting is of particular relevance for monitoring and anomaly detection which are directly applicable to many tasks and challenges in engineering. This survey provides a taxonomy of existing work on unsupervised drift detection. In addition to providing a comprehensive literature review, it offers precise mathematical definitions of the considered problems and contains standardized experiments on parametric artificial datasets allowing for a direct comparison of different detection strategies. Thus, the suitability of different schemes can be analyzed systematically, and guidelines for their usage in real-world scenarios can be provided.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundCarotid plaques are major risk factors for stroke. Carotid ultrasound can help to assess the risk and incidence rate of stroke. However, large-scale carotid artery screening is time-consuming and laborious, the diagnostic results inevitably involve the subjectivity of the diagnostician to a certain extent. Deep learning demonstrates the ability to solve the aforementioned challenges. Thus, we attempted to develop an automated algorithm to provide a more consistent and objective diagnostic method and to identify the presence and stability of carotid plaques using deep learning.MethodsA total of 3,860 ultrasound images from 1,339 participants who underwent carotid plaque assessment between January 2021 and March 2023 at the Shanghai Eighth People’s Hospital were divided into a 4:1 ratio for training and internal testing. The external test included 1,564 ultrasound images from 674 participants who underwent carotid plaque assessment between January 2022 and May 2023 at Xinhua Hospital affiliated with Dalian University. Deep learning algorithms, based on the fusion of a bilinear convolutional neural network with a residual neural network (BCNN-ResNet), were used for modeling to detect carotid plaques and assess plaque stability. We chose AUC as the main evaluation index, along with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as auxiliary evaluation indices.ResultsModeling for detecting carotid plaques involved training and internal testing on 1,291 ultrasound images, with 617 images showing plaques and 674 without plaques. The external test comprised 470 ultrasound images, including 321 images with plaques and 149 without. Modeling for assessing plaque stability involved training and internal testing on 764 ultrasound images, consisting of 494 images with unstable plaques and 270 with stable plaques. The external test was composed of 279 ultrasound images, including 197 images with unstable plaques and 82 with stable plaques. For the task of identifying the presence of carotid plaques, our model achieved an AUC of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.840, 0.998) with a sensitivity of 93.2% and a specificity of 99.21% on the internal test. On the external test, the AUC was 0.951 (95% CI: 0.962, 0.939) with a sensitivity of 95.3% and a specificity of 82.24%. For the task of identifying the stability of carotid plaques, our model achieved an AUC of 0.896 (95% CI: 0.865, 0.922) on the internal test with a sensitivity of 81.63% and a specificity of 87.27%. On the external test, the AUC was 0.854 (95% CI: 0.889, 0.830) with a sensitivity of 68.52% and a specificity of 89.49%.ConclusionDeep learning using BCNN-ResNet algorithms based on routine ultrasound images could be useful for detecting carotid plaques and assessing plaque instability.},

  abstract     = {Background and noveltyWhen RT-PCR is ineffective in early diagnosis and understanding of COVID-19 severity, Computed Tomography (CT) scans are needed for COVID diagnosis, especially in patients having high ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. Radiologists find the manual method for lesion detection in CT very challenging and tedious. Previously solo deep learning (SDL) was tried but they had low to moderate-level performance. This study presents two new cloud-based quantized deep learning UNet3+ hybrid (HDL) models, which incorporated full-scale skip connections to enhance and improve the detections.MethodologyAnnotations from expert radiologists were used to train one SDL (UNet3+), and two HDL models, namely, VGG-UNet3+ and ResNet-UNet3+. For accuracy, 5-fold cross-validation protocols, training on 3,500 CT scans, and testing on unseen 500 CT scans were adopted in the cloud framework. Two kinds of loss functions were used: Dice Similarity (DS) and binary cross-entropy (BCE). Performance was evaluated using (i) Area error, (ii) DS, (iii) Jaccard Index, (iii) Bland–Altman, and (iv) Correlation plots.ResultsAmong the two HDL models, ResNet-UNet3+ was superior to UNet3+ by 17 and 10% for Dice and BCE loss. The models were further compressed using quantization showing a percentage size reduction of 66.76, 36.64, and 46.23%, respectively, for UNet3+, VGG-UNet3+, and ResNet-UNet3+. Its stability and reliability were proved by statistical tests such as the Mann–Whitney, Paired t-Test, Wilcoxon test, and Friedman test all of which had a p &amp;lt; 0.001.ConclusionFull-scale skip connections of UNet3+ with VGG and ResNet in HDL framework proved the hypothesis showing powerful results improving the detection accuracy of COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundWhile Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered positively with respect to technological progress and abilities, people are rather opposed to machines making moral decisions. But the circumstances under which algorithm aversion or algorithm appreciation are more likely to occur with respect to LLMs have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how texts with moral or technological topics, allegedly written either by a human author or by ChatGPT, are perceived.MethodsIn a randomized controlled experiment, n = 164 participants read six texts, three of which had a moral and three a technological topic (predictor text topic). The alleged author of each text was randomly either labeled “ChatGPT” or “human author” (predictor authorship). We captured three dependent variables: assessment of author competence, assessment of content quality, and participants&#39; intention to submit the text in a hypothetical university course (sharing intention). We hypothesized interaction effects, that is, we expected ChatGPT to score lower than alleged human authors for moral topics and higher than alleged human authors for technological topics and vice versa.ResultsWe only found a small interaction effect for perceived author competence, p = 0.004, d = 0.40, but not for the other dependent variables. However, ChatGPT was consistently devalued compared to alleged human authors across all dependent variables: there were main effects of authorship for assessment of the author competence, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.95; for assessment of content quality, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.39; as well as for sharing intention, p &amp;lt; 0.001, d = 0.57. There was also a small main effect of text topic on the assessment of text quality, p = 0.002, d = 0.35.ConclusionThese results are more in line with previous findings on algorithm aversion than with algorithm appreciation. We discuss the implications of these findings for the acceptance of the use of LLMs for text composition.},

  abstract     = {Crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) produce sounds as a natural means to communicate and convey various behaviors and activities, including mating, feeding, aggression, distress, and more. These vocalizations are intricately linked to prevailing environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. By accurately monitoring, identifying, and appropriately addressing these behaviors and activities, the farming and production of crickets can be enhanced. This research implemented a decision support system that leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms to decode and classify cricket songs, along with their associated key weather variables (temperature and humidity). Videos capturing cricket behavior and weather variables were recorded. From these videos, sound signals were extracted and classified such as calling, aggression, and courtship. Numerical and image features were extracted from the sound signals and combined with the weather variables. The extracted numerical features, i.e., Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, and chroma, were used to train shallow (support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest (RF)) ML algorithms. While image features, i.e., spectrograms, were used to train different state-of-the-art deep ML models, i,e., convolutional neural network architectures (ResNet152V2, VGG16, and EfficientNetB4). In the deep ML category, ResNet152V2 had the best accuracy of 99.42%. The RF algorithm had the best accuracy of 95.63% in the shallow ML category when trained with a combination of MFCC+chroma and after feature selection. In descending order of importance, the top 6 ranked features in the RF algorithm were, namely humidity, temperature, C#, mfcc11, mfcc10, and D. From the selected features, it is notable that temperature and humidity are necessary for growth and metabolic activities in insects. Moreover, the songs produced by certain cricket species naturally align to musical tones such as C# and D as ranked by the algorithm. Using this knowledge, a decision support system was built to guide farmers about the optimal temperature and humidity ranges and interpret the songs (calling, aggression, and courtship) in relation to weather variables. With this information, farmers can put in place suitable measures such as temperature regulation, humidity control, addressing aggressors, and other relevant interventions to minimize or eliminate losses and enhance cricket production.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a notable integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into mine ventilation systems. A mine ventilation network presents a complex system with numerous interconnected processes, some of which pose challenges for deterministic simulation methods. The utilization of machine learning techniques and evolutionary algorithms offers a promising avenue to address these complexities, resulting in enhanced monitoring and control of air parameter distribution within the ventilation network. These methods facilitate the timely identification of resistance faults and enable prompt calculation of ventilation parameters during emergency scenarios, such as underground explosions and fires. Furthermore, evolutionary algorithms play a crucial role in the advancement of methods for visual analysis of ventilation systems. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the current utilization of AI technologies in mine ventilation is limited and does not encompass the full spectrum of challenging-to-formalize problems. Promising areas for AI application include analyzing changes in air distribution caused by unaccounted thermal draft and gas pressure, as well as developing novel approaches for calculating shock losses. Moreover, the application of AI technologies in optimizing large-scale mine ventilation networks remains an unresolved issue. Addressing these challenges holds significant potential for enhancing safety and efficiency in mine ventilation systems.},

  abstract     = {In this study we test ChatGPT-4’s ability to provide accurate information about the origins and evolution of SWOT analysis, perhaps the most widely used strategy tool in practice worldwide. ChatGPT-4 is tested for historical accuracy and hallucinations. The API is prompted using a Python script with a series of structured questions from an Excel file and the results are recorded in another Excel file and rated on a binary scale. Our findings present a nuanced view of ChatGPT-4’s capabilities. We observe that while ChatGPT-4 demonstrates a high level of proficiency in describing and outlining the general concept of SWOT analysis, there are notable discrepancies when it comes to detailing its origins and evolution. These inaccuracies range from minor factual errors to more serious hallucinations that deviate from evidence in scholarly publications. However, we also find that ChatGPT-4 comes up with spontaneous historically accurate facts. Our interpretation of the result is that ChatGPT is largely trained on easily available websites and to a very limited extent has been trained on scholarly publications on SWOT analysis, especially when these are behind a paywall. We conclude with four propositions for future research.},

  abstract     = {Active learning is a field of machine learning that seeks to find the most efficient labels to annotate with a given budget, particularly in cases where obtaining labeled data is expensive or infeasible. This is becoming increasingly important with the growing success of learning-based methods, which often require large amounts of labeled data. Computer vision is one area where active learning has shown promise in tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. In this research, we propose a pool-based semi-supervised active learning method for image classification that takes advantage of both labeled and unlabeled data. Many active learning approaches do not utilize unlabeled data, but we believe that incorporating these data can improve performance. To address this issue, our method involves several steps. First, we cluster the latent space of a pre-trained convolutional autoencoder. Then, we use a proposed clustering contrastive loss to strengthen the latent space&#39;s clustering while using a small amount of labeled data. Finally, we query the samples with the highest uncertainty to annotate with an oracle. We repeat this process until the end of the given budget. Our method is effective when the number of annotated samples is small, and we have validated its effectiveness through experiments on benchmark datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the power of our method for image classification tasks in accuracy terms.},

I will show, on one hand, equipping AI-DSS with emotional capabilities offers great opportunities, as they open the possibility to prevent emotionally biased decisions – but that it also amplifies the ethical challenges already posed by emotionally-incapable AI-DSS. Yet, if their introduction is accompanied by a broad social discourse and prepared by suitable measures to address these challenges, I argue, nothing should fundamentally stand in the way of equipping AI-DSS with emotional capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Hate speech detection in Arabic poses a complex challenge due to the dialectal diversity across the Arab world. Most existing hate speech datasets for Arabic cover only one dialect or one hate speech category. They also lack balance across dialects, topics, and hate/non-hate classes. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting ADHAR—a comprehensive multi-dialect, multi-category hate speech corpus for Arabic. ADHAR contains 70,369 words and spans four language variants: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), Egyptian, Levantine, Gulf and Maghrebi. It covers four key hate speech categories: nationality, religion, ethnicity, and race. A major contribution is that ADHAR is carefully curated to maintain balance across dialects, categories, and hate/non-hate classes to enable unbiased dataset evaluation. We describe the systematic data collection methodology, followed by a rigorous annotation process involving multiple annotators per dialect. Extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate the quality and usefulness of ADHAR. Our experiments with various classical and deep learning models demonstrate that our dataset enables the development of robust hate speech classifiers for Arabic, achieving accuracy and F1-scores of up to 90% for hate speech detection and up to 92% for category detection. When trained with Arabert, we achieved an accuracy and F1-score of 94% for hate speech detection, as well as 95% for the category detection.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates the application of machine learning to improve the diagnosis of tinnitus using high-frequency audiometry data. A Logistic Regression (LR) model was developed alongside an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and various baseline classifiers to identify the most effective approach for classifying tinnitus presence. The methodology encompassed data preprocessing, feature extraction focused on point detection, and rigorous model evaluation through performance metrics including accuracy, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1 scores. The main findings reveal that the LR model, supported by the ANN, significantly outperformed other machine learning models, achieving an accuracy of 94.06%, an AUC of 97.06%, and high precision and recall scores. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the LR model and ANN in accurately diagnosing tinnitus, surpassing traditional diagnostic methods that rely on subjective assessments. The implications of this research are substantial for clinical audiology, suggesting that machine learning, particularly advanced models like ANNs, can provide a more objective and quantifiable tool for tinnitus diagnosis, especially when utilizing high-frequency audiometry data not typically assessed in standard hearing tests. The study underscores the potential for machine learning to facilitate earlier and more accurate tinnitus detection, which could lead to improved patient outcomes. Future work should aim to expand the dataset diversity, explore a broader range of algorithms, and conduct clinical trials to validate the models&#39; practical utility.

  abstract     = {Wetware computing and organoid intelligence is an emerging research field at the intersection of electrophysiology and artificial intelligence. The core concept involves using living neurons to perform computations, similar to how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used today. However, unlike ANNs, where updating digital tensors (weights) can instantly modify network responses, entirely new methods must be developed for neural networks using biological neurons. Discovering these methods is challenging and requires a system capable of conducting numerous experiments, ideally accessible to researchers worldwide. For this reason, we developed a hardware and software system that allows for electrophysiological experiments on an unmatched scale. The Neuroplatform enables researchers to run experiments on neural organoids with a lifetime of even more than 100 days. To do so, we streamlined the experimental process to quickly produce new organoids, monitor action potentials 24/7, and provide electrical stimulations. We also designed a microfluidic system that allows for fully automated medium flow and change, thus reducing the disruptions by physical interventions in the incubator and ensuring stable environmental conditions. Over the past three years, the Neuroplatform was utilized with over 1,000 brain organoids, enabling the collection of more than 18 terabytes of data. A dedicated Application Programming Interface (API) has been developed to conduct remote research directly via our Python library or using interactive compute such as Jupyter Notebooks. In addition to electrophysiological operations, our API also controls pumps, digital cameras and UV lights for molecule uncaging. This allows for the execution of complex 24/7 experiments, including closed-loop strategies and processing using the latest deep learning or reinforcement learning libraries. Furthermore, the infrastructure supports entirely remote use. Currently in 2024, the system is freely available for research purposes, and numerous research groups have begun using it for their experiments. This article outlines the system’s architecture and provides specific examples of experiments and results.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundThe most common Assisted Reproductive Technology is In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). During IVF, embryologists commonly perform a morphological assessment to evaluate embryo quality and choose the best embryo for transferring to the uterus. However, embryo selection through morphological assessment is subjective, so various embryologists obtain different conclusions. Furthermore, humans can consider only a limited number of visual parameters resulting in a poor IVF success rate. Artificial intelligence (AI) for embryo selection is objective and can include many parameters, leading to better IVF outcomes.ObjectivesThis study sought to use AI to (1) predict pregnancy results based on embryo images, (2) assess using more than one image of the embryo in the prediction of pregnancy but based on the current process in IVF labs, and (3) compare results of AI-Based methods and embryologist experts in predicting pregnancy.MethodsA data set including 252 Time-lapse Videos of embryos related to IVF performed between 2017 and 2020 was collected. Frames related to 19 ± 1, 43 ± 1, and 67 ± 1 h post-insemination were extracted. Well-Known CNN architectures with transfer learning have been applied to these images. The results have been compared with an algorithm that only uses the final image of embryos. Furthermore, the results have been compared with five experienced embryologists.ResultsTo predict the pregnancy outcome, we applied five well-known CNN architectures (AlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet34, Inception V3, and DenseNet121). DeepEmbryo, using three images, predicts pregnancy better than the algorithm that only uses one final image. It also can predict pregnancy better than all embryologists. Different well-known architectures can successfully predict pregnancy chances with up to 75.0% accuracy using Transfer Learning.ConclusionWe have developed DeepEmbryo, an AI-based tool that uses three static images to predict pregnancy. Additionally, DeepEmbryo uses images that can be obtained in the current IVF process in almost all IVF labs. AI-based tools have great potential for predicting pregnancy and can be used as a proper tool in the future.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionFine-grained, descriptive information on habitats and reproductive conditions of plant species are crucial in forest restoration and rehabilitation efforts. Precise timing of fruit collection and knowledge of species&#39; habitat preferences and reproductive status are necessary especially for tropical plant species that have short-lived recalcitrant seeds, and those that exhibit complex reproductive patterns, e.g., species with supra-annual mass flowering events that may occur in irregular intervals. Understanding plant regeneration in the way of planning for effective reforestation can be aided by providing access to structured information, e.g., in knowledge bases, that spans years if not decades as well as covering a wide range of geographic locations. The content of such a resource can be enriched with literature-derived information on species&#39; time-sensitive reproductive conditions and location-specific habitats.MethodsWe sought to develop unsupervised approaches to extract relationships pertaining to habitats and their locations, and reproductive conditions of plant species and corresponding temporal information. Firstly, we handcrafted rules for a traditional rule-based pattern matching approach. We then developed a relation extraction approach building upon transformer models, i.e., the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5), casting the relation extraction problem as a question answering and natural language inference task. We then propose a novel unsupervised hybrid approach that combines our rule-based and transformer-based approaches.ResultsEvaluation of our hybrid approach on an annotated corpus of biodiversity-focused documents demonstrated an improvement of up to 15 percentage points in recall and best performance over solely rule-based and transformer-based methods with F1-scores ranging from 89.61 to 96.75% for reproductive condition - temporal expression relations, and ranging from 85.39% to 89.90% for habitat - geographic location relations. Our work shows that even without training models on any domain-specific labeled dataset, we are able to extract relationships between biodiversity concepts from literature with satisfactory performance.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition characterized by persistent low mood, cognitive and physical symptoms, anhedonia (loss of interest in activities), and suicidal ideation. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts depression will become the leading cause of disability by 2030. While biological markers remain essential for understanding MDD&#39;s pathophysiology, recent advancements in social signal processing and environmental monitoring hold promise. Wearable technologies, including smartwatches and air purifiers with environmental sensors, can generate valuable digital biomarkers for depression assessment in real-world settings. Integrating these with existing physical, psychopathological, and other indices (autoimmune, inflammatory, neuroradiological) has the potential to improve MDD recurrence prevention strategies.MethodsThis prospective, randomized, interventional, and non-pharmacological integrated study aims to evaluate digital and environmental biomarkers in adolescents and young adults diagnosed with MDD who are currently taking medication. The study implements a sensor-integrated platform built around an open-source “Pothos” air purifier system. This platform is designed for scalability and integration with third-party devices. It accomplishes this through software interfaces, a dedicated app, sensor signal pre-processing, and an embedded deep learning AI system. The study will enroll two experimental groups (10 adolescents and 30 young adults each). Within each group, participants will be randomly allocated to Group A or Group B. Only Group B will receive the technological equipment (Pothos system and smartwatch) for collecting digital biomarkers. Blood and saliva samples will be collected at baseline (T0) and endpoint (T1) to assess inflammatory markers and cortisol levels.ResultsFollowing initial age-based stratification, the sample will undergo detailed classification at the 6-month follow-up based on remission status. Digital and environmental biomarker data will be analyzed to explore intricate relationships between these markers, depression symptoms, disease progression, and early signs of illness.ConclusionThis study seeks to validate an AI tool for enhancing early MDD clinical management, implement an AI solution for continuous data processing, and establish an AI infrastructure for managing healthcare Big Data. Integrating innovative psychophysical assessment tools into clinical practice holds significant promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and developing more specific digital devices for comprehensive mental health evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Perceptual measures, such as intelligibility and speech disorder severity, are widely used in the clinical assessment of speech disorders in patients treated for oral or oropharyngeal cancer. Despite their widespread usage, these measures are known to be subjective and hard to reproduce. Therefore, an M-Health assessment based on an automatic prediction has been seen as a more robust and reliable alternative. Despite recent progress, these automatic approaches still remain somewhat theoretical, and a need to implement them in real clinical practice rises. Hence, in the present work we introduce SAMI, a clinical mobile application used to predict speech intelligibility and disorder severity as well as to monitor patient progress on these measures over time. The first part of this work illustrates the design and development of the systems supported by SAMI. Here, we show how deep neural speaker embeddings are used to automatically regress speech disorder measurements (intelligibility and severity), as well as the training and validation of the system on a French corpus of head and neck cancer. Furthermore, we also test our model on a secondary corpus recorded in real clinical conditions. The second part details the results obtained from the deployment of our system in a real clinical environment, over the course of several weeks. In this section, the results obtained with SAMI are compared to an a posteriori perceptual evaluation, conducted by a set of experts on the new recorded data. The comparison suggests a high correlation and a low error between the perceptual and automatic evaluations, validating the clinical usage of the proposed application.},

While these systems are celebrated for their potential to enhance efficiency and objectivity, they also pose risks of perpetuating and amplifying societal biases and discrimination. This paper aims to provide an indepth analysis of the types of algorithmic discrimination, exploring both the challenges and potential solutions.MethodsThe methodology includes a systematic literature review, analysis of legal documents, and comparative case studies across different geographic regions and sectors. This multifaceted approach allows for a thorough exploration of the complexity of algorithmic bias and its regulation.ResultsWe identify five primary types of algorithmic bias: bias by algorithmic agents, discrimination based on feature selection, proxy discrimination, disparate impact, and targeted advertising. The analysis of the U.S. legal and regulatory framework reveals a landscape of principled regulations, preventive controls, consequential liability, self-regulation, and heteronomy regulation. A comparative perspective is also provided by examining the status of algorithmic fairness in the EU, Canada, Australia, and Asia.ConclusionReal-world impacts are demonstrated through case studies focusing on criminal risk assessments and hiring algorithms, illustrating the tangible effects of algorithmic discrimination. The paper concludes with recommendations for interdisciplinary research, proactive policy development, public awareness, and ongoing monitoring to promote fairness and accountability in algorithmic decision-making. As the use of AI and automated systems expands globally, this work highlights the importance of developing comprehensive, adaptive approaches to combat algorithmic discrimination and ensure the socially responsible deployment of these powerful technologies.},

Leveraging this intuition, we propose a novel approach to OOD detection using a diffusion model to discern images that deviate from the in-domain distribution. Our method involves training a diffusion model using in-domain images. At inference time, we lift an image from its original manifold using a masking process, and then apply a diffusion model to map it towards the in-domain manifold. We measure the distance between the original and mapped images, and identify those with a large distance as OOD. Our experiments encompass comprehensive evaluation across various datasets characterized by differences in color, semantics, and resolution. Our method demonstrates strong and consistent performance in detecting OOD images across the tested datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in handling images with diverse characteristics. Additionally, ablation studies confirm the significant contribution of each component in our framework to the overall performance.},

However, despite the field’s profound implications for the educational community, the social impact of this scientific production on digital social media remains unclear. To address this question, the present research has been proposed, aiming to analyze the social impact of scientific production on the use of Artificial Intelligence for emotions in the educational context. For this purpose, a sample of 243 scientific publications indexed in Scopus and Web of Science has been selected, from which a second sample of 6,094 social impact records has been extracted from Altmetric, Crossref, and PlumX databases. A dual analysis has been conducted using specially designed software: on one hand, the scientific sample has been analyzed from a bibliometric perspective, and on the other hand, the social impact records have been studied. Comparative analysis based on the two dimensions, scientific and social, has focused on the evolution of scientific production with its corresponding social impact, sources, impact, and content analysis. The results indicate that scientific publications have had a high social impact (with an average of 25.08 social impact records per publication), with a significant increase in research interest starting from 2019, likely driven by the emotional implications of measures taken to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, a lack of alignment has been identified between articles with the highest scientific impact and those with the highest social impact, as well as a lack of alignment in the most commonly used terms from both scientific and social perspectives, a significant variability in the lag in months for scientific research to make an impact on social media, and the fact that the social impact of the research did not emerge from the interest of Twitter users unaffiliated with the research, but rather from the authors, publishers, or scientific institutions. The proposed comparative methodology can be applied to any field of study, making it a useful tool given that current trends in accreditation agencies propose the analysis of the repercussion of scientific research in social media.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that affects the retina and causes vision loss due to blood vessel destruction. The retina is the layer of the eye responsible for visual processing and nerve signaling. Diabetic retinopathy causes vision loss, floaters, and sometimes blindness; however, it often shows no warning signals in the early stages. Deep learning-based techniques have emerged as viable options for automated illness classification as large-scale medical imaging datasets have become more widely available. To adapt to medical image analysis tasks, transfer learning makes use of pre-trained models to extract high-level characteristics from natural images. In this research, an intelligent recommendation-based fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model has been proposed for quick and precise assessment for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, which will help ophthalmologists in early diagnosis and detection. The proposed EfficientNetB0 model is compared with three transfer learning-based models, namely, ResNet152, VGG16, and DenseNet169. The experimental work is carried out using publicly available datasets from Kaggle consisting of 3,200 fundus images. Out of all the transfer learning models, the EfficientNetB0 model has outperformed with an accuracy of 0.91, followed by DenseNet169 with an accuracy of 0.90. In comparison to other approaches, the proposed intelligent recommendation-based fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 approach delivers state-of-the-art performance on the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score criteria. The system aims to assist ophthalmologists in early detection, potentially alleviating the burden on healthcare units.},

The complexity lies in devising a universally applicable solution due to computational demands and impracticality of exhaustive searches for optimal sequencing. To tackle this, our proposed algorithm employs a shortest path methodology grounded in semantic similarity between images. Tailored specifically for the real estate sector, it evaluates diverse similarity metrics to efficiently arrange images. Additionally, we introduce a genetic algorithm to optimize the selection of semantic features considered by the algorithm, further enhancing its effectiveness.ResultsEmpirical evidence from our dataset demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

We achieve this by adapting the Faster R-CNN to the few-shot learning scenario with two elegant components to effectively address the overfitting and category bias. First, an IOU-aware weight imprinting strategy is proposed to directly determine the classifier weights for incremental novel classes and the background class, which is with zero training to avoid the notorious overfitting issue in few-shot learning. Second, since the above zero-retraining imprinting approach may lead to undesired category bias in the classifier, we develop a bias correction module for iFSOD, named the group soft-max layer (GSL), that efficiently calibrates the biased prediction of the imprinted classifier to organically improve classification performance for the few-shot classes, preventing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO show that our method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art method ONCE by 5.9 points in commonly encountered few-shot classes.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is a gradually advancing neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a concealed onset. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an efficient hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), which regulates the concentration of ACh at synapses and then terminates ACh-mediated neurotransmission. There are inhibitors to inhibit the activity of AChE currently, but its side effects are inevitable. In various application fields where Al have gained prominence, neural network-based models for molecular design have recently emerged and demonstrate encouraging outcomes. However, in the conditional molecular generation task, most of the current generation models need additional optimization algorithms to generate molecules with intended properties which make molecular generation inefficient. Consequently, we introduce a cognitive-conditional molecular design model, termed PED, which leverages the variational auto-encoder. Its primary function is to adeptly produce a molecular library tailored for specific properties. From this library, we can then identify molecules that inhibit AChE activity without adverse effects. These molecules serve as lead compounds, hastening AD treatment and concurrently enhancing the AI&#39;s cognitive abilities. In this study, we aim to fine-tune a VAE model pre-trained on the ZINC database using active compounds of AChE collected from Binding DB. Different from other molecular generation models, the PED can simultaneously perform both property prediction and molecule generation, consequently, it can generate molecules with intended properties without additional optimization process. Experiments of evaluation show that proposed model performs better than other methods benchmarked on the same data sets. The results indicated that the model learns a good representation of potential chemical space, it can well generate molecules with intended properties. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirmed PED&#39;s efficiency and efficacy. Furthermore, we also verified the binding ability of molecules to AChE through molecular docking. The results showed that our molecular generation system for AD shows excellent cognitive capacities, the molecules within the molecular library could bind well to AChE and inhibit its activity, thus preventing the hydrolysis of ACh.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionBrain-inspired computing has become an emerging field, where a growing number of works focus on developing algorithms that bring machine learning closer to human brains at the functional level. As one of the promising directions, Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is centered around the idea of having holographic and high-dimensional representation as the neural activities in our brains. Such representation is the fundamental enabler for the efficiency and robustness of HDC. However, existing HDC-based algorithms suffer from limitations within the encoder. To some extent, they all rely on manually selected encoders, meaning that the resulting representation is never adapted to the tasks at hand.MethodsIn this paper, we propose FLASH, a novel hyperdimensional learning method that incorporates an adaptive and learnable encoder design, aiming at better overall learning performance while maintaining good properties of HDC representation. Current HDC encoders leverage Random Fourier Features (RFF) for kernel correspondence and enable locality-preserving encoding. We propose to learn the encoder matrix distribution via gradient descent and effectively adapt the kernel for a more suitable HDC encoding.ResultsOur experiments on various regression datasets show that tuning the HDC encoder can significantly boost the accuracy, surpassing the current HDC-based algorithm and providing faster inference than other baselines, including RFF-based kernel ridge regression.DiscussionThe results indicate the importance of an adaptive encoder and customized high-dimensional representation in HDC.},

  abstract     = {Building an investment portfolio is a problem that numerous researchers have addressed for many years. The key goal has always been to balance risk and reward by optimally allocating assets such as stocks, bonds, and cash. In general, the portfolio management process is based on three steps: planning, execution, and feedback, each of which has its objectives and methods to be employed. Starting from Markowitz&#39;s mean-variance portfolio theory, different frameworks have been widely accepted, which considerably renewed how asset allocation is being solved. Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide methodological and technological capabilities to solve highly complex problems, and investment portfolio is no exception. For this reason, the paper reviews the current state-of-the-art approaches by answering the core question of how artificial intelligence is transforming portfolio management steps. Moreover, as the use of artificial intelligence in finance is challenged by transparency, fairness and explainability requirements, the case study of post-hoc explanations for asset allocation is demonstrated. Finally, we discuss recent regulatory developments in the European investment business and highlight specific aspects of this business where explainable artificial intelligence could advance transparency of the investment process.},

ML has the potential to enhance prognostication in lung cancer patients and improve clinical decision-making. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the performance of ML models compared to logistic regression (LR) models in predicting overall survival in patients with lung cancer.MethodsWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases using a predefined search query. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select eligible studies. Risk of bias assessment was performed using predefined criteria. Data extraction was conducted using the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS) checklist. Meta-analytic analysis was performed to compare the discriminative ability of ML and LR models.ResultsThe literature search resulted in 3,635 studies, and 12 studies with a total of 211,068 patients were included in the analysis. Six studies reported confidence intervals and were included in the meta-analysis. The performance of ML models varied across studies, with C-statistics ranging from 0.60 to 0.85. The pooled analysis showed that ML models had higher discriminative ability compared to LR models, with a weighted average C-statistic of 0.78 for ML models compared to 0.70 for LR models.ConclusionMachine learning models show promise in predicting overall survival in patients with lung cancer, with superior discriminative ability compared to logistic regression models. However, further validation and standardization of ML models are needed before their widespread implementation in clinical practice. Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current literature, such as potential bias and heterogeneity among studies, to improve the accuracy and generalizability of ML models for predicting outcomes in patients with lung cancer. Further research and development of ML models in this field may lead to improved patient outcomes and personalized treatment strategies.},

India is commonly labeled as the “diabetes capital of the world” owing to the widespread prevalence of this condition. To the best of the authors&#39; last knowledge updated on September 2021, approximately 77 million adults in India were reported to be affected by diabetes, reported by the International Diabetes Federation. Owing to the concealed early symptoms, numerous diabetic patients go undiagnosed, leading to delayed treatment. While Computational Intelligence approaches have been utilized to improve the prediction rate, a significant portion of these methods lacks interpretability, primarily due to their inherent black box nature. Rule extraction is frequently utilized to elucidate the opaque nature inherent in machine learning algorithms. Moreover, to resolve the black box nature, a method for extracting strong rules based on Weighted Bayesian Association Rule Mining is used so that the extracted rules to diagnose any disease such as diabetes can be very transparent and easily analyzed by the clinical experts, enhancing the interpretability.

  abstract     = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fatal blood disorder characterized by the excessive proliferation of immature white blood cells, originating in the bone marrow. An effective prognosis and treatment of ALL calls for its accurate and timely detection. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in digital pathology. However, they face challenges in classifying different subtypes of leukemia due to their subtle morphological differences. This study proposes an improved pipeline for binary detection and sub-type classification of ALL from blood smear images. At first, a customized, 88 layers deep CNN is proposed and trained using transfer learning along with GoogleNet CNN to create an ensemble of features. Furthermore, this study models the feature selection problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposes a memetic version of binary whale optimization algorithm, incorporating Differential Evolution-based local search method to enhance the exploration and exploitation of feature search space. The proposed approach is validated using publicly available standard datasets containing peripheral blood smear images of various classes of ALL. An overall best average accuracy of 99.15% is achieved for binary classification of ALL with an 85% decrease in the feature vector, together with 99% precision and 98.8% sensitivity. For B-ALL sub-type classification, the best accuracy of 98.69% is attained with 98.7% precision and 99.57% specificity.

  abstract     = {Background and objectiveDue to the high prevalence of dental caries, fixed dental restorations are regularly required to restore compromised teeth or replace missing teeth while retaining function and aesthetic appearance. The fabrication of dental restorations, however, remains challenging due to the complexity of the human masticatory system as well as the unique morphology of each individual dentition. Adaptation and reworking are frequently required during the insertion of fixed dental prostheses (FDPs), which increase cost and treatment time. This article proposes a data-driven approach for the partial reconstruction of occlusal surfaces based on a data set that comprises 92 3D mesh files of full dental crown restorations.MethodsA Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is considered for the given task in view of its ability to represent extensive data sets in an unsupervised manner with a wide variety of applications. Having demonstrated good capabilities in terms of image quality and training stability, StyleGAN-2 has been chosen as the main network for generating the occlusal surfaces. A 2D projection method is proposed in order to generate 2D representations of the provided 3D tooth data set for integration with the StyleGAN architecture. The reconstruction capabilities of the trained network are demonstrated by means of 4 common inlay types using a Bayesian Image Reconstruction method. This involves pre-processing the data in order to extract the necessary information of the tooth preparations required for the used method as well as the modification of the initial reconstruction loss.ResultsThe reconstruction process yields satisfactory visual and quantitative results for all preparations with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.02 mm to 0.18 mm. When compared against a clinical procedure for CAD inlay fabrication, the group of dentists preferred the GAN-based restorations for 3 of the total 4 inlay geometries.ConclusionsThis article shows the effectiveness of the StyleGAN architecture with a downstream optimization process for the reconstruction of 4 different inlay geometries. The independence of the reconstruction process and the initial training of the GAN enables the application of the method for arbitrary inlay geometries without time-consuming retraining of the GAN.},

  abstract     = {Background and purposeWe proposed an artificial neural network model to predict radiobiological parameters for the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with radiation therapy. The model uses the tumor specification, demographics, and radiation dose distribution to predict the tumor control probability and the normal tissue complications probability. These indices are crucial for the assessment and clinical management of cancer patients during treatment planning.MethodsTwo publicly available datasets of 31 and 215 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with conformal radiation therapy were selected. The demographics, tumor specifications, and radiation therapy treatment parameters were extracted from the datasets used as inputs for the training of perceptron. Radiobiological indices are calculated by open-source software using dosevolume histograms from radiation therapy treatment plans. Those indices were used as output in the training of a single-layer neural network. The distribution of data used for training, validation, and testing purposes was 70, 15, and 15%, respectively.ResultsThe best performance of the neural network was noted at epoch number 32 with the mean squared error of 0.0465. The accuracy of the prediction of radiobiological indices by the artificial neural network in training, validation, and test phases were determined to be 0.89, 0.87, and 0.82, respectively. We also found that the percentage volume of parotid inside the planning target volume is the significant parameter for the prediction of normal tissue complications probability.ConclusionWe believe that the model has significant potential to predict radiobiological indices and help clinicians in treatment plan evaluation and treatment management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are currently designed and tested in many fields to improve humans’ ability to make decisions. One of these fields is higher education. For example, AI-based chatbots (“conversational pedagogical agents”) could engage in conversations with students in order to provide timely feedback and responses to questions while the learning process is taking place and to collect data to personalize the delivery of course materials. However, many existent tools are able to perform tasks that human professionals (educators, tutors, professors) could perform, just in a timelier manner. While discussing the possible implementation of AI-based tools in our university’s educational programs, we reviewed the current literature and identified a number of capabilities that future AI solutions may feature, in order to improve higher education processes, with a focus on distance higher education. Specifically, we suggest that innovative tools could influence the methodologies by which students approach learning; facilitate connections and information attainment beyond course materials; support the communication with the professor; and, draw from motivation theories to foster learning engagement, in a personalized manner. Future research should explore high-level opportunities represented by AI for higher education, including their effects on learning outcomes and the quality of the learning experience as a whole.},

  abstract     = {Food and nutrition are a steadfast essential to all living organisms. With specific reference to humans, the sufficient and efficient supply of food is a challenge as the world population continues to grow. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be identified as a plausible technology in this 5th industrial revolution in bringing us closer to achieving zero hunger by 2030—Goal 2 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). This goal cannot be achieved unless the digital divide among developed and underdeveloped countries is addressed. Nevertheless, developing and underdeveloped regions fall behind in economic resources; however, they harbor untapped potential to effectively address the impending demands posed by the soaring world population. Therefore, this study explores the in-depth potential of AI in the agriculture sector for developing and under-developed countries. Similarly, it aims to emphasize the proven efficiency and spin-off applications of AI in the advancement of agriculture. Currently, AI is being utilized in various spheres of agriculture, including but not limited to crop surveillance, irrigation management, disease identification, fertilization practices, task automation, image manipulation, data processing, yield forecasting, supply chain optimization, implementation of decision support system (DSS), weed control, and the enhancement of resource utilization. Whereas AI supports food safety and security by ensuring higher crop yields that are acquired by harnessing the potential of multi-temporal remote sensing (RS) techniques to accurately discern diverse crop phenotypes, monitor land cover dynamics, assess variations in soil organic matter, predict soil moisture levels, conduct plant biomass modeling, and enable comprehensive crop monitoring. The present study identifies various challenges, including financial, infrastructure, experts, data availability, customization, regulatory framework, cultural norms and attitudes, access to market, and interdisciplinary collaboration, in the adoption of AI for developing nations with their subsequent remedies. The identification of challenges and opportunities in the implementation of AI could ignite further research and actions in these regions; thereby supporting sustainable development.},

  abstract     = {The dual-channel graph convolutional neural networks based on hybrid features jointly model the different features of networks, so that the features can learn each other and improve the performance of various subsequent machine learning tasks. However, current dual-channel graph convolutional neural networks are limited by the number of convolution layers, which hinders the performance improvement of the models. Graph convolutional neural networks superimpose multi-layer graph convolution operations, which would occur in smoothing phenomena, resulting in performance decreasing as the increasing number of graph convolutional layers. Inspired by the success of residual connections on convolutional neural networks, this paper applies residual connections to dual-channel graph convolutional neural networks, and increases the depth of dual-channel graph convolutional neural networks. Thus, a dual-channel deep graph convolutional neural network (D2GCN) is proposed, which can effectively avoid over-smoothing and improve model performance. D2GCN is verified on CiteSeer, DBLP, and SDBLP datasets, the results show that D2GCN performs better than the comparison algorithms used in node classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionVideo service providers are moving from focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) to Quality of Experience (QoE) in their video networks since the users’ demand for high-quality video content is continually growing. By focusing on QoE, video service providers can provide their subscribers with a more personalized and engaging experience, which can help increase viewer satisfaction and retention. This focus shift requires not only a more sophisticated approach to network management and new tools and technologies to measure and optimize QoE in their networks but also a novel approach to video delivery operations.MethodsThis paper describes the components, interactions, and relationships of an algorithm factory for video delivery operation that assures high QoE for video streaming services. The paper also showcases the results of gradually implementing an algorithm factory in the video industry. Using a dataset from 2016 to 2022, we present the case of a European PayTV service provider that achieved improved performance measured by both objective and subjective metrics.ResultsThe use of an algorithm factory significantly improved the PayTV service provider’s performance. The study found a fivefold increase in the speed of critical incident resolution and a 59% reduction in the number of critical incidents, all while expanding the customer base and maintaining the same level of labor resources. The case also demonstrates a strong positive relation between the productivity measures of the PayTV operator and their survey-based quality ratings. These results underscore the importance of flawless QoS and operational excellence in delivering QoE to meet the evolving demands of viewers.DiscussionThe paper adds to the existing literature on relationships between operational efficiency, innovation, and subjective quality. The paper further offers empirical evidence from the PayTV industry. The insights provided are expected to benefit both traditional and over-the-top (OTT) video service providers in their quest to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving video industry. It may also translate to other service providers in similar industries committed to supporting high-quality service delivery.},

This study investigates the influence of anthropomorphism, rank, decision cost, and task difficulty on trust in human-autonomous teams (HAT) and how blame is apportioned if shared tasks fail. Participants (N = 31) completed repeated trials with an artificial teammate using a low-fidelity variation of an air-traffic control game. We manipulated anthropomorphism (human-like or machine-like), military rank of artificial teammates using three-star (superiors), two-star (peers), or one-star (subordinate) agents, the perceived payload of vehicles with people or supplies onboard, and task difficulty with easy or hard missions using a within-subject design. A behavioural measure of trust was inferred when participants accepted agent recommendations, and a measure of no trust when recommendations were rejected or ignored. We analysed the data for trust using binomial logistic regression. After each trial, blame was apportioned using a 2-item scale and analysed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. A post-experiment questionnaire obtained participants’ power distance orientation using a seven-item scale. Possible power-related effects on trust and blame apportioning are discussed. Our findings suggest that artificial agents with higher levels of anthropomorphism and lower levels of rank increased trust and shared accountability, with human team members accepting more blame for team failures.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundPublic health policy researchers face a persistent challenge in identifying and integrating relevant data, particularly in the context of the U.S. opioid crisis, where a comprehensive approach is crucial.PurposeTo meet this new workforce demand health policy and health economics programs are increasingly introducing data analysis and data visualization skills. Such skills facilitate data integration and discovery by linking multiple resources. Common linking strategies include individual or aggregate level linking (e.g., patient identifiers) in primary clinical data and conceptual linking (e.g., healthcare workforce, state funding, burnout rates) in secondary data. Often, the combination of primary and secondary datasets is sought, requiring additional skills, for example, understanding metadata and constructing interlinkages.MethodsTo help improve those skills, we developed a 2-step process using a scoping method to discover data and network visualization to interlink metadata. Results: We show how these new skills enable the discovery of relationships among data sources pertinent to public policy research related to the opioid overdose crisis and facilitate inquiry across heterogeneous data resources. In addition, our interactive network visualization introduces (1) a conceptual approach, drawing from recent systematic review studies and linked by the publications, and (2) an aggregate approach, constructed using publicly available datasets and linked through crosswalks.ConclusionsThese novel metadata visualization techniques can be used as a teaching tool or a discovery method and can also be extended to other public policy domains.},

  abstract     = {ObjectiveAutomated surgical step recognition (SSR) using AI has been a catalyst in the “digitization” of surgery. However, progress has been limited to laparoscopy, with relatively few SSR tools in endoscopic surgery. This study aimed to create a SSR model for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT), leveraging a novel application of transfer learning to reduce video dataset requirements.Materials and methodsRetrospective surgical videos of TURBT were manually annotated with the following steps of surgery: primary endoscopic evaluation, resection of bladder tumor, and surface coagulation. Manually annotated videos were then utilized to train a novel AI computer vision algorithm to perform automated video annotation of TURBT surgical video, utilizing a transfer-learning technique to pre-train on laparoscopic procedures. Accuracy of AI SSR was determined by comparison to human annotations as the reference standard.ResultsA total of 300 full-length TURBT videos (median 23.96 min; IQR 14.13–41.31 min) were manually annotated with sequential steps of surgery. One hundred and seventy-nine videos served as a training dataset for algorithm development, 44 for internal validation, and 77 as a separate test cohort for evaluating algorithm accuracy. Overall accuracy of AI video analysis was 89.6%. Model accuracy was highest for the primary endoscopic evaluation step (98.2%) and lowest for the surface coagulation step (82.7%).ConclusionWe developed a fully automated computer vision algorithm for high-accuracy annotation of TURBT surgical videos. This represents the first application of transfer-learning from laparoscopy-based computer vision models into surgical endoscopy, demonstrating the promise of this approach in adapting to new procedure types.},

Camouflage Object Detection (COD) tackles this challenge by identifying objects seamlessly blended into their surroundings. Existing COD techniques struggle with hidden objects due to noisy inferences inherent in natural environments. To address this, we propose the Discriminative Context-aware Network (DiCANet) for improved COD performance.MethodsDiCANet addresses camouflage challenges through a two-stage approach. First, an adaptive restoration block intelligently learns feature weights, prioritizing informative channels and pixels. This enhances convolutional neural networks’ ability to represent diverse data and handle complex camouflage. Second, a cascaded detection module with an enlarged receptive field refines the object prediction map, achieving clear boundaries without post-processing.ResultsWithout post-processing, DiCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging COD datasets (CAMO, CHAMELEON, COD10K) by generating accurate saliency maps with rich contextual details and precise boundaries.DiscussionDiCANet tackles the challenge of identifying camouflaged objects in noisy environments with its two-stage restoration and cascaded detection approach.

  abstract     = {The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in education can be viewed as a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem, in which several stakeholders evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of AI applications in educational settings according to distinct preferences and criteria. A MAGDM framework can assist in providing transparent and logical recommendations for implementing AI in education by methodically analyzing the trade-offs and conflicts among many components, including ethical, social, pedagogical, and technical concerns. A novel development in fuzzy set theory is the 2-tuple linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (2TLq-ROFS), which is not only a generalized form but also can integrate decision-makers quantitative evaluation ideas and qualitative evaluation information. The 2TLq-ROF Schweizer-Sklar weighted power average operator (2TLq-ROFSSWPA) and the 2TLq-ROF Schweizer-Sklar weighted power geometric (2TLq-ROFSSWPG) operator are two of the aggregation operators we create in this article. We also investigate some of the unique instances and features of the proposed operators. Next, a new Entropy model is built based on 2TLq-ROFS, which may exploit the preferences of the decision-makers to obtain the ideal objective weights for attributes. Next, we extend the VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) technique to the 2TLq-ROF version, which provides decision-makers with a greater space to represent their decisions, while also accounting for the uncertainty inherent in human cognition. Finally, a case study of how artificial intelligence has impacted education is given to show the applicability and value of the established methodology. A comparative study is carried out to examine the benefits and improvements of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionAcute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is one of the most aggressive hematological neoplasms, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and strategic treatment planning. The association between prompt intervention and enhanced patient survival rates underscores the pivotal role of therapy decisions. To determine the treatment protocol, specialists heavily rely on prognostic predictions that consider the response to treatment and clinical outcomes. The existing risk classification system categorizes patients into favorable, intermediate, and adverse groups, forming the basis for personalized therapeutic choices. However, accurately assessing the intermediate-risk group poses significant challenges, potentially resulting in treatment delays and deterioration of patient conditions.MethodsThis study introduces a decision support system leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address these issues. The system automatically recommends tailored oncology therapy protocols based on outcome predictions.ResultsThe proposed approach achieved a high performance close to 0.9 in F1-Score and AUC. The model generated with gene expression data exhibited superior performance.DiscussionOur system can effectively support specialists in making well-informed decisions regarding the most suitable and safe therapy for individual patients. The proposed decision support system has the potential to not only streamline treatment initiation but also contribute to prolonged survival and improved quality of life for individuals diagnosed with AML. This marks a significant stride toward optimizing therapeutic interventions and patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI), as an important engine for promoting high-quality economic development, should not be overlooked in terms of its impact on the employment of the labor force while promoting the digital and intelligent transformation of industries. In the face of the complex international environment and non-systemic shocks, it is of great significance to explore whether it is “machine replacement” or “job creation” in the process of the integration of AI and industry, as well as the impact of technological progress on the employment pattern of the labor force, in order to promote the economic development, respond to and solve the employment problem. It is of great significance to promote economic development and cope with and solve the employment problem. Based on the task model, this paper analyses the mechanism of the impact of AI on the employment pattern of manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, based on the provincial panel data of China&#39;s manufacturing industry from 2011 to 2020, it empirically examines the impact of AI on the total employment, employment structure and employment quality of the labor force, and analyses the multiple responses of AI on the employment pattern of the manufacturing industry. The study shows that: Firstly, the level of development of AI and the total amount of employment is a positive U-shaped relationship, the short term is dominated by the substitution effect, and the long term is dominated by the creation effect; Secondly, with regard to the employment structure, low-skilled labor is more likely to be replaced. The financial, accommodation and catering industries are relatively less affected by the spillover effects of the manufacturing industry; Third, with regard to the employment quality, the gap between urban and rural incomes has eased, with per capita net income of rural residents rising to a higher degree than per capita disposable income of urban residents. Thus, in order to further address the impact of AI on the employment patterns of the labor force, the level of AI development should be increased while expanding employment channels, paying attention to labor force skills training, reinforcing the leading role of developed regions, and accelerating regional integration and urban-rural integration, so as to share the dividends of technological progress.},

The biggest clusters, all with over 100 articles, are biased toward multidrug resistance, carbapenem resistance, clinical treatment, and nosocomial infections. However, we also found that some research areas, such as ecology and non-human infections, have received very little attention. This approach allowed us to study research themes over time unveiling those of recent interest, such as the use of Cefiderocol (a recently approved antibiotic) against A. baumannii.DiscussionIn a broader context, our results show that unsupervised learning, NLP and topic modelling can be used to describe and analyse the research themes for important infectious diseases.

  abstract     = {The well-known Greulich and Pyle (GP) method of bone age assessment (BAA) relies on comparing a hand X-ray against templates of discrete maturity classes collected in an atlas. Automated methods have recently shown great success with BAA, especially using deep learning. In this perspective, we first review the success and limitations of various automated BAA methods. We then offer a novel hypothesis: When networks predict bone age that is not aligned with a GP reference class, it is not simply statistical error (although there is that as well); they are picking up nuances in the hand X-ray that lie “outside that class.” In other words, trained networks predict distributions around classes. This raises a natural question: How can we further understand the reasons for a prediction to deviate from the nominal class age? We claim that segmental aging, that is, ratings based on characteristic bone groups can be used to qualify predictions. This so-called segmental GP method has excellent properties: It can not only help identify differential maturity in the hand but also provide a systematic way to extend the use of the current GP atlas to various other populations.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, has brought a significant transformation in decision-making (DM) processes within organizations, with AI gradually assuming responsibilities that were traditionally performed by humans. However, as shown by recent findings, the acceptance of AI-based solutions in DM remains a concern as individuals still strongly prefer human intervention. This resistance can be attributed to psychological factors and other trust-related issues. To address these challenges, recent studies show that practical guidelines for user-centered design of AI are needed to promote justified trust in AI-based systems.Methods and resultsTo this aim, our study bridges Service Design Thinking and the third generation of Activity Theory to create a model which serves as a set of practical guidelines for the user centered design of Multi-Actor AI-based DSS. This model is created through the qualitative study of human activity as a unit of analysis. Nevertheless, it holds the potential for further enhancement through the application of quantitative methods to explore its diverse dimensions more extensively. As an illustrative example, we used a case study in the field of human capital investments, with a particular focus on organizational development, which involves managers, professionals, coaches and other significant actors. As a result, the qualitative methodology employed in our study can be characterized as a “pre-quantitative” investigation.DiscussionThis framework aims at locating the contribution of AI in complex human activity and identifying the potential role of quantitative data in it.},

In manufacturing, operating production lines has become increasingly knowledge-intensive, putting strain on a factory&#39;s capacity to train and support new operators. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to retrieve information from the extensive knowledge contained in factory documentation and knowledge shared by expert operators. The system aims to efficiently answer queries from operators and facilitate the sharing of new knowledge. We conducted a user study at a factory to assess its potential impact and adoption, eliciting several perceived benefits, namely, enabling quicker information retrieval and more efficient resolution of issues. However, the study also highlighted a preference for learning from a human expert when such an option is available. Furthermore, we benchmarked several commercial and open-sourced LLMs for this system. The current state-of-the-art model, GPT-4, consistently outperformed its counterparts, with open-source models trailing closely, presenting an attractive option given their data privacy and customization benefits.

Researchers have been actively addressing cyberbullying for a long time by applying machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, although these algorithms have performed well on artificial datasets, they do not provide similar results when applied to real-time datasets with high levels of noise and imbalance. Consequently, finding generic algorithms that can work on dynamic data available across several platforms is critical. This study used a unique hybrid random forest-based CNN model for text classification, combining the strengths of both approaches. Real-time datasets from Twitter and Instagram were collected and annotated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The performance of various ML and DL algorithms was compared, and the RF-based CNN model outperformed them in accuracy and execution speed. This is particularly important for timely detection of bullying episodes and providing assistance to victims. The model achieved an accuracy of 96% and delivered results 3.4 seconds faster than standard CNN models.},

  abstract     = {Identifying key statements in large volumes of short, user-generated texts is essential for decision-makers to quickly grasp their key content. To address this need, this research introduces a novel abstractive key point generation (KPG) approach applicable to unlabeled text corpora, using an unsupervised approach, a feature not yet seen in existing abstractive KPG methods. The proposed method uniquely combines topic modeling for unsupervised data space segmentation with abstractive summarization techniques to efficiently generate semantically representative key points from text collections. This is further enhanced by hyperparameter tuning to optimize both the topic modeling and abstractive summarization processes. The hyperparameter tuning of the topic modeling aims at making the cluster assignment more deterministic as the probabilistic nature of the process would otherwise lead to high variability in the output. The abstractive summarization process is optimized using a Davies-Bouldin Index specifically adapted to this use case, so that the generated key points more accurately reflect the characteristic properties of this cluster. In addition, our research recommends an automated evaluation that provides a quantitative complement to the traditional qualitative analysis of KPG. This method regards KPG as a specialized form of Multidocument summarization (MDS) and employs both word-based and word-embedding-based metrics for evaluation. These criteria allow for a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the KPG output. Demonstrated through application to a political debate on Twitter, the versatility of this approach extends to various domains, such as product review analysis and survey evaluation. This research not only paves the way for innovative development in abstractive KPG methods but also sets a benchmark for their evaluation.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundHospital readmissions for heart failure patients remain high despite efforts to reduce them. Predictive modeling using big data provides opportunities to identify high-risk patients and inform care management. However, large datasets can constrain performance.ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop a machine learning based prediction model leveraging a nationwide hospitalization database to predict 30-day heart failure readmissions. Another objective of this study is to find the optimal feature set that leads to the highest AUC value in the prediction model.Material and methodsHeart failure patient data was extracted from the 2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database. A heuristic feature selection process incrementally incorporated predictors into logistic regression and random forest models, which yields a maximum increase in the AUC metric. Discrimination was evaluated through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC.ResultsA total of 566,019 discharges with heart failure diagnosis were recognized. Readmission rate was 8.9% for same-cause and 20.6% for all-cause diagnoses. Random forest outperformed logistic regression, achieving AUCs of 0.607 and 0.576 for same-cause and all-cause readmissions respectively. Heuristic feature selection resulted in the identification of optimal feature sets including 20 and 22 variables from a pool of 30 and 31 features for the same-cause and all-cause datasets. Key predictors included age, payment method, chronic kidney disease, disposition status, number of ICD-10-CM diagnoses, and post-care encounters.ConclusionThe proposed model attained discrimination comparable to prior analyses that used smaller datasets. However, reducing the sample enhanced performance, indicating big data complexity. Improved techniques like heuristic feature selection enabled effective leveraging of the nationwide data. This study provides meaningful insights into predictive modeling methodologies and influential features for forecasting heart failure readmissions.},

Modeling the bundle utility for users is a non-trivial task, as it requires to account for the potential interdependencies between bundle attributes. To address this challenge, we introduce a new preference-based approach for bundle recommendation exploiting the Choquet integral. This allows us to formalize preferences for coalitions of environmental-related attributes, thus recommending product bundles accounting for synergies among product attributes. An experimental evaluation of a dataset of local food products in Northern Italy shows how the Choquet integral allows the natural formalization of a sensible notion of environmental friendliness and that standard approaches based on weighted sums of attributes end up recommending bundles with lower environmental friendliness even if weights are explicitly learned to maximize it. We further show how preference elicitation strategies can be leveraged to acquire weights of the Choquet integral from user feedback in terms of preferences over candidate bundles, and show how a handful of queries allow to recommend optimal bundles for a diverse set of user prototypes.},

  abstract     = {Hate Speech Detection in Arabic presents a multifaceted challenge due to the broad and diverse linguistic terrain. With its multiple dialects and rich cultural subtleties, Arabic requires particular measures to address hate speech online successfully. To address this issue, academics and developers have used natural language processing (NLP) methods and machine learning algorithms adapted to the complexities of Arabic text. However, many proposed methods were hampered by a lack of a comprehensive dataset/corpus of Arabic hate speech. In this research, we propose a novel multi-class public Arabic dataset comprised of 403,688 annotated tweets categorized as extremely positive, positive, neutral, or negative based on the presence of hate speech. Using our developed dataset, we additionally characterize the performance of multiple machine learning models for Hate speech identification in Arabic Jordanian dialect tweets. Specifically, the Word2Vec, TF-IDF, and AraBert text representation models have been applied to produce word vectors. With the help of these models, we can provide classification models with vectors representing text. After that, seven machine learning classifiers have been evaluated: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bays (NB), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (Ada), XGBoost (XGB), and CatBoost (CatB). In light of this, the experimental evaluation revealed that, in this challenging and unstructured setting, our gathered and annotated datasets were rather efficient and generated encouraging assessment outcomes. This will enable academics to delve further into this crucial field of study.},

Understanding the capacities and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking tasks is therefore essential for ensuring the health of our information ecosystem. Here, we evaluate the use of LLM agents in fact-checking by having them phrase queries, retrieve contextual data, and make decisions. Importantly, in our framework, agents explain their reasoning and cite the relevant sources from the retrieved context. Our results show the enhanced prowess of LLMs when equipped with contextual information. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3, but accuracy varies based on query language and claim veracity. While LLMs show promise in fact-checking, caution is essential due to inconsistent accuracy.

  abstract     = {Crying is an inevitable character trait that occurs throughout the growth of infants, under conditions where the caregiver may have difficulty interpreting the underlying cause of the cry. Crying can be treated as an audio signal that carries a message about the infant&#39;s state, such as discomfort, hunger, and sickness. The primary infant caregiver requires traditional ways of understanding these feelings. Failing to understand them correctly can cause severe problems. Several methods attempt to solve this problem; however, proper audio feature representation and classifiers are necessary for better results. This study uses time-, frequency-, and time-frequency-domain feature representations to gain in-depth information from the data. The time-domain features include zero-crossing rate (ZCR) and root mean square (RMS), the frequency-domain feature includes the Mel-spectrogram, and the time-frequency-domain feature includes Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Moreover, time-series imaging algorithms are applied to transform 20 MFCC features into images using different algorithms: Gramian angular difference fields, Gramian angular summation fields, Markov transition fields, recurrence plots, and RGB GAF. Then, these features are provided to different machine learning classifiers, such as decision tree, random forest, K nearest neighbors, and bagging. The use of MFCCs, ZCR, and RMS as features achieved high performance, outperforming state of the art (SOTA). Optimal parameters are found via the grid search method using 10-fold cross-validation. Our MFCC-based random forest (RF) classifier approach achieved an accuracy of 96.39%, outperforming SOTA, the scalogram-based shuffleNet classifier, which had an accuracy of 95.17%.},

Within the field of orthopedics, which integrates closely with AI due to its extensive data requirements, rotator cuff injuries are a commonly encountered condition in joint motion. One of the most severe complications following rotator cuff repair surgery is the recurrence of tears, which has a significant impact on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this issue, we utilized the innovative EV-GCN algorithm to train a predictive model. We collected medical records of 1,631 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair surgery at a single center over a span of 5 years. In the end, our model successfully predicted postoperative re-tear before the surgery using 62 preoperative variables with an accuracy of 96.93%, and achieved an accuracy of 79.55% on an independent external dataset of 518 cases from other centers. This model outperforms human doctors in predicting outcomes with high accuracy. Through this methodology and research, our aim is to utilize preoperative prediction models to assist in making informed medical decisions during and after surgery, leading to improved treatment effectiveness. This research method and strategy can be applied to other medical fields, and the research findings can assist in making healthcare decisions.},

However, previous studies have rarely quantitatively evaluated the “explanation performance” of XAI methods against ground-truth data, and transfer learning and its influence on objective measures of explanation performance has not been investigated. Here, we propose a benchmark dataset that allows for quantifying explanation performance in a realistic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification task. We employ this benchmark to understand the influence of transfer learning on the quality of explanations. Experimental results show that popular XAI methods applied to the same underlying model differ vastly in performance, even when considering only correctly classified examples. We further observe that explanation performance strongly depends on the task used for pre-training and the number of CNN layers pre-trained.

  abstract     = {Oral cancer ranks sixteenth amongst types of cancer by number of deaths. Many oral cancers are developed from potentially malignant disorders such as oral leukoplakia, whose most frequent predictor is the presence of epithelial dysplasia. Immunohistochemical staining using cell proliferation biomarkers such as ki67 is a complementary technique to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of oral leukoplakia. The cell counting of these images was traditionally done manually, which is time-consuming and not very reproducible due to intra- and inter-observer variability. The software presently available is not suitable for this task. This article presents the OralImmunoAnalyser software (registered by the University of Santiago de Compostela–USC), which combines automatic image processing with a friendly graphical user interface that allows investigators to oversee and easily correct the automatically recognized cells before quantification. OralImmunoAnalyser is able to count the number of cells in three staining levels and each epithelial layer. Operating in the daily work of the Odontology Faculty, it registered a sensitivity of 64.4% and specificity of 93% for automatic cell detection, with an accuracy of 79.8% for cell classification. Although expert supervision is needed before quantification, OIA reduces the expert analysis time by 56.5% compared to manual counting, avoiding mistakes because the user can check the cells counted. Hence, the SUS questionnaire reported a mean score of 80.9, which means that the system was perceived from good to excellent. OralImmunoAnalyser is accurate, trustworthy, and easy to use in daily practice in biomedical labs. The software, for Windows and Linux, with the images used in this study, can be downloaded from https://citius.usc.es/transferencia/software/oralimmunoanalyser for research purposes upon acceptance.},

  abstract     = {Multi-target learning (MTL) is a popular machine learning technique which considers simultaneous prediction of multiple targets. MTL schemes utilize a variety of methods, from traditional linear models to more contemporary deep neural networks. In this work we introduce a novel, highly interpretable, tree-based MTL scheme which exploits the correlation between the targets to obtain improved prediction accuracy. Our suggested scheme applies cross-validated splitting criterion to identify correlated targets at every node of the tree. This allows us to benefit from the correlation among the targets while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme in a variety of synthetic and real-world experiments, showing a significant improvement over alternative methods. An implementation of the proposed method is publicly available at the first author&#39;s webpage.},

  abstract     = {Distributed learning is a promising alternative to central learning for machine learning (ML) model training, overcoming data-sharing problems in healthcare. Previous studies exploring federated learning (FL) or the traveling model (TM) setup for medical image-based disease classification often relied on large databases with a limited number of centers or simulated artificial centers, raising doubts about real-world applicability. This study develops and evaluates a convolution neural network (CNN) for Parkinson&#39;s disease classification using data acquired by 83 diverse real centers around the world, mostly contributing small training samples. Our approach specifically makes use of the TM setup, which has proven effective in scenarios with limited data availability but has never been used for image-based disease classification. Our findings reveal that TM is effective for training CNN models, even in complex real-world scenarios with variable data distributions. After sufficient training cycles, the TM-trained CNN matches or slightly surpasses the performance of the centrally trained counterpart (AUROC of 83% vs. 80%). Our study highlights, for the first time, the effectiveness of TM in 3D medical image classification, especially in scenarios with limited training samples and heterogeneous distributed data. These insights are relevant for situations where ML models are supposed to be trained using data from small or remote medical centers, and rare diseases with sparse cases. The simplicity of this approach enables a broad application to many deep learning tasks, enhancing its clinical utility across various contexts and medical facilities.},

  abstract     = {Mesoscale eddies, which are fast-moving rotating water bodies in the ocean with horizontal scales ranging from 10 km to 100 km and above, are considered to be the weather of the oceans. They are of interest to marine biologists, oceanographers, and geodesists for their impact on water mass, heat, and nutrient transport. Typically, gridded sea level anomaly maps processed from multiple radar altimetry missions are used to detect eddies. However, multi-mission sea level anomaly maps obtained by the operational processors have a lower effective spatiotemporal resolution than their grid spacing and temporal resolution, leading to inaccurate eddy detection. In this study, we investigate the use of higher-resolution along-track sea level anomaly data to infer daily two-dimensional segmentation maps of cyclonic, anticyclonic, or non-eddy areas with greater accuracy than using processed sea level anomaly grid map products. To tackle this challenge, we propose a deep neural network that uses spatiotemporal contextual information within the modality of along-track data. This network is capable of producing a two-dimensional segmentation map from data with varying sparsity. We have developed an architecture called Teddy, which uses a Transformer module to encode and process spatiotemporal information, and a sparsity invariant CNN to infer a two-dimensional segmentation map of classified eddies from the ground tracks of varying sparsity on the considered region. Our results show that Teddy creates two-dimensional maps of classified eddies from along-track data with higher accuracy and timeliness when compared to commonly used methods that work with less accurate preprocessed sea level anomaly grid maps. We train and test our method with a carefully curated and independent dataset, which can be made available upon request.},

Performance evaluations involved comparing identical twins, all speakers in the dataset (including twin pairs), and all speakers excluding twin pairs. Speech samples, ranging from 5 to 30 s, underwent assessment based on equal error rates (EER) and Log cost-likelihood ratios (Cllr). Results highlight the substantial challenge posed by identical twins to the ASR system, leading to a decrease in overall speaker recognition accuracy. Furthermore, analyses based on longer speech samples outperformed those using shorter samples. As sample size increased, standard deviation values for both intra and inter-speaker similarity scores decreased, indicating reduced variability in estimating speaker similarity/dissimilarity levels in longer speech stretches compared to shorter ones. The study also uncovered varying degrees of likeness among identical twins, with certain pairs presenting a greater challenge for ASR systems. These outcomes align with prior research and are discussed within the context of relevant literature.},

Additionally, we introduce a novel distance-based kernel specifically designed for binary-type features based on a similarity matrix that efficiently handles both binary and multi-class classification problems. Computational experiments on publicly available datasets of varying sizes demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, the distance-based kernel achieves superior performance compared to other well-known kernels from the literature and those used in previous studies on the same datasets. These findings validate the effectiveness of our proposed classification method and distance-based kernel for SVMs. By leveraging random subset selection and a unique kernel design, we achieve notable improvements in classification accuracy.

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a visualization technique to explore and visualize concept hierarchies generated from a textbook in the legal domain. Through a human-centered design process, we developed a tool that allows users to effectively navigate through and explore complex hierarchical concepts in three kinds of traversal techniques: top-down, middle-out, and bottom-up. Our concept hierarchies offer an overview over a given domain, with increasing level of detail toward the bottom of the hierarchy which is consisting of entities. In the legal use case we considered, the concepts were adapted from section headings in a legal textbook, whereas references to law or legal cases inside the textbook became entities. The design of this tool is refined following various steps such as gathering user needs, pain points of an existing visualization, prototyping, testing, and refining. The resulting interface offers users several key features such as dynamic search and filter, explorable concept nodes, and a preview of leaf nodes at every stage. A high-fidelity prototype was created to test our theory and design. To test our concept, we used the System Usability Scale as a way to measure the prototype&#39;s usability, a task-based survey to asses the tool&#39;s ability in assisting users in gathering information and interacting with the prototype, and finally mouse tracking to understand user interaction patterns. Along with this, we gathered audio and video footage of users when participating in the study. This footage also helped us in getting feedback when the survey responses required further information. The data collected provided valuable insights to set the directions for extending this study. As a result, we have accounted for varying hierarchy depths, longer text spans than only one to two words in the elements of the hierarchy, searchability, and exploration of the hierarchies. At the same time, we aimed for minimizing visual clutter and cognitive overload. We show that existing approaches are not suitable to visualize the type of data which we support with our visualization.},

The analysis shows that the effect of central clearing on systemic risk is ambiguous, with potential positive and negative outcomes, depending on the credit quality of the clearing house, netting benefits and losses, and concentration risks. These computational findings align with empirical studies, yet do not require intensive collection of proprietary data. In addition, our approach enables us to disentangle various competing effects.

The proposed semantic segmentation method leveraged a hybrid model which combined ResNet-101-D with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism to obtain precise morphological features from cow images. The body size parameters and physical measurements were then used for training the regression-based machine learning models to estimate the weight of individual cattle. The comparative analysis methods revealed that the BP neural network achieved the best results with an MAE of 13.11 pounds and an RMSE of 22.73 pounds. By eliminating the need for physical contact, this approach not only improves animal welfare but also mitigates potential risks. The work addresses the specific needs of welfare farming and aims to promote animal welfare and advance the field of precision agriculture.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundThe increasing prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Iran over the past three decades has made it a key public health burden. This study aimed to predict metastasis in CRC patients using machine learning (ML) approaches in terms of demographic and clinical factors.MethodsThis study focuses on 1,127 CRC patients who underwent appropriate treatments at Taleghani Hospital, a tertiary care facility. The patients were divided into training and test datasets in an 80:20 ratio. Various ML methods, including Naive Bayes (NB), random rorest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), decision tree (DT), and logistic regression (LR), were used for predicting metastasis in CRC patients. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, reporting sensitivity, specificity, the area under the curve (AUC), and other indexes.ResultsAmong the 1,127 patients, 183 (16%) had experienced metastasis. In the predictionof metastasis, both the NN and RF algorithms had the highest AUC, while SVM ranked third in both the original and balanced datasets. The NN and RF algorithms achieved the highest AUC (100%), sensitivity (100% and 100%, respectively), and accuracy (99.2% and 99.3%, respectively) on the balanced dataset, followed by the SVM with an AUC of 98.8%, a sensitivity of 97.5%, and an accuracy of 97%. Moreover, lower false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), and higher negative predictive value (NPV) can be confirmed by these two methods. The results also showed that all methods exhibited good performance in the test datasets, and the balanced dataset improved the performance of most ML methods. The most important variables for predicting metastasis were the tumor stage, the number of involved lymph nodes, and the treatment type. In a separate analysis of patients with tumor stages I–III, it was identified that tumor grade, tumor size, and tumor stage are the most important features.ConclusionThis study indicated that NN and RF were the best among ML-based approaches for predicting metastasis in CRC patients. Both the tumor stage and the number of involved lymph nodes were considered the most important features.},

  abstract     = {China&#39;s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 has sparked scholars&#39; interest in examining the environmental ramifications of green technologies in the digital era. While plenty of them provide eco-efficiency policy such as increasing R&amp;amp;D investment or stimulating green exports, little attention has been paid to the firm-level technological management and recombination strategies such as differentiation/specialization of green portfolios along with AI integration, which can significantly impact the pace of net-zero transitions. To address these gaps, this study investigates the moderating effect of technological specialization on levels of AI integration into green technologies estimated by green-AI technological distance and enterprises&#39; innovation performance in Chinese contemporary contexts. Regression results of fixed-effect model in Chinese patent data (2011–2020) indicate that enterprises&#39; green innovation performance is significantly improved as AI integrates more into the green technologies due to the legitimacy and the inability to appropriate more green values. Interestingly, specialized green-technological enterprises demonstrate superior performance in integrating distant AI technologies. This occurrence could potentially be driven by the governments&#39; incentives and the organization&#39;s risk attitudes, shaping green innovation outcomes. Hence, the study underscores the importance of considering both the AI integration and green specialization in shaping innovation outcomes amidst green transitions.},

  abstract     = {Neuroimaging data repositories are data-rich resources comprising brain imaging with clinical and biomarker data. The potential for such repositories to transform healthcare is tremendous, especially in their capacity to support machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Current discussions about the generalizability of such tools in healthcare provoke concerns of risk of bias—ML models underperform in women and ethnic and racial minorities. The use of ML may exacerbate existing healthcare disparities or cause post-deployment harms. Do neuroimaging data repositories and their capacity to support ML/AI-driven clinical discoveries, have both the potential to accelerate innovative medicine and harden the gaps of social inequities in neuroscience-related healthcare? In this paper, we examined the ethical concerns of ML-driven modeling of global community neuroscience needs arising from the use of data amassed within neuroimaging data repositories. We explored this in two parts; firstly, in a theoretical experiment, we argued for a South East Asian-based repository to redress global imbalances. Within this context, we then considered the ethical framework toward the inclusion vs. exclusion of the migrant worker population, a group subject to healthcare inequities. Secondly, we created a model simulating the impact of global variations in the presentation of anosmia risks in COVID-19 toward altering brain structural findings; we then performed a mini AI ethics experiment. In this experiment, we interrogated an actual pilot dataset (n = 17; 8 non-anosmic (47%) vs. 9 anosmic (53%) using an ML clustering model. To create the COVID-19 simulation model, we bootstrapped to resample and amplify the dataset. This resulted in three hypothetical datasets: (i) matched (n = 68; 47% anosmic), (ii) predominant non-anosmic (n = 66; 73% disproportionate), and (iii) predominant anosmic (n = 66; 76% disproportionate). We found that the differing proportions of the same cohorts represented in each hypothetical dataset altered not only the relative importance of key features distinguishing between them but even the presence or absence of such features. The main objective of our mini experiment was to understand if ML/AI methodologies could be utilized toward modelling disproportionate datasets, in a manner we term “AI ethics.” Further work is required to expand the approach proposed here into a reproducible strategy.},

  abstract     = {BackgroundAs global demographics shift toward an aging population, monitoring their heart rate becomes essential, a key physiological metric for cardiovascular health. Traditional methods of heart rate monitoring are often invasive, while recent advancements in Active Assisted Living provide non-invasive alternatives. This study aims to evaluate a novel heart rate prediction method that utilizes contactless smart home technology coupled with machine learning techniques for older adults.MethodsThe study was conducted in a residential environment equipped with various contactless smart home sensors. We recruited 40 participants, each of whom was instructed to perform 23 types of predefined daily living activities across five phases. Concurrently, heart rate data were collected through Empatica E4 wristband as the benchmark. Analysis of data involved five prominent machine learning models: Support Vector Regression, K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Multilayer Perceptron.ResultsAll machine learning models achieved commendable prediction performance, with an average Mean Absolute Error of 7.329. Particularly, Random Forest model outperformed the other models, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of 6.023 and a Scatter Index value of 9.72%. The Random Forest model also showed robust capabilities in capturing the relationship between individuals&#39; daily living activities and their corresponding heart rate responses, with the highest R2 value of 0.782 observed during morning exercise activities. Environmental factors contribute the most to model prediction performance.ConclusionsThe utilization of the proposed non-intrusive approach enabled an innovative method to observe heart rate fluctuations during different activities. The findings of this research have significant implications for public health. By predicting heart rate based on contactless smart home technologies for individuals&#39; daily living activities, healthcare providers and public health agencies can gain a comprehensive understanding of an individual&#39;s cardiovascular health profile. This valuable information can inform the implementation of personalized interventions, preventive measures, and lifestyle modifications to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases and improve overall health outcomes.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionGraph-based representations are becoming more common in the medical domain, where each node defines a patient, and the edges signify associations between patients, relating individuals with disease and symptoms in a node classification task. In this study, a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) model was utilized to capture differences in neurocognitive, genetic, and brain atrophy patterns that can predict cognitive status, ranging from Normal Cognition (NC) to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (AD), on the Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Elucidating model predictions is vital in medical applications to promote clinical adoption and establish physician trust. Therefore, we introduce a decomposition-based explanation method for individual patient classification.MethodsOur method involves analyzing the output variations resulting from decomposing input values, which allows us to determine the degree of impact on the prediction. Through this process, we gain insight into how each feature from various modalities, both at the individual and group levels, contributes to the diagnostic result. Given that graph data contains critical information in edges, we studied relational data by silencing all the edges of a particular class, thereby obtaining explanations at the neighborhood level.ResultsOur functional evaluation showed that the explanations remain stable with minor changes in input values, specifically for edge weights exceeding 0.80. Additionally, our comparative analysis against SHAP values yielded comparable results with significantly reduced computational time. To further validate the model&#39;s explanations, we conducted a survey study with 11 domain experts. The majority (71%) of the responses confirmed the correctness of the explanations, with a rating of above six on a 10-point scale for the understandability of the explanations.DiscussionStrategies to overcome perceived limitations, such as the GCN&#39;s overreliance on demographic information, were discussed to facilitate future adoption into clinical practice and gain clinicians&#39; trust as a diagnostic decision support system.},

The rapid increase in cases adversely affects a nation&#39;s economy, public health, and residents&#39; social and personal well-being. Improving the precision of COVID-19 infection forecasts can aid in making informed decisions regarding interventions, given the pandemic&#39;s harmful impact on numerous aspects of human life, such as health and the economy. This study aims to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia using Bayesian optimization (BOA) and deep learning (DL) methods. Two methods were assessed for their efficacy in predicting the occurrence of positive cases of COVID-19. The research employed data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia (SA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Tunisia (TU) from 2020 to 2021. The findings from the BOA model indicate that accurately predicting the number of COVID-19 positive cases is difficult due to the BOA projections needing to align with the assumptions. Thus, a DL approach was utilized to enhance the precision of COVID-19 positive case prediction in South Africa. The DQN model performed better than the BOA model when assessing RMSE and MAPE values. The model operates on a local server infrastructure, where the trained policy is transmitted solely to DQN. DQN formulated a reward function to amplify the efficiency of the DQN algorithm. By examining the rate of change and duration of sleep in the test data, this function can enhance the DQN model&#39;s training. Based on simulation findings, it can decrease the DQN work cycle by roughly 28% and diminish data overhead by more than 50% on average.},

This paper addresses a well-defined problem pertaining to the critical need for a comprehensive examination of students&#39; ChatGPT adoption in higher education. To examine such adoption, it is imperative to focus on measuring actual user behavior. While measuring students&#39; ChatGPT usage behavior at a specific point in time can be valuable, a more holistic approach is necessary to understand the temporal dynamics of AI adoption. To address this need, a longitudinal survey was conducted, examining how students&#39; ChatGPT usage behavior changes over time among students, and unveiling the drivers of such behavior change. The empirical examination of 222 Dutch higher education students revealed a significant decline in students&#39; ChatGPT usage behavior over an 8 month period. This period was defined by two distinct data collection phases: the initial phase (T1) and a follow-up phase conducted 8 months later (T2). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that changes in trust, emotional creepiness, and Perceived Behavioral Control significantly predicted the observed change in usage behavior. The findings of this research carry significant academic and managerial implications, as they advance our comprehension of the temporal aspects of AI adoption in higher education. The findings also provide actionable guidance for AI developers and educational institutions seeking to optimize student engagement with AI technologies.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach to Item Response Theory (IRT) by incorporating deep learning to analyze student facial expressions to enhance the prediction and understanding of student responses to test items. This research is based on the assertion that students&#39; facial expressions offer crucial insights into their cognitive and affective states during testing, subsequently influencing their item responses. The proposed State-Aware Deep Item Response Theory (SAD-IRT) model introduces a new parameter, the student state parameter, which can be viewed as a relative subjective difficulty parameter. It is latent-regressed from students&#39; facial features while solving test items using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In an experiment with 20 students, SAD-IRT boosted prediction performance in students&#39; responses compared to prior models without the student state parameter, including standard IRT and its deep neural network implementation, while maintaining consistent predictions of student ability and item difficulty parameters. The research further illustrates the model&#39;s early prediction ability in predicting the student&#39;s response result before the student answered. This study holds substantial implications for educational assessment, laying the groundwork for more personalized and effective learning and assessment strategies that consider students&#39; emotional and cognitive states.},

  abstract     = {Heart sound detection technology plays an important role in the prediction of cardiovascular disease, but the most significant heart sounds are fleeting and may be imperceptible. Hence, obtaining heart sound information in an efficient and accurate manner will be helpful for the prediction and diagnosis of heart disease. To obtain heart sound information, we designed an audio data analysis tool to segment the heart sounds from single heart cycle, and validated the heart rate using a finger oxygen meter. The results from our validated technique could be used to realize heart sound segmentation. Our robust algorithmic platform was able to segment the heart sounds, which could then be compared in terms of their difference from the background. A combination of an electronic stethoscope and artificial intelligence technology was used for the digital collection of heart sounds and the intelligent identification of the first (S1) and second (S2) heart sounds. Our approach can provide an objective basis for the auscultation of heart sounds and visual display of heart sounds and murmurs.},

They show tremendous promise for advancing our understanding of neurodevelopment and neurological disorders. However, the unprecedented ability to model human brain development and function in vitro also raises complex ethical, legal, and social challenges. Organoid Intelligence (OI) describes the ongoing movement to combine such organoids with Artificial Intelligence to establish basic forms of memory and learning. This article discusses key issues regarding the scientific status and prospects of brain organoids and OI, conceptualizations of consciousness and the mind–brain relationship, ethical and legal dimensions, including moral status, human–animal chimeras, informed consent, and governance matters, such as oversight and regulation. A balanced framework is needed to allow vital research while addressing public perceptions and ethical concerns. Interdisciplinary perspectives and proactive engagement among scientists, ethicists, policymakers, and the public can enable responsible translational pathways for organoid technology. A thoughtful, proactive governance framework might be needed to ensure ethically responsible progress in this promising field.},

Participants of the workshop on “Artificial Intelligence in Biology and Medicine” (Jerusalem, Feb 14–15, 2023), both researchers and practitioners, aimed to build a holistic picture by exploring AI advancements, challenges and perspectives, as well as to suggest new fields for AI applications. Presentations showcased the potential of large language models (LLMs) in generating molecular structures, predicting protein-ligand interactions, and promoting democratization of AI development. Ethical concerns in medical decision making were also addressed. In biological applications, AI integration of multi-omics and clinical data elucidated the health relevant effects of low doses of ionizing radiation. Bayesian latent modeling identified statistical associations between unobserved variables. Medical applications highlighted liquid biopsy methods for non-invasive diagnostics, routine laboratory tests to identify overlooked illnesses, and AI&#39;s role in oral and maxillofacial imaging. Explainable AI and diverse image processing tools improved diagnostics, while text classification detected anorexic behavior in blog posts. The workshop fostered knowledge sharing, discussions, and emphasized the need for further AI development in radioprotection research in support of emerging public health issues. The organizers plan to continue the initiative as an annual event, promoting collaboration and addressing issues and perspectives in AI applications with a focus on low-dose radioprotection research. Researchers involved in radioprotection research and experts in relevant public policy domains are invited to explore the utility of AI in low-dose radiation research at the next workshop.},

This paper investigates the ability of a Deep Learning (DL) approach to predict future disease diagnosis from Electronic Health Records (EHR) for the purposes of Population Health Management.MethodsIn this study, embeddings were created using a Word2Vec algorithm from structured vocabulary commonly used in EHRs e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes. This study is based on longitudinal medical data from ~50 m patients in the USA. We introduced a novel method of including binned observation values into an embeddings model. We also included novel features associated with wider determinants of health. Patient records comprising these embeddings were then fed to a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to predict the likelihood of patients developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), Hypertension or experiencing an Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) in the next 3 years. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to achieve model explainability.ResultsIncreasing the data scope to include binned observations and wider determinants of health was found to improve predictive performance. We achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve value of 0.92 for Diabetes prediction, 0.94 for COPD, 0.92 for Hypertension and 0.94 for MI. The SHAP values showed that the models had learned features known to be associated with these outcomes.DiscussionThe DL approach outlined in this study can identify clinically-relevant features from large-scale EHR data and use these to predict future disease outcomes. This study highlights the promise of DL solutions for identifying patients at future risk of disease and providing clinicians with the means to understand and evaluate the drivers of those predictions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the use of machine learning to predict stock market indices has emerged as a vital concern in the FinTech domain. However, the inherent nature of point estimation in traditional supervised machine learning models leads to an almost negligible probability of achieving perfect predictions, significantly constraining the applicability of machine learning prediction models. This study employs 4 machine learning models, namely BPN, LSTM, RF, and ELM, to establish predictive models for the Taiwan biotech index during the COVID-19 period. Additionally, it integrates the Gaussian membership function MF from fuzzy theory to develop 4 hybrid fuzzy interval-based machine learning models, evaluating their predictive accuracy through empirical analysis and comparing them with conventional point estimation models. The empirical data is sourced from the financial time series of the “M1722 Listed Biotechnology and Medical Care Index” compiled by the Taiwan Economic Journal during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to understand the effectiveness of machine learning models in the face of significant disruptive factors like the pandemic. The findings demonstrate that despite the influence of COVID-19, machine learning remains effective. LSTM performs the best among the models, both in traditional mode and after fuzzy interval enhancement, followed by the ELM and RF models. The predictive results of these three models reach a certain level of accuracy and all outperform the BPN model. Fuzzy-LSTM effectively predicts at a 68% confidence level, while Fuzzy-ELM and Fuzzy-RF yield better results at a 95% confidence level. Fuzzy-BPN exhibits the lowest predictive accuracy. Overall, the fuzzy interval-based LSTM excels in time series prediction, suggesting its potential application in forecasting time series data in financial markets to enhance the efficacy of investment analysis for investors.},

  abstract     = {Efforts to automate translation were made in the 1950s and 1960s, albeit with limited resources compared to current advanced standards. Machine translation is categorised under computational linguistics that examines employing computer software in the rendition of text from one language into another. The present paper seeks to compare five different machine translation systems for the sake of assessing the quality of their outputs in rendering certain articles of the Saudi Commercial Law into English through post-editing based on Human Translation Edit Rate. Each machine translation output is assessed against the same post-edited version, and the closest output to the post-edited version with regard to the use of the same lexicon and word order will achieve the lowest score. The lower the score of the machine translation output is, the higher quality it has. The paper then analyses the results of the Human Translation Edit Rate metric evaluation to ascertain as to whether or not high-quality machine translation outputs always produce acceptable Arabic–English legal translation. The present paper argues that the use of Human Translation Edit Rate metric is a useful tool for the sake of undertaking post-editing procedures as it is a combination of both human evaluation as well as automatic evaluation. It is also advantageous as it takes account of both the use of lexicon and word order. However, such metric cannot be sufficiently depended on as one term substitution, which will be counted according to this metric as a single error, may render the whole sentence invalid, particularly in legal translation. This paper offers a baseline for the quality assessment of machine translation output through post-editing based on Human Translation Edit Rate metric and how its results should be analysed within Arabic–English legal translation context, which may have implications for similar machine translation output quality assessment contexts.},

In the age of AI, the role of HRM professionals in organizations continues to evolve. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many HRM functions and practices throughout organizations creating system and process efficiencies, performing advanced data analysis, and contributing to the value creation process of the organization. A growing body of evidence highlights the benefits AI brings to the field of HRM. Despite the increased interest in AI-HRM scholarship, focus on human-AI interaction at work and AI-based technologies for HRM is limited and fragmented. Moreover, the lack of human considerations in HRM tech design and deployment can hamper AI digital transformation efforts. This paper provides a contemporary and forward-looking perspective to the strategic and human-centric role HRM plays within organizations as AI becomes more integrated in the workplace. Spanning three distinct phases of AI-HRM integration (technocratic, integrated, and fully-embedded), it examines the technical, human, and ethical challenges at each phase and provides suggestions on how to overcome them using a human-centric approach. Our paper highlights the importance of the evolving role of HRM in the AI-driven organization and provides a roadmap on how to bring humans and machines closer together in the workplace.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare can enhance clinical workflows and diagnoses, particularly in large-scale operations like COVID-19 mass testing. This study presents a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for automated COVID-19 RATD image classification.MethodsTo address the absence of a RATD image dataset, we crowdsourced 900 real-world images focusing on positive and negative cases. Rigorous data augmentation and StyleGAN2-ADA generated simulated images to overcome dataset limitations and class imbalances.ResultsThe best CNN model achieved a 93% validation accuracy. Test accuracies were 88% for simulated datasets and 82% for real datasets. Augmenting simulated images during training did not significantly improve real-world test image performance but enhanced simulated test image performance.DiscussionThe findings of this study highlight the potential of the developed model in expediting COVID-19 testing processes and facilitating large-scale testing and tracking systems. The study also underscores the challenges in designing and developing such models, emphasizing the importance of addressing dataset limitations and class imbalances.ConclusionThis research contributes to the deployment of large-scale testing and tracking systems, offering insights into the potential applications of AI in mitigating outbreaks similar to COVID-19. Future work could focus on refining the model and exploring its adaptability to other healthcare scenarios.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionEven with modern advancements in medical care, one of the persistent challenges hospitals face is the frequent readmission of patients. These recurrent admissions not only escalate healthcare expenses but also amplify mental and emotional strain on patients.MethodsThis research delved into two primary areas: unraveling the pivotal factors causing the readmissions, specifically targeting patients who underwent dermatological treatments, and determining the optimal machine learning algorithms that can foresee potential readmissions with higher accuracy.ResultsAmong the multitude of algorithms tested, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Naïve Bayesian (NB), artificial neural network (ANN), xgboost (XG), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), it was noted that two models—XG and RF—stood out in their prediction prowess. A closer inspection of the data brought to light certain patterns. For instance, male patients and those between the ages of 21 and 40 had a propensity to be readmitted more frequently. Moreover, the months of March and April witnessed a spike in these readmissions, with ~6% of the patients returning within just a month after their first admission.DiscussionUpon further analysis, specific determinants such as the patient&#39;s age and the specific hospital where they were treated emerged as key indicators influencing the likelihood of their readmission.},

  abstract     = {Formal deductive logic, used to express and reason over declarative, axiomatizable content, captures, we now know, essentially all of what is known in mathematics and physics, and captures as well the details of the proofs by which such knowledge has been secured. This is certainly impressive, but deductive logic alone cannot enable rational adjudication of arguments that are at variance (however much additional information is added). After affirming a fundamental directive, according to which argumentation should be the basis for human-centric AI, we introduce and employ both a deductive and—crucially—an inductive cognitive calculus. The former cognitive calculus, &lt;mml:math id=&quot;M1&quot; xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mi mathvariant=&quot;script&quot;&gt;DCEC&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;, is the deductive one and is used with our automated deductive reasoner ShadowProver; the latter, &lt;mml:math id=&quot;M2&quot; xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mi mathvariant=&quot;script&quot;&gt;IDCEC&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;, is inductive, is used with the automated inductive reasoner ShadowAdjudicator, and is based on human-used concepts of likelihood (and in some dialects of &lt;mml:math id=&quot;M3&quot; xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mrow&gt;&lt;mml:mi mathvariant=&quot;script&quot;&gt;IDCEC&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:mrow&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;, probability). We explain that ShadowAdjudicator centers around the concept of competing and nuanced arguments adjudicated non-monotonically through time. We make things clearer and more concrete by way of three case studies, in which our two automated reasoners are employed. Case Study 1 involves the famous Monty Hall Problem. Case Study 2 makes vivid the efficacy of our calculi and automated reasoners in simulations that involve a cognitive robot (PERI.2). In Case Study 3, as we explain, the simulation employs the cognitive architecture ARCADIA, which is designed to computationally model human-level cognition in ways that take perception and attention seriously. We also discuss a type of argument rarely analyzed in logic-based AI; arguments intended to persuade by leveraging human deficiencies. We end by sharing thoughts about the future of research and associated engineering of the type that we have displayed.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, the applications have become increasingly widespread in various domains. However, traditional deep learning methods are often referred to as “black box” models with low interpretability of their results, posing challenges for their application in certain critical domains. In this study, we propose a comprehensive method for the interpretability analysis of sentiment models. The proposed method encompasses two main aspects: attention-based analysis and external knowledge integration. First, we train the model within sentiment classification and generation tasks to capture attention scores from multiple perspectives. This multi-angle approach reduces bias and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying sentiment. Second, we incorporate an external knowledge base to improve evidence extraction. By leveraging character scores, we retrieve complete sentiment evidence phrases, addressing the challenge of incomplete evidence extraction in Chinese texts. Experimental results on a sentiment interpretability evaluation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We observe a notable increase in accuracy by 1.3%, Macro-F1 by 13%, and MAP by 23%. Overall, our approach offers a robust solution for enhancing the interpretability of sentiment models by combining attention-based analysis and the integration of external knowledge.},
