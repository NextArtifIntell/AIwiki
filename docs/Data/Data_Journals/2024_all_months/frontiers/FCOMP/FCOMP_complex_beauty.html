  abstract     = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the humanities represents a transformative shift, offeringnew tools to understand, preserve, and share cultural and historical heritage. While this innovation opensunprecedented avenues for exploration, it also raises questions about the balance between computational efficiency and human-centered interpretation. The current debate, in fact, examines how to maintain equilibrium between automated analysis and the contextual depth characteristic of human understanding, while also addressing the ethical implications of using AI in the study and representation of culture. This special issue delves into these very themes. Each contribution brings forward innovative methodologies, building an interdisciplinary bridge between AI and the humanities. In doing so, it lays the groundwork for AI applications that both respect and enrich the complexity and diversity of cultural heritage. The collection begins with an exploration of human-computer interaction, where Zellou and Holliday examine speech adaptations in voice-activated AI dialogues (Zellou and Holliday, 2024). This research reveals the subtle ways users adjust their communication with AI, enhancing our understanding of social dynamics in human-computer interaction. Their work resonates with Chun’s research on MultiSentimentArcs (Chun, 2024), a multimodal sentiment analysis framework that applies AI to emotional narratives in media.Together, these studies highlight AI’s role in capturing social and emotional nuances, offering insightsinto how technology can interact empathetically with users. Elkins’ work on translation evaluation buildson this theme, examining how AI can help retain the emotional and stylistic depth of literary texts acrosslanguages (Elkins, 2024). By employing advanced language models, Elkins demonstrates how AI preservesthe fidelity of cross-cultural texts, contributing to the broader discourse on AI in cultural preservation.This exploration of cross-cultural fidelity finds a parallel in Stacchio et al.’s work, where a framework forneural rendering is proposed to ensure ethical handling of digital cultural assets. Their research emphasizes transparency and ethical responsibility, aligning AI practices with established guidelines in cultural heritage preservation (Stacchio et al., 2024). The theme of ethical AI applications continues in Mehra et al.’s study on the final verbal expressions of death row inmates, which applies computational psycholinguistics to analyze themes of spirituality, forgiveness, and emotional consistency. By capturing profound aspects of human psychology, this study illustrates AI’s potential to enhance our understanding of sensitive, high-stakes contexts, supporting fields like criminology and psychology in ethically resonant ways (Mehra et al., 2024). Santini’s work complements these themes through its focus on knowledge extraction from Italian TEI-encoded texts. This study leverages language models to create knowledge graphs that preserve and contextualize historical texts, contributing to digital humanities by enhancing the accessibility and coherence of cultural content. The methodology emphasizes both structured and machine-readable data, bridging gaps between technology and the humanistic study of texts (Santini, 2024). Morotti and colleagues add to the discourse on AI’s role in cultural preservation with their innovative DIP-ST method for artwork restoration. This study combines Deep Image Prior with Style Transfer to reconstruct damaged artwork areas, maintaining stylistic fidelity without requiring large datasets. Their approach highlights AI’s potential in contexts where data scarcity and artistic coherence are crucial, underscoring the need for tools that adapt to humanities research with minimal intrusion (Morotti et al., 2024). Collectively, these contributions underscore AI’s transformative potential across the humanities, from human-computer interaction to cultural preservation. This issue advocates for a balanced approach to AI in humanities, one that marries technical advancement with ethical consideration and interpretive respect. As AI continues to shape how we interact with, preserve, and interpret cultural heritage, this research provides a foundation for an AI-enhanced future that respects the depth, complexity, and humanity of its subjects.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we combine the deep image prior (DIP) framework with a style transfer (ST) technique to propose a novel approach (called DIP-ST) for image inpainting of artworks. We specifically tackle cases where the regions to fill in are large. Hence, part of the original painting is irremediably lost, and new content must be generated. In DIP-ST, a convolutional neural network processes the damaged image while a pretrained VGG network forces a style constraint to ensure that the inpainted regions maintain stylistic coherence with the original artwork. We evaluate our method performance to inpaint different artworks, and we compare DIP-ST to some state-of-the-art techniques. Our method provides more reliable solutions characterized by a higher fidelity to the original images, as confirmed by better values of quality assessment metrics. We also investigate the effectiveness of the style loss function in distinguishing between different artistic styles, and the results show that the style loss metric accurately measures artistic similarities and differences. Finally, despite the use of neural networks, DIP-ST does not require a dataset for training, making it particularly suited for art restoration where relevant datasets may be scarce.},

In this work, we highlight the natural relation that quantum computing models like boson and Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) have to this problem. We first explore the use of boson sampling to identify biclusters based on matrix permanents. We then propose a heuristic that finds clusters in a dataset using Gaussian boson sampling by (i) converting the dataset into a bipartite graph and then (ii) running GBS to find the densest sub-graph(s) within the larger bipartite graph. Our simulations for the above proposed heuristics show promising results for future exploration in this area.},

It is a type of cancer that commonly remains undetected due to unpresented symptoms until it has progressed to later stages which motivates the requirement for accurate methods of early detection of lung nodules. Computer-aided diagnosis systems have adapted to aid in detecting and segmenting lung cancer, which can increase a patient&#39;s chance of survival. Automatic lung cancer detection and segmentation is a challenging task in aspects of segmentation accuracy. This study provides a comprehensive review of current methods and popular techniques which will aid in further research in lung tumor detection and segmentation. This study presents methods and techniques implemented to solve the challenges associated with lung cancer detection and segmentation and compares the approaches with each other. The methods used to evaluate these techniques and the accuracy rates are also discussed and compared to give insight for future research. Although several combination methods have been proposed over the past decade, an effective and efficient model still needs to be improvised for routine use.},

Current research provides general solutions for mitigating privacy risks, but it does not focus on particular platforms. However, the voluntary sharing of personal information on these platforms presents considerable privacy risks, highlighting the need for effective risk assessment mechanisms. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses the fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and game theory to estimate privacy risks on Meta and X. We used a fuzzy AHP to rank determinant variables based on surveys of social media users and professionals. These weighted criteria were then used in a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) framework using cooperative game theory to discover ways to lower privacy hazards. The model accurately analyzed the privacy threats on Meta and X, recommending alternate techniques for preventing breaches in data privacy. The cooperative game theory method allows stakeholders to collaborate on creating privacy-preserving measures. The findings emphasize the model’s ability to address platform-specific privacy threats, as well as its flexibility in other social media settings. The model’s potential for real-world application is demonstrated by its ability to provide practical risk reduction measures, which improve privacy protection for social media users.},

Decision-making processes now hinge on timely data analysis, creating a competitive edge for companies that leverage this asset effectively. As a result, another paradigm shift has occurred: Industry 4.0. This movement integrates digital and physical systems, incorporating automated, intelligent technologies into nearly every industrial process (Lu, 2017). In this data-rich environment, the role of data has become as crucial to industrial success as physical machinery once was (Horlings, 2022). Industry 4.0 represents a profound shift, characterized by the fusion of physical and digital technologies. This revolution harnesses the potential of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and data-driven decision-making to create smart factories and intelligent, selfoptimizing manufacturing processes (Tyagi et al., 2024). Human-Computer Interaction emerges as a cornerstone of this transformation, enabling the design, creation, and optimization of technology with the human element at its core. By improving user interfaces and experiences, HCI offers industries unprecedented levels of productivity, innovation, and personalized solutions.A critical challenge in this transformative era is the development of interfaces that not only facilitate human-machine interaction but also simplify it, ensuring workers can harness the full potential of advanced machinery without being overwhelmed by its complexity.

This framework aims to authenticate communication parties, ensure overall system and network security within SDN environments, and foster trust among users and stakeholders. The experimental analysis focuses on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, particularly those employed in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The CNN algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance on the training dataset, achieving 99.96% accuracy with minimal training time. It also shows favorable results in terms of detection speed, requiring only 1 s, and maintains a low False Alarm Rate (FAR) of 0.02%. Subsequently, the proposed framework was deployed in a testbed SDN environment to evaluate its detection capabilities across diverse network topologies, showcasing its efficiency compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for secure distributed machine learning model training across multiple clients or devices, enabling model training without having to share data across the clients. However, recent studies revealed that FL could be vulnerable to data leakage and reconstruction attacks even if the data itself are never shared with another client. Thus, to resolve such vulnerability and improve the privacy of all clients, a class of techniques, called privacy-preserving FL, incorporates encryption techniques, such as homomorphic encryption (HE), to encrypt and fully protect model information from being exposed to other parties. A downside to this approach is that encryption schemes like HE are very compute-intensive, often causing inefficient and excessive use of client CPU resources that can be used for other uses. To alleviate this issue, this study introduces a novel approach by leveraging smart network interface cards (SmartNICs) to offload compute-intensive HE operations of privacy-preserving FL. By employing SmartNICs as hardware accelerators, we enable efficient computation of HE while saving CPU cycles and other server resources for more critical tasks. In addition, by offloading encryption from the host to another device, the details of encryption remain secure even if the host is compromised, ultimately improving the security of the entire FL system. Given such benefits, this paper presents an FL system named FedNIC that implements the above approach, with an in-depth description of the architecture, implementation, and performance evaluations. Our experimental results demonstrate a more secure FL system with no loss in model accuracy and up to 25% in reduced host CPU cycle, but with a roughly 46% increase in total training time, showing the feasibility and tradeoffs of utilizing SmartNICs as an encryption offload device in federated learning scenarios. Finally, we illustrate promising future study and potential optimizations for a more secure and privacy-preserving federated learning system.},

  abstract     = {Indicators are quantitative or qualitative measures used to gauge various aspects of society and assess change over time (such as monitoring the progress or effectiveness of a public policy). Ideally, indicators should be precisely defined and measured according to harmonized procedures that may not be feasible in practice, especially in domains such as health, where indicators are often derived from preexisting, heterogeneous datasets. Integrating such data has posed a persistent challenge, but semantic technologies offer advantages by enriching data in a relatively simple, linkable, and non-disruptive way. However, without harmonized frameworks, the difficulties associated with data integration are unlikely to be resolved. In this article, we propose a generic, domain-neutral indicator contextualization framework for structuring and linking distributed datasets with contextual metadata according to a standard model. The framework integrates the concepts of the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 11179 metadata registry standard with the common core ontologies (CCO) mid-level ontology suite, and incorporates other semantic technologies to make it adaptable and interoperable within and across domains. Application of the framework to an example indicator illustrates the versatility and adaptability of the approach in a federated data architecture. The contextual information can be dereferenced using standard query tools to provide data users a comprehensive understanding and overview of the indicator. The framework is amenable to deep learning applications via the principles of semantic data models, linked open data, and knowledge organization systems. The ideas are presented to stimulate further reflection and consolidation of standard data contextualization frameworks.},

While accuracy of the recommendations resulted in a significant reduction in trust, this did not differ significantly by AI-application.ConclusionUsing three predefined general knowledge tasks and fixed recommendation sets from the AI-assistant, we did not find evidence that trust in LLM-generated output is artificially inflated, or that people are more likely to miscalibrate their trust in this novel technology than another commonly drawn on form of AI-sourced information.},

Cryptography stands out as a scientific methodology for safeguarding communication against unauthorized access. Within the realm of cryptography, numerous encryption algorithms have been developed to enhance data security. Recognizing the imperative for nonstandard encryption algorithms to counter traditional attacks, this paper puts forth novel encryption techniques. These methods leverage special corona graphs, star graphs, and complete bipartite graphs, incorporating certain algebraic properties to bolster the secure transmission of messages. The introduction of these proposed encryption schemes aims to elevate the level of security in confidential communication, some of the applications of these schemes are given in the later section.},

  abstract     = {Affective artificial intelligence and multimodal sentiment analysis play critical roles in designing safe and effective human-computer interactions and are in diverse applications ranging from social chatbots to eldercare robots. However emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence can also manipulate, persuade, and otherwise compromise human autonomy. We face a constant stream of ever more capable models that can better understand nuanced, complex, and interrelated sentiments across different modalities including text, vision, and speech. This paper introduces MultiSentimentArcs, combination of an open and extensible multimodal sentiment analysis framework, a challenging movie dataset, and a novel benchmark. This enables the quantitative and qualitative identification, comparison, and prioritization of conflicting sentiments commonly arising from different models and modalities. Diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis is especially challenging in film narratives where actors, directors, cinematographers and editors use dialog, characters, and other elements in contradiction with each other to accentuate dramatic tension. MultiSentimentArcs uses local open-source software models to democratize artificial intelligence. We demonstrate how a simple 2-step pipeline of specialized open-source software with a large multimodal model followed by a large language model can approximate video sentiment analysis of a commercial state-of-the-art Claude 3 Opus. To the best of our knowledge, MultiSentimentArcs is the first fully open-source diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis framework, dataset, and benchmark to enable automatic or human-in-the-loop exploration, analysis, and critique of multimodal sentiment analysis on long-form narratives. We demonstrate two novel coherence metrics and a methodology to identify, quantify, and explain real-world sentiment models and modalities. MultiSentimentArcs integrates artificial intelligence with traditional narrative studies and related fields like film, linguistic and cultural studies. It also contributes to eXplainable artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence safety by enhancing artificial intelligence transparency in surfacing emotional persuasion, manipulation, and deception techniques. Finally, it can filter noisy emotional input and prioritize information rich channels to build more performant real-world human computer interface applications in fields like e-learning and medicine. This research contributes to the field of Digital Humanities by giving non-artificial intelligence experts access to directly engage in analysis and critique of research around affective artificial intelligence and human-AI alignment.

  abstract     = {IntroductionEffective delivery of healthcare depends on timely and accurate triage decisions, directing patients to appropriate care pathways and reducing unnecessary visits. Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, particularly those based on Large Language Models (LLMs), may enable non-experts to make better triage decisions at home, thus easing the healthcare system&#39;s load. We investigate how LLM-powered conversational agents influence non-experts in making triage decisions, further studying different persona profiles embedded via prompting.MethodsWe designed a randomized experiment where participants first assessed patient symptom vignettes independently, then consulted one of the two agent profiles—rational or empathic—for advice, and finally revised their triage ratings. We used linear models to quantify the effect of the agent profile and confidence on the weight of advice. We examined changes in confidence and accuracy of triage decisions, along with participants&#39; perceptions of the agents.ResultsIn a study with 49 layperson participants, we found that persona profiles can be differentiated in LLM-powered conversational agents. However, these profiles did not significantly affect the weight of advice. Notably, less confident participants were more influenced by LLM advice, leading to larger adjustments to initial decisions. AI guidance improved alignment with correct triage levels and boosted confidence in participants&#39; decisions.DiscussionWhile LLM advice improves triage recommendations accuracy, confidence plays an important role in its adoption. Our findings raise design considerations for human-AI interfaces, highlighting two key aspects: encouraging appropriate alignment with LLMs&#39; advice and ensuring that people are not easily swayed in situations of uncertainty.},

The proposed map is also highly sensitive to initial values, making it a secure basis for encryption.

  abstract     = {BackgroundThe occurrence of diseases in rice leaves presents a substantial challenge to farmers on a global scale, hence jeopardizing the food security of an expanding global population. The timely identification and prevention of these diseases are of utmost importance in order to mitigate their impact.MethodsThe present study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of contemporary literature pertaining to the identification of rice diseases, covering the period from 2008 to 2023. The process of selecting pertinent studies followed the guidelines outlined by Kitchenham, which ultimately led to the inclusion of 69 studies for the purpose of review. It is worth mentioning that a significant portion of research endeavours have been directed towards studying diseases such as rice brown spot, rice blast, and rice bacterial blight. The primary performance parameter that emerged in the study was accuracy. Researchers strongly advocated for the combination of hybrid deep learning and machine learning methodologies in order to improve the rates of recognition for rice leaf diseases.ResultsThe study presents a comprehensive collection of scholarly investigations focused on the detection and characterization of diseases affecting rice leaves, with specific emphasis on rice brown spot, rice blast, and rice bacterial blight. The prominence of accuracy as a primary performance measure highlights the importance of precision in the detection and diagnosis of diseases. Furthermore, the efficacy of employing hybrid methodologies that combine deep learning and machine learning techniques is exemplified in enhancing the recognition capacities pertaining to diseases affecting rice leaves.ConclusionThis systematic review provides insight into the significant research endeavours conducted by scholars in the field of rice disease detection during the previous decade. The text underscores the significance of precision in evaluation and calls for the implementation of hybrid deep learning and machine learning methodologies to augment disease identification, presenting possible resolutions to the obstacles presented by these agricultural hazards.},

In the present study, we used a more modern paradigm (i.e., app-based tutoring) and commercially-available TTS voices. Second, we asked whether participants provided different social evaluations of non-native-accented and native-accented American English-speaking machines. In the present study, 85 American participants completed a tutoring session with a system designed to look like a device application (we called it a “TutorBot”). Participants were presented with facts related to two topics: ‘love and relationships’ and ‘computers and technology’. Tutoring was provided either by a female or male TTS voice. Participants heard either native-English accented voices or non-native-English accented (here, Castilian Spanish-accented) voices. Overall, we find no effect of voice gender on any of the dependent measures: listeners recalled facts and rated female and male voices equivalently across topics and conditions. Yet, participants rated non-native accented TTS voices as less competent, less knowledgeable, and less helpful after completing the tutoring session. Finally, when participants were tutored on facts related to ‘love and relationships’, they showed better accuracy at recall and provided higher ratings for app competency, likeability, and helpfulness (and knowledgeable, but only for native-accented voices). These results are relevant for theoretical understandings of human-computer interaction, particularly the extent to which human-based social biases are transferred to machines, as well as for applications to voice-AI system design and usage.},

Previous studies often examined its development trends from the perspective of technical advantages or application processes. This study explores the attitudes and acceptance of creative industry practitioners towards Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) from the perspective of user behavior modification. Utilizing the Stimulus-Organism-Response Model (SOR) as the theoretical background, this research integrates the Technology Acceptance Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, and Self-Efficacy to form the research framework. By employing a mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative analyses, data from 226 designers were explored, and structural equation modeling was used to verify the correlations between endogenous factors. The results indicate that users’ facilitating conditions significantly influence self-efficacy, which in turn determines their intention to adopt AIGC. Additionally, semi-structured interviews revealed that factors hindering the widespread application of AIGC mainly encompass legal security, ethical risks, and fairness. This study extends the application scope of the Stimulus-Organism-Response Model (SOR), enriches the Technology Acceptance Model, and provides a new research framework for the application of AIGC in the creative industry, detailing the responsibilities, processes, and content of designers in the Artificial Intelligence Generated Design (AIGD) process.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a recommendation system that merges a knowledge-based (attribute-based) approach with collaborative filtering, specifically addressing the challenges of the pure-cold start scenario in personalized e-learning. The system generates learning recommendations by assessing item similarities, utilizing the Rogers-Tanimoto similarity measure for materials and users, and Jaccard&#39;s similarity for user comparisons. Unlike traditional collaborative methods relying on prior ratings, this approach depends on attributes. Additionally, user and learning material profiling structures were created to serve as fundamental inputs for the recommendation algorithm. These profiles represent student and material knowledge in a two-dimensional space to facilitate matching. Our processes incorporate user learning styles, preferences, and prior knowledge as metrics for achieving the desired level of personalization. The system produces a list of top recommendations based on predicted ratings. To validate its efficacy, a website resembling our learning platform was developed and tested by users. The primary results demonstrate the system&#39;s ability to identify similar users even in a pure cold start condition without existing ratings. Consequently, the system proves its capability in recommending suitable materials, modeling students, and identifying similar user groups. The evaluation results of the proposed system showed a good level of satisfaction by the testimonials, quantified by a score of 82% for the recommended materials (16% higher than exiting cold-start systems), and an average score of 90% in terms of satisfaction about the generated student profiles. As they proved the capability of the framework in recommending suitable materials, and its capability in modeling students, finding similar groups of users.},

We surveyed 428 Japanese residents, including not only game players but also those who watch the game live or are merely aware of its existence. We also interviewed an individual who started rice farming after playing the game. The findings indicate that the game successfully stimulates greater interest in agriculture and somewhat motivates players to consider farming, more than just viewers or those who are aware of it. Moreover, individuals with real-life connections to agriculture, such as farming experience or professional connections, were optimistic about the transition from game to reality. The study suggests that rice farming simulation games can foster expectations of developing an interest in agriculture and potentially embarking on farming careers, demonstrating the game’s significant impact beyond entertainment.},

The reliable ECU identification has the potential to prevent spoofing attacks launched over the CAN due to the lack of message authentication. In this regard, we model the ECU-specific random distortion caused by the imperfections in the digital-to-analog converter and semiconductor impurities in the transmitting ECU for fingerprinting. Afterward, a 4-layered artificial neural network (ANN) is trained on the feature set to identify the transmitting ECU and the corresponding ECU pin. The ECU-pin identification is also a novel contribution of this study and can be used to prevent voltage-based attacks. We have evaluated our method using ANNs over a dataset generated from 7 ECUs with 6 pins, each having 185 records, and 40 records for each pin. The performance evaluation against state-of-the-art methods revealed that the proposed method achieved 99.4% accuracy for ECU identification and 96.7% accuracy for pin identification, which signifies the reliability of the proposed approach.},

The research utilized an action research approach with a pre-test/post-test design for data collection, with results being explored using sentiment-based and thematic analysis. The findings reveal mixed responses from participants which highlighted the usefulness of the exercise but noted that the courses’ focus on technical quality and a lack of adequate preparation hindered the experience, with adequate mentoring and developer support being suggested to improve it. Arts-based approaches to such educational interventions, with a focus on “deep” games, critical play, and values-conscious design throughout the curriculum, are discussed as a potential solution. While game design remains a useful educational tool for engaging with complex societal issues, educators must increasingly ensure they prepare undergraduate students adequately for such creative exercises.},

The registration of heterogeneous data obtained from 2D and 3D sensors is required to create photo-realistic 3D models. However, the alignment of 2D images with 3D models introduces a significant challenge due to their inherent differences. This article introduces a rigorous mathematical approach to align a 360° image with its corresponding 3D model generated from images with known camera poses followed by texture projection on the model. We use Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature descriptors enhanced with a homography-based metric to establish correspondences between the faces of a cubemap and the posed images. To achieve optimal alignment, we use a non-linear least squares optimization technique with a custom objective function. Subsequently, the outcomes of the alignment process are evaluated through texturing using a customized raytracing algorithm. The resulting projections are compared against the original textures, with a comprehensive assessment of the alignment&#39;s fidelity and precision.},

Can greater engagement by CI users in the music mixing process mutually benefit them as well as audio engineers? This paper presents an exploratory mixed-methods study that leverages insights from CI users and professional audio engineers (AEs) in the investigation of techniques to enhance CI user music enjoyment and promote empathetic practices in AEs. Analysis of data collected over a multi-step process of surveys, interviews, and iterative cycles of sound mixing and feedback revealed two mixing strategies—namely essentializing and exaggeration of musical elements—common among mixes preferred by CI users. Participant responses also highlighted systemic ableism and audism in the music industry—an industry from which CI users report feeling excluded. Specifically, AEs felt inadequately trained around aural diversity considerations and experienced anxiety around their own aural diversity. In sum, this work contributes to insights into CI user music listening preferences; how AEs approach mixing for an aurally diverse audience; and discussion around the efficacy of CI simulation, user feedback, and AE peer feedback on mix enjoyment by CI users. Based on these findings, we offer several design insights that emphasize the need for customizable music listening tools centered around user agency and enjoyment.},

  abstract     = {The study of the geometric organization of biological tissues has a rich history in the literature. However, the geometry and architecture of individual cells within tissues has traditionally relied upon manual or indirect measures of shape. Such rudimentary measures are largely a result of challenges associated with acquiring high resolution images of cells and cellular components, as well as a lack of computational approaches to analyze large volumes of high-resolution data. This is especially true with brain tissue, which is composed of a complex array of cells. Here we review computational tools that have been applied to unravel the cellular nanoarchitecture of astrocytes, a type of brain cell that is increasingly being shown to be essential for brain function. Astrocytes are among the most structurally complex and functionally diverse cells in the mammalian body and are essential partner cells of neurons. Light microscopy does not allow adequate resolution of astrocyte morphology, however, large-scale serial electron microscopy data, which provides nanometer resolution 3D models, is enabling the visualization of the fine, convoluted structure of astrocytes. Application of computer vision methods to the resulting nanoscale 3D models is helping reveal the geometry and organizing principles of astrocytes, but a complete understanding of astrocyte structure and its functional implications will require further adaptation of existing computational tools, as well as development of new approaches.},

Software requirements engineering constitutes one of the disciplines in the software development lifecycle. Based on the literature concerning agile-based software requirements engineering, coping with changing user requirements and constant alterations is often challenging. Consequently, both students and software developers must thoroughly grasp agile-based software requirements engineering. Over the last few years, educators and researchers have crafted gamified learning environments for agile-based software requirements engineering activities. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of agile-based software requirements engineering activities through a gamified design approach. For this purpose, an application, ReGile, was developed and evaluated with 87 second and third-year software engineering students using the M-3 evaluation framework. Overall, the results were promising. Students expressed satisfaction with ReGile’s technological usability. They performed well (72.14%) in answering questions related to software requirements engineering and agile methodology concepts. Furthermore, gender-wise results indicated that male students outperformed female students when using ReGile.},

  abstract     = {Security and reliability are primary concerns in any computing paradigm, including quantum computing. Currently, users can access quantum computers through a cloud-based platform where they can run their programs on a suite of quantum computers. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect that more companies including untrusted/less-trusted/unreliable vendors will begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at varied price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue could be long, the users will be motivated to use the cheaper and readily available but unreliable/less-trusted hardware. The less-trusted vendors can tamper with the results, providing a sub-optimal solution to the user. For applications such as, critical infrastructure optimization, the inferior solution may have significant socio-political implications. Since quantum computers cannot be simulated in classical computers, users have no way of verifying the computation outcome. In this paper, we address this challenge by modeling adversarial tampering and simulating it&#39;s impact on both pure quantum and hybrid quantum-classical workloads. To achieve trustworthy computing in a mixed environment of trusted and untrusted hardware, we propose an equitable distribution of total shots (i.e., repeated executions of quantum programs) across hardware options. On average, we note ≈ 30X and ≈ 1.5X improvement across the pure quantum workloads and a maximum improvement of ≈ 5X for hybrid-classical algorithm in the chosen quality metrics. We also propose an intelligent run adaptive shot distribution heuristic leveraging temporal variation in hardware quality to user&#39;s advantage, allowing them to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more number of shots to the reliable hardware, which results in a maximum improvement of ≈ 190X and ≈ 9X across the pure quantum workloads and an improvement of up to ≈ 2.5X for hybrid-classical algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Recent research shows that Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) are effective for Salient Object Detection (SOD), a challenging computer vision task that mimics the way human vision focuses on important parts of an image. However, implementing cGANs for this task has presented several complexities, including instability during training with skip connections, weak generators, and difficulty in capturing context information for challenging images. These challenges are particularly evident when dealing with input images containing small salient objects against complex backgrounds, underscoring the need for careful design and tuning of cGANs to ensure accurate segmentation and detection of salient objects. To address these issues, we propose an innovative method for SOD using a cGAN framework. Our method utilizes encoder-decoder framework as the generator component for cGAN, enhancing the feature extraction process and facilitating accurate segmentation of the salient objects. We incorporate Wasserstein-1 distance within the cGAN training process to improve the accuracy of finding the salient objects and stabilize the training process. Additionally, our enhanced model efficiently captures intricate saliency cues by leveraging the spatial attention gate with global average pooling and regularization. The introduction of global average pooling layers in the encoder and decoder paths enhances the network&#39;s global perception and fine-grained detail capture, while the channel attention mechanism, facilitated by dense layers, dynamically modulates feature maps to amplify saliency cues. The generated saliency maps are evaluated by the discriminator for authenticity and gives feedback to enhance the generator&#39;s ability to generate high-resolution saliency maps. By iteratively training the discriminator and generator networks, the model achieves improved results in finding the salient object. We trained and validated our model using large-scale benchmark datasets commonly used for salient object detection, namely DUTS, ECSSD, and DUT-OMRON. Our approach was evaluated using standard performance metrics on these datasets. Precision, recall, MAE and Fβ score metrics are used to evaluate performance. Our method achieved the lowest MAE values: 0.0292 on the ECSSD dataset, 0.033 on the DUTS-TE dataset, and 0.0439 on the challenging and complex DUT-OMRON dataset, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in salient object detection, highlighting its potential benefits for real-life applications.},

  abstract     = {Many deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), learn an immersion mapping from a standard normal distribution in a low-dimensional latent space into a higher-dimensional data space. As such, these mappings are only capable of producing simple data topologies, i.e., those equivalent to an immersion of Euclidean space. In this work, we demonstrate the limitations of such latent space generative models when trained on data distributions with non-trivial topologies. We do this by training these models on synthetic image datasets with known topologies (spheres, torii, etc.). We then show how this results in failures of both data generation as well as data interpolation. Next, we compare this behavior to two classes of deep generative models that in principle allow for more complex data topologies. First, we look at chart autoencoders (CAEs), which construct a smooth data manifold from multiple latent space chart mappings. Second, we explore score-based models, e.g., denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which estimate gradients of the data distribution without resorting to an explicit mapping to a latent space. Our results show that these models do demonstrate improved ability over latent space models in modeling data distributions with complex topologies, however, challenges still remain.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe dynamic and sophisticated nature of phishing attacks, coupled with the relatively weak anti-phishing tools, has made phishing detection a pressing challenge. In light of this, new gaps have emerged in phishing detection, including the challenges and pitfalls of existing phishing detection techniques. To bridge these gaps, this study aims to develop a more robust, effective, sophisticated, and reliable solution for phishing detection through the optimal feature vectorization algorithm (OFVA) and supervised machine learning (SML) classifiers.MethodsInitially, the OFVA was utilized to extract the 41 optimal intra-URL features from a novel large dataset comprising 2,74,446 raw URLs (134,500 phishing and 139,946 legitimate URLs). Subsequently, data cleansing, curation, and dimensionality reduction were performed to remove outliers, handle missing values, and exclude less predictive features. To identify the optimal model, the study evaluated and compared 15 SML algorithms arising from different machine learning (ML) families, including Bayesian, nearest-neighbors, decision trees, neural networks, quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, bagging, boosting, random forests, and ensembles. The evaluation was performed based on various metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve analysis. Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning (using Grid-search) and k-fold cross-validation were performed to optimize the detection accuracy.Results and discussionThe findings indicate that random forests (RF) outperformed the other classifiers, achieving a greater accuracy rate of 97.52%, followed by 97.50% precision, and an AUC value of 97%. Finally, a more robust and lightweight anti-phishing model was introduced, which can serve as an effective tool for security experts, practitioners, and policymakers to combat phishing attacks.},

The current situation is characterized by the need for more objective and reliable methods to assess pain, especially in patients who cannot effectively communicate their experiences, such as young children or critically ill individuals. Despite technological advances, the effective integration of artificial intelligence tools for multifaceted and accurate pain detection continues to present significant challenges. Our proposal addresses this problem through an interdisciplinary approach, developing a hybrid model that combines the analysis of facial gestures and paralanguage using artificial intelligence techniques. This model contributes significantly to the field, allowing for more objective, accurate, and sensitive pain detection to individual variations. The results obtained have been notable, with our model achieving a precision of 92%, a recall of 90%, and a specificity of 95%, demonstrating evident efficiency over conventional methodologies. The clinical implications of this model include the possibility of significantly improving pain assessment in various medical settings, allowing for faster and more accurate interventions, thereby improving patients’ quality of life.},

  abstract     = {Various applications use asymmetric cryptography to secure communications between both parties, and it raises the main issue of generating vast amounts of computation and storage. Thus, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a methodology that emerged to overcome this issue using its low computation and generation of small keys with its strong encryption strategy. ECC is becoming mandatory and used mostly for public key encryption protocols. ECC has expanded cumulative acceptance in practice due to the reduced bit magnitude of operands compared to RSA for safety level. Previously, protocols designed for ECC suggested calculation of scalar development and it was accomplished in finite fields as projective, affine, and Jacobian simulations of coordinates. Arithmetic operations in a limited area establish the core benefits of the ECC algorithm. Even though ECC generated an issue of complex key generation using its curve formation, to overcome this issue a hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems (HECC) is proposed in this study. HECC perform ECC in the Public Key Cryptography (PKC) domain. This study presented an optimization-based key generation and made a random selection of integers for encrypting the message. Selecting a prime number as the private key and multiplying it to the encrypted message to generate a public key is done. This encrypted message is mapped to the curve to check whether it satisfies the curve equation or not. Once an encrypted message is obtained, it is then sent to a second party for pursuing the message. On the side of the second party, a reverse process called decryption takes place. Thus, a secured transmission of data communication takes place. Implementing this algorithm in MATLAB resulted in 94% accuracy and an error of 6%, which was a higher performance ratio than previous methods.},

We present an empirical study that evaluates and contrasts four commonly employed annotation methods in user studies focused on in-the-wild data collection. For both the user-driven, in situ annotations, where participants annotate their activities during the actual recording process, and the recall methods, where participants retrospectively annotate their data at the end of each day, the participants had the flexibility to select their own set of activity classes and corresponding labels. Our study illustrates that different labeling methodologies directly impact the annotations&#39; quality, as well as the capabilities of a deep learning classifier trained with the data. We noticed that in situ methods produce less but more precise labels than recall methods. Furthermore, we combined an activity diary with a visualization tool that enables the participant to inspect and label their activity data. Due to the introduction of such a tool were able to decrease missing annotations and increase the annotation consistency, and therefore the F1-Score of the deep learning model by up to 8% (ranging between 82.1 and 90.4% F1-Score). Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods compared in our study, the biases they could introduce, and the consequences of their usage on human activity recognition studies as well as possible solutions.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) has become an interesting research domain as numerous devices, preferably equipped with sensors, communication, and actuator modules, are deployed to capture real-time data in the different application areas, such as smart healthcare and industries. These devices have the built-in capacity to directly interact with the physical phenomenon and report any unusual situation within their respective coverage areas, i.e., monitoring a critical patient in the smart hospital but direct communication with a common destination module is not guaranteed and could possibly be very challenging if two or more devices, preferably those in closed proximity, are interested to transmit simultaneously. Therefore, in this manuscript, we are going to present a hybrid slot allocation approach, which is specifically designed for those devices resided in neighborhood and are eager to communication concurrently with a common destination device, i.e., server. In the beginning, the k-mean clustering algorithm is used to group these devices into clusters where server is forced to collect data from devices deployed in the respective coverage areas. Thus, every server generates dedicated slots for active devices and an additional slot for server(s). Similarly, the proposed neighborhood-enabled time division multiple access (TDMA) has the flexibility of assigning multiple slots to a requesting device if available, which is needed in scenarios, such as detection of pest in the field. Additionally, a member device is allowed to migrate (if needed and possible) from one server&#39;s coverage region to another. Simulation results confirmed that the proposed approach is better than the existing algorithms (opportunistic TDMA, hybrid TDMA, and non-orthogonal multiple access), particularly in terms of bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and empty slot utilization. The proposed scheme has improved bandwidth and empty slot utilization, which are approximately 15% and 12%, respectively, whereas it has achieved approximately 94.89% utilization of the available slots which was previously 93.4%.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing a robot in a new application requires the robot to be programmed at each time. To reduce such programmings efforts, we have been developing “Learning-from-observation (LfO)” that automatically generates robot programs by observing human demonstrations. So far, our previous research has been in the industrial domain. From now on, we want to expand the application field to the household-service domain. One of the main issues with introducing this LfO system into the domain is the cluttered environments, which makes it difficult to discern which movements of the human body parts and their relationships with environment objects are crucial for task execution when observing demonstrations. To overcome this issue, it is necessary for the system to have task common-sense shared with the human demonstrator to focus on the demonstrator&#39;s specific movements. Here, task common-sense is defined as the movements humans take almost unconsciously to streamline or optimize the execution of a series of tasks. In this paper, we extract and define three types of task common-sense (semi-conscious movements) that should be focused on when observing demonstrations of household tasks and propose representations to describe them. Specifically, the paper proposes to use labanotation to describe the whole-body movements with respect to the environment, contact-webs to describe the hand-finger movements with respect to the tool for grasping, and physical and semantic constraints to describe the movements of the hand with the tool with respect to the environment. Based on these representations, the paper formulates task models, machine-independent robot programs, that indicate what-to-do and where-to-do. In this design process, the necessary and sufficient set of task models to be prepared in the task-model library are determined on the following criteria: for grasping tasks, according to the classification of contact-webs along the purpose of the grasping, and for manipulation tasks, corresponding to possible transitions between states defined by either physical constraints and semantic constraints. The skill-agent library is also prepared to collect skill-agents corresponding to tasks. The skill-agents in the library are pre-trained using reinforcement learning with the reward functions designed based on the physical and semantic constraints to execute the task when specific parameters are provided. Third, the paper explains the task encoder to obtain task models and task decoder to execute the task models on the robot hardware. The task encoder understands what-to-do from the verbal input and retrieves the corresponding task model in the library. Next, based on the knowledge of each task, the system focuses on specific parts of the demonstration to collect where-to-do parameters for executing the task. The decoder constructs a sequence of skill-agents retrieving from the skill-agnet library corresponding and inserts those parameters obtained from the demonstration into these skill-agents, allowing the robot to perform task sequences with following the Labanotation postures. Finally, this paper presents how the system actually works through several example scenes.},

  abstract     = {This research explores critical aspects of the ongoing educational transition from traditional two-dimensional digital platforms toward immersive realities in the metaverse. In this work, a networked, collaborative, ubiquitous, and immersive platform, “EduX” is developed to host different educational sessions. Several metrics are tracked and compared with parallel sessions using traditional digital platforms used by educational institutions, particularly during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, such as Zoom, MS Teams, and Black Board Ultra as the Learning Management System. Four groups of students from different domains of knowledge (n = 396) participated in the study, whereby each group was split into two subgroups, taking their session via EduX and BBUltra, followed by post-assessments and discussions. Using a mixed methods approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed to examine the influence of the platform on engagement, performance, and overall student achievements. The discussed results demonstrate superior usability and user experience levels of the proposed platform, with higher levels of engagement, leading to significantly improved attainments. Other than demonstrating the efficacy and feasibility of the platform, this work establishes fundamental metrics to be considered by software and hardware solution providers, academic institutions, and the research community concerned with the convergence towards immersive technologies.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of devices such as sensors for collecting data, actuators that perform mechanical actions on the sensor&#39;s collected data, and gateways used as an interface for effective communication with the external world. The IoT has been successfully applied to various fields, from small households to large industries. The IoT environment consists of heterogeneous networks and billions of devices increasing daily, making the system more complex and this need for privacy and security of IoT devices become a major concern. The critical components of IoT are device identification, a large number of sensors, hardware operating systems, and IoT semantics and services. The layers of a core IoT application are presented in this paper with the protocols used in each layer. The security challenges at various IoT layers are unveiled in this review paper along with the existing mitigation strategies such as machine learning, deep learning, lightweight encryption techniques, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to overcome these security challenges and future scope. It has been concluded after doing an intensive review that Spoofing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are two of the most common attacks in IoT applications. While spoofing tricks systems by impersonating devices, DDoS attacks flood IoT systems with traffic. IoT security is also compromised by other attacks, such as botnet attacks, man-in-middle attacks etc. which call for strong defenses including IDS framework, deep neural networks, and multifactor authentication system.},

This study presents a user-centric evaluation of an intelligent context-aware alert system, tailored for small-scale greenhouse farming. We employed standardized questionnaires, including the NASA Task Load Index and the User Experience Questionnaire, to assess the system&#39;s perceived utility, mental workload, and overall user experience. Our findings reveal the high perceived utility of the system among farmers. Farmers participating in the assessment indicated a strong intention to utilize the system for crop monitoring. Moreover, the system demonstrated a moderate mental workload, suggesting ease of use and potential acceptance by users. Our evaluation highlighted an excellent user experience, with scores ranging from very good to extremely good across all dimensions. Furthermore, user preferences for alert mechanisms underscored the importance of adaptable notifications, with voice and text alerts favored for comprehensive information dissemination. Light and voice alerts were preferred during manual tasks. This study highlights the significance of user-centered design in agricultural technology, offering insights to enhance the usability and the adoption of alert systems in small-scale farming environments. The positive reception of the system&#39;s utility and the moderate mental workload suggest that such technology can be readily adopted by farmers, thereby improving monitoring and management practices in greenhouse farming. The preference for adaptable alert mechanisms further emphasizes the need for flexible and context-sensitive solutions in agricultural technology.},

Several parallel libraries exist for performing hashmap operations utilizing GPU hardware, but none have yet supported GPUs and CPUs interchangeably. We introduce Hashinator, a novel portable hashmap designed to operate efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs using CUDA or HIP/ROCm Unified Memory, offering host access methods, in-kernel access methods, and efficient GPU offloading capability on both NVIDIA and AMD hardware. Hashinator utilizes open addressing with Fibonacci hashing and power-of-two capacity.

The states that are induced by component failures are represented using a state-space model. The research continues by suggesting a hybrid microgrid reliability model that analyzes data using a Markov process. Problems arise when trying to estimate reliability metrics for the microgrid using data that is both restricted and imprecise. This is why the study takes uncertainties into account to make microgrid reliability estimations more realistic. The importance of microgrid components concerning their overall availability is evaluated using fuzzy sets and reliability assessments. The study uses numerical analysis and then carefully considers the outcomes. The overall availability of hybrid microgrids is 0.99999.},

Similar to all emerging techniques, CSSD has its own benefits and challenges. Some unique challenges arise when CSSD is used with Agile methodology. This is because many characteristics of CSSD differ from Agile principles. CSSD is a distributed approach where workers are unknown to each other, whereas Agile advocates teamness and is mostly suitable for colocated teams. Many organizations are now combining crowdsourcing software development (CSSD) and Agile methodologies, yet there is limited understanding on the implications of this integration. It is crucial to emphasize the human factors at play when implementing Agile alongside CSSD. This involves considering how teams interact, communicate, and adapt within these frameworks. By recognizing these dynamics, organizations can better navigate the complexities of integrating CSSD and Agile, ultimately fostering more efficient and collaborative development processes.MethodThis study aimed to explore the human factors involved in the integration of CSSD with Agile, by identifying the challenges that practitioners face when they follow Agile with CSSD and the strategies they follow. The study contributes by providing an in-depth understanding of a new approach, CSSD, integrated with Agile.

By analyzing this signal, eye blink activity can be accurately identified. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed solution were evaluated through five distinct scenarios involving eight participants. Utilizing a user-dependent detection method with a customized predefined threshold value, an average precision of 92% and a recall of 94% were achieved.

Our approach combines textual and syntactic techniques, employing a support vector machine (SVM) to effectively combine various indicators of similarity and calculate the resulting similarity scores. The algorithm was trained and tested using a sample of code submissions of 4 coding problems each from 45 volunteers; 15 of these were original submissions while the other 30 were plagiarized samples. The submissions of two of the questions was used for training and the other two for testing-using the leave-p-out cross-validation strategy to avoid overfitting. We compare the performance of the proposed method with two widely used tools-MOSS and JPlag—and find that the proposed method results in a small but significant improvement in accuracy compared to JPlag, while significantly outperforming MOSS in flagging plagiarized samples.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, concerns over the potential negative impacts of social network sites (SNS) on users’ digital wellbeing are on the rise. These concerns have sparked a growing demand for SNS to introduce changes to their business model and offer features that prioritize users’ wellbeing, even if it means introducing fees to users. Still, it is questionable whether such a new model is welcomed by users and commercially valid. In this paper, we investigate (i) people’s willingness to pay (WTP) for digital wellbeing services designed to foster more autonomy, control, and personal growth in users and (ii) the influence of sociodemographic variables, personality, and social networks use disorder (SNUD) on WTP. Data were collected through an online survey with participants from two distinct cultural contexts, the European and Arabic. The samples comprised 262 participants from Europe (Males: 57.63%) and 251 from Arab countries (Males: 60.56%). The participants ranged in age from 18 to 66 years (MEurope = 29.16, SD = 8.42; MArab = 31.24, SD = 8.23). The results revealed that a notable proportion of participants were willing to pay for digital wellbeing services (Europe: 24%; Arab: 30%). Females in the European sample demonstrated a higher WTP for “Mental Health Issues Minimization” compared to males. In the Arab sample, males showed a higher WTP for “Safeguarding Data Privacy” than females. Multiple regression analyses revealed that SNUD and the need for cognition emerged as significant and positive predictors of WTP in both the European and Arab samples. Differences in the relations of personality traits and sociodemographic variables on WTP in each sample were noted. These insights contribute to our understanding of the factors shaping individuals’ preferences and valuation related to digital wellbeing services on SNS and highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic variables and personal factors as well as cultural contexts when planning and introducing them.},

Thus, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) was developed to combat malicious network attacks. However, IDSs still struggle with accuracy, false alarms, and detecting new intrusions. Therefore, organizations are using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms in IDS for more accurate attack detection. This paper provides an overview of IDS, including its classes and methods, the detected attacks as well as the dataset, metrics, and performance indicators used. A thorough examination of recent publications on IDS-based solutions is conducted, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, as well as a discussion of their potential implications, research challenges, and new trends. We believe that this comprehensive review paper covers the most recent advances and developments in ML and DL-based IDS, and also facilitates future research into the potential of emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address the growing complexity of cybersecurity challenges.},

In settings where such labeled data may be scarce, there may be value in exploiting cheaper or more readily available data through clinical trials, such as Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO).MethodsThis study demonstrates the utility of such measurements for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation, whereby an encoder network is first trained to regress synthetic “Pseudo-RANO” measurements using a mean squared error loss with cosine similarity penalty to promote orthogonality of the principal axes. Using oriented bounding-boxes to measure overlap with the ground truth, we show that the encoder model can reliably estimate tumor principal axes with good performance. The trained encoder was combined with a randomly initialized decoder for fine-tuning as a U-Net architecture for whole tumor (WT) segmentation.ResultsOur results demonstrate that weakly supervised encoder models converge faster than those trained without pre-training and help minimize the annotation burden when trained to perform segmentation.DiscussionThe use of cheap, low-fidelity labels in the context allows for both faster and more stable training with fewer densely segmented ground truth masks, which has potential uses outside this particular paradigm.},

The reliability issues raised with specific supporting technologies for each tier according to the layered IoT reliability are initially described in this research. The research then offers a complete review and assessment of IoT reliability. In this paper, various types of reliability on the IoT have been analyzed with each layer of IoT to solve the issues of failure rates, latency, MTTF, and MTBF. Each parameter has a certain classification and perception as well as enhancement in efficiency, accuracy, precision, timeliness, and completeness. Reliability models provide efficient solutions for different IoT problems, which are mirrored in the proposed study and classified with four types of reliabilities. The field of IoT reliability exploration is still in its initial phases, despite a sizable research record. Furthermore, the recent case study of CHISS is elaborated with discovered behaviors including brand-new aspects such as the multifaceted nature of evolving IoT systems, research opportunities, and difficulties.},

This study introduces an advanced four-input Improved Gate Diffusion Input (IGDI) design specifically for QCA technology as a universal gate. A key feature of the proposed 10-cell block is the absence of cross-wiring, which significantly enhances the circuit’s operational efficiency. Its universal cell nature allows for the carrying out of various logical gates by merely altering input values, without necessitating any structural redesign. The proposed design showcases notable advancements over prior models, including a reduced cell count by 17%, a 29% decrease in total energy usage, and a 44% reduction in average energy loss. This innovative IGDI design efficiently executes 21 combinational and various sequential functions. Simulations in 18 nm technology, accompanied by energy consumption analyses, demonstrate this design’s superior performance compared to existing models in key areas such as multiplexers, comparators, and memory circuits, alongside a significant reduction in cell count.},

One of the significant technical problems lies in the difficulty of building complex transformations from the composition of small and reusable transformations. Another problem resides in developing transformations from scratch in case they are missing. In this paper, we present an approach to how to handle these issues. The approach allows composing reusable transformations to build more complex ones by providing a catalog of prebuilt transformations targeting common architectures, frameworks, and design patterns. To give guidance and simplify the task of developing new transformations, we describe a platform description model of an entire system or a part of it in two views: a UML profile and a set of transformations. We also present three transformation types, each of which handles different abstraction design concerns. Generic transformations are small and reusable to build complex transformations, system-independent transformations are reusable and implement high-level design decisions, and system-specific transformations are not reusable and implement all design decisions needed for a given system. The approach is implemented as a plugin for a UML modeling tool and validated by developing a system that simulates the behavior of a gas station through model transformations built from the composition of reusable transformations.},

In recent works we demonstrated how such a problem could be cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that can be embedded onto the D-Wave Advantage™ quantum annealer system, demonstrating proof of principle. Our initial studies left open the possibility for improvement of D-Wave solutions via judicious choices of system run parameters. Here we report on our investigations for optimizing these system parameters, and how we incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to further improve on the quality of solutions. In particular, we use the Hamming distance to investigate correlations between various system-run parameters and solution vectors. We then apply a decision tree neural network (NN) to learn these correlations, with the goal of using the neural network to provide further guesses to solution vectors. We successfully implement this NN in a simple integer linear programming (ILP) example, demonstrating how the NN can fully map out the solution space that was not captured by D-Wave. We find, however, for the 3-node network problem the NN is not able to enhance the quality of space of solutions.},

  abstract     = {Computational cost in metaheuristics such as Evolutionary Algorithm (EAs) is often a major concern, particularly with their ability to scale. In data-based training, traditional EAs typically use a significant portion, if not all, of the dataset for model training and fitness evaluation in each generation. This makes EA suffer from high computational costs incurred during the fitness evaluation of the population, particularly when working with large datasets. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Machine Learning (ML)-driven Distance-based Selection (DBS) algorithm that reduces the fitness evaluation time by optimizing test cases. We test our algorithm by applying it to 24 benchmark problems from Symbolic Regression (SR) and digital circuit domains and then using Grammatical Evolution (GE) to train models using the reduced dataset. We use GE to test DBS on SR and produce a system flexible enough to test it on digital circuit problems further. The quality of the solutions is tested and compared against state-of-the-art and conventional training methods to measure the coverage of training data selected using DBS, i.e., how well the subset matches the statistical properties of the entire dataset. Moreover, the effect of optimized training data on run time and the effective size of the evolved solutions is analyzed. Experimental and statistical evaluations of the results show our method empowered GE to yield superior or comparable solutions to the baseline (using the full datasets) with smaller sizes and demonstrates computational efficiency in terms of speed.},

The series of annealing experiments which led us to these results, however, did not follow a straight-line path; rather, they involved a convoluted trial-and-error process, full of failed or partially-failed attempts and backtracks, which only in the end drove us to find the successful annealing strategies. In this paper, we delve into the reasoning behind our experimental decisions and provide an account of some of the attempts we have taken before conceiving the final strategies that allowed us to achieve the results. This involves also a bunch of ideas, techniques, and strategies we investigated which, although turned out to be inferior wrt. those we adopted in the end, may instead provide insights to a more-specialized audience of D-Wave users and practitioners. In particular, we show the following insights: (i) different initialization techniques affect performances, among which flux biases are effective when targeting locally-structured embeddings; (ii) chain strengths have a lower impact in locally-structured embeddings compared to problem relying on global embeddings; (iii) there is a trade-off between broken chain and excited CFAs, suggesting an incremental annealing offset remedy approach based on the modules instead of single qubits. Thus, by sharing the details of our experiences, we aim to provide insights into the evolving landscape of quantum annealing, and help people access and effectively use D-Wave quantum annealers.},

The series of problems we study are especially designed instances of the maximum cardinality matching problem that are easy to solve classically but difficult for SA and, as found experimentally, not easy for QA either. In addition to using several D-Wave processors, we simulate the QA process by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We find that the embedded problems can be significantly more difficult than the unembedded problems, and some parameters, such as the chain strength, can be very impactful for finding the optimal solution. Thus, finding a good embedding and optimal parameter values can improve the results considerably. Interestingly, we find that although SA succeeds for the unembedded problems, the SA results obtained for the embedded version scale quite poorly in comparison with what we can achieve on the D-Wave quantum annealers.},

Participants, who were native speakers of American English and self-classified themselves according to how frequently they used voice-AI assistants, listened to statements produced by neural text-to-speech in either an American English or British English accent. They then rated the credibility of both the information content and the voice itself, along several dimensions. Results showed that in multiple conditions, participants perceived information delivered by British-accented voices as more credible than that delivered by American English-accented voices. Furthermore, frequency-of-use exerted a significant effect on perceived trustworthiness of a voice. These findings have implications for the ethical design of voice-AI systems, and for human-computer interaction more generally.},

However, it is difficult to recognize object roughness/textures through tactile feedback due to the surface features cannot be acquired with equipped sensors. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether different object roughness/textures can be classified using machine vision and utilized for human-machine haptic interaction. Based on practical application, two classes of specialized datasets, the roughness dataset consisted of different spacing/shapes/height distributions of the surface bulges and the texture dataset included eight types of representative surface textures, were separately established to train the respective classification models. Four kinds of typical deep learning models (YOLOv5l, SSD300, ResNet18, ResNet34) were employed to verify the identification accuracies of surface features corresponding to different roughness/textures. The human fingers&#39; ability to objects roughness recognition also was quantified through a psychophysical experiment with 3D-printed test objects, as a reference benchmark. The computation results showed that the average roughness recognition accuracies based on SSD300, ResNet18, ResNet34 were higher than 95%, which were superior to those of the human fingers (94% and 91% for 2 and 3 levels of object roughness, respectively). The texture recognition accuracies with all models were higher than 84%. Outcomes indicate that object roughness/textures can be effectively classified using machine vision and exploited for human-machine haptic interaction, providing the feasibility of functional sensory restoration of intelligent robots equipped with visual capture and tactile stimulation devices.},

However, the motivation driving individuals to utilize these platforms, particularly in the Middle East, remains unclear. While numerous studies have explored technology adoption, limited research has investigated social media usage in the UAE. Therefore, this study proposes and empirically analyzes a framework based on a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model to understand the factors influencing users’ opinions, objectives, and actual usage of social media platforms, focusing on Facebook.MethodsTo investigate these factors, we employed structural equation modeling and smart PLS techniques on a sample of 540 participants. We aimed to identify predictors such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, as well as a hedonic dimension encompassing perceived enjoyment, curiosity, and perceived connectedness, in shaping users’ attitudes towards Facebook usage. Additionally, we examined the relationship between social presence and users’ intentions to use Facebook.ResultsOur analysis revealed that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are significant predictors of users’ attitudes towards utilizing Facebook. Furthermore, the hedonic dimension, comprising perceived enjoyment, curiosity, and perceived connectedness, also plays a crucial role in shaping users’ attitudes. Moreover, social presence was found to have a significant association with users’ intentions to use Facebook.DiscussionThese findings contribute to our understanding of the factors influencing the adoption and usage of social media platforms, particularly in the context of the UAE. By highlighting the importance of both utilitarian and hedonic aspects, this research provides insights into the complex motivations behind individuals’ acceptance of dynamic applications like Facebook. Furthermore, our empirical model lays the groundwork for exploring additional factors that may influence the uptake of information systems and social media utilities, thereby advancing attitude-behavior theories in this domain.},

  abstract     = {A public key infrastructure-enabled system authentication model is developed to provide essential security functions for Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). An intelligent transportation system is provided by VANET, an emerging technology. Dedicated short-range communication is used to disseminate messages wirelessly. Communications may be hacked, and messages can be stolen or fabricated. Hence, authenticated communication is crucial in the VANET environment. Some parameters such as trust, authentication, privacy, and security are at high risk. This article suggests a VANET with secure authentication and trust-based clustering mechanisms to provide stable and secure communication. Initially, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine learning algorithm (RBMA) is used to select the cluster head, which depends upon trust, vehicle lifetime, and buffer level. Then, cluster members are formed, followed by grouping. Diffie–Hellman Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography and cryptographic hash functions are used by signcryption for secure communication in VANET. Therefore, the essential component of the key agreement strategy that will give superior authentication is this signcryption mechanism. Over the medium access protocol layer, all of these security characteristics are updated. The proposed method of clustering signcryption key agreement scheme (CSKAS) approach reduces time complexity and increases packet delivery ratio which is vital in providing stable, secure communication.},

Human speech patterns toward voice-AI presents a test to our scientific understanding about speech communication and language use. First, work exploring how human-AI interactions are similar to, or different from, human-human interactions in the realm of speech variation is reviewed. In particular, we focus on studies examining how users adapt their speech when resolving linguistic misunderstandings by computers and when accommodating their speech toward devices. Next, we consider work that investigates how top-down factors in the interaction can influence users’ linguistic interpretations of speech produced by technological agents and how the ways in which speech is generated (via text-to-speech synthesis, TTS) and recognized (using automatic speech recognition technology, ASR) has an effect on communication. Throughout this review, we aim to bridge both HCI frameworks and theoretical linguistic models accounting for variation in human speech. We also highlight findings in this growing area that can provide insight to the cognitive and social representations underlying linguistic communication more broadly. Additionally, we touch on the implications of this line of work for addressing major societal issues in speech technology.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionA remarkable phenomenon in perception is that the visual system spontaneously organizes sets of discrete elements into abstract shape representations. We studied perceptual performance with dot displays to discover what spatial relationships support shape perception.MethodsIn Experiment 1, we tested conditions that lead dot arrays to be perceived as smooth contours vs. having vertices. We found that the perception of a smooth contour vs. a vertex was influenced by spatial relations between dots beyond the three points that define the angle of the point in question. However, there appeared to be a hard boundary around 90° such that any angle 90° or less was perceived as a vertex regardless of the spatial relations of ancillary dots. We hypothesized that dot arrays whose triplets were perceived as smooth curves would be more readily perceived as a unitary object because they can be encoded more economically. In Experiment 2, we generated dot arrays with and without such “vertex triplets” and compared participants’ phenomenological reports of a unified shape with smooth curves vs. shapes with angular corners. Observers gave higher shape ratings for dot arrays from curvilinear shapes. In Experiment 3, we tested shape encoding using a mental rotation task. Participants judged whether two dot arrays were the same or different at five angular differences. Subjects responded reliably faster for displays without vertex triplets, suggesting economical encoding of smooth displays. We followed this up in Experiment 4 using a visual search task. Shapes with and without vertex triplets were embedded in arrays with 25 distractor dots. Participants were asked to detect which display in a 2IFC paradigm contained a shape against a distractor with random dots. Performance was better when the dots were sampled from a smooth shape than when they were sampled from a shape with vertex triplets.Results and discussionThese results suggest that the visual system processes dot arrangements as coherent shapes automatically using precise smoothness constraints. This ability may be a consequence of processes that extract curvature in defining object shape and is consistent with recent theory and evidence suggesting that 2D contour representations are composed of constant curvature primitives.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming an increasingly important concept in various areas of our daily lives. With the development of information and communication technologies, the possibilities of IoT implementation are also expanding. The retail sector is also starting to make more significant use of IoT to improve and increase the efficiency of its business processes and more effective interaction with customers. Even though several partial IoT solutions have been implemented in retail, according to publicly available sources, there is no comprehensive IoT implementation in this sector. Therefore, we focused on the possibilities of creating a comprehensive proposal for the use of IoT in a retail enterprise in Slovakia. The main reasons for this transformation are the development of intelligent technologies, the increased demand of consumers for more convenient purchases and the efficiency of business processes, as well as to increase the competitiveness of the company. The aim of the contribution is to create a proposal for the implementation of IoT in retail, which will contribute to the sustainable development and competitiveness of the company. The result of the contribution is the creation of a proposal for the integration of the Internet of Things in retail, while the proposal is also applicable in other similar enterprises. The research methodology includes secondary sources and primary inquiry using an online questionnaire. The results of the primary research showed that a large part of respondents are interested in using IoT solutions in retail and that the implementation of these solutions affects their purchasing behavior. The conclusions of the paper indicate that the implementation of IoT solutions in retail would have a positive impact on the competitiveness of businesses. Factors that influence the choice of brick-and-mortar and online stores by customers were also identified. Customers’ interest in IoT solutions, as well as their preferences when choosing stores, represent a guideline for businesses operating in the retail sector. The implementation of the proposed solutions is relatively demanding on financial resources, therefore a good financial condition of the company is a necessary condition. Further research should focus on the security risks, barriers, ethical privacy issues associated with the use of IoT in retail stores.},

This research demonstrates how cyber defenders can increase their capabilities by joining forces with eXplainable-AI (XAI) utilizing interactive human-machine collaboration. With a global shortfall of cyber defenders there is a need to amplify their skills using AI. Cyber asymmetries make propositional machine learning techniques impractical. Human reasoning and skill is a key ingredient in defense and must be embedded in the AI framework. For Human-Machine collaboration to work requires that the AI is an ultra-strong machine learner and can explain its models. Unlike Deep Learning, Inductive Logic Programming can communicate what it learns to a human. An empirical study was undertaken using six months of eavesdropped network traffic from an organization generating up-to 562K network events daily. Easier-to-defend devices were identified using a form of the Good-Turing Frequency estimator which is a promising form of volatility measure. A behavioral cloning grammar in explicit symbolic form was then produced from a single device&#39;s network activity using the compression algorithm SEQUITUR. A novel visualization was generated to allow defenders to identify network sequences they wish to explain. Interactive Inductive Logic Programming (the XAI) is supplied the network traffic meta data, sophisticated pre-existing cyber security background knowledge, and one recurring sequence of events from a single device to explain. A co-inductive process between the human cyber defender and the XAI where the human is able to understand, then refute and shape the XAI&#39;s developing model, to produce a model that conforms with the data as well as the original device designers programming.

The success of these models is often attributed to an extremely large number of trainable parameters and an abundance of training data, with limited or no understanding of the underlying data manifold. In this article, we explore the possibility of learning a deep generative model that is structured to better capture the underlying manifold&#39;s geometry, to effectively improve image generation while providing implicit controlled generation by design. Our approach structures the latent space into multiple disjoint representations capturing different attribute manifolds. The global representations are guided by a disentangling loss for effective attribute representation learning and a differential manifold divergence loss to learn an effective implicit generative model. Experimental results on a 3D shapes dataset demonstrate the model&#39;s ability to disentangle attributes without direct supervision and its controllable generative capabilities. These findings underscore the potential of structuring deep generative models to enhance image generation and attribute control without direct supervision with ground truth attributes signaling progress toward more sophisticated deep generative models.},

  abstract     = {Dependable utilization of computer vision applications, such as smart surveillance, requires training deep learning networks on datasets that sufficiently represent the classes of interest. However, the bottleneck in many computer vision applications lies in the limited availability of adequate datasets. One particular application that is of great importance for the safety of cities and crowded areas is smart surveillance. Conventional surveillance methods are reactive and often ineffective in enable real-time action. However, smart surveillance is a key component of smart and proactive security in a smart city. Motivated by a smart city application which aims at the automatic identification of concerning events for alerting law-enforcement and governmental agencies, we craft a large video dataset that focuses on the distinction between small-scale violence, large-scale violence, peaceful gatherings, and natural events. This dataset classifies public events along two axes, the size of the crowd observed and the level of perceived violence in the crowd. We name this newly-built dataset the Multi-Scale Violence and Public Gathering (MSV-PG) dataset. The videos in the dataset go through several pre-processing steps to prepare them to be fed into a deep learning architecture. We conduct several experiments on the MSV-PG datasets using a ResNet3D, a Swin Transformer and an R(2 + 1)D architecture. The results achieved by these models when trained on the MSV-PG dataset, 88.37%, 89.76%, and 89.3%, respectively, indicate that the dataset is well-labeled and is rich enough to train deep learning models for automatic smart surveillance for diverse scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel method to synchronize multiple wireless inertial measurement unit sensors (IMU) using their onboard magnetometers. The basic method uses an external electromagnetic pulse to create a known event measured by the magnetometer of multiple IMUs and in turn uses this to synchronize the devices. An initial evaluation using four commercial IMUs reveals a maximum error of 40 ms per hour as limited by a 25 Hz sample rate. Building on this we introduce a novel method to improve synchronization beyond the limitations imposed by the sample rate and evaluate this in a further study using 8 IMUs. We show that a sequence of electromagnetic pulses, in total lasting &amp;lt;3-s, can reduce the maximum synchronization error to 8 ms (for 25 Hz sample rate, and accounting for the transient response time of the magnetic field generator). An advantage of this method is that it can be applied to several devices, either simultaneously or individually, without the need to remove them from the context in which they are being used. This makes the approach particularly suited to synchronizing multi-person on-body sensors while they are being worn.},

  abstract     = {In support of smart wearable researchers striving to select optimal ground truth methods for motion capture across a spectrum of loose garment types, we present an extended benchmark named DrapeMoCapBench (DMCB+). This augmented benchmark incorporates a more intricate limb-wise Motion Capture (MoCap) accuracy analysis, and enhanced drape calculation, and introduces a novel benchmarking tool that encompasses multicamera deep learning MoCap methods. DMCB+ is specifically designed to evaluate the performance of both optical marker-based and markerless MoCap techniques, taking into account the challenges posed by various loose garment types. While high-cost marker-based systems are acknowledged for their precision, they often require skin-tight markers on bony areas, which can be impractical with loose garments. On the other hand, markerless MoCap methods driven by computer vision models have evolved to be more cost-effective, utilizing smartphone cameras and exhibiting promising results. Utilizing real-world MoCap datasets, DMCB+ conducts 3D physics simulations with a comprehensive set of variables, including six drape levels, three motion intensities, and six body-gender combinations. The extended benchmark provides a nuanced analysis of advanced marker-based and markerless MoCap techniques, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across distinct scenarios. In particular, DMCB+ reveals that when evaluating casual loose garments, both marker-based and markerless methods exhibit notable performance degradation (&amp;gt;10 cm). However, in scenarios involving everyday activities with basic and swift motions, markerless MoCap outperforms marker-based alternatives. This positions markerless MoCap as an advantageous and economical choice for wearable studies. The inclusion of a multicamera deep learning MoCap method in the benchmarking tool further expands the scope, allowing researchers to assess the capabilities of cutting-edge technologies in diverse motion capture scenarios.},

Gaming serves as a social and recreational outlet for many, connecting friends, family, and even strangers through collaboration and competition. However, MND’s disease progression, including muscle weakness and paralysis, severely limit the ability to engage in gaming. In this paper, we desscribe our exploration of AI solutions to improve accessibility to gaming. We argue that any application of accessible AI must be led by lived experience. Notably, we found in our previous scoping review, existing academic research into video games for those living with MND largely neglects the experiences of MND patients in the context of video games and AI, which was a prompt for us to address this critical gap.},

  abstract     = {Numerous studies have focused on constructing multimodal machine learning models for estimating a person&#39;s cognitive load. However, a prevalent limitation is that these models are typically evaluated on data from the same scenario they were trained on. Little attention has been given to their robustness against data distribution shifts, which may occur during deployment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of these models when confronted with a scenario different from the one on which they were trained. For this evaluation, we utilized a dataset encompassing two distinct scenarios: an n-Back test and a driving simulation. We selected a variety of classic machine learning and deep learning architectures, which were further complemented by various fusion techniques. The models were trained on the data from the n-Back task and tested on both scenarios to evaluate their predictive performance. However, the predictive performance alone may not lead to a trustworthy model. Therefore, we looked at the uncertainty estimates of these models. By leveraging these estimates, we can reduce misclassification by resorting to alternative measures in situations of high uncertainty. The findings indicate that late fusion produces stable classification results across the examined models for both scenarios, enhancing robustness compared to feature-based fusion methods. Although a simple logistic regression tends to provide the best predictive performance for n-Back, this is not always the case if the data distribution is shifted. Finally, the predictive performance of individual modalities differs significantly between the two scenarios. This research provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of multimodal machine learning models in handling distribution shifts and identifies which approaches may potentially be suitable for achieving robust results.},

  abstract     = {Modern video streaming services require quality assurance of the presented audiovisual material. Quality assurance mechanisms allow streaming platforms to provide quality levels that are considered sufficient to yield user satisfaction, with the least possible amount of data transferred. A variety of measures and approaches have been developed to control video quality, e.g., by adapting it to network conditions. These include objective matrices of the quality and thresholds identified by means of subjective perceptual judgments. The former group of matrices has recently gained the attention of (multi) media researchers. They call this area of study “Quality of Experience” (QoE). In this paper, we present a theoretical model based on review of previous QoE’s models. We argue that most of them represent the bottom-up approach to modeling. Such models focus on describing as many variables as possible, but with a limited ability to investigate the causal relationship between them; therefore, the applicability of the findings in practice is limited. To advance the field, we therefore propose a structural, top-down model of video QoE that describes causal relationships among variables. This novel top-down model serves as a practical guide for structuring QoE experiments, ensuring the incorporation of influential factors in a confirmatory manner.},

  abstract     = {Children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often struggle to grasp social conventions and promptly recognize others&#39; emotions. Recent advancements in the application of deep learning (DL) to emotion recognition are solidifying the role of AI-powered assistive technology in supporting autistic children. However, the cost of collecting and annotating large-scale high-quality human emotion data and the phenomenon of unbalanced performance on different modalities of data challenge DL-based emotion recognition. In response to these challenges, this paper explores transfer learning, wherein large pre-trained models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) and wav2vec 2.0 are fine-tuned to improve audio- and video-based emotion recognition with text- based guidance. In this work, we propose the EmoAsst framework, which includes a visual fusion module and emotion prompt fine-tuning for CLIP, in addition to leveraging CLIP&#39;s text encoder and supervised contrastive learning for audio-based emotion recognition on the wav2vec 2.0 model. In addition, a joint few-shot emotion classifier enhances the accuracy and offers great adaptability for real-world applications. The evaluation results on the MELD dataset highlight the outstanding performance of our methods, surpassing the majority of existing video and audio-based approaches. Notably, our research demonstrates the promising potential of the proposed text-based guidance techniques for improving video and audio-based Emotion Recognition and Classification (ERC).},

  abstract     = {We introduce a method for solving a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) with the two-way one-hot constraints by dividing the QUBO into parts and solving it with an Ising machine. The one-hot constraint is a constraint condition in that only one binary variable takes the value one for a set of multiple binary variables. The two-way one-hot constraint imposes one-hot constraint conditions on every row and every column of a two-dimensional array of binary variables with equal numbers of rows and columns. For example, traveling salesman problems (TSPs) have two-way one-hot constraints. We propose two methods to solve a TSP by dividing the cities into clusters based on information in the QUBO matrix. The proposed methods decompose cities into clusters and solve TSPs for each cluster. We solve TSPs such that the cities are distributed in clusters and compare the results of the two proposed methods with the results of solving the problem without partitioning. The results show that the proposed methods are robust to the coefficient parameters in the Hamiltonian of QUBO and can obtain a solution closer to the optimal solution when solving the problem without partitioning is hard. We also discuss the application of the methods proposed in the TSPs to the quadratic assignment problems and to the problems of ordering things.},

Further inclusion in both games and the game industry requires educational resources useful within game curricula, which has been developed by the industry, to raise awareness about design and development regarding game accessibility and related issues. The purpose of this paper is to explain how inclusive game design and game accessibility can be taught to students in higher education, for curricular design, in-between generic curricula and practice. A tentative curriculum framework (TCF) was developed by the author and a co-author, based on feedback from peers. The problem is that there is still a gap between the basic structure of the TCF and how to apply it in higher education courses. The goal with this paper is to exemplify how this can be done with a set of generalized modules with course activities based on teaching by the author for two decades, that can be implemented in higher education courses, either modified or as-is, related to the TCF. A set of example modules consisting of activities is presented that can be adapted and applied by peer educators. Future work involves transforming the modules themselves into open educational resources, organized based on the TCF. Hopefully, this can motivate peer educators to also contribute with further open educational resources in a common repository, to aid each other as a community of educators developing best practices for teaching about game accessibility in higher education.},

  abstract     = {User experience (UX) research relies heavily on survey scales to measure users&#39; subjective experiences with technology. However, repeatedly raised concerns regarding the improper use of survey scales in UX research and adjacent fields call for a systematic review of current measurement practices. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review, screening 153 papers from four years of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems proceedings (ACM CHI 2019 to 2022), of which 60 were eligible empirical studies using survey scales to study users&#39; experiences. We identified 85 different scales and 172 distinct constructs measured. Most scales were used once (70.59%), and most constructs were measured only once (66.28%). The System Usability Scale was the most popular scale, followed by the User Experience Questionnaire, and the NASA Task Load Index. Regarding constructs, usability was the most frequently measured, followed by attractiveness, effort, and presence. Furthermore, results show that papers rarely contained complete rationales for scale selection (20.00%) and seldom provided all scale items used (30.00%). More than a third of all scales were adapted (34.19%), while only one-third of papers reported any scale quality investigation (36.67%). On the basis of our results, we highlight questionable measurement practices in UX research and suggest opportunities to improve scale use for UX-related constructs. Additionally, we provide six recommended steps to promote enhanced rigor in following best practices for scale-based UX research.},

  abstract     = {The increase in the use of smart devices has led to the realization of the Internet of Everything (IoE). The heart of an IoE environment is a Context-Aware System that facilitates service discovery, delivery, and adaptation based on context classification. The context has been defined in a domain-dependent way, traditionally. The classical models of context have been focused on rich context and lack Cost of Context (CoC) that can be used for decision support. The authors present a philosophy-inspired mathematical model of context that includes confidence in activity classification of context, the actions performed, and the power information. Since a single recurring activity can lead to distinct actions performed at different times, it is better to record the actions. The power information includes the power consumed in the complete context processing and is a quality attribute of the context. Power consumption is a useful metric as CoC and is suitable for power-constrained context awareness. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work, example contexts are described, and the context model is presented mathematically in this study. The context is aggregated with power information, and actions and confidence on the classification outcome lead to the concept of situational context. The results show that the context gathered through sensor data and deduced through remote services can be made more rich with CoC parameters.},

It enables unified representation of students&#39; characteristics that supports creating personalized learning experiences. This paper aims to build an effective student model by combining learning preferences with skill levels. A student profile is formulated upon detecting the user&#39;s learning styles and learning preferences, as well as their knowledge level and misconceptions. The pieces of information are collected through an interactive online platform, by completing personal and knowledge assessment quizzes. Moreover, a learner can make his/her profile open for other learners as a starting point for supporting collaborative learning. The results showed an improvement of students&#39; educational achievements who used the platform, and the satisfaction level reported by non-neutral users was averaged as a score of 90%. The evaluation of this platform showed promising results regarding its ability in describing students in a comprehensive manner.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid accumulation of large amounts of user-generated content through social media, social data reuse and integration have gained increasing attention recently. This has made it almost obsolete for software applications to collect, store, and work with their own data stored on local servers. While, with the provision of Application Programming Interfaces from the leading social networking sites, data acquisition and integration has become possible, the meaningful usage of such unstructured, non-uniform, and incoherent data collections needs special procedures of data summarization, understanding, and visualization. One particular aspect in this regard that needs special attention is the procedures for data (text snippets in the form of social media posts) categorization and concept tagging to filter out the relevant and most suitable data for the particular audience and for the particular purpose. In this regard, we propose a corpus-based approach for searching and successively categorizing and tagging the social data with relevant concepts in real time. The proposed approach is capable of addressing the semantical and morphological similarities, as well as domain-specific vocabularies of query strings and tagged concepts. We demonstrate the feasibility and application of our proposed approach in a web-based tool that allows searching Facebook posts and provides search results together with a concept map for further navigation, filtering, and refining of search results. The tool has been evaluated by performing multiple search queries, and resultant concept maps and annotated texts are analyzed in terms of their precision. The approach is thereby found effective in achieving its stated goal of classifying text snippets in real time.},

  abstract     = {More than half of the world&#39;s population relies on rice as their primary food source. In India, it is a dominant cereal crop that plays a significant role in the national economy, contributing to almost 17% of the GDP and engaging 60% of the population. Still, the agricultural sector faces numerous challenges, including diseases that can cause significant losses. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven effective in identifying rice diseases based on visual characteristics. However, CNNs require millions of parameters, resulting in high computational complexity, so deploying these models on limited-resource devices can be difficult due to their computational complexity. In this research, a lightweight CNN model named Oryza Sativa Pathosis Spotter (OSPS)-MicroNet is proposed. OSPS-MicroNet is inspired by the teacher-student knowledge distillation mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that OSPS-MicroNet achieves an accuracy of 92.02% with only 0.7% of the network size of the heavyweight model, RESNET152. This research aims to create a more streamlined and resource-efficient model to detect rice diseases while minimizing demands on computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Socio-ecological inclusion and the impacts of climate change on the built environment are two shared concerns central to the design and planning of the just transition in cities. The just transition leans heavily on inclusive convergence processes that are grounded in knowledge integration and transdisciplinary practice. However, there is a paucity of effective methods for the inclusion of so-called weak signals from actors situated at the periphery of these convergence processes. Building on the concept of structured flexibility, we introduce a building-blocks approach as a modular architecture for constructing methods for distributed engagement and knowledge integration beyond conventional small-group settings. By engaging in research through design, the Amplifying Weak Signals approach was prototyped with students in the context of dealing with heatwaves in The Hague and tested with expert users from the region who facilitate resilience strategy-making processes. Out of 900 possible building block combinations, 18 methods were created during prototyping. The resulting heatwave strategies that were drafted based on the collected peripheral knowledge showed the integration of new socio-ecological issues rather than a drastic departure from the baseline resilience strategy of the city. We discuss the research findings and their use in the production of guidelines for the construction of methods to integrate peripheral knowledge in convergence processes. Ongoing work to develop the guidelines in the form of an open-access, interactive repository of knowledge elicitation methods for urban resilience spatial planning will also be described. Recommendations for scaling the approach are provided.},

  abstract     = {At the time of this writing, emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and DALL-E, are shaping education. Despite their great potential for enhancing education, the discussion on the risks for the Society is an ongoing debate. Remote or distance education (DE) in developed countries has evolved in parallel to the permeation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). In Latin America (LATAM), a deep understanding of this interrelated evolution will encourage an efficient implementation of innovative policies, pedagogies, and technologies, including GenAI. This paper presents the historical development of DE in LATAM, drawing connections with milestones along the evolution of ICT in the region. This evolution is described across five generations: Correspondence, Audiovisual, ICTs-based, Web-based, and Interactive. Each generation offered incremental benefits to students, from flexibility and well-designed instructional materials to adaptive, interactive, and cost-effective education. This research encompassed a comprehensive search on Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Latindex, Dialnet, Redalyc, and SciELO with an historical approach. It yielded 97 peer-reviewed articles, books, and reports from recognized international organizations, published in Spanish or English and covering a period spanning from the end of the 19th century to the onset of COVID-19 lockdown. The analysis confirms the critical role of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in LATAM in supporting ICT integration, demonstrating a synergistic interplay with DE. Notwithstanding, the region’s social inequality and digital divide have delayed the full deployment of DE’s advantages, in comparison to USA and Europe. The paper exposes different scenarios and tech-educational requirements of DE, showcasing Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, as well as other countries with smaller populations. Notably, by 2019, Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, and Universidade de São Paulo and Universidade Federal da Paraíba in Brazil have pioneered the implementation of the Fifth Generation of DE in the region. The findings of this research highlight the value of DE as a cost-effective solution to traditional education, addressing social barriers and broadening educational access in LATAM, especially during emergencies. This research poses significant implications that can equip digital technology providers, HEIs, governments, and policymakers as they navigate the ongoing educational challenges.},

By analyzing the concepts through inductive and iterative analysis, we have defined a design space consisting of 12 aspects, categorized in four themes: interaction-, content-, event-, and display-centric.

It is used not only for authentication purposes but also for key derivation mechanisms. The primary purpose of password hashing is to enhance the security of user credentials by preventing the exposure of plaintext passwords in the event of a data breach. As a key derivation function, password hashing aims to derive secret keys from a master key, password, or passphrase using a pseudorandom function. This review focuses on the design and analysis of time-memory trade-off (TMTO) attacks on recent password hashing algorithms. This review presents a comprehensive survey of TMTO attacks and recent studies on password hashing for authentication by examining the literature. The study provides valuable insights and strategies for safely navigating transitions, emphasizing the importance of a systematic approach and thorough testing to mitigate risk. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance to developers and administrators on how to update cryptographic practices in response to evolving security standards and threats.},

Our experiment demonstrates that adversarial music crafted by our attack can easily mislead industry-level TDNN models into picking up ghost commands with high success rates.

  abstract     = {Free space optical (FSO) systems offer a desirable and affordable way of providing communication services in remote locations. They provide secure wireless transmission without the requirement for licensing and with lower implementation costs. However, due to the impact of atmospheric turbulences on the effectiveness of FSO systems, their implementation faces significant challenges. Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) has shown promise in addressing the growing bandwidth needs in optical networks. This paper introduces a hybrid optical amplifier based system, combining DWDM and FSO technology. Energy conservation in such a system involves optimizing various aspects to reduce power consumption while maintaining or improving performance. The proposed DWDM-FSO system operates at a rate of 480 Gbps and consists of 12 channels, each capable of transmitting data at 40 Gbps. The system&#39;s performance is evaluated and compared by determining the Q-factor and bit error rate (BER) for both the cases when hybrid amplifier is employed and with no hybrid amplifier within the C-band, specifically focusing on wavelengths around 1550 nm. Moreover, the length of the FSO link is increased to assess the corresponding Q-factor and BER. Resultantly, the maximum distance for the FSO link is determined, ensuring that it remains within acceptable Q-factor and BER thresholds. Furthermore, the FSO system&#39;s effectiveness is assessed and compared across various atmospheric conditions. The findings reveal that, in clear weather conditions, the FSO system achieves a maximum distance of 510 meters while maintaining satisfactory Q-factor and BER values when not utilizing a hybrid amplifier. However, by integrating a hybrid amplifier, the system&#39;s reach significantly extends to 1700 m under clear weather conditions, still maintaining acceptable Q-factor and BER values.},

  abstract     = {We validate the OpenSense framework for IMU-based joint angle estimation and furthermore analyze the framework&#39;s ability for sensor selection and optimal positioning during activities of daily living (ADL). Personalized musculoskeletal models were created from anthropometric data of 19 participants. Quaternion coordinates were derived from measured IMU data and served as input to the simulation framework. Six ADLs, involving upper and lower limbs were measured and a total of 26 angles analyzed. We compared the joint kinematics of IMU-based simulations with those of optical marker-based simulations for most important angles per ADL. Additionally, we analyze the influence of sensor count on estimation performance and deviations between joint angles, and derive the best sensor combinations. We report differences in functional range of motion (fRoMD) estimation performance. Results for IMU-based simulations showed MAD, RMSE, and fRoMD of 4.8°, 6.6°, 7.2° for lower limbs and for lower limbs and 9.2°, 11.4°, 13.8° for upper limbs depending on the ADL. Overall, sagittal plane movements (flexion/extension) showed lower median MAD, RMSE, and fRoMD compared to transversal and frontal plane movements (rotations, adduction/abduction). Analysis of sensor selection showed that after three sensors for the lower limbs and four sensors for the complex shoulder joint, the estimation error decreased only marginally. Global optimum (lowest RMSE) was obtained for five to eight sensors depending on the joint angle across all ADLs. The sensor combinations with the minimum count were a subset of the most frequent sensor combinations within a narrowed search space of the 5% lowest error range across all ADLs and participants. Smallest errors were on average &amp;lt; 2° over all joint angles. Our results showed that the open-source OpenSense framework not only serves as a valid tool for realistic representation of joint kinematics and fRoM, but also yields valid results for IMU sensor selection for a comprehensive set of ADLs involving upper and lower limbs. The results can help researchers to determine appropriate sensor positions and sensor configurations without the need for detailed biomechanical knowledge.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study was to address the logistical and data challenges of using wearable technologies in the context of a clinical trial to measure heart rate variability (HRV) as a marker of physiologic stress in emergency healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. When using these wearable smart garments, the dilemma is two-fold: (1) the volume of raw physiological data produced is enormous and is recorded in formats not easily portable in standard analytic software, and (2) the commensurate data analysis often requires proprietary software. Our team iteratively developed a novel algorithm called HRVEST that can successfully process enormous volumes of physiologic raw data generated by wearable smart garments and meet the specific needs of HRV analyses. HRVEST is a noise-filtering and data-processing algorithm that allows the precise measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) of clinicians working in an Emergency Department (ED). HRVEST automatically processed the biometric data derived from 413 electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in just over 15 min. Furthermore, throughout this study, we identified unique challenges of working with these technologies and proposed solutions that may facilitate future use in broader contexts. With HRVEST, using wearable smart garments to monitor HRV over long periods of time becomes logistically and feasibly viable for future studies. We also see the potential for real-time feedback to prophylactically reduce emergency physician stress, like informing optimal break-taking or short meditation sessions to lower heart rate. This could improve emotional wellbeing and, subsequently, clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image recognition. Their ability to identify complex patterns, combined with learning transfer techniques, has proven effective in multiple fields, such as image classification. In this article we propose to apply a two-step methodology for image classification tasks. First, apply transfer learning with the desired dataset, and subsequently, in a second stage, replace the classification layers by other alternative classification models. The whole methodology has been tested on a dataset collected at Conil de la Frontera fish market, in Southwest Spain, including 19 different fish species to be classified for fish auction market. The study was conducted in five steps: (i) collecting and preprocessing images included in the dataset, (ii) using transfer learning from 4 well-known CNNs (ResNet152V2, VGG16, EfficientNetV2L and Xception) for image classification to get initial models, (iii) apply fine-tuning to obtain final CNN models, (iv) substitute classification layer with 21 different classifiers obtaining multiple F1-scores for different training-test splits of the dataset for each model, and (v) apply post-hoc statistical analysis to compare their performances in terms of accuracy. Results indicate that combining the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with other supervised classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines or Linear Discriminant Analysis is a simple and effective way to increase model performance.},

While most are respectfully enjoyed by millions of players, a small group of players engages in disruptive behavior, such as cheating and hate speech. Identifying and subsequently moderating these toxic players is a challenging task. Previous research has only studied specific aspects of this problem using curated data and with limited access to real-world moderation practices. In contrast, our work offers a unique and holistic view of the universal challenges of moderating disruptive behavior in online systems. We combine an analysis of a large dataset from a popular online competitive first-person action title (Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare®II) with insights from stakeholders involved in moderation. We identify six universal challenges related to handling disruptive behaviors in such games. We discuss challenges omitted by prior work, such as handling high-volume imbalanced data or ensuring the comfort of human moderators. We also offer a discussion of possible technical, design, and policy approaches to mitigating these challenges.},

  abstract     = {The use of virtual reality (VR) in firefighter training is promising because it provides cost-effective, safe environments that arouse similar behavioral responses to real-life scenarios. However, the pedagogical potential of VR and its impact on learning outcomes compared to traditional methods is currently an under-explored area. This research investigates how well VR can support learning compared to traditional methods in the context of training firefighters in combating vegetation fires. A VR learning environment was developed, informed by a “design for learning” framework providing a pedagogical underpinning. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 40 participants to measure the knowledge transfer of the VR learning environment against the official textbook. In addition, VR&#39;s theorized learning benefits of intrinsic motivation, situational interest, and self-efficacy were compared with textbook-based learning. Lastly, the design quality of the learning environment was assessed based on its learning and user experience. We employed a primarily quantitative approach to data collection and analysis, using a combination of knowledge test results and questionnaires, with supporting qualitative data from semi-structured interviews and observation notes to answer our hypotheses. The results found a significant difference between the knowledge transfer of both conditions, with textbook-based learning more effectively transferring factual and conceptual knowledge than VR. No significant difference was found in reported self-efficacy between the two conditions but was found in reported levels of intrinsic motivation and situational interest, which were higher in the VR condition. The design was found to have facilitated a good user and learning experience, assessed via questionnaire responses. During interviews, VR participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the experience, praising the hands-on learning approach and interactivity, while reporting frustration with the lack of knowledge reinforcement and initial difficulties with the controls. A key finding was that presence was found to be negatively associated with knowledge transfer, which we theorize to be caused by the novelty of the realistic VR environment distracting participants from the more familiar lesson content. This research contributes to the body of work related to knowledge transfer within VR in this domain while highlighting key pedagogical and design considerations that can be used to inform future design implementations.},

  abstract     = {This study provides a computable, direct, and mathematically rigorous approximation to the differential geometry of class manifolds for high-dimensional data, along with non-linear projections from input space onto these class manifolds. The tools are applied to the setting of neural network image classifiers, where we generate novel, on-manifold data samples and implement a projected gradient descent algorithm for on-manifold adversarial training. The susceptibility of neural networks (NNs) to adversarial attack highlights the brittle nature of NN decision boundaries in input space. Introducing adversarial examples during training has been shown to reduce the susceptibility of NNs to adversarial attack; however, it has also been shown to reduce the accuracy of the classifier if the examples are not valid examples for that class. Realistic “on-manifold” examples have been previously generated from class manifolds in the latent space of an autoencoder. Our study explores these phenomena in a geometric and computational setting that is much closer to the raw, high-dimensional input space than what can be provided by VAE or other black box dimensionality reductions. We employ conformally invariant diffusion maps (CIDM) to approximate class manifolds in diffusion coordinates and develop the Nyström projection to project novel points onto class manifolds in this setting. On top of the manifold approximation, we leverage the spectral exterior calculus (SEC) to determine geometric quantities such as tangent vectors of the manifold. We use these tools to obtain adversarial examples that reside on a class manifold, yet fool a classifier. These misclassifications then become explainable in terms of human-understandable manipulations within the data, by expressing the on-manifold adversary in the semantic basis on the manifold.},

Making good sleep for productive scheduling a personal responsibility does not necessarily lead to better sleep and may cause stress and anxiety. In an autoethnographic study, the first author of this paper tracked her sleep for one month using a diary, body maps and an Oura ring and compared her subjectively felt sleep experience with the data produced by the Oura app. A thematic analysis of the data resulted in four themes describing the relationship between the user-researcher and her wearable sleep-tracker: (1) good sleep scores are motivating, (2) experience that matches the data leads to sense-making, (3) contradictory information from the app leads to frustration, and (4) the sleep-tracker competes with other social agents. A diffractive reading of the data and research process, following Karen Barad&#39;s methodology, resulted in a discussion of how data passes through the analog and digital apparatus and what contextual factors are left out but still significantly impact sleep quality and quantity. We add to a canon of sleep research recommending a move away from representing sleep in terms of comparison and competition, uncoupling it from neoliberal capitalistic productivity and self-improvement narratives which are often key contributing factors to bad sleep in the first place.},

  abstract     = {Virtual agents (computer-graphics-based agents) have been developed for many purposes such as supporting the social life, mental care, education, and entertainment of both young and old people individuals. Promoting affective communication between young/old users and agents requires clarifying subjective feelings induced by an agent&#39;s expressions. However, an emotional response model of agents to induce positive feelings has not been fully understood due to differences in emotion perception between young and old adults. We investigated subjective feelings induced when facing with a non-human computer-graphics-based agent&#39;s emotional responses in consideration of differences of emotion perception between young adults and old adults. To emphasize the differences in emotion perception, the agent&#39;s expressions were developed by adopting exaggerated human expressions. The differences in their emotion perception of happy, sadness, and angry between young and old participants were then identified through a preliminary experiment. Considering the differences in emotion perception, induced feelings when facing with the agent&#39;s expressions were analyzed from the three types of emotion sources of the participant, agent, and other, which was defined as subject and responsibility of induced emotion. The subjective feelings were evaluated using a subjective rating task with 139 young and 211 old participants. The response of the agent that most induced positive feelings was happy when participants felt happy, and that was sad when participants felt sad, regardless emotion sources in both young and old groups. The response that most induced positive feelings was sad when participants felt angry and emotion sources were participant and the agent, and that was angry when the emotion source was other. The emotion types of the response to induce most positive feelings were the same between the young and old participants, and the way to induce most positive feelings was not always to mimic the emotional expressions, which is a typical tendency of human responses. These findings suggest that a common agent response model can be developed for young and old people by combining an emotional mimicry model with a response model to induce positive feelings in users and promote natural and affective communication, considering age characteristics of emotion perception.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThis article proposes a secure implementation for consensus using a dynamic event-triggered control (DETC) scheme for general autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) under asynchronous (distributed) denial of service (DoS) attacks. The asynchronous DoS attacks can block each communication channel independently in an unknown pattern. Depending on the impact of DoS on the communication topology, the attacks are categorized into (i): connectivity-preserved DoS (CP-DoS), and (ii): connectivity-broken DoS (CB-DoS). In CP-DoS, the operating communication topology remains connected. On the other hand, in CB-DoS the adversary breaks the communication graph into isolated sub-graphs.MethodsThe DETC scheme is employed to reduce the control updates for each agent. To guarantee consensus under both the CP-DoS and CB-DoS, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based optimization approach is proposed, which simultaneously designs all the unknown DETC parameters as well as the state feedback control gain.ResultsThe proposed optimization method prioritizes the minimum inter-event interval (MIET) between consecutive control updates. The trade-off between relevant features of the MAS, namely the consensus convergence rate, intensity of control updates, and level of resilience to DoS can be handled by the proposed optimization.DiscussionSimulation results quantify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing its ability to maintain secure consensus in MAS under varying DoS attack scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Every process within software development refers to a specific set of input and output artifacts. Each artifact models specific design information of a system, yet they complement each other and make an improved system description. The requirements phase is an early stage of software development that drives the rest of the development process. Throughout the software development life cycle, checking that every artifact produced in every development stage should comply with the given requirements is necessary. Moreover, there should be relatedness between elements within artifacts of different development stages. This study provides an overview of the conformity between artifacts and the possibility of artifact transformation. This study also describes the methods and tools used in previous studies for ensuring the conformity of artifacts with requirements in the transformation process between artifacts. It also provides their applications in the real world. The review identified three applications, seven methods and approaches, and five challenges in ensuring the conformity of artifacts with requirements. We identified the artifacts as class diagrams, aspect-oriented software architecture, architectural models, entity relationship diagrams, and sequence diagrams. The applications for ensuring the conformity of artifacts with requirements are maintaining traceability, software verification and validation, and software reuse. The methods include information retrieval, natural language processing, model transformations, text mining, graph-based, ontology-based, and optimization algorithms. The benefits of adopting methods and tools for ensuring the conformity of artifacts with requirements can motivate and assist practitioners in designing and creating artifacts.},

We engage a finite difference method to solve this equation numerically. The performance of its parallel implementation is considered using Message Passing Interface (MPI), Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), and time schemes, such as Forward Euler (FE) and Runge-Kutta (RK) methods. The originality of this study is research on parallel implementations of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) for sparse matrices on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture. The supreme proprietary framework for GPU computing is CUDA, provided by NVIDIA. We will show three metrics through this parallelization to compare the computing performance: time-to-solution, speed-up, and performance. The spectral method is investigated by utilizing the FFTW software library, based on the computation of the fast Fourier transforms (FFT) in parallel and distributed memory architectures. Our CUDA-based FFT, named CUFFT, is performed in platforms, which is a highly optimized FFTW implementation. We will give numerical tests to reveal that this method is up-and-coming for solving the heat equation. The final result demonstrates that CUDA has a significant advantage and performance since the computational cost is tiny compared with the MPI implementation. This vital performance gain is also achieved through careful attention of managing memory communication and access.},

The potential connections between movements of the body and artistic content have been extensively studied over time, considering movement as a non-verbal language with a universal character.MethodsThis pilot study presents the results of the validation of an innovative multimodal system, the DanzArTe-Emotional Wellbeing Technology, designed to support active and participative experience of older people providing physical and cognitive activation through a full-body physical interaction with a traditional visual work of art of religious subject. DanzArTe supports a replicable treatment protocol for multidimensional frailty, administered through a low cost and scalable technological platform capable of generating real-time visual and auditory feedback (interactive sonification) from the automated analysis of individual as well as joint movement expressive qualities. The study involved 45 participants, 23 of whom participated in the DanzArTe program and 22 who were included in the control group.ResultsThe two groups were similar in terms of age (p = 0.465) and gender (p = 0.683).

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial to increase the chances of survival and reduce the recovery time of the patient. Chest X-ray images, the most widely used method in practice, are challenging to classify. Our aim is to develop a machine learning tool that can accurately classify images as belonging to normal or infected individuals. A support vector machine (SVM) is attractive because binary classification can be represented as an optimization problem, in particular as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, which, in turn, maps naturally to an Ising model, thereby making annealing—classical, quantum, and hybrid—an attractive approach to explore. In this study, we offer a comparison between different methods: (1) a classical state-of-the-art implementation of SVM (LibSVM); (2) solving SVM with a classical solver (Gurobi), with and without decomposition; (3) solving SVM with simulated annealing; (4) solving SVM with quantum annealing (D-Wave); and (5) solving SVM using Graver Augmented Multi-seed Algorithm (GAMA). GAMA is tried with several different numbers of Graver elements and a number of seeds using both simulating annealing and quantum annealing. We found that simulated annealing and GAMA (with simulated annealing) are comparable, provide accurate results quickly, competitive with LibSVM, and superior to Gurobi and quantum annealing.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the need for collecting and labeling affect-related data in ecological settings. Collecting the annotations in the wild is a very challenging task, which, however, is crucial for the creation of datasets and emotion recognition models. We propose a novel solution to collect and annotate such data: a questionnaire based on the appraisal theory, that is accessible through an open-source mobile application. Our approach exploits a commercially available wearable physiological sensor connected to a smartphone. The app detects potentially relevant events from the physiological data, and prompts the users to report their emotions using a novel questionnaire based on the Ortony, Clore, and Collins (OCC) Model. The questionnaire is designed to gather information about the appraisal process concerning the significant event. The app guides a user through the reporting process by posing a series of questions related to the event. As a result, the annotated data can be used, e.g., to develop emotion recognition models. In the paper, we analyze users&#39; reports. To validate the questionnaire, we asked 22 individuals to use the app and the sensor for a week. The analysis of the collected annotations shed new light on self-assessment in terms of appraisals. We compared a proposed method with two commonly used methods for reporting affect-related events: (1) a two-dimensional model of valence and arousal, and (2) a forced-choice list of 22 labels. According to the results, appraisal-based reports largely corresponded to the self-reported values of arousal and valence, but they differed substantially from the labels provided with a forced-choice list. In the latter case, when using the forced-choice list, individuals primarily selected labels of basic emotions such as anger or joy. However, they reported a greater variety of emotional states when using appraisal theory for self-assessment of the same events. Thus, proposed approach aids participants to focus on potential causes of their states, facilitating more precise reporting. We also found that regardless of the reporting mode (mandatory vs. voluntary reporting), the ratio between positive and negative reports remained stable. The paper concludes with a list of guidelines to consider in future data collections using self-assessment.},

We prove that the classic adversarial risk can be bounded from both sides using the normal and in-manifold adversarial risks. We also show a surprisingly pessimistic case that the standard adversarial risk can be non-zero even when both normal and in-manifold adversarial risks are zero. We finalize the study with empirical studies supporting our theoretical results.

In structural causal models, information is encoded in the compositions of functions that define variables because that information is used to constraint how an intervention that changes the definition of a variable influences the rest of the variables. Current probabilistic models with tractable marginalization also imply a function decomposition but with the purpose of allowing easy marginalization of variables. In this article, structural causal models are extended so that the information implicitly stored in their structure is made explicit in an input–output mapping in higher dimensional representation where we get to define the cause–effect relationships as constraints over a function space. Using the cause–effect relationships as constraints over a space of functions, the existing methodologies for handling causality with tractable probabilistic models are unified under a single framework and generalized.},

In the context of real-time monitoring of networked systems, it is crucial that new solutions do not increase the burden on an already overloaded visual channel. Sonification can be leveraged as a peripheral monitoring tool that complements current visualization systems. We conceptualized, designed, and prototyped Datascapes, a framework project that explores the potential of sound-based applications for the monitoring of cyber-attacks on AI-supported networked environments. Within Datascapes, two Design Actions were realized that applied sonification on the monitoring and detection of anomalies in (1) water distribution networks and (2) Internet networks. Two series of prototypes were implemented and evaluated in a real-world environment with eight experts in network management and cybersecurity. This paper presents experimental results on the use of sonification to disclose anomalous behavior and assess both its gravity and the location within the network. Furthermore, we define and present a design methodology and evaluation protocol that, albeit grounded in sonification for anomaly detection, can support designers in the definition, development, and validation of real-world sonification applications.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning shows promising results in extracting useful information from medical images. The proposed work applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on retinal images to extract features that allow early detection of ophthalmic diseases. Early disease diagnosis is critical to retinal treatment. Any damage that occurs to retinal tissues that cannot be recovered can result in permanent degradation or even complete loss of sight. The proposed deep-learning algorithm detects three different diseases from features extracted from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. The deep-learning algorithm uses CNN to classify OCT images into four categories. The four categories are Normal retina, Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Choroidal Neovascular Membranes (CNM), and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The proposed work uses publicly available OCT retinal images as a dataset. The experimental results show significant enhancement in classification accuracy while detecting the features of the three listed diseases.},

  abstract     = {Technological advancements in physiological body sensor networks (i.e., biometric tracking wearables) and simulated environments (i.e., VR) have led to increased research in the field of neuroarchitecture, specifically investigating the effects of architectural forms, defined here as subtle variations in the shape or configuration of the interior built environment, on neurological responses. While this research field is still in its nascent stages, early findings suggest that certain architectural forms may impact physiological stress responses. Physiological stress has, in turn, been implicated in the development of certain diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. To aid future research, particularly into the relationship between media architecture and physiological stress, this paper conducts a systematic review following PRISMA-P guidelines on studies that evaluated physiological stress responses to architectural form using clinical biomarkers. The review identifies the specific clinical biomarkers used to evaluate physiological stress responses to architectural forms and the distinct categories of architectural forms that have, to date, been correlated with elevated stress responses: curvature, enclosure and proportion. Although these studies&#39; findings imply that the identified architectural forms influence physiological stress, their generalisability is arguably constrained by several factors. These constraints include the paucity of research in this area, the lack of uniformity in the definition and measurement of these architectural forms, the varying contextual settings, the unisensory approach of research methodologies, and the duration of exposure under evaluation. The review concludes that clinical biomarkers may be used to measure the impact of architectural form on physiological stress; however, future research should strive for standardized approaches in defining and measuring architectural forms in order to increase the transferability and robustness of results.},

  abstract     = {The emerging field of human-building interaction (HBI) has its roots in the historical trends of the development of architecture and human-computer interaction (HCI). Advancements in building information modelling (BIM), sensing, and actuation technologies as well as the commodification and miniaturisation of microprocessors over the past two decades are transforming what once were quixotic visions of a cybernetic architecture into reality. This new reality which integrates computation with architecture opens up different kinds of engagements in the ways we design, use, and inhabit our built environments. A question that follows this new reality is: how can we conceptualise human experience in such environments? Thus far, the lived human experience of such interactions has been an overlooked aspect in HBI-related research. In this article, we provide an initial experience framework for HBI underpinned by existing literature from the HCI and architecture domains on the subjective, lived-in experience of architecture and findings derived from a case study of a field-deployed HBI interface. The research objective of our framework is to outline aspects of HBI lived experiences that can be used as guiding lenses for HBI designers and practitioners who wish to design for and assess such experiences.},

This article presents inclusive design practices for hearing accessibility through wearable and multimodal haptic interfaces with participants with diverse hearing backgrounds.MethodsWe develop a movement-based sound design practice and audio-tactile compositional vocabulary, co-created with a Deaf co-designer, to offer a more inclusive and embodied listening experience. This listening experience is evaluated with a focus group whose participants have background in music, dance, design, or accessibility in arts. By involving multiple stakeholders, we survey the participants&#39; qualitative experiences in relation to Deaf co-designer&#39;s experience.ResultsResults show that multimodal haptic feedback enhanced the participants&#39; listening experience while on-skin vibrations provided more nuanced understanding of the music for Deaf participants. Hearing participants reported interest in understanding the Deaf individuals&#39; musical experience, preferences, and compositions.DiscussionWe conclude by presenting design practices when working with movement-based musical interaction and multimodal haptics.

  abstract     = {Classical good continuation for image curves is based on 2D position and orientation. It is supported by the columnar organization of cortex, by psychophysical experiments, and by rich models of (differential) geometry. Here, we extend good continuation to stereo by introducing a neurogeometric model to abstract cortical organization. Our model clarifies which aspects of the projected scene geometry are relevant to neural connections. The model utilizes parameterizations that integrate spatial and orientation disparities, and provides insight into the psychophysics of stereo by yielding a well-defined 3D association field. In sum, the model illustrates how good continuation in the (3D) world generalizes good continuation in the (2D) plane.},
