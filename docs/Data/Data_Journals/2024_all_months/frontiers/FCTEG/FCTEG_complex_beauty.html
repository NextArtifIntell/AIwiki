  abstract     = {Friction stir welding (FSW) offers significant advantages over fusion welding, particularly for high-strength alloys like Inconel 718. However, achieving optimal surface quality in Inconel 718 FSW remains challenging due to its sensitivity to temperature fluctuations during welding. This study integrates finite element simulations, statistical analysis, and advanced control methodologies to enhance weld surface quality through adequate thermal management. High-fidelity simulations of the FSW process were conducted using a validated 3D transient COMSOL Multiphysics model, producing a comprehensive dataset correlating process parameters (rotational speed, axial force, and welding speed) with workpiece temperature. This dataset facilitated statistical analysis and parameter optimization through Analysis of variance (ANOVA) method, leading to a deeper understanding of process variables. A nonlinear state-space system model was subsequently developed using experimental data and the system identification toolbox in Matlab, incorporating domain-specific insights. This model was rigorously validated with an independent dataset to ensure predictive accuracy. Utilizing the validated model, tailored control strategies, including proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and model predictive control (MPC) in both single and multivariable configurations, were designed and evaluated. These control strategies excelled in maintaining welding temperatures within optimal ranges, demonstrating robustness in response times and disturbance handling. This precision in thermal management is poised to significantly refine the FSW process, enhancing both surface integrity and microstructural uniformity. The strategic implementation of these controls is anticipated to substantially improve the quality and consistency of welding outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Targeted plasticity therapy (TPT) utilizes vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to promote improvements in function following neurological injury and disease. During TPT, a brief burst of VNS induces neuromodulator release, which when paired with relevant behavioral events can influence functionally relevant neuroplasticity. Functional improvements following TPT are therefore in part mediated by neuromodulator signaling. Unfortunately, comorbidities associated with neurological disease often result in altered cognitive states that can influence neuromodulator signaling, potentially impeding neuroplasticity induced by TPT. Aside from altered cognitive states, cardiorespiratory rhythms also affect neuromodulator signaling, due to the vagus nerve’s role in relaying visceral sensory information from the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Moreover, precise VNS delivery during specific periods of the cardiorespiratory rhythms may further improve TPT. Ultimately, understanding the impact of patient-specific states on neuromodulator signaling may likely facilitate optimized VNS delivery, paving the way for personalized neuromodulation during TPT. Overall, this review explores challenges and considerations for developing advanced TPT paradigms, focusing on altered cognitive states and cardiorespiratory rhythms. We specifically discuss the possible impact of these cognitive states and autonomic rhythms on neuromodulator signaling and subsequent neuroplasticity. Altered cognitive states (arousal deficits or pain) could affect VNS intensity, while cardiorespiratory rhythms may further inform optimized timing of VNS. We propose that understanding these interactions will lead to the development of personalized state dependent VNS paradigms for TPT.},

  abstract     = {When deploying agents to execute a mission with collective behavior, it is common for accidental malfunctions to occur in some agents. It is challenging to distinguish whether these malfunctions are due to actuator failures or sensor issues based solely on interactions with the affected agent. However, we humans know that if we cause a group behavior where other agents collide with a suspected malfunctioning agent, we can monitor the presence or absence of a positional change and identify whether it is the actuator (position changed) or the sensor (position unchanged) that is broken. We have developed artificial intelligence that can autonomously deploy such “information acquisition strategies through collective behavior” using machine learning. In such problems, the goal is to plan collective actions that result in differences between the hypotheses for the state [e.g., actuator or sensor]. Only a few of the possible collective behavior patterns will lead to distinguishing between hypotheses. The evaluation function to maximize the difference between hypotheses is therefore sparse, with mostly flat values across most of the domain. Gradient-based optimization methods are ineffective for this, and reinforcement learning becomes a viable alternative. By handling this maximization problem, our reinforcement learning surprisingly gets the optimal solution, resulting in collective actions that involve collisions to differentiate the causes. Subsequent collective behaviors, reflecting this situation awareness, seemed to involve other agents assisting the malfunctioning agent.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel approach for the path planning of a 6-degree-of-freedom free-floating space robotic manipulator, focusing on collision and obstacle avoidance through reinforcement learning. It addresses the challenges of dynamic coupling between the spacecraft and the robotic manipulator, which significantly affects control and precision in the space environment. An innovative reward function is introduced in the reinforcement learning framework to ensure accurate alignment of the manipulator’s end effector with its target, despite disturbances from the spacecraft and the need for obstacle and collision avoidance. A key feature of this study is the use of quaternions for orientation representation to avoid the singularities associated with conventional Euler angles and enhance the training process’ efficiency. Furthermore, the reward function incorporates joint velocity constraints to refine the path planning for the manipulator joints, enabling efficient obstacle and collision avoidance. Another key feature of this study is the inclusion of observation noise in the training process to enhance the robustness of the agent. Results demonstrate that the proposed reward function enables effective exploration of the action space, leading to high precision in achieving the desired objectives. The study provides a solid theoretical foundation for the application of reinforcement learning in complex free-floating space robotic operations and offers insights for future space missions.},

  abstract     = {Introduction:A self-paced (SP) heart rate (HR) control system proposed in a previous study was found to be feasible for healthy participants. The aims of this work were to investigate whether the SP HR control system is feasible to achieve accurate HR control in a participant with gait impairments, and to assess its interaction with an existing motor-driven body weight support (BWS) system.Methods:One participant with cerebral palsy was recruited in this case study. Three preliminary tests were completed to determine the appropriate mean value and amplitude of the target heart rate curve, and to identify a customised heart rate response model. Two series of formal self-paced heart rate control tests were then conducted to investigate the influence of different heart rate compensators and the presence of the BWS system.Results:The customised heart rate controller achieved improved accuracy in heart rate control and reduced oscillation in the treadmill target speed: the root-mean-square heart rate tracking error (RMSE) was 2.38 beats per minute (bpm) vs. 3.91 bpm (customised controller vs. nominal controller), and the average power of changes in the treadmill target speed was 0.4 × 10−4 m2/s2 vs. 8.4 × 10−4 m2/s2. The BWS system resulted in improved HR tracking accuracy: RMSE on heart rate tracking was 3.02 bpm vs. 3.50 bpm (with BWS vs. without BWS). The BWS system had no influence on the automatic position control accuracy: RMSE on distance tracking was 0.0159 m vs. 0.0164 m.Conclusion:After customising the heart rate compensator, the self-paced heart rate control system is feasible to achieve accurate heart rate control in an individual with gait impairments, and it can correctly interact with the BWS system.},
