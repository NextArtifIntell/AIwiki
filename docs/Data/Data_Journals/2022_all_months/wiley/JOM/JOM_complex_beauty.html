  abstract     = {Multinational corporations have benefited tremendously from free trade in the past few decades. However, the dynamism of international relations, paired with the global recession, has rekindled the debate over frictionless trade. In this study, we examine how trade friction, created by tariff trade barriers, affects the operational performance of domestic firms which source from the affected countries. We also investigate how various supply chain characteristics and strategies can moderate the impact of such trade friction. Motivated by the 2018 U.S.–China trade war, we conducted a difference-in-difference analysis to examine the impact of trade tariffs on performance indicators of U.S. firms with direct supplier connections in China. Specifically, we found that U.S. firms with direct supply partners (i.e., first-tier suppliers) in China had a worse performance than the U.S. firms without direct supply partners in China in terms of inventory (i.e., days of supply) and profitability (return-on-assets). We further found that the negative impacts were more severe for firms with a higher degree of outsourcing, and horizontal and spatial supply base complexity. We discuss the implications for international operations management, supply chain networks, supply risk management, and provide suggestions to supply chain practitioners and trade policymakers.},

  abstract     = {Government trade actions are an increasing source of supply chain risk. This research provides empirical evidence of the stock market reaction to trade actions against a targeted firm on other firms in the targeted firm&#39;s supply chain eco-system. We test our hypothesized stock price effects using the case of the 2018 US government ban on US firms from supplying to ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications manufacturer. We estimate the ban&#39;s effects on ZTE&#39;s tier-one US and non-US suppliers, as well as the upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects by considering ZTE&#39;s tier-two suppliers and business customers. We also estimate impacts to ZTE&#39;s competitors. We find that tier-one US suppliers experienced a stock price effect of −3.33\% following the ban, and the reaction was more negative for those suppliers more dependent on ZTE for revenues. We find a stock price effect on tier-two suppliers of −0.40\%, but an insignificant effect on non-US tier-one suppliers. Business customers experienced a stock price effect of 0.66\%, and the competitors&#39; stock price effect was 1.34\%. The reversal of the ban 4 weeks later resulted in a stock price effect of 1.56\% for tier-one US suppliers, 1.72\% for tier-one non-US suppliers, and 1.35\% for competitors.},

  abstract     = {Researchers have investigated various factors that explain the variation in product quality across firms, but little is known about how competition from companies located in other countries may affect domestic firms&#39; product quality. Although such foreign competition has received much attention from news media and the public, especially during the recent United States (US)–China trade war, its impact on product quality is still unclear. Our research answers this important question by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in the US, in which significant reductions in import tariff rates represent an exogenous increase in foreign competition for US firms. Performing a difference-in-differences estimation of the difference in product quality changes between treatment and control firms, our research shows that increased foreign competition has a negative impact on the product quality of the US firms concerned. However, such a negative impact is less significant for firms with high levels of operational slack and R&amp;D intensity. Firms pursuing product differentiation rather than cost leadership strategies are also less affected by foreign competition. Overall, our research demonstrates foreign competition&#39;s negative impact on product quality and highlights the crucial role that firms&#39; operational resources and strategies play in mitigating the negative impact.},

  abstract     = {Although the supply chain (SC) literature has discussed the influence of the political environment on global SC decisions, the role of political leaders has been overlooked. To fill this research void, we predict and show that the turnover of a country&#39;s top political leader (hereafter, “politician turnover”) increases policy uncertainty in the country, which drives multinational corporations (MNCs) to adjust their SC involvement there. We also identify three politician-related contingency factors: the market-friendliness of the successor relative to the incumbent, the length of the successor&#39;s political career, and corruption in the turnover country. In an analysis of politician turnover events from 2003 to 2018 and the global supplier-customer relationships of US-incorporated MNCs, we find that politician turnover causes MNCs to reduce SC involvement (measured as the proportions of an MNC&#39;s customers, suppliers, and the transaction volume that are located in the turnover country). The negative effect of politician turnover on SC involvement is exacerbated by corruption in the turnover country, mitigated when the successor has a long political career, and exacerbated when the successor is less market-friendly than the incumbent; the effect becomes positive when the successor is more market-friendly than the incumbent.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in logistics tracking technologies have enabled e-commerce firms to both accurately track the shipments and obtain accurate estimates of delivery times. With customers constantly tracking the status of their orders, the effects of logistics processes on customers&#39; evaluation of their online shopping experience are relatively unknown as academic literature provides little guidance. Drawing upon the expectation-disconfirmation theory and attribution theory, and using a unique dataset assembled in collaboration with an e-commerce firm, we empirically investigate the effects of order processing and delivery times on online customer ratings. We also estimate the impact of positive deviation (i.e., early delivery) and negative deviation (i.e., late delivery) from the promised delivery date on online customer ratings and whether the impact of delivery status (early or late) depends on order cost and freight cost. Our empirical findings demonstrate that longer order processing and delivery times are associated with lower ratings. Our results also highlight that the late delivery of an order is negatively associated with ratings and that the order cost amplifies this effect. Furthermore, freight cost reduces both the negative effect of late delivery and the positive effect of early delivery on online ratings. Our results also indicate that there exist curvilinear relationships between online ratings and the number of days an online order is late or early. Specifically, the negative effect of a late delivery follows a convex-shape curve such that its impact decreases as the number of days an online order is late increases. Likewise, the positive effect of an early delivery increases at a decreasing rate as the number of days an online order is early increases. Our supplementary analyses further account for potential endogeneity issues and corroborate our main results with additional empirical evidence obtained through alternative model specifications and estimation strategies. We present important theoretical implications and managerial takeaways from our findings.},

This study focuses on available technological knowledge in a firm&#39;s global supplier network and examines factors that accrue innovation benefits from such knowledge for a buyer firm. Using absorptive capacity as a theoretical lens, we specifically examine technological distance, technological breadth, and extent of global sourcing, and how these factors interrelate in influencing a firm&#39;s innovation performance. The panel data is drawn from various sources (Bloomberg SPLC, PATSTAT Global, and Compustat). Our sample spans four years from 2011 through 2014 and comprises an unbalanced panel of 878 firm-year observations derived from buyer–supplier relationship data of 246 unique buyer firms. Embedded in this data are 846 unique supplier firms and 9291 dyads (buyer–supplier pairs). The findings confirm the negative association between technological distance and innovation performance, and the positive association between technological breadth and innovation performance. Contrary to expectations, technological distance plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between technological breadth and innovation performance. The results also show that while the extent of a firm&#39;s global sourcing has a positive relationship with its innovation performance, the relationship changes with technological distance.},

The advantages gained from the experience of working together can be complemented, but also offset, by common aspects of technology projects—like the dispersion of team members and the integration of heterogeneous tasks across global sites. This study develops and tests a conceptual framework that scrutinizes the impact of team familiarity and task allocation challenges. It identifies three elements of task allocation in technology projects that affect the familiarization process: (i) team (im)balance , (ii) task (im)balance , and (iii) task heterogeneity . An examination of 27,948 software tasks in six projects involving teams working apart on heterogeneous and dispersed tasks in the Netherlands and India shows that the experience of working together apart reduces the average cost of software tasks. This positive effect is enhanced by task heterogeneity and team balance, despite being hampered by task balance. These findings shed new light on task allocation challenges in cross-organizational technology projects distributed over the world.},

  abstract     = {Although using a single vendor when outsourcing information technology (IT) services (i.e., single-sourcing) is commonplace, splitting the IT service package among multiple vendors (i.e., multisourcing) is an increasingly popular strategy. However, our understanding of the factors that contribute to this trend is limited. Guided by a thorough review of the extant literature and interviews with industry experts, we focus on the influence of emerging technologies (i.e., cloud-based services and automation services), vendor location (i.e., offshore or domestic), and experiential learning (i.e., client and vendor experience) on the choice between single-sourcing and multisourcing for IT services. The trend towards more multisourcing exemplifies a broader movement towards greater disaggregation and distribution of knowledge work. Thus, we utilize a knowledge-based perspective to develop our hypotheses for how the aforementioned factors relate to the likelihood of multisourcing. Analyzing a large database of IT service contracts, we find that cloud-based services are less likely to be multisourced, but automation services are not significantly associated with the likelihood of multisourcing. We also find that more experienced client firms are more likely to adopt multisourcing. Conversely, our results indicate that more experienced vendors and vendors located offshore are less likely to be part of multisourcing arrangements. Exploratory post hoc analyses yield additional interesting insights related to client and vendor location. These findings advance our understanding of the drivers of the single-sourcing versus multisourcing decision in IT and more broadly contribute to the literature on technology sourcing. Our study has normative implications for both client and vendor management teams.},

  abstract     = {Many hotels have recently started to offer room upgrades digitally after the completion of booking to replace traditional front-desk upselling during check-in. Quickly becoming popular for upselling the premium rooms that may otherwise go unsold, standby upgrade—an availability-based, discounted premium room upgrade—is a prominent example. However, customers, in particular loyalty members, may become knowledgeable about standby upgrades through repeated interactions with this technology, and act strategically, that is, initially choose a standard room with the expectation of being offered a premium room discount through standby upgrades. Consequently, while enjoying the benefits of this program, hotels may face the potential cannibalization of premium sales due to such strategic behavior and need to adjust their pricing accordingly. Using a major hotel chain&#39;s 16-month booking and standby upgrades data, we empirically investigate the existence and extent of strategic customers in the context of standby upgrades. After showing preliminary evidence of potential strategic behavior, we develop a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the percentage of customers who are strategic. This estimator captures the sequential nature of customer decision-making for standby upgrades (booking decision, clicking the standby upgrades offer, and requesting an upgrade) through a Sequential Logit Model. We find evidence of strategic behavior in three (out of eight) hotels examined. Considering both a weak-form and a strong-form strategic behavior, our estimates suggest that 12\%–42\% of the loyalty customers act strategically in these three properties. We then propose a new pricing policy to help hoteliers maximize their premium room revenues from direct bookings and standby upgrade requests. This policy recommends a discounted full price, but also a higher standby upgrade price for loyalty customers, which can bring a revenue improvement of up to 19\% over a policy ignoring the strategic behavior and 34\% over a policy assuming that all customers are strategic—two reasonable benchmarks without an estimate of the fraction of strategic customers. Our research, thus, provides insights for technology managers on the potential customer behavioral challenges that a hotel may face with the adoption of a disruptive digital technology, and how existing policies may need to be adjusted for the technology to be successful.},

Moreover, disintermediation and decentralization have broken new ground for platform organizations and management mechanisms and instigated the concept of a DAO ( Decentralized Autonomous Organization ). Recent literature on operations management has called for further research on governance issues related to DAOs. In response to this call, we explore the relationship between DAO management efforts and platform performance in this study. Specifically, we propose and theoretically articulate decentralized voting tasks in DAOs as a new form of organizing. Harnessing both online and on-chain data from seven sources, we empirically examine how voting task division, task allocation, reward distribution, and information provision affect platform performance in the context of MakerDAO (an Ethereum-based stablecoin issuance platform). Our findings reveal that strategic decisions arrived at through voting have a positive impact on platform operational performance under certain conditions, whereas operational decisions resulting from voting have a negative impact. Moreover, we elucidate the moderating effects of voting task execution characteristics on the relationship between completed decision tasks and operational performance. These findings have important implications from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We also share all the raw data we use to promote the development of blockchain-related empirical research.},

Struggling to make a living and support their families, women miners are subject to discrimination, unfair labor practices, and poor access to rich foreign markets. Grounded in a longitudinal case study in Africa, this qualitative research examines the journey of an organization seeking to emancipate women miners through supply chains that embrace technology, provenance, and disintermediation. This research demonstrates the strategic value of emancipatory technologies for firms. Secondly, we find evidence that combinations of storytelling and digital records create multidimensional provenance that mitigates a number of supply chain risks, particularly in tainted chains.

  abstract     = {This study contributes to the technology management literature on the effects of IT on operations processes by examining the use of systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in professional services. The paper builds on key concepts on AI, information systems, professional work, and professional services operations management. A model is developed to explain how AI-based systems combine with humans to do work, both automating and augmenting the work of the professional, leading to process improvement and extension of the service offering. The study uses case-based research in two law firms and two accountancy firms using AI-based systems. It shows that AI-based systems are used selectively, mainly on high-volume, back-office tasks, across the sequence of stages in the professional service process—diagnosis, inference, and treatment. Automation using AI relieves professionals from repetitive tasks, while AI achieves augmentation by buffering professionals from low-value activity, making their expertise scalable and providing new analytical insights. System use can improve performance in delivering core professional services and enable service extension into additional, high-value advisory work. The model and research approach have potential implications for other emerging areas of technology management in OM.},

  abstract     = {Although disruptive “Industry 4.0” technologies often lack a clear business case, vendors are advocating and companies are actively exploring their use in operations settings. The technology management literature suggests that successful adoption derives from an appropriate fit between the specific technology and (1) economic and strategic factors, (2) operational and supply chain factors, and (3) organizational and behavioral factors. Through a five-year research project, we explore how drones—an archetypal emerging technology supported by a thriving vendor ecosystem—transitioned from early ideas to experimental applications to full adoption in daily operations. We analyze a range of data, including exploratory interviews with drone ecosystem actors, a secondary dataset, and case studies of drone applications in Geberit and IKEA. Key findings relate to our observation that technology adoption patterns for emerging technologies do not always follow the traditional linear logic of technology fit. We find that emerging technologies are characterized by a dynamic interaction between technology push from a thriving ecosystem and market pull from companies exploring meaningful operational and business value using the concept of “use case.” Based on these findings, we contribute to the technology management literature with an alternative technology adoption framework for emerging “Industry 4.0” technologies.},

This paper examines how managers actually think about resilience strategies, and then analyzes the relationship between operations, supply-chain characteristics, and the implemented strategies. We define a “Triple-P” framework that matches resilience strategies to supply-chain archetypes by examining P roduct, P artnership, and P rocess complexity based on interviews of senior supply-chain executives. These interviews revealed two major influencers of resilience strategy, that is, Homogeneity of internal supply-chain processes and Integration with other actors in their end-to-end supply chains . We found that the supply chains have different resilience requirements, have different ways to achieve resilience (which we conceptualize as “bespoke supply-chain resilience”), and face different obstacles to resilience. This study aims at initiating a dialogue between supply-chain scholars and practitioners to support more research for developing an effective supply-chain resilience strategy.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the waiting time a customer experiences in a service system is determined by the service processing time of preceding customers, among other factors. We argue that a directionally opposite effect, which diffuses from waiting time to her own service time, also exists in co-productive service contexts where a significant fraction of the service time is contributed by the customer. Multiple underlying customer behavioral mechanisms lead us to hypothesize that waiting&#39;s impact is dependent on the service stage and magnifies as the service process approaches completion. Our empirical analysis uses a unique operational data set that combines server log information with instant-messaging transcripts collected from a live-chat contact center. We show that pre-service waiting accelerates customer engagement—one dimension of customer instigated service time—only at the beginning of the conversation and then exhibits a slowdown effect as the conversation proceeds. In contrast, in-service waiting consistently slows down customer responses—another dimension of customer instigated service time, the magnitude of which is higher in later episodes of the agent-customer message exchanges. We discuss the practical implications of our findings on operational policies employed in contact centers.},

  abstract     = {Rural nanostores are the dominant source of packaged products for consumers in rural China, thus the more these stores order from reliable suppliers, the better the product quality available to rural areas. To improve merchandise circulation in rural areas, the Chinese government embarked on the large-scale “Thousands of Villages” (ToV) program in 2005. One of its key components was the implementation of an information technology (IT) procurement system to facilitate transactions between rural nanostores and the ToV program&#39;s certified consumer packaged goods (CPG) suppliers. The nanostores&#39; adoption of the ToV procurement system was encouraged yet voluntary. We study how this system was used initially and how it evolved over time. If effective, this program has the potential to address the growing social disparity between rural and developed areas in China. We first embarked on an exploratory analysis (March 2012) to understand the ToV program from the perspectives of nanostore owners, the ToV&#39;s CPG suppliers, and the government. We then collected interview data. In Period 1 (2013–2014), when the technology was still nascent, we found that nanostore owner&#39;s trust in the ToV&#39;s CPG suppliers, and system value, played key roles for nanostore owners to use the ToV procurement system. In Period 2 (2018–2019), three contextual factors emerged—population demographic shift, improved technology infrastructure, and trust in new [non-ToV] purchasing platforms—each hindering the ToV procurement system&#39;s use. We observed strong government support during the early phases of ToV, but that support evolved from subsidizing the ToV platform and offering associated training ( Period 1 ), to also providing credibility to competing non-ToV procurement platforms ( Period 2 ). Collectively, the findings identify idiosyncratic challenges that arise when public policies attempt to address developing region problems by reengineering supply chains via IT. We provide implications for IT research about technology management in rural developing areas and for managers to recognize potential pitfalls of managing IT projects in supply bases unfamiliar with advanced IT.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing technology platforms specializing in on-demand last mile delivery face a novel problem—heightened agent independence increases uncertainty in last mile delivery and has the potential to undermine operational performance. Uncertainty emanates from drivers&#39; competing interests, or opportunity costs. Rather than increase remuneration, some platforms have designed the technology to allow customers to tip, but the subsequent effects on driver behavior and last mile performance have not yet been studied. We explore this feature of on-demand delivery technology design—customer tipping—and its implications for crowdsourced delivery performance. Using netnography and secondary data sources, we empirically ground an adaptive, multi-agent hybrid simulation to propose how customer tipping impacts service performance through context-contingent driver behavior. Our results generally indicate that tipping as a technology design feature mitigates uncertainty in the crowdsourced delivery fleet and reduces fulfillment times and unit delivery costs. We also find evidence suggesting that the impact of tipping on driver behavior is geography-contingent, with tipping having unexpectedly detrimental effects in high population density areas relative to low-density areas. We conclude by making a series of theoretical propositions and managerial implications about designing technology to facilitate crowdsourced delivery.},

We draw upon our experience with two servicizing OEMs and highlight the inter-functional coordination and development of new business processes needed for OEMs to successfully manage the transition from selling the product to selling the service. Specifically, we discuss the interconnected nature of the business strategy, product development, supply chain, and accounting and finance functions in managing a servicizing business model. Along with close coordination in the strategic dimensions, OEMs also need to make changes in their operational processes to manage the return flow of multiple usecycle products to profitably remanufacture them and re-lease to customers. When operational changes are implemented correctly, the servicizing model also offers several benefits that are not present in the traditional sell-a-product business model.},

We draw on inventory theory and resource-based theories to hypothesize about the effect of supplier inventory leanness on a focal firm&#39;s financial performance and how supplier and focal firm inventory leanness interact to affect such outcomes. We test our hypotheses using a large panel dataset of supplier-focal firm relationships obtained from Compustat&#39;s Customer Segment database and aggregated to the focal firm-quarter level, as well as firm financial information from Compustat&#39;s Fundamentals Quarterly database. The econometric analyses provide evidence that supplier inventory leanness influences focal firm financial performance indirectly through the interaction with the firm&#39;s own inventory leanness. In particular, our estimation results detail how supplier inventory leanness affects the non-linearity of the focal firm&#39;s inventory leanness-financial performance relationship and its optimal inventory leanness level. The findings broaden the scope of empirical inventory literature and highlight supplier inventory leanness as an important consideration in firm-level inventory decision making.},

  abstract     = {This study is about competitive dynamics surrounding opportunistic innovation in the digital supply chain (i.e., on-line gaming, multi-media broadcasting, etc.). When a digital service firm falls short of delivering required services, consumers look for alternative service offerings. For competing firms, potential demand is created suddenly, and they are compelled to innovate to capture this opportunity. This innovation response occurs in reaction to a service failure, and we call it opportunistic innovation. We characterize opportunistic innovation as being situational and temporal—the opportunity is created by the failure of another firm, and it is taken up by the fast-responding firms. The goal of this study is to develop a theory of opportunistic innovation and empirically examine its presence and associated constructs. We have compiled the daily usage-and-update history of 460 online gaming services between 2014 and 2017 and their 58 major service failure events. Our results confirm the temporal and situational characteristics of opportunistic innovation. Firms with alternative services quickly introduce innovation to the market shortly after a service failure when the readiness for convertibility at competing firms is high. In addition, results suggest that opportunistic innovation is constrained by the resource congestion on the supplier side in the digital supply chain.},

Supply chain transparency (SCT) efforts are intended to signal positive information about the company to consumers but the benefits are often unclear, especially when consumers receive multiple, but mixed signals that include negative events. We draw on signaling theory to explore how consumers develop impressions of a company&#39;s products based on different evaluative dimensions: the positive integrity signal of SCT and the negative capability signal of a product recall. The incongruent signal set creates ambiguity for consumers in assessing product quality and subsequent purchase decisions. We develop two scenario-based experiments to test aspects of interdimensional signal incongruence. Experiment 1 investigates the magnitude of signal incongruity by considering combinations of different levels of SCT and product recall severity. Experiment 2 investigates the temporal effect of the incongruent signals, considering the restorative effect of SCT after a product recall signal has been received. While product recall signals are salient for consumers in shaping perceptions of product quality and purchase intentions across both experiments, we demonstrate the strategic value of SCT as a positive integrity signal to consumers.},

  abstract     = {Globalization has added a layer of complexity to the challenge of mitigating opportunism in buyer–supplier relationships. When engaging with suppliers in different countries, buyers must manage relationships across various cultures. Prior empirical research has shown that inter-firm power affects opportunism in exchange relationships, and conceptual studies suggest that national culture is a location characteristic that could influence inter-firm power. However, no research has empirically examined the efficacy of inter-firm power in controlling opportunism, or other exchange outcomes, across different cultural contexts. To study this relevant issue, we investigate how a supplier&#39;s national culture influences the effectiveness of two bases of inter-firm power, coercive and expert power, on a form of opportunism that has been anecdotally observed in practice—supplier shirking. We utilize primary dyadic data on 109 outsourcing relationships and secondary data of supply chain location characteristics to examine this phenomenon. We find that the effects of inter-firm power on shirking vary across suppliers in different cultures and that, in certain cultures, coercive power may reduce the effectiveness of expert power. Our results show that manufacturers must explicitly consider suppliers&#39; national culture when managing a globally dispersed supply base or risk encountering supplier shirking.},

  abstract     = {To exercise risk control at the corporate level, firms often appoint Chief Risk Officers (CROs) to their top management team. By establishing CRO positions, firms can reduce firm risk and potential financial losses caused by operational disruptions. Yet, by inducing stringent control measures on risks, security, and compliance, CRO appointments might create unwieldy bureaucracies with operational hurdles and incur burdensome costs that offset efficiency. Using longitudinal secondary data collected from multiple sources, we analyze the impact of CRO appointments on firm risk and operational efficiency of 435 publicly listed firms in the United States from 2006 to 2016. Our results indicate that CRO appointments not only reduce risks, but also improve efficiency in operations. We delve into the power of CROs and find that more powerful CROs are more effective in enhancing the operational efficiency of firms. We further examine the contextual factors and reveal that firms operating under high industry litigation threats and industry dynamism improve operational efficiency to a greater extent after CRO appointments. Overall, CROs&#39; appointments are more beneficial to firms when they have stronger power in the top management team and when the operating environments are uncertain and volatile.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the performance impacts of design sourcing choices in addressing an architectural innovation from its originating market to subsequent markets. We maintain that the effects of design internalization and externalization on the technological performance of firms&#39; products may vary across the originating and subsequent markets with different requisite technological demands due to the dynamics of knowledge spillovers and knowledge exchange hazards in those markets. We hypothesize that design internalization is likely to outperform design externalization when facing an architectural innovation in a subsequent upscale market with a higher technological performance requisite than in the originating market. The case is then reverse in a subsequent downscale market with a lower technological performance requisite. We test our hypotheses in the empirical contexts of the US bicycle markets in which the index gear-shifting technology (i.e., an architectural innovation) originated in the road bicycle market in 1985 and subsequently traversed to the mountain bicycle market (i.e., an upscale market) in 1987 and the city bicycle market (i.e., a downscale market) in 1988. The results are largely in line with our hypotheses. The contributions of our study to the current literature as well as its managerial implications are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how patients can co-create value when transitioning care between the hospital and home after a major life altering surgery such as kidney transplant. Collaborating with health care providers at a large U.S. hospital, we adopted an intervention-based research approach to develop a standardized peer-mentoring program where former patients mentor current patients for 30 days postdischarge. We assessed the impact of the program on patient anxiety and 30-day readmissions through a randomized control trial that recruited 80 transplant patients. Our analyses of patient anxiety indicated that patients in the treatment arm experienced 3.42 points greater decrease in anxiety score over 30 days, suggesting that care transitions using mentors decreases anxiety levels among patients. Our analyses of readmissions led to an unexpected but explainable result. We found that patients in the treatment arm were at 12.6 times greater risk of readmission during the first 30 days. Exploratory analysis suggests that increased readmission may have been due to patients reporting complications sooner, which allowed them to get treated earlier. Overall, our study informs healthcare operations on how to design effective transition of care programs using cost-effective resources and offers new insights on using patient-centric metrics.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the long-standing interest in understanding the role of location for firm performance, this paper provides a semiparametric methodology to accommodate locational heterogeneity in production analysis. Our approach is novel in that we explicitly model spatial variation in parameters in the production-function estimation. We accomplish this by allowing both the input-elasticity and productivity parameters to be unknown functions of the firm&#39;s geographic location and estimate them via local kernel methods. This allows the production technology to vary across space, thereby accommodating neighborhood influences on firm production. In doing so, we are also able to examine the role of cross-location differences in explaining the variation in operational productivity among firms. Our model is superior to the alternative spatial production-function formulations because it (i) explicitly estimates the cross-locational variation in production functions, (ii) is readily reconcilable with the conventional production axioms and, more importantly, (iii) can be identified from the data by building on the popular proxy-variable methods, which we extend to incorporate locational heterogeneity. Using our methodology, we study China&#39;s chemicals manufacturing industry and find that differences in technology (as opposed to in idiosyncratic firm heterogeneity) are the main source of the cross-location differential in total productivity in this industry.},

  abstract     = {Despite numerous optimization techniques proposed to address inventory record inaccuracy (IRI), there continues to be a lack of empirical appreciation of IRI, nor do existing item-level inspection policies accommodate managerial needs for allocating inspection effort to groups of items. We address these issues by collaborating with a retailer to collect archival data and develop statistical estimation and practical optimization techniques that address IRI. We propose a continuous-time model to explain group-level information decay and, based on the model&#39;s structure, develop an inspection policy that satisfies managerial needs for allocating inspection effort to a group of items. After analyzing model behavior and quantifying unobservable cost factors using information readily available, we test the efficacy of the proposed policy within the retailing environment and find it to outperform both the retailer&#39;s inspection routines and a well-established industry benchmark. Finally, we illustrate how to optimize grouping and inspection decisions jointly and show potential benefits from optimized group formation. Our empirically grounded modeling effort yields transferable methods and generalizable insights for improving inventory integrity.},

  abstract     = {While the literature tends to take a dichotomous view of supplier-induced disruptions, we take a continuum perspective: a buyer perceives a disruption induced by the supplier to varying degrees (i.e., attributing varying levels of responsibility to the supplier), thus affecting the buyer&#39;s decisions in switching suppliers. By focusing on the recurrent disruptions, we argue that imputed buyers&#39; attributions of responsibility are characterized by disruptions&#39; recurrent nature and locus of causality —whether the disruptions were repeatedly triggered by recurrent events internal or external to the supplier. Furthermore, while previous studies have identified either buyers&#39; attributions of disruptions or suppliers&#39; justice approaches (to resolve disruptions) as independent factors driving buyers&#39; decisions, we integrate attribution and justice theories and investigate their combined effect—how responsibility attributions affect buyers&#39; switching intentions given suppliers&#39; justice approaches. Using three vignette-based studies of 705 purchasing managers (supplemented by three robustness check studies), we show that distributive justice attenuates the damaging impact of disruptions triggered by suppliers&#39; internal incidents (internal locus) on buyers&#39; switching intentions, whereas procedural and interactional justice are more instrumental in disruptions triggered by external events (external locus). We conclude by offering substantive guidance for suppliers regarding appropriate actions in preserving the relationship.},

  abstract     = {We empirically examine the effect of product variety on sales at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level. Prior empirical operations management studies generally treat product variety as a single-dimensional measure (e.g., the number of SKUs carried by the store, distribution center, or firm) and study its impact on aggregate sales (e.g., sales at the store, distribution center, or firm). As such, SKUs from different brands are assumed to contribute equally to total sales, which is not always the case. To address this, we need to conceptualize product variety within brands and investigate its impact on sales at a more granular level. In this study, we propose and theoretically articulate two product variety dimensions (within-brand variety [ WV ] and average WV of other brands [ AWVO ]) to investigate the mechanisms that connect product variety to SKU-level sales. Using a detailed transaction dataset from a local grocery retailer, we first show that product variety conceptualized within brands (i.e., the mean of WVs [ MWV ]) does have an impact on aggregate subcategory sales, as the literature suggests. At the SKU level, we find WV increases same-brand SKU sales, while AWVO reduces it. Our work provides an alternative explanation to the inverted U-shaped relationship between product variety and aggregate sales observed in the literature: Increasing variety only increases sales of SKUs belonging to the brand whose variety has increased, while it decreases sales of the other SKUs. We also find that variety effects vary significantly across different profitability levels and product categories. Product variety appears to have the strongest positive effect on high-margin products. The impact of product variety on specific product category sales varies from as high as 11\% to negligible. We further discuss the practical value of our findings and show the robustness of our results through multiple tests while addressing endogeneity using the control function approach.},

  abstract     = {A buyer–supplier new product development (NPD) project is an ambiguous and complex transaction, making neither formal contracts nor a collaborative relationship sufficient to ensure project success. NPD project performance could also be directly influenced by the transactional psychological contracts (TPCs) of project members due to their strong motivational effect. Adopting a dyadic view, we explore the performance implications of buyer–supplier TPCs (in)congruence using a matched, dyadic survey dataset from 279 NPD projects. We find that levels of congruence (congruent vs. incongruent), types of congruence (high–high vs. low–low), and directions of in congruence (buyer-higher vs. supplier-higher) all affect project performance. Challenging the conventional wisdom that buyer–supplier congruence is generally productive, we find that congruence in TPCs, a generally undesirable type of PC, lowers product quality in NPD projects. This is because congruence in TPCs locks project members in the status quo by creating psychological balance and removing healthy conflicts, which prevents a team from balancing between exploration and exploitation. The combination of buyer-lower, supplier-higher TPCs incongruence is most effective for improving both product quality and development efficiency. These results remind NPD project managers that buyer and supplier TPCs can interact to jointly affect project outcomes beyond individual influences of each party&#39;s TPC.},
