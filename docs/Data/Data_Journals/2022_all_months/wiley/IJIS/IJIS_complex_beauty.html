  abstract     = {Emotion recognition has become a research focus in the brain–computer interface and cognitive neuroscience. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is employed for its advantages as accurate, objective, and noninvasive nature. However, many existing research only focus on extracting the time and frequency domain features of the EEG signals while failing to utilize the dynamic temporal changes and the positional relationships between different electrode channels. To fill this gap, we develop the dynamic differential entropy and brain connectivity features based EEG emotion recognition using linear graph convolutional network named DDELGCN. First, the dynamic differential entropy feature which represents the frequency domain feature as well as time domain feature is extracted based on the traditional differential entropy feature. Second, brain connectivity matrices are constructed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient, phase-locked value and transfer entropy, and then are used to denote the connectivity features of all electrode combinations. Finally, a linear graph convolutional network is customized and applied to aggregate the features from total electrode combinations and then classifies the emotional states, which consists of five layers, namely, an input layer, two linear graph convolutional layers, a fully connected layer, and a softmax layer. Extensive experiments show that the accuracies in the valence and arousal dimensions reach 90.88\% and 91.13\%, and the precision reaches 96.66\% and 97.02\% on the DEAP dataset, respectively. On the SEED dataset, the accuracy and precision reach 91.56\% and 97.38\%, respectively.},

Secondly, the privacy level of the trajectory data in the clusters is measured individually, which ensures the needs for personalized privacy protection are met. Finally, a noise trajectory (NTR) tree based on differential privacy is constructed, and the allocation of privacy budget and noise addition are optimized.

Once the devices are infected with virus, the damages to companies and users are unpredictable. Although researchers have developed malware detection methods, the analysis result still cannot achieve the desired accuracy due to complicated malicious code families and fast-growing variants. In this paper, to solve this problem, we combine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to design an efficient and accurate malware detection method. First, we implement a code visualization method and utilize GAN to generate more samples of malicious code variants in the role of data augmentation. Then, the lightweight AlexNet originated from CNN to classify malware families. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate that our CNN plus GAN model can achieve a higher classification accuracy (i.e., 97.78\%) compared with some related work.},

  abstract     = {Macrophotography Images (MPIs) have recently emerged as an active topic due to the development of mobile phone camera technology. A large number of MPIs have been rapidly increasing in many rich visual services, such as smartphones or high-definition monitors. MPIs are often composed of sharp macroimage and blur background, which exhibit different perceptual properties that often lead to different just noticeable difference (JND) estimation. Inspired by this, we formulate the blur concealment (BC) as another factor to determine the total masking effect: the interaction is relatively straightforward with a limited masking effect in the sharp regions, and is complicated with a strong masking effect in the blur parts. Furthermore, texture and orientation adaption and color information weighting are separately incorporated into the contrast masking and color masking. Finally, considering both BC and masking effects, a novel robust watermarking framework based on the proposed blur-guided JND model for MPIs, targeting at further improving the MPIs copyright protection performance. Extensive experiments on MP2020 and Blur Detection data sets show that the applicability of the proposed JND model in the scenario of perceptually MPIs watermarking, and our proposed scheme can outperform the state-of-the-art watermarking schemes by providing better robustness performance at the uniform visual quality.},

Then, a new Pythagorean fuzzy entropy measure is defined to compute the objective weights of criteria. Meanwhile, a combined weighting method is presented, which makes the criteria weights consist of subjective weights and objective weights. Furthermore, combined weights are applied to the decision-making process and a graph-based Pythagorean fuzzy decision-making method is proposed.

  abstract     = {Exploring the finest shortest-path traveling salesman optimization application is a typical NP-hard problem. Similarly the solution of the large-scale optimization applications is also a big challenging issue in front of scientists. First, African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) was developed to resolve continuous applications where it performed fine. In the last few months, many enhanced strategies of AVOA have been offered in recent literature works and it has been extensively utilized to resolve large-scale engineering optimization applications. This study offers a newly modified dimension learning hunting (DLH)-based AVOA called DLHAV algorithm to resolve highly complex continuous and discrete applications. It helps improve the imbalance amid the hunting (or exploitation) and search (or exploration), the lack of crowd diversity, slow convergence speed, trapping in local optima, and early convergence of the AVOA variant. The proposed strategy benefits from a newly driven approach called the DLH search approach congenital from the separate exploitation behavior of vultures in the search domain. DLH exploration strategy utilizes a distinct method to make the best neighborhood for all vultures in which the nearest member information can be supplied amid vultures. DLH helps in improving the balance amid global and local and sustains diversity. To scrutinize the performance of DLHAV, the solutions of the DLHAV method are verified on 29-CEC&#39;17 and 10-CEC&#39;20 with familiar comparative methods and some other classical optimization approaches over many familiar traveling salesman problem/large-scale instances. With the intention of attaining unbiased and rigorous comparison, descriptive statistics such as standard deviation and mean have been applied, and the statistical Friedman test is also conducted. The experimental solution carried out in this study has revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms significantly over the other alternative optimizers.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly important in cybersecurity, as they can quickly analyse and identify different types of threats from millions of events. In spite of the increasing number of possible applications of ML, successful adoption of ML models in cybersecurity still highly relies on the explainability of those models that are used for making predictions. Explanations that support ML model outputs are crucial in cybersecurity-oriented ML applications because people need to get more information from the model than just binary output for analysis. The explainable models help ML developers solve the “trust” problem for a security application prediction in a faithful way: validating model behaviours, diagnosing misclassifications and sometimes automatically patching errors in the target models. Therefore, explainable ML for cybersecurity has become a necessary and important research branch. In this paper, we present the topic of explainable ML in cybersecurity through two general types of explanations: (1) ante hoc explanation, and (2) post hoc explanation, with their methodologies. We systematically review and categorise the state-of-the-art research, and provide comparative studies to help researchers find the optimal solutions to specific problems. We further list open issues in this field to facilitate future studies. This survey will benefit diverse groups of readers from both academia and industries, who want to effectively use ML to solve cybersecurity challenges.},

We aim to reduce model complexity by reducing the number of parameters while achieving better (or at least comparable) performance. We propose an Interpolation Graph Convolutional Network (IGCN) for extracting features of point clouds. IGCN uses the point cloud graph structure and a specially designed Interpolation Convolution Kernel to mimic the operations of CNN for feature extraction. On the basis of weight postfusion and multilevel-resolution aggregation, IGCN not only reduces the cost of calculating the interpolation operation but also improves the model&#39;s performance. We validate the performance of IGCN on both point cloud classification and segmentation tasks and explore the contribution of each module of our model through ablation experiments. Furthermore, we embed the IGCN point cloud feature extraction module as a plug-and-play module into other frameworks and perform point cloud registration experiments.},

In general, multimodal-based methods can achieve better performance because of the complementation among different modalities. However, the majority of them simply concatenate features from different modalities, failing to well preserve the mutual information in common features. To address this issue, a novel framework named semantic-enhanced multimodal fusion network is proposed for fake news detection, which can better capture mutual features among events and thus benefit the detection of fake news. This model consists of three subnetworks, namely multimodal fusion and event domain adaptation networks as well as the fake news detector. Specifically, the multimodal fusion network aims to extract deep features from texts and images and fuse them into a common semantic feature known as a snapshot. Then, the fake news detector can learn the representation of posts. Finally, the event domain adaptation network can single out and remove the peculiar features of each event, and keep shared features among events. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches on two real-world multimedia data sets.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial attacks expose the vulnerability of deep neural networks. Compared to image adversarial attacks, textual adversarial attacks are more challenging due to the discrete nature of texts. Recent synonym-based methods achieve the current state-of-the-art results. However, these methods introduce new words against the original text, leading to that humans easily perceive the difference between the adversarial example and the original text. Motivated by the fact that humans are usually unaware of chaotic word order in some cases, we propose exchange-attack (EA), a concise and effective word-level textual adversarial attack model. Specifically, the EA model generates adversarial examples by exchanging words of the original text itself according to the contributions that these words make regarding classification results. Intuitively, the smaller the distance between the two exchanged words, the more difficult the chaotic word order to be perceived by humans. We thus take the word distance into consideration when generating the chaotic word orders. Extensive experiments on several text classification data sets show that the EA model consistently outperforms the selected baselines in terms of averaged after-attack accuracy, modification rate, query number, and semantic similarity.

  abstract     = {Hashing techniques have attracted considerable attention owing to their advantages of efficient computation and economical storage. However, it is still a challenging problem to generate more compact binary codes for promising performance. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive vision transformer hashing method, which seamlessly integrates contrastive learning and vision transformers (ViTs) with hash technology into a well-designed model to learn informative features and compact binary codes simultaneously. First, we modify the basic contrastive learning framework by designing several hash layers to meet the specific requirement of hash learning. In our hash network, ViTs are applied as backbones for feature learning, which is rarely performed in existing hash learning methods. Then, we design a multiobjective loss function, in which contrastive loss explores discriminative features by maximizing agreement between different augmented views from the same image, similarity preservation loss performs pairwise semantic preservation to enhance the representative capabilities of hash codes, and quantization loss controls the quantitative error. Hence, we can facilitate end-to-end joint training to improve the retrieval performance. The encouraging experimental results on three widely used benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Rice leaf disease (RLD) is one of the major factors that cause the decline in production, and the automatic recognition of such diseases under natural field conditions is of great significance for timely targeted rice management. Although many machine learning approaches have been proposed for RLD recognition, scale variation is still a challenging problem that affects prediction accuracy, especially in uncontrolled environments, such as natural fields. Also, the existing RLD data sets are collected in laboratory environments or with a constant scale, which cannot be used to develop the RLD classification algorithms under natural field conditions. To tackle these particular challenges, we propose a multiscale voting mechanism for RLD recognition under natural field conditions. First, data from 26 rice fields were collected to build a data set containing 6046 images of RLD. Afterwards, a feature pyramid was embedded into a mainstream classification architecture (EfficientNet) with a bottom-up and top-down pathway for feature fusion at different scales. To further reduce the inconsistency among multiscaled features, a multiscale voting strategy with regard to probability distribution was proposed to integrate the decisions from various scales. Each proposed module was carefully validated through an ablation study to demonstrate its effectiveness, and the proposed method was compared with a few state-of-the-art algorithms, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector, Feature Pyramid Networks, Path Aggregation Network, and Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network. Experimental results have shown that the classification accuracy of our model can reach 90.24\%, which is 4.48\% higher than that of the original EfficientNet-b0 model and 1.08\% higher than that of existing multiscale networks. Finally, we exploit and demonstrate a visualized explanation for the boosted performance from the proposed model. As an extra outcome, our data set and codes are available at to benefit the whole research community.},

In this paper, the full round differential characteristics for CRAFT block cipher are given. A new method on counting the number of differentials by using correlation matrix is given. We can compute the number of all optimal characteristics or suboptimum differentials with the same input difference and output difference by hand. We explore the multiple differential trails and compute the probability of differential characteristic by using the multiplication of correlation matrices. Our work complements automatic search methods for the best differential with a careful manual analysis. Since the automatic search method is stranded by storage and search space limitations, which will cause a computer to crash as the number of search rounds increases. Thanks to the correlation matrix technique, we are able to find differential distinguishers for 9-round of the cipher with the probability of at least . Moreover, we can construct differential distinguisher covers more rounds based on the 9-round differential distinguishers. As one of its typical application, we propose the differential characteristics for the full-round CRAFT which ensure that the probability of each round is optimal. Besides, we explore the clustering effect on the full round by exhibiting a class of high probability characteristics for 9-round. In general, we obtain a good understanding of the propagation of differences for CRAFT due to its algebraic structure.},

  abstract     = {To prevent the abuse of low-rate speech-based steganography from threatening cyberspace security, the corresponding steganalysis approaches have been developed and received significant attention from research community. However, most existing steganalysis methods assume that steganography methods are known in advance, which in practice is impractical. That is why, in this paper, we present three blind detection schemes suitable for steganography in low-bit-rate speech streams. The first is based on mixed sample data augmentation. It randomly selects a certain proportion of steganographic samples from the sample set of each steganographic method to form a training set together with the original carrier samples for training to enhance the robustness of the model. The second relies on decision fusion where first step is to train a dedicated classification model for each steganography method and then use a majority voting mechanism in the detection stage to fuse the outputs of each model to give the final detection result. Compared to the other two steganalysis schemes, the third one design the detection model based on self-paced ensemble according to the distribution characteristics of speech samples. Its main idea is to fully train multiple base classifiers through multiple iterations as well as under-sampling processes, and organically fuse them to form a powerful ensemble classifier. In each iteration, differing from the traditional ensemble classifier solution, we put more attention to the steganographic samples at the decision boundary for the under-sampling process of the steganography set composed of multiple steganography methods, rather than randomly selecting steganographic samples. The steganographic samples at the decision boundary are searched using the classification hardness given by the ensemble classifier trained in the last iteration, which is more informative and more conducive to improve the performance of base classifiers. The experimental results show that the proposed three schemes can achieve efficient blind detection for low-bit-rate speech-based steganography, and the steganalysis scheme based on the self-paced ensemble has the best performance. Specifically, when the embedding rate is at 30\%, the accuracy of the steganalysis scheme based on self-paced ensemble is more than 85\%, while the accuracy of the other two steganalysis method is less than 80\%. Additionally, the steganalysis scheme based on the self-paced ensemble learning even outperforms dedicated detectors for specific steganographic methods in terms of recall for steganographic sample detection.},

  abstract     = {An interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) contains the infinite number of embedded membership functions (MFs) defined as type-1 fuzzy sets. The center of gravity (COG) of an IT2FS is obtained by integrating the centroids of all these MFs. However, obtaining the COG of an IT2FS in a continuous domain is impossible because the number of embedded MFs is infinite and, in a discrete domain, comes with exponential time complexity. Therefore, different algorithms were proposed to find the center of centroids (COCs) instead of the COG. These algorithms do not necessarily obtain the exact value of COC; they compete to find a more accurate result in less time. In this study, we propose a simple noniterative method to obtain the COG of IT2FSs. This method only considers the MFs which form the boundary values, that is, the lower MF (LMF) and upper MF (UMF), and obtains their centroids separately. We show that the COG of an IT2FS is equal to the weighted sum of the centroids of its LMF and UMF if the relative areas of LMF and UMF are considered their corresponding weights. We call this method the Indirect COG (ICOG) method because it indirectly obtains the COG of an IT2FS. This method finds the accurate COG of an IT2FS by considering only two MFs instead of infinite MFs. It can also obtain the accurate COG of an uncommon polygonal IT2FS schematically. We use numerical examples to illustrate that the ICOG obtains the accurate COG of an IT2FS very fast in a nonexponential time. We also develop a new triangular interval type-2 fuzzy analytical hierarchy process that uses the ICOG method to accurately defuzzify the IT2 fuzzy weights.},

  abstract     = {Modeling other agents&#39; behaviors plays an important role in decision models for interactions among multiple agents. To optimize its own decisions, a subject agent needs to model what other agents act simultaneously in an uncertain environment. However, modeling insufficiency occurs when the agents are competitive and the subject agent cannot get full knowledge about other agents. Even when the agents are collaborative, they may not share their true behaviors due to their privacy concerns. Most of the recent research still assumes that the agents have common knowledge about their environments and a subject agent has the true behavior of other agents in its mind. Consequently, the resulting techniques are not applicable in many practical problem domains. In this article, we investigate into diversifying behaviors of other agents in the subject agent&#39;s decision model before their interactions. The challenges lie in generating and measuring new behaviors of other agents. Starting with prior knowledge about other agents&#39; behaviors, we use a linear reduction technique to extract representative behavioral features from the known behaviors. We subsequently generate their new behaviors by expanding the features and propose two diversity measurements to select top- behaviors. We demonstrate the performance of the new techniques in two well-studied problem domains. The top- behavior selection embarks the study of unknown behaviors in multiagent decision making and inspires investigation of diversifying agents&#39; behaviors in competitive agent interactions. This study will contribute to intelligent systems dealing with unknown unknowns in an open artificial intelligence world.},

This paper proposes an IoT botnet detection method using feature reconstruction and interval optimization to solve the above problems. Through the designed address triple and time window-based IP aggregation and feature reconstruction method (ATTW-IP-FR), the network traffic samples obtained from the IoT gateway are integrated, and the flow features are reconstructed to attain the reconstructed sample set. The proposed self-corrected hybrid weighted sampling algorithm balances the normal and botnet flow samples in the reconstructed sample set to get the resampling sample set. The introduced multiattribute decision-making and adjacency relation chain-based sequential forward selection algorithm is applied to eliminate the redundant features in the resampling sample set, and the optimal feature subset is obtained. The resampling sample set filtered by the optimal feature subset is detected and classified through the designed two-stage hybrid heterogeneous model optimized by the intermittent chaos and bald eagle search algorithm-based interval optimization algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively detects the botnet in two real IoT scenarios. The detection accuracy is 99.17, the Matthews correlation coefficient is 98.35, the false positive rate is 0.25, and the false negative rate is 1.27, which are better than the existing methods. This method can effectively reduce sampling and feature selection time and space overhead and better adapt to the resource-constrained IoT environment.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzing is considered to be an essential approach to guarantee the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) based systems. The DNN fuzzing leverages various inputs prioritization methods to guide the testing process. The current research mainly focus on constructing testing metrics that symbolize the logical representation of the DNN to guide the generation of test cases, which neglects the potential performance brought by implementing heuristic algorithm. Moreover, the straightforward implementation of queue structure can not represent the metamorphic relationships between generated inputs in DNN fuzzing. Therefore, developing the appropriate heuristic algorithm-based inputs prioritization method is critical to improve the performance of DNN fuzzers. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based inputs prioritization method called (Exploration and Exploitation) that formulates DNN testing exploration as the sequential decision process. The technique introduces an innovative tree-structure design that schedules inputs from the statistical perspective. Different from traditional DNN testing, the batch pool is maintained in the form of nodes in MCTS. The links between nodes precisely represent the metamorphic relationship between input batches, which indicates the potential value for in-depth search. Furthermore, a novel simulation mechanism is implemented to adapt MCTS in DNN testing, which attain better coverage feedback. The effectiveness of our method is comprehensively investigated on six popular deep learning models from LeNet and VGG families. The comparison experiments are conducted between DeepHunter, TensorFuzz, and DeepSmartFuzzer to demonstrate efficacy on various testing metrics. The experimental results show that the significantly enhance the coverage gain of DNN fuzzing up to 30\% against the best performance in comparison groups.},

In addition, existing methods still need to pay more attention to the sentiment information, user-interaction, and attempt to merge more external knowledge to help improve the effect of stance detection.},

In particular, the generation of complex basic belief assignment (CBBA) is a key issue for uncertainty modeling in complex evidence theory. In this paper, we first construct complex interval number (CIN) model. In this context, we propose a novel CBBA generation method to model uncertainty in the framework of complex planes. Furthermore, we propose a novel decision-making algorithm on the basis of the CIN-based CBBA generation method.

  abstract     = {Integrated berth and quay crane allocation problem (BQCAP) are two essential seaside operational problems in container terminal scheduling. Most existing works consider only one objective on operation and partition of quay into berths of the same lengths. In this study, BQCAP is modeled in a multiobjective setting that aims to minimize total equipment used and overall operational time and the quay is partitioned into berths of different lengths, to make the model practical in the real-world and complex quay layout setting. To solve the new BQCAP efficiently, a multiobjective hydrologic cycle optimization algorithm is devised considering problem characteristics and historical Pareto-optimal solutions. Specifically, the quay crane of the large vessel in all Pareto-optimal solutions is rearranged to increase the chance of finding a good solution. Besides, worse solutions are probabilistic retained to maintain diversity. The proposed algorithm is applied to a real-world terminal scheduling problem with different sizes from a container terminal company. Experimental results show that our algorithm generally outperforms the other well-known peer algorithms and its variants on solving BQCAP, especially in finding the Pareto-optimal solutions range.},

The existing methods mainly decouple the problem into the two-stage decoupling training, that is, representation learning and classifier training, or multistage training based on knowledge distillation, thus resulting in huge training steps and extra computation cost. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective One-stage Long-tailed Self-Distillation framework, called OLSD, which simultaneously takes representation learning and classifier training into one-stage training. For representation learning, we take two different sampling distributions and mixup them to input them into two branches, where the collaborative consistency loss is introduced to train network consistency, and we theoretically show that the proposed mixup naturally generates a tail-majority distribution mixup. For classifier training, we introduce balanced self-distillation guided knowledge transfer to improve generalization performance, where we theoretically show that proposed knowledge transfer implicitly minimizes not only cross-entropy but also KL divergence between head-to-tail and tail-to-head. Extensive experiments on long-tailed CIFAR10/100, ImageNet-LT and multilabel long-tailed VOC-LT demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s effectiveness.},

We comprehensively considered the similarity between the actual work track and the predetermined track from the two characteristics of track angle and track distance. Among them, the similarity of track rotation angle is calculated using the improved longest common subsequence algorithm, and the similarity of track distance is calculated using the improved dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. Then the results of the similarity calculation of these two features are weighted. Finally, the weighted results are used to evaluate the similarity between the actual work track and the predetermined track, so as to judge whether the actual work track meets the requirements of the predetermined track. Experimental data show that the trajectory similarity matching algorithm in this paper has higher accuracy and efficiency than traditional DTW and other algorithms, and has higher ability to resist the interference of trajectory point evacuation than traditional DTW and other algorithms.},

Therefore, differentiating potential responders from primary nonresponders is clinically important. In this double-center study, we developed and validated a computed tomography enterography (CTE)-based radiomic signature (RS) for identification of CD patients at high risk of primary nonresponse (PNR) to IFX therapy, and demonstrated its incremental value to the clinical model. A total of 244 patients (training cohort,  = 119; test cohort 1,  = 51; test cohort 2,  = 74) were retrospectively recruited. Their clinical data and pretreatment CTE were retrieved and analyzed. All patients underwent IFX induction therapy. Reliability of clinical factors and radiomic-based features were assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). In all, 1130 radiomic features were extracted from the whole inflamed gut in CTE images. In training cohort and test cohorts 1 and 2, the RS that discriminated PNR to IFX therapy yielded AUCs of 0.848, 0.789, and 0.789, respectively (all  &lt; 0.05). By combining the clinical predictors (C-reactive protein, albumin, and body mass index) and RS, the radiomic-clinical model showed an increase in predicting performance (AUCs: 0.864, 0.794, and 0.791, respectively; all  &lt; 0.05). Decision curve analysis and net reclassification improvement demonstrated the clinical usefulness of the radiomic-clinical model. In this study, the proposed RS showed potential as a clinical aid for the accurate identification of CD patients at high risk of PNR to IFX therapy before treatment.

  abstract     = {The cloud-assisted intelligent systems have attracted extensive attention due to their powerful data analysis and computation capabilities. However, how to handle encrypted data remains a challenging problem in intelligent systems. A promising solution is searchable symmetric encryption (SSE), which enables a client to privately outsource their data to the cloud while preserving keyword search functionality. In practice, dynamic SSE is more practical and supports efficient data addition and deletion. Unfortunately, data update will leak some additional information which can be exploited to break data privacy. To address this issue, forward and backward secure SSE schemes are proposed to reduce the leakage of data update. That is, forward security guarantees that the newly updated documents cannot reveal the previously searched keywords, while backward security guarantees that the server cannot recover the deleted documents. However, the existing forward and backward secure SSE schemes mainly consider curious-but-honest server. How to verify the soundness and completeness of search results is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a noninteractive verifiable dynamic SSE scheme with forward and backward security from two universal accumulators. Specifically, the server in our scheme only needs one roundtrip to return the nondeleted search results to the client, which saves the communication overhead dramatically. Besides, our scheme can achieve public verification that anyone can verify the search results but not only the client who has the private key. Finally, we give a formal security analysis and compare the proposed scheme with other related work, the results show that our scheme can achieve the desired security properties with practical efficiency.},

The projected path of grocery delivery to different residences in containment zones is determined by estimating the similarity measure between each residence and the various necessary goods.

To mitigate the security risk of 5G data leakage, building covert channel is an alternative approach of providing confidential data transmission. Due to the high transmission rate of 5G, the interpacket intervals become small and derandomized, this caused the encoding phase of the covert timing channel imports relatively large modulation errors. rearranging is a widespread phenomenon that is occurred over the data communications. In this paper, we propose a rearrangement covert channel approach named Hybrid Variable-length Packet Rearrangement Covert Timing Channel (HVPR-CTC), which artificially chooses the delimiter packets and identification (ID) packets from the overt traffics, and encodes the packet sending order between adjacent delimiter packets according to a generated hybrid variable-length codeword dictionary, and embeds the secret message by rearranging the sending order of the ID packets. The experiments demonstrate that the HVPR-CTC scheme can effectively perform strategy adjustment: its minimum Location Square Deviation is 0.832 and minimum Swap Deviation is 139. the maximum throughput reaches 14.37 bps, and the optimal Bit Error Rate is 3.27\% and 9.70\% for low-channel noise and high-channel noise communication conditions, respectively.},

As a consequence, parallel processing systems are gaining popularity to enhance overall computer performance. Programmers should be able to efficiently utilize available hardware resources with parallelization in an ideal world. Through the automatic parallelization of sequential code, multithreading can be executed without extra supervision. However, a wide range of software dependencies prevents this from being feasible. An architectural framework for speculative parallelization along with an efficient memory analysis and computational algorithms for the code generation are proposed that can provide optimal performance. Furthermore, a suitable support of hardware design as a runtime library to the proposed architectural framework is presented which can be used to recover misspeculated results during execution to minimize speculative parallelism overhead. The implementation makes use of the Low-Level Virtual Machine compiler infrastructure and is tested on numerous benchmarks, thus making it highly scalable in terms of programming languages and architectures. According to our experimental results, there is significant potential for speedup increase. In comparison to the overall function speedup, that is, geomean speedup of 5.2× approximately when using the proposed architecture without hardware support, the proposed architectural framework and algorithm with hardware support give an average geomean speedup of 7.0× approximately on the given benchmark which is written in C/C++.},

  abstract     = {In distributed machine learning training, bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) and asynchronous parallel (ASP) are two main synchronization methods to help achieve gradient aggregation. However, BSP needs longer training time due to “stragglers” problem, while ASP sacrifices the accuracy due to “gradient staleness” problem. In this article, we propose a distributed training paradigm on parameter server framework called adaptive synchronous strategy (A2S) which improves the BSP and ASP paradigms by adaptively adopting different parallel training schemes for workers with different training speeds. Based on the stale value between the fastest and slowest worker, A2S adaptively adds a relaxed synchronous barrier for fast workers to alleviate gradient staleness, where a differentiated weighting gradient aggregation method is used to reduce the impact of slow gradients. Simultaneously, A2S adopts ASP training for slow workers to eliminate stragglers. Hence, A2S not only improves the “gradient staleness” and “stragglers” problems, but also obtains convergence stability and synchronous gain through synchronous and asynchronous parallel, respectively. Specially, we theoretically proved the convergence of A2S by deriving the bound. Moreover, experiment results show that A2S improves accuracy by up to 2.64\% and accelerates training by up to 41\% more than the state-of-the-art synchronization methods BSP, ASP, stale synchronous parallel (SSP), dynamic SSP, and Sync-switch.},

Subsequently, the fuzzy logic system and dynamic surface control technology are embedded in the backstepping design process, and the purpose of the dynamic surface control technique is to settle the problem of computational explosion when processing the backstepping design. The fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the unknown functions that appear in the system. Finally, a new controller is designed in combination with an updated law which ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop is bounded.

  abstract     = {On account of the rapid progress of zeroing neural network (ZNN) and the extensive use of fuzzy logic system (FLS), this article proposes an intelligent fuzzy robustness ZNN (IFR-ZNN) model and applies it to solving the time-variant Stein matrix equation (TVSME) problem. Be different from ZNN models before, the IFR-ZNN model uses a fuzzy parameter as the design parameter and adopts a first proposed improved nonlinear piecewise activation function. Particularly, the FLS that generates the fuzzy parameter utilizes an improved membership function of nonuniform distribution which can improve the adaptability and robustness of the IFR-ZNN model. Based on the above two optimizations, the proposed IFR-ZNN model possesses three significant advantages: (1) fixed-time convergence independent of initial states; (2) superior robustness to tolerate two kinds of noises simultaneously; and (3) better adaptiveness based on computational error. Besides, the upper bounds of fixed-time convergence of the IFR-ZNN model under noisy or non-noisy situations are calculated theoretically, and the stability as well as the excellent adaptability are analyzed in detail. Finally, simulation comparison results manifest the availability and meliority of the proposed IFR-ZNN model in solving the TVSME problem.},

  abstract     = {Pythagorean fuzzy sets are an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and are more efficient from an application perspective. Though the Pythagorean fuzzy sets are more informative, not much work on similarity measures is available in the literature. Furthermore, existing similarity measures are not efficient. Also, the containment property in Pythagorean fuzzy units is not correctly defined or ineffective. As a result, the existing similarity measures do not reflect appropriate information between the Pythagorean fuzzy sets. The scalar function of the Yager is mainly used for verifying the validity of similarity measures. Most of the existing similarity measures do not conform to the Yager scalar function. Hence, the existing similarity measures exhibit some discrepancies. Furthermore, the existing similarity measures are inconsistent in determining the similarity in intuitionsitic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. In some real-world modeling issues, past, present, and cross-time information are essential. However, such information is missing in the existing similarity measures. Therefore, in this paper, two new measures of similarity are being developed based on the deviation of the parameters: membership degree, nonmembership degree, strength of commitment, direction of commitment, and cross-time evaluation factors. Under this construction, the proposed similarity measures effectively measure the similarity between the Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Furthermore, the newly defined containment property is also reflected in the proposed similarity measures, which were a limitation in most cases. Moreover, Yager&#39;s scalar function is also reflected by the proposed similarity measures. The complement of given information is also essential in some real-world problems. However, such information is incomplete in the theory of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Hence, the complement of the Pythagorean fuzzy set is being redefined, and a few related results on similarity measures are proposed. Finally, the proposed similarity measures are tested for applicability to medical diagnosis and clustering problems through some hypothetical case studies.},

Specifically, the server broadcasts the quantized global model parameter to the workers; the workers update local model parameters using their own data sets and upload the quantized version to the server; then the server updates the global model parameter by aggregating all the quantized local model parameters and its previous global model parameter. This algorithm can be interpreted as a quantized variant of the federated averaging algorithm.

Adopting an outdated model is potentially risky and may result in unintentional losses. In this paper, we propose a novel ybrid daptive oosting approach (HA-Boost) for transfer learning. HA-Boost is characterized by the domain similarity-based and class imbalance-based adaptation mechanisms, which simultaneously address two critical limitations of the classical TrAdaBoost algorithm. We validated HA-Boost in predicting hospital-acquired acute kidney injury using real-world longitudinal EHRs data. The experiment results demonstrate that HA-Boost stably outperforms the competing baselines in terms of both Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic and Area Under Precision-Recall Curve across a 7-year time span. This study has confirmed the effectiveness of transfer learning as a superior model updating approach in a dynamic environment.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most effective feature learning methods, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been widely used in many scientific fields, such as computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. However, NMF is an unsupervised method that cannot fully utilize the label information of data. Thus, its performance is limited in some recognition and classification problems. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Semisupervised Discriminative NMF (SDNMF) method. First, we design a Soft-Labeled NMF (SLNMF) model by introducing a soft-label matrix-based regression term into the original NMF, so that the relationship between the soft-label matrix and low-dimensional features can be constructed to improve the discriminative ability of low-dimensional features. Second, to effectively estimate the soft-label matrix, a Label Propagation (LP) model is adopted to fully explore the spatial distribution relationship between the labeled and unlabeled samples. Third, an Adaptive Graph Learning (AGL) model is proposed to exploit the geometric relationship of samples well, which could enhance the performance of LP. Finally, the above three models (i.e., SLNMF, LP, and AGL) are integrated into a unified framework for effective feature learning, which can not only effectively explore the structural relationship matrix between data, but also predict the labels for unknown samples. Moreover, an iterative optimization algorithm is presented to solve our objective function. The convergence and computational complexity analysis of the proposed SDNMF method are also provided. Extensive experiments are conducted on several standard data sets. Compared with related methods, the experimental results verify that the proposed SDNMF method achieves better performance.},

  abstract     = {Usage-based insurance (UBI) provides reasonable vehicle insurance premiums based on vehicle usage and driving behavior. In general, there are three major issues in realizing intelligent UBI systems. First, UBI evaluation mechanisms are not auditable to drivers. Insurers may thus deliberately adjust the UBI premiums. Second, the process of collecting driving data by insurers may lead to serious privacy breaches. Third, forging safer driving data for reducing insurance premiums may cause economic losses for insurers. To address these challenges, in this study, we propose CCUBI, a cross-chain-based premium competition scheme with privacy preservation for intelligent UBI systems. We introduce tamper-resistant blockchain and smart contracts to construct credible insurance mechanisms. The cross-chain technology connects these blockchains in the entire network to form an open premium competition scheme. Vehicle owners can assess designated insurers by sharing historical data with them to get a suitable CCUBI plan. In addition, we propose a data aggregation method used for CCUBI analysis with privacy preservation. Vehicle owners only publish proofs of the driving data. Proofs can still maintain privacy and computability in cross-chain flows. Finally, we adopt roadside units to detect forged driving data. We conduct a detailed security analysis. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of CCUBI.},

This paper proposes a new method for rapid localization of EF based on the automatic detection of HFOs by waveform feature templates (WFTs). First, the initial screening of HFOs based on Hilbert transform and subsequent rescreening with short-time energy and short-time Fourier transform is performed, and the two screening results are used as the template data set of HFOs. Then, a coarse-grained and fine-grained screening method for detecting HFOs using autocorrelation coefficients and interrelation coefficients as WFT detectors, respectively. Compared with the Hilbert transform detector and other HFOs detector methods proposed at abroad in recent years, the experimental simulations showed that the automatic detector based on WFT could detect HFOs more rapidly, accurately, and efficiently. Our proposed WFT detector has the advantages of high specificity, high sensitivity, and high accuracy in locating EF and has a high clinical utility.},

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is an eye disease that leads to irreversible vision loss. Accurate Optic Disc (OD) and Optic Cup (OC) segmentation can effectively facilitate ophthalmologist in glaucoma diagnosis. Recently, a series of deep learning approaches attain promising performance in OD and OC segmentation but still face the challenge to precisely segment OC boundary with enhanced computational efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel network named Robust Multiscale Feature Extraction with Depthwise Separable Convolution (RMSDSC-Net), which can better solve the challenging tradeoff between segmentation performance and network cost. The proposed RMSDSC-Net is mainly composed of Multiscale Input (MSI), Depthwise Separable Convolution Unit (DSCU), Dilated Convolution Block (DCB), and External Residual Connection (ERC). First, the introduction of MSI can reduce the information loss due to the pooling layers used in the network for capturing rich feature representations. Next, to enhance segmentation performance and computational efficiency, this paper designs DSCU and DCB modules to avoid spatial information loss from minor details of the image and preserve more high-level semantic features. Finally, this paper develops ERC established between the encoding layers and decoding layers to minimize the feature degradation problem. Hence, a high segmentation performance can be achieved using a shallow network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed network, extensive experiments have been enforced on two publicly available databases, DRISHTI-GS and REFUGE. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with the Dice Coefficient of (0.978, 0.919) and (0.965, 0.910) for OD and OC segmentation on DRISHTI-GS and REFUGE databases, respectively. As a result, the proposed approach has a strong potential in analyzing fundus images for glaucoma diagnosis.},

Much work so far has focused on directly extracted deep visual features via Convolutional Neural Networks, which require significant computational resources and training time. The high requirements on hardware resources severely limit the application of food recognition in mobile devices and the sustainable extension on the server side. Therefore, how to design an efficient and high-performance lightweight neural network for food recognition is the key to solve the problem. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Transformer-Based Deep Neural Network for food image recognition, which can achieve effective recognition of food images with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Through Transformer Grouping and Token Shuffling, we construct an efficient food image recognition network that effectively combines the advantages of Transformer to extract global features and MobileNet to extract local features. The proposed network architecture effectively copes with the particularly scattered distribution of salient features in food images, and improves the recognition rate. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular food data sets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in applying lightweight neural networks to food image recognition.},

It has been widely used in takeout, data labeling, organizing activities, security and artificial intelligence. Currently, many manufacturers wish to explore SC in maintenance business, as SC can reduce maintenance time, reduce labor costs, and improve customer satisfaction. In maintenance business scenarios, there are two kinds of cooperated participators. One is freedom workers who are sensitive to distance, and the other is employed by manufacturers who are insensitive to distance. Therefore, some methods of SC with one type worker are challenging to apply to maintenance business scenarios directly. To match this scenario, we model the maintenance scenario and prove that this scenario is an NP-hard problem; then, both greedy and Nash equilibrium methods are proposed to complete the tasks for making a high total reward. The greedy algorithm (GA) first assigns the nearest available workers to each task, and the employee will try to join the task to help GM to complete more tasks, on the condition that the task cannot be completed and reaches a particular proportion. The Nash equilibrium algorithm (NA) is used to find a Nash equilibrium for all the workers and employees. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the synthetic data set of gMission in small and large data sets. The finished task number of NA is about 5\% more than that of GA, and the reward of NA is about 10\% more than that of GA.},

Early detection and prior care may help patients improve their quality of life, although this neurodegenerative disease has no known cure. In this study, we propose a FResnet18 model to classify MRI images of PD and Health Control (HC) by fusing image texture features with deep features. First, Local Binary Pattern and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix are used to extract the handcrafted features. Second, the modified ResNet18 network is used to extract deep features. Finally, the fused features are classified by Support Vector Machine. The classification accuracy rate for MRI images reaches 98.66\%, and the findings demonstrate that the model can successfully differentiate between PD and HC. The suggested FResnet18 provides greater performance compared with existing approaches, and it is shown through extensive experimental findings on the Parkinson&#39;s Disease Progression Markers Initiative data set that feature fusion may improve classification performance.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread development of intelligent systems, a considerable number of mobile devices are connected together, and continuously generate huge amounts of data. Although cloud storage provides perfect solution for effectively storing these massive data, how to ensure the integrity of the outsourced data becomes challenging. For this reason, the primitive of verifiable data streaming (VDS) protocol was introduced, and enables a data owner to continuously outsource streaming data to an untrusted cloud server, while capturing the integrity of the outsourced data. That is, when a data user retrieves some data item via its index from the server, he/she can publicly verify its integrity with the proof generated and returned by the server. Supporting data update is one of the major features of VDS, and allows the data owner to replace an old data item with a new one. Although many VDS protocols have been proposed to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the original VDS protocol, they all ignore the issue of preserving those updated data items. In fact, in various application scenarios of VDS, preserving and storing previously updated data items is actually necessary. For example, in the setting of DNA sequencing, there might be multiple versions of DNA fragments at the same location due to the genetic mutation. Obviously, for more precise treatment, all these DNA fragments need to be preserved. To this end, in this paper, we propose a VDS protocol that features of enabling the query of the update history of each data item. Specifically, we first put forward a new chameleon authentication tree with update history (UCAT), which consists of two CATs (the basic tree and the update history tree). In more detail, the basic tree is used to store the data item appended to the corresponding location for the first time, and the update history tree is utilized to preserve each updated version of the corresponding data item. Furthermore, based on UCAT, we propose a VDS protocol supporting update history queries, which allows a data user to retrieve any version of the data item. The theoretical analysis and performance evaluation indicate that our protocol outperforms previous ones in the field of functionality, and its computation/communication costs are acceptable. We also prove its security in the standard model.},

  abstract     = {Because of the overgrowth of data, especially in text format, the value and importance of multi-label text classification have increased. Aside from this, preprocessing and particularly intelligent feature selection (FS) are the most important step in classification. Each FS finds the best features based on its approach, but we try to use a multi-strategy approach to find more useful features. Evaluating and comparing features’ importance and relevance makes using multiple strategy and methods more suitable than conventional approaches because each feature is measured based on several perspectives. Nevertheless, the ensemble FS merges the final performance results of various methods to take advantage of different methods’ strengths and better classify. In this article, we have proposed an ensemble FS method for multi-label text data (MLTD) for the first time using the order statistics (EMFS) approach. We have utilized four multi-label FS (MLFS) algorithms with various particular performances to achieve a good result. In this method, as one of the most important statistics methods, Order Statistics was used to aggregate the ranks of different algorithms, which is robust against noise, redundant and inessential features. In the end, the performance of EMFS, executing six MLTDs, was evaluated according to six performance criteria (ranking-based and classification-based). Surprisingly, the proposed method was more accurate than others among all used MLTDs. The proposed method has improved by 1.5\% compared to other methods. This value is based on the results obtained based on six evaluation criteria and all tested data sets.},

The multi-robot reinforcement learning algorithm guided by the potential energy models is presented to perform the hunting, where reinforcement learning principles are combined with the model control. Secondly, based on the potential energy models, the target-tracking hunting strategy and the target-circumnavigation hunting strategy are established. In the former, the consensus tracking of multi-robot systems is achieved by designing the velocity potential energy function. And in the latter, virtual circumnavigation points are added to construct the potential energy function, which realizes the desired circumnavigation.

  abstract     = {The high mortality rate and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) make early detection of the disease essential. Due to its simplicity and low cost, the phonocardiogram (PCG) system is widely used in healthcare applications for the recognition of CVD in multiclass problems. On the basis of the PCG signal, this paper proposes a hybrid method for classifying cardiac sounds with deep extracted features through two-step learning. For fine-grained features in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), sampling and prior layers are employed. A PCG signal is divided into equal parts with overlap using the windowing process. -spectrograms extract frequency-domain information from signals to figure out their power spectrum. Furthermore, the deep GCN tries to determine the association between CVD and spectrogram images to recognize CVD signals better. Combining retrieved features with convolutional neural network (CNN) characteristics reveals an image&#39;s intrinsic associations. To generate relational feature representations, correlations between clusters and GCN are visualized using a graph structure. CNN&#39;s discriminative ability has been enhanced by incorporating GCN attributes. Using Michigan Heart Sound and Murmur Database and PhysioNet/CinC 2016 Challenge results, we are 99.44\% and 96.16\% accurate, respectively. Through a combination of GCN architecture, CNN design, and deep features, the hybrid model significantly improves CVD classification accuracy. Measuring metrics demonstrate that the proposed approach detects CVD more effectively than previous approaches.},

The device application sandbox deployment model is one of the four essential Zero Trust architecture device deployment models. The isolation of the application sandbox directly affects the security of trusted applications. Given the security risks, such as sandbox escape in the sandbox application, we propose a hybrid isolation model based on access behavior and give the formal definition and security characteristics of the model. The model dynamically determines the security identity of the subject according to the access behavior and controls the access operation of the application sandbox. Therefore, the sandbox meets the characteristics of autonomous security, domain isolation, and integrity, ensuring that the system is always in an isolated safe state and easy to use. Finally, we implement the security model based on the container and Linux security module, and test the network and disk performance of this model. What is more, we make security comparison experiments based on the same container escape vulnerability. The experimental results show that the security model proposed in this paper effectively enhances the security of the device application sandboxing deployment model in Zero Trust architecture, and has a better performance compared with Container-SELinux.},

This paper proposes a differential privacy-preserving deep learning caching framework (DP-DLCF) for heterogeneous communication networks. First, the multivariate randomized response mechanism is used to perturb the mobile client&#39;s sensitive information while introducing the least square method to balance the data privacy and utility, and realize the adaptive allocation of the privacy budget. Then use selective integrated learning methods to further improve the local cache accuracy of the neural network training model. Therefore, the framework not only improves the prediction accuracy of the cache network but also solves the problem of privacy leakage in data sharing. Finally, four simulation examples verify the DP-DLCF framework&#39;s effectiveness.},

This form of attack has come to be a severe cyber-security difficulty and has triggered incredible monetary losses to the victims. Many antismishing solutions for mobile devices have been proposed till date but still, there is a lack of a full-fledged solution. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient approach that analyzes text content and uniform resource locator (URL) presented in the SMS. We have integrated the URL phishing classifier with the text classifier to improve accuracy as some of the SMS contain the URL with no text or much less text. To find out rare words in a report, depending upon the frequency of term (TF) and the reciprocal of document frequency TF-inverse document frequency (IDF), a weighting framework TF-IDF is used. We have used two data sets for both text as well as for URL phishing classifier and used a synthetic minority oversampling technique to balance the training data. The voting classifier simply merges the findings of each classifier passed into it and predicts the output on the basis of voting. In proposed approach integrating KNN, RF, and ETC can detect smishing messages with a 99.03\% accuracy and 98.94\% precision rate which is relatively efficient compared with existing ones like SmiDCA model which has the given accuracy of 96.40\% using Random Forest classifier in BFSA, Feature-Based it has an accuracy of 98.74\% and 94.20\% true positive rate and Smishing Detector it shows an overall accuracy of 96.29\%.},

The prevailing token shuffling policies rely too heavily on blacklists in the token shuffling process, which is contrary to the idea of decentralization. Therefore, weakening or even eliminating the usage of blacklisting mechanisms in TSSs, which is an urgent issue to be addressed. In this paper, we adopt the idea of machine learning and propose a general framework for TSSs, which replaces the natural role under incomplete information with machine learning, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating the blacklist mechanism in TSSs. Then, the token shuffling process is constructed as an extended game under incomplete information on the basis of different token shuffling policies, and this incomplete information game is analyzed on the basis of poison policy, haircut policy, and suicide policy respectively. Finally, the sequential equilibrium under different games is investigated through simulations. The simulation results show that in the incomplete information game based on the poison policy, the participation of two players in the TSS is a sequential equilibrium, while in the incomplete information game based on the haircut policy, the players do not participate in the TSS is an sequential equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) driven blockchain is currently one of the most promising technology revolutions with enormous potential across a wide range of applications. Distributed ledger is essentially a distributed and encrypted database that can address several concerns pertaining to Internet security and trust with transparency. In fact, the scope of blockchain applications is broadening with each passing day. The exclusive features of safe and transparent data exchange provided by blockchain technology provide compelling arguments for its implementation in a variety of application scenarios. In this paper, we present the comprehensive view of blockchain and its related concepts. Though, there exists intensive research on these domains; however, these fields are still dealing with several security issues, data reliability and storage and scalability. Blockchain has emerged as a critical technology that can address these issues through its features like decentralization, transparency, immutability and auditability. Building trust in distributed systems without the need for authority is a technological advancement that can be well leveraged by domain, like, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and social media. Technologies like IoT and Cloud computing can be perceived as the trivial ones to get benefitted from the blockchain. However, the integration of social media and blockchain can revolutionize the domains, like, content creating and sharing, fake news scourge, trademarking and rights management. In this paper, we illustrate the integration of blockchain with IoT, cloud and social media and the related issues and challenges. Moreover, we also show some of the major research works done in each domain.},

  abstract     = {Recent researchers have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial exemplars, making them unsuitable for security-critical applications. Transferability of adversarial examples is crucial for attacking black-box models, which facilitates adversarial attacks in more practical scenarios. We propose a novel adversarial attack with high transferability. Unlike existing attacks that directly modify the input pixels, our attack is executed in the feature space. More specifically, we corrupt the abstract features by maximizing the feature distance between the adversarial example and clean images with a perceptual similarity network, inducing model misclassification. In addition, we apply a spectral transformation to the input, thus narrowing the search space in the frequency domain to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples. The disruption of crucial features in a specific frequency component achieves greater transferability. Extensive evaluations illustrate that our approach is easily compatible with many existing frameworks for transfer attacks and can significantly improve the baseline performance of black-box attacks. Moreover, we can obtain a higher fooling rate even if the model has a defense technique. We achieve a maximum black-box fooling rate of 61.70\% on the defense model. Our work indicates that existing pixel space defense techniques are difficult to guarantee the robustness of the feature space, and the feature space from a frequency perspective is promising for developing more robust models.},

CNN model is more accurate when trained on large amounts of data from multiple sources, and the huge training cost makes the model much more valuable. However, data from various sources is often privacy-sensitive. Therefore, the privacy of these data should be protected during CNN model training and inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure two-party computation (2PC) framework PPCNN for privacy-preserving CNN training and inference. Specifically, we use a new secret sharing technique introduced in ABY2.0 to securely compute various computational tasks involved in the CNN training and inference processes. This secret sharing technique can significantly reduce the communication overhead. Meanwhile, we assign these computationally intensive tasks to cloud servers to reduce the computational burden on local devices. We demonstrate the security of these protocols in the semihonest model. In addition, we use the MP-SPDZ library to simulate our PPCNN framework, and the experiments prove its high efficiency and accuracy.},

Therefore, this paper establishes a human-centered attention mechanism that dynamically highlights regions associated with action recognition according to target appearance to selectively recognize the human-object interaction action.

Using private set intersection (PSI) protocol, users can securely compute the intersection of their sets without disclosing their private input and other additional information. At the same time, there is also a strong practical demand for statistical analysis of intersection data. However, when multiple parties are involved, the efficiency of the multiparty PSI protocol decreases dramatically as the number of users increases. In this paper, we construct a novel server-aided multiparty PSI protocol, which can transform the complex multiparty computation problem into an efficient two-party computation problem. In addition, we design a series of server-aided party PSI statistical protocols to compute the statistics of the intersection elements, such as the sum, average, variance, range (maximum, minimum), and the cardinality of intersection (the size of intersection). In our protocol, the clients only need to upload their private data to the servers in blinded form and do not need to keep online during server computing. Experiments show that our protocol has high computation and communication efficiency and is suitable for lightweight clients.

To alleviate the limitation, we present a self-supervised domain adaptation fault diagnosis network (SDAFDN), which considers two temporal dependencies to improve the transferability of the learned representations. Specifically, we first design a down-sampling and interaction network that considers the temporal dependency among subsequences with low temporal resolution in feature space.

Finally, we introduced a self-supervised learning module, which considers the temporal dependency between the past and future temporal segments via classification tasks.

The recent proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which incorporate the high-order neighbors of the target occasional group, can alleviate the above problem in some extent.

  abstract     = {The existing trajectory prediction is mainly for specific road sections, which is poor to adapt to complex and changing traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, decentralized trajectory data is hard to be fully utilized in the data silo environment. To solve data silos in the intelligent vehicle industry, introducing federated learning methods in vehicular edge computing has attracted extensive attention. But traditional federated learning still has the potential to suffer from the mining of training data in the case of model privacy leakage. In this paper, a vehicle trajectory prediction method based on federated learning and homomorphic encryption has been presented, which adopts a three-layer architecture with a vehicle cluster, edge computing server, and cloud core network. Compared with traditional centralized deep learning methods, this approach enables joint modeling of multiple parties to improve the model&#39;s generalization performance. We used a proxy re-encryption algorithm to implement key distribution and also designed an encrypted federated network algorithm FAHEFL, which uses FAHE1 homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of the model in parameter transmission. Each local model includes a driving behavior recognition module and trajectory output module. The driving behavior recognition module uses a 1D convolutional neural network to recognize the driving behavior, then input recognition results and historical trajectories to the trajectory output module, which uses LSTM neural network to output predicted trajectories. The experiment results show that the model built with FAHEFL has no more 1\% error in the driving behavior recognition module than concentrated learning, while the minimum mean square error of the trajectory prediction module increased by only 2.5\%. This article also discusses the performance between FAHEFL and well-known cryptographic federation network algorithms.},

As a key component of IIS, the smart port is essential to be offered low-complexity and high-reliability communication service, especially for driverless engineering vehicles. However, it is combined and nonconvex to find the optimal association between vehicles and the road side units (RSUs). Besides, due to the mobility of vehicles and the severe path loss of mmWave links, beam switching and reassociation between vehicles and RSUs are required frequently, which brings a great challenge to the communication for the IIS. A low complexity closed-loop strategy based on distributed cooperation for mmWave communication in IIS is proposed in this study, in which user association and beam tracking with the assistance of beam pools is proposed. Many-to-many user association is established based on distributed multiagent reinforcement learning, where the vehicle can independently select the set of serving RSUs based on the local observation without information exchange with others, reducing the signaling overhead and computational complexity while improving system throughput. Furthermore, multipoint-cooperation soft switching of beams based on beam tracking improves the reliability of mmWave communication with the smaller training cost. Extensive analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly reduces the complexity of the mmWave communication while improving the throughput and stability in IIS.},

However, the previous works on the study of PLS ignored the significance of mobility and limited packet length constraint required by uRLLC for satisfying low latency, in this paper, we investigate the impact of mobility on the secrecy performance of uRLLC by using the Random WayPoint (RWP) model and the Random Direction (RD) model. Specifically, with the tools of stochastic geometry, to observe the impact of key system parameters on the secrecy performance, we establish the closed-form expression of connection outage probability, secrecy outage probability, and decoding error probability-based secrecy transmission capacity (DEP-STC). Furthermore, we derive the condition that achieves a positive DEP-STC under two moving models, which can offer the network designer some greatly significant insights into achieving perfect secrecy. Simulations validate our derived theoretical results, and indicate that RWP moving receiver can obtain a higher security level than RD moving one, while RWP eavesdropper can lead to a lower security.},

  abstract     = {As a distributed ledger technology, blockchain has excellent openness and transparency, which can provide data security management services for distributed intelligent systems and establish effective security guarantee mechanisms. However, precisely due to the open nature of blockchain, malicious users can trace the real transaction transfer path with high probability and even obtain the real identity of users by collecting transaction information on the blockchain and performing data analysis. Besides, existing intelligent systems lack effective encryption or desensitization measures, and attackers are able to access data in intelligent systems through identity forgery and other means, posing a huge potential risk to user privacy. To alleviate the above security issues, this paper proposes an efficient blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme with attribute and homomorphic encryption, which can not only achieve user-level fine-grained secure access control but also supports the transmission and verification of blockchain data in the form of ciphertext. The access control method based on attribute-based encryption and the data transmission method based on homomorphic encryption are proposed, and the blockchain-based access whitelist mechanism is designed to reduce the resource loss due to repeated authentication. Simulation calculations and blockchain performance experiments show that this scheme can develop flexible access policies according to the attributes of users, has good performance in computational efficiency, and the blockchain performance test results are stable with errors in milliseconds for all operations. It has certain application potential in the field of distributed intelligent systems and blockchain.},

With the trend toward sharing pretrained models, the risk of stealing training data sets through member inference attacks and model inversion attacks is further heightened. To tackle the privacy-preserving problems in deep learning tasks, we propose an improved Differential Privacy Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm, using Simulated Annealing algorithm and Laplace Smooth denoising mechanism to optimize the allocation method of privacy loss, replacing the constant clipping method with adaptive gradient clipping method to improve model accuracy. we also analyze privacy cost under random shuffle data batch processing method in detail within the framework of Subsampled Rényi Differential Privacy. Compared with the existing privacy protection training methods with fixed parameters and dynamic privacy parameters in classification tasks, our implementation and experiments show that we can use less privacy budget train deep neural networks with the nonconvex objective function, obtain a higher model evaluation, and have almost zero additional cost in terms of model complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.},

  abstract     = {Inkjet printing technology can make tiles with very rich and realistic patterns, so it is widely adopted in the ceramic industry. However, the frequent nozzle blockage and inconsistent inkjet volume by inkjet printing devices, usually leads to defects such as stayguy and color blocks in the tile surface. Especially, the stayguy in complex pattern is difficult to identify by naked eyes due to it is easily covered by complex patterns and becomes invisible, this brings great challenge to tile quality inspection. Nowadays, the machine learning is employed to address the issues. The existing machine learning methods based on hand-crafted features are capable of stayguy detection of the tiles with a simple pattern, but not applicable for complex patterns due to the interference of pattern in feature extraction. The emerging deep-learning-based methods have the potential to be applied for stayguy detection with complex patterns, but cannot achieve real-time detection due to high complexity. In this paper, a lightweight hand-crafted feature enhanced convolutional neural network (named HFENet) is proposed for rapid defect detection of tile surface. First, we perform data enhancement on the original image by global histogram equalization and image addition. Second, for the special shape of stayguy which is usually vertical, we embed the extended vertical edge detection operator (Prewitt) as convolution kernel into HFENet to extract the hand-crafted vertical edge features of the test image and eliminate the interference of complex pattern in the feature extraction. Third, the 5 × 1 asymmetric convolution kernel with a dilation rate of 2 is used to improve the utilization of convolution kernel and reduce the complexity of the model. Fourth, to reach the real-time requirements, a memory access cost-aware design is proposed, which can orchestrate the number of shallow convolution layers and deep convolution layers in feature extraction. The experiments were performed on the ceramic tile image data set captured by high-resolution industrial cameras in ceramic tile production line. Experimental results show that the HFENet outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks (i.e., UNet, FCN-8s, SegNet, DeepLabV3+, etc.) and lightweight networks (i.e., ShuffleNet, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet).

However, in the process of acquiring facial feature information, face information is easily affected by factors, such as object occlusion, lighting changes, and similar backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a multifeature fusion algorithm based on integral histograms and a real-time update tracking particle filtering (PF) module. First, edge features and colour features are extracted, weighting methods are used to weight the colour histogram and edge features to describe facial features, and fusion of colour features and edge features is made adaptive by using fusion coefficients to improve face tracking reliability. Then, the integral histogram is integrated into the PF algorithm to simplify the calculation steps of complex particles and improve operational efficiency. Finally, the tracking window size is adjusted in real-time according to the change in the average distance from the particle centre to the edge of the current model and the initial model to reduce the drift problem and achieve stable tracking with significant changes in the target dimension. The results show that the algorithm improves video tracking accuracy, simplifies particle operation complexity, improves the speed, and has good anti-interference ability and robustness compared with extracting a single feature.},

  abstract     = {Medical imaging systems installed in different hospitals and labs generate images in bulk, which could support medics to analyze infections or injuries. Manual inspection becomes difficult when there exist more images, therefore, intelligent systems are usually required for real-time diagnosis. Melanoma is one of the most common and severe forms of skin cancer that begins from the cells beneath the skin. Through dermoscopic images, it is possible to diagnose the infection at the early stages. In this regard, different approaches have been exploited for improved results. In this study, we propose a two-stream deep neural network information fusion framework for multiclass skin cancer classification. The proposed technique follows two streams: initially, a fusion-based contrast enhancement technique is proposed, which feeds enhanced images to the pretrained DenseNet201 architecture. The extracted features are later optimized using a skewness-controlled moth–flame optimization algorithm. In the second stream, deep features from the fine-tuned MobileNetV2 pretrained network are extracted and down-sampled using the proposed feature selection framework. Finally, most discriminant features from both networks are fused using a new parallel multimax coefficient correlation method. A multiclass extreme learning machine classifier is used to classify lesion images. The testing process is initiated on three imbalanced skin data sets—HAM10000, ISBI2018, and ISIC2019. The simulations are performed without performing any data augmentation step in achieving an accuracy of 96.5\%, 98\%, and 89\%, respectively. A fair comparison with the existing techniques reveals the improved performance of our proposed algorithm.},

Most of these generation algorithms create global perturbations that would affect the visual quality of adversarial examples. To mitigate such drawbacks, some attacks attempt to generate local perturbations. However, existing local adversarial attacks are time-consuming and the generated adversarial examples are still distinguishable from clean images. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient local adversarial attack (ELAA) using model interpreters to generate severe local perturbations and improve the imperceptibly of the generated adversarial examples. Specifically, we take advantage of model interpretation methods to search the discriminative regions of clean images. Then, we generate local adversarial examples by adding masks to original clean images. We also propose a new optimization method to reduce the redundancy of local perturbations. Through extensive experiments, we show our ELAA can maintain a high attack ability while preserving the visual quality of clean images. Experimental results also demonstrate our local attack outperforms state-of-the-art local attack methods under various system settings.},

In this paper, we focus on the validity of semi-selfish mining attacks considering the probability of being detected. More specifically, we discuss mining strategies through backward deduction. That is to say that the attacking states derived from the observable states, which with normal forking rate, just as without semi-selfish mining attacks, toward the view of the honest miners. Rewards distribution is further investigated concerning these strategies. The simulation results indicate that it does not necessarily bring rewards advantage over large pools. Instead, the small pools have an advantage over the additional rewards. However, the probability for small pools to successfully implement these strategies is pretty low. That is, it is impossible for the pools, although profitable for them, to sponsor semi-selfish mining attacks without being detected.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has been consolidated as a support for the vast majority of current and emerging technologies. However, there are some barriers that prevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the major cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms that ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers. However, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud provider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined to ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are bound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and prevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud environments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically translating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured across multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent knowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs defined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral metrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system). Secondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can be measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation based on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by leading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the complementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and transparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed by the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study.},

Several optimization algorithms have been used for determining the optimal solutions that can reduce the production cost and/or enhance the production efficiency with in limited time-periods. However, existing optimization approaches have failed to solve the issues in the complex manufacturing process. To overcome this issue, a novel technique called directed acyclic graph theory based multiobjective oppositional learnt artificial ant colony resource optimization (DAGT-MOLAACRO) technique has been introduced in this study for solving the complex manufacturing process in the industry. Initially, IoT devices are used in the industrial sector for sensing and collecting data. Then the collected data is sent to the cyberspace of the CPS system with the least latency. Then, the CPS system collects the data generated from the industrial IoT devices that is stored in cyberspace with lesser memory consumption. MOLAACRO is applied to find the optimal solution among the population that satisfies the resource constraints by constructing the directed acyclic graph. In this way, the DAGT-MOLAACRO technique reduces the time complexity with minimal latency and computation overhead. For verification purposes, our experimental work has been carried out using different performance metrics such as data latency, time complexity, and computation overhead with respect to the number of IoT devices and the amount of data collected. The results show that the DAGT-MOLAACRO technique has better performance with reductions in terms of time complexity by 10\%, latency by 17\%, and the computation overhead by 11\% against the existing works in literature.},

  abstract     = {Apart from high-level computer vision tasks, deep learning has also made significant progress in low-level tasks, including single image dehazing. A well-detailed image looks realistic and natural with its clear edges and balanced colour. To achieve a clearer and vivid view, we exploit the role of edges and colours as a significant part of our proposed work. A progressive two-stage image dehazing network is presented to overcome the challenges of current image dehazing algorithms. The proposed image dehazing framework is divided into two steps; in the first stage, the multiscale image features of the encoder and decoder structure can be extracted. The second stage consists of the Color Correction Model (CCM), which retrieves balanced colour close to the ground truth. The encode-decoder network consists of a dense residual attention unit (DRAU) that comprises channel attention with pixel attention mechanisms. We have seen that weighted information and the haze difference is inconsistent across pixels without DRAU at the various channel-specific features. DRAU deals with different features and pixels unequally, which offers more versatility in handling knowledge of various types of detailed information. Our proposed two-stage network exceeds state-of-the-art algorithms in both visual and quantitative aspects. The findings are tested with the best-published peak signal-to-noise ratio metrics of 33.55–33.44 dB and SSIM 0.9619–0.9714 on SOTS indoor and outdoor test data sets.},

A historical record book is established to manage the privacy budget according to historical query types, and a differential privacy protection algorithm based on noise reusing is used to generate and reusing noise. In the experiments, we tested the privacy budget loss, data utility and system performance based on the business data-set from chemical supply chain. The experimental results show that the blockchain system with multichain structure based on community clustering algorithm reduces the system data storage space and decreases request processing time effectively. The privacy budget loss of the proposed method is about 1/3 of that of the pure Gaussian mechanism method. After 100 queries, the total amount of noise is about 8\% less than that of pure Gaussian mechanism. Besides that, the noise reusing algorithm reduces the loss of the privacy budget and breaks through the query limitation caused by privacy budget wasting.},

  abstract     = {Security communication and information sharing among mobile devices are important application technologies of the intelligent information system (IIS). Because IIS is vulnerable to attacks, so the security of information sharing among mobile devices is seriously threatened. Thence, it is necessary to establish a secure channel for communication among mobile devices of IIS over an opening network. Group key agreement (GKA) can establish a secure channel among mobile devices of IIS by encryption technology. Due to the resource-constraints of mobile devices, such as weak computing power, small storage capacity, and limited communication range. To address these issues, an asymmetric GKA protocol among terminals of IIS for mobile edge computing (GKA–IIS–MEC) network is proposed in this paper. Adopted asymmetric GKA to achieve the group secure communication mechanisms that message sender unfettered in this protocol; the protocol also uses edge computing environment to migrate the computation and communication loads of mobile devices of IIS to edge nodes, thereby ensuring that mobile devices have lightweight computation and communication loads; and the members participating in the GKA can verify whether the group session keys they calculated are correctness. Under the hardness assumption of bilinear inverse Diffie–Hellman problem, the proposed protocol is proven that it can resist negative attacks. After evaluating the performance of the protocol, GKA–IIS–MEC has higher efficiency than the referred works in terms of time cost, communication consumption, and computation consumption.},

To deal with the challenge, this paper proposes graph embedding-based intelligent industrial decision for complex STP (GE-STP). The graph embedding (GE) scheme is employed to enhance feature extraction and neural computing structure is utilized to simulate uncertain biochemical transformation inside STP. The introduction of GE can not only improves the fineness of feature spaces, but also improves the representative ability of models towards complex industrial processes. On this basis, the GE-STP is evaluated on a real-world data set collected from a realistic sewage treatment plant equipped with a set of Internet of Things devices. And some typical neural network models that have been utilized for modeling complex STP, are selected as baseline methods. Three groups of experiments show that efficiency of the GE-STP exceeds baselines about 6\%–12\%, and that the GE-STP is not susceptible to parameter changing.},

To this extent, violence detection (VD) has received substantial attention from the research community due to its vast applications, such as ensuring security over public areas and industrial settings through smart machine intelligence. However, because of changing illumination, complex background and low resolution, the analysis of violence patterns remains challenging in the industrial video surveillance domain. In this paper, we propose a computationally intelligent VD approach to precisely detect violent scenes through deep analysis of surveillance video sequential patterns. First, the video stream acquired through the vision sensor is processed by a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation of important shots. Next, temporal optical flow features are extracted from the informative shots via a residential optical flow CNN. These are concatenated with appearance-invariant features extracted from a Darknet CNN model. Finally, a multilayer long short-term memory network is plugged to generate the final feature map for learning the violence patterns in a sequence of frames. In addition, we contribute to the existing surveillance VD data set by considering its indoor and outdoor scenarios separately for the proposed method&#39;s evaluation, achieving a 2\% increase in accuracy over surveillance fight data set. Experiments also show encouraging results over the state of the art on other challenging benchmark data sets.},

Although, recent approaches improved the utility of published output with generalized terms retrieved from several medical and general-purpose knowledge bases like SNOMED-CT and MASH. However, these models work on predefined sensitive terms using Wikipedia articles instead of authentic benchmarks. These Information Content-based methods are not capable to achieve the best balance between privacy and utility. The existing approaches guarantee syntactic privacy by sanitization but lack semantic privacy for textual clinical data. Therefore, it is imperative to design a confidentiality-aware framework to overcome these problems. Our proposed use preprocessed combinations of the terms instead of all combinations and perform automatic detection and sanitization of the sensitive and semantically correlated terms. The probabilistic sampling-based method guarantees the semantic privacy. We use high-level Petri nets to perform formal modeling of our proposed approach.

The accurate localization of IoT objects is indispensable for most IoT applications, especially healthcare monitoring. Utilizing GPS as the positioning system is not cost-efficient and does not apply to some environments (e.g., deep forests, oceans, inside the buildings, etc.). Hereupon, copious position estimation approaches are developed in the literature. Among range-free approaches, distance vector-Hop (DV-Hop) is the widely used algorithm due to its straightforward applicability and can estimate the position of unknown objects that are far-off the anchors. Due to its low accuracy, various techniques were proposed to increase the accuracy of basic DV-Hop. In the most recent approach, meta-heuristic algorithms were used, the results of which were promising. In the present paper, Tunicate Swarm Algorithm and Harris hawk optimization were initially hybridized. Afterthought, the resulting hybrid algorithm was enhanced by appending a new phase. Then, the proposed hybrid algorithm was intermingled with the DV-Hop algorithm. In the first set of experiments, the proposed hybrid algorithm was evaluated on 50 test functions using average, box plot, and p-value criteria. In the second part, the proposed localization algorithm&#39;s efficiency was investigated in twenty-eight different manners using node localization error, average localization error, and localization error variance metrics. The effectiveness of the contributions was evident from the experimental results.},

With more and more users using this method, the database becomes more extensive, and the functions are seriously challenged. Data outsourcing has advantages in terms of convenience and cost savings, so it has attracted much research effort. However, due to the biometric&#39;s immutability of the whole life, it is extremely sensitive, and disclosing it to a third party is undesirable. In this paper, we address the issue of securely outsourcing biometric database. We propose a novel boolean searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) to construct a secure interactive protocol when outsourcing. A new encrypted database construction method was proposed, using the more efficient boolean vectors. Based on this, We suggest three kinds of expressive SSE, supporting disjunctive query, boolean query, and lightweight settings. We prove the schemes&#39; correctness and security theoretically. Our constructions use simple cryptographic tools, such as symmetric cryptography and pseudo-random functions. They are straightforward to understand and easy to implement. The experiments show that all our schemes are practical and more efficient than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {For secure communication in a distributed cooperation, generally, the data are encrypted and decrypted using a symmetric key. The process of creating, distributing, storing, deploying, and finally revoking the cryptographic keys is called key management. On the basis of the structure, usability, and complexity of the cyber-physical systems, each one of the current key management practices is suitable for a specific range of applications. However, these schemes have some drawbacks in common, such as complicated key generation and distribution process, using key storage, attacks, and traffic load. This paper proposes a key management model for establishing secure communications in the distributed industrial intelligent systems. The model is attack resistant, has high usability in real-world applications, and transforms the current customary key management workflow to enhance security and reduce weaknesses. Its main features include reduced process, intelligent attack resistance, producing dynamic keys with no additional cost, and eliminating key storage and revocation calls.},

  abstract     = {As a mental disorder, depression has affected people&#39;s lives, works, and so on. Researchers have proposed various industrial intelligent systems in the pattern recognition field for audiovisual depression detection. This paper presents an end-to-end trainable intelligent system to generate high-level representations over the entire video clip. Specifically, a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network equipped with a module spatiotemporal feature aggregation module (STFAM) is trained from scratch on audio/visual emotion challenge (AVEC)2013 and AVEC2014 data, which can model the discriminative patterns closely related to depression. In the STFAM, channel and spatial attention mechanism and an aggregation method, namely 3D DEP-NetVLAD, are integrated to learn the compact characteristic based on the feature maps. Extensive experiments on the two databases (i.e., AVEC2013 and AVEC2014) are illustrated that the proposed intelligent system can efficiently model the underlying depression patterns and obtain better performances over the most video-based depression recognition approaches. Case studies are presented to describes the applicability of the proposed intelligent system for industrial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of Internet and the widespread application of distributed computing, people enjoy various conveniences while at the same time their privacy has also been threatened. Secure multiparty computation (MPC) can solve the problem of how data owners who do not trust each other jointly compute in distributed scenarios. Using MPC technique, people can not only realize data joint computing, but also ensure data privacy. In most data application scenarios, private data held by different parties can often be represented by sets. To complete the relevant statistical computations of the intersection of two private sets, we propose a suite of protocols based on MPC. These protocols can compute the statistical functions of the associated data of the intersection, including cardinality, sum, average, variance, range, and so forth, without revealing any additional information other than the result. To achieve these functions, we design a private membership test protocol with the result as the arithmetic sharing value, called the arithmetic shared private membership test (ASPMT) protocol. On the basis of the ASPMT protocol, the size and other statistics of the intersection can be computed securely and efficiently. All fundamental computations are constructed based on secret sharing and oblivious transfer techniques. Thanks to the use of precomputation technique, all protocols are highly efficient.},

Under the mode of continuous development of Internet of vehicles technology, vehicles will be connected with each other in the future, and the hackers will attack the energy system of the vehicle. However, health assessment of lithium-ion battery can timely grasp the running state and health of the power battery system, so as to realize active defense against hacker security attacks. This paper proposes a health assessment method for lithium-ion batteries using incremental capacity analysis and weighted Kalman filter algorithm. In view of the problem that ordinary Kalman filtering algorithm produces poor filtering results when the actual measurement noise error is large, this paper proposes a weighted Kalman filtering algorithm based on ordinary Kalman filtering. Incremental capacity analysis was performed on the charge and discharge data of lithium-ion batteries, and health characteristics were extracted to construct a Gaussian nonlinear feature association mapping model for the health characteristics of lithium-ion batteries. Combined with the battery SOH double-exponential decay model, the weighted Kalman filter algorithm was used to evaluate the health of lithium-ion batteries. Four lithium-ion battery data sets provided by NASA were used to simulate and verify the health assessment method proposed in this paper. The verification results show that the health assessment method based on weighted Kalman filter proposed in this paper has better assessment accuracy than the common Kalman filter method with an average percentage error of 0.61\%. The average percentage error of the assessment results for different types of batteries was less than 0.9\%. The health assessment method has high accuracy and is suitable for different types of batteries.},

Second, we utilized the Dual regularization non-negative matrix tri-factorization (DNMTF) algorithm to obtain the words clustering indicator matrix, which was used to get the feature space by dimensionality reduction methods. Thirdly, words with close relationship were selected out from the feature space and added into the short-text to solve the sparsity issue.

While most of the existing research only depend on the top-level event prediction, they ignore the influence of other bottom levels or other relationship modeling manners. In this paper, we focus on the problem of SEP via multilevel script learning where the goal of is to explore a multistage, multiprediction and multilevel information fusion model for SEP. This is challenging in (1) simultaneously modeling of the multilevel event relationship semantic information and (2) effectively designing multilevel information fusion strategies. In this paper, we propose a new script event prediction model based on nhanced ultilevel script learning and ual usion strategies, named EMDF-Net. Specifically, EMDF-Net designs the multilevel () script learning to model both temporal and casual information as well as the rich structural relevance via neural stacking of self-attention mechanism and graph neural networks. Then it proposes dual fusion strategies to fully integrate different-level information by nonlinear feature composition and weighted score fusion. Finally, a deep supervision strategy is utilized to end-to-end train the whole model and provide a good initialization for information fusion. Experimental results on the popular NYT corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EMDF-Net.},

  abstract     = {There is an increasing interest in enhancing the quality of low-resolution (LR) facial images for various social life applications. Existing methods often use domain-specific prior knowledge, which is effective in improving the face super-resolution model&#39;s performance. However, it is challenging to obtain rich and accurate prior information from LR inputs in real-world scenarios, which can limit the robustness and generalization ability of the developed face super-resolution model. In this paper, a multisource reference-based face super-resolution Network, namely MSRNet, is proposed. Without considering the prior knowledge of faces, the network can reconstruct a LR face image with a magnitude factor of 8 under the guidance of multiple reference face images of different identities. By constructing an “appearance-alike” reference data set , the designed MSRNet aims to fully exploit the local and spatially similar high frequency information between the distinct references and the current face. More specifically, to effectively combine the information from multiple references, a cross-scale and cross-space feature fusion mechanism is introduced for external and internal references, and then the enhanced local semantics are finally incorporated into the high-resolution face reconstruction. The robustness of face image super-resolution is increased compared to current correlation approaches, since it not only eliminates the need for face prior knowledge but also avoids performing alignment operations on reference faces with multiple expressions and different poses. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to produce results for face super-resolution that are satisfying and dependable and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual perceptual quality and quantity evaluation.},

Due to the unconstrained imaging conditions, the scale variation and background occlusion in the images make it still challenging to achieve counting accurately. To tackle the two key challenges, we design a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Network (HFANet) for accurate crowd counting in complex scenarios. The proposed method can extract multiple features at different levels and then aggregate them hierarchically to generate a high-quality density map. To highlight the crowd regions effectively from the cluttered background, we propose the Semantic Attention module to preserve the useful feature information through the attention mechanism for the low-level features extracted by VGG-16. Meanwhile, we employ convolutional kernels of different sizes to extract multi-scale features and global average pooling operations to preserve contextual information. Furthermore, we design the Feature Aggregation module to integrate the extracted multiple features through a progressive approach, which aims to take full advantage of the complementary properties between low-level and high-level features for efficient features aggregation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed HFANet on four challenging datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach has better performance compared with most state-of-the-art approaches.},

To date, a plethora of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been proposed to help users interpret model decisions. However, given its data-driven nature, the explanation itself is potentially susceptible to a high risk of exposing privacy. In this paper, we first show that the existing XAI is vulnerable to model extraction attacks and then present an XAI-aware dual-task model extraction attack (DTMEA). DTMEA can attack a target model with explanation services, that is, it can extract both the classification and explanation tasks of the target model. More specifically, the substitution model extracted by DTMEA is a multitask learning architecture, consisting of a sharing layer and two task-specific layers for classification and explanation. To reveal which explanation technologies are more vulnerable to expose privacy information, we conduct an empirical evaluation of four major explanation types in the benchmark data set. Experimental results show that the attack accuracy of DTMEA outperforms the predicted-only method with up to 1.25\%, 1.53\%, 9.25\%, and 7.45\% in MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, respectively.

These attacks can easily infer whether a sample exists in the training set of the target model with little adversary knowledge, and the inference accuracy is often much higher than random guessing, which causes serious privacy leakage. To this end, defenses against membership inference attacks have attracted great interest. However, the current available defense methods such as regularization, differential privacy, and knowledge distillation are unable to balance the trade-off between privacy and utility well. In this paper, we combine knowledge distillation and generative adversarial networks to propose a novel training framework that can effectively defend against membership inference attacks, called KD-GAN. Extensive experiments show that our method implements an attack success rate of nearly 0.5 (random guesses) which can successfully defend against membership inference attacks without causing significant damage to model utility, and consistently outperforming other defense methods in the balance of privacy and utility.},

  abstract     = {(PATE), a general machine learning framework based on knowledge distillation, can provide a privacy guarantee for training data sets. However, this framework poses a number of security risks. First, PATE mainly focuses on the privacy of teachers&#39; training data and fails to protect the privacy of their students&#39; data. Second, PATE relies heavily on a trusted aggregator to count teachers&#39; votes, which is not convincing enough to assume a third party would never leak teachers&#39; votes during the knowledge transfer process. To address the abovementioned issues, we improve the original PATE framework and present a new one that combines secret sharing with Intel Software Guard Extensions in a novel way. In the proposed framework, teachers are trained locally, then uploaded and stored in two computing servers in the form of secret shares. In the knowledge transfer phase, the two computing servers receive shares of private inputs from students before collaboratively performing secure predictions. Thus neither teachers nor students expose sensitive information. During the aggregation process, we propose an effective masking technique suitable for the setting to keep the prediction results private and prevent the votes from being leaked to the aggregation server. Besides, we optimize the aggregation mechanism and add noise perturbations adaptively based on the posterior entropy of the prediction results. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the new framework on multiple data sets and experimentally demonstrate that the new framework allows highly efficient, accurate, and secure predictions.},

  abstract     = {Image matting aims to extract specific objects, deployed in many applications. Generally, the automatic matting methods need an extra before overcome the intricate details and the diverse appearances. Recently, the matting community has paid more attentions to the investigation of trimap-free matting direction to address the dependency of priors. Most trimap-free approaches divide the matting task into global segmentation and detail matting subtasks. Unfortunately, these methods suffer from stagewise modeling, uncorrectable errors, or subtasks bottleneck problems. To address these issues, we propose a new set of matting subtasks, including foreground segmentation, background segmentation, and disambiguation. And we present a novel Foreground–Background Decoupling Matting (FBDM) network motivated by the new subtasks. Specifically, we first design a nested attention mechanism to decouple the backbone features. Then, we utilize two independent progressive semantic decoders by the decoupling features to complete the foreground and background segmentation subtasks. Finally, we utilize multiple of the proposed frequency division local disambiguation modules to achieve the disambiguation subtask. Besides, we establish a challenging potted plant (PPT) benchmark which contains 100 potted plants images in the real world for the matting community. Extensive experiments on several public benchmarks and the PPTs benchmark demonstrate that the proposed FBDM generates the best results compared with the state-of-the-art trimap-free methods.},

  abstract     = {With recent advances in cloud computing, mobile devices are increasingly being used to record patient physiological parameters, and transfer them to a cloud-based hospital information system, for access control mediation over a variety of stakeholders. In such a cloud-based architecture, the patient must specify an access policy for a group of authorized parties towards its outsourced data. Multiauthority ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) was provided as an innovative cloud-based access control cryptographic primitive to tackle the key escrow issue in a centralized architecture, and boost flexibility through cross-domain attributes management. Existing works, however, still have glaring drawbacks. First, they still rely on a trusted authority to generate and distribute user secret keys. Second, they do not simultaneously provide encryption, decryption, or revocation outsourcing, resulting in high processing and communication cost for both the data sender and the data receiver. Third, they do not support both user and attribute revocation, and the integrity of ciphertext downloaded from the cloud is not always verified at the user end. As a result, this paper exploits the dummy attribute technique and introduces a novel, efficient, and secure multiauthority ciphertext-policy ABE method for mediating access control over medical data, in the mobile cloud. The ciphertext access policy enforcement, partial ciphertext decryption, and both the user and attribute indirect revocation updates are safely outsourced to the cloud server in this study. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our scheme is efficient and verifiable, and we prove that our construction is secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption.},

  abstract     = {Rain streaks can seriously degrade the visual quality of an image and are detrimental to subsequent algorithms such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Therefore, removing rain streaks is a very important task. The deraining task has two main limitations: the first is to encode information about rain streaks in different densities and directions, the second is to keep the background details of the image while removing the rain streak. To address these limitations, we propose an effective algorithm, called multi-stage and multi-scale joint channel coordinate attention fusion network (MMAFN). We mainly propose a two-stage network structure, both of which use an encoder-decoder network to extract features. The first-stage network extracts coarse features and the second-stage network integrates the features of the former to further refine features. We design the joint channel coordinate attention block to encode features of rain streaks in different directions and densities. In addition, to better fuse features of different scales and enhance the generalization performance of the network, the inception attention branch block and the multi-level feature fusion block are designed. Extensive experiments substantiate the superiority of the proposed network and prove that our method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art method. The average PSNR of the five test sets is improved by 0.2dB. On the Test100 test set, the PSNR is increased by 0.93dB at most.},

To alleviate the privacy issue in contrastive learning, we propose some novel techniques based on differential privacy, which aim at reducing the high sensitivity of gradient in the private training caused by interactive contrastive learning. Specifically, we add differentially private protection to the connection point related to different per-example gradients, which decreases the sensitivity of the gradients significantly.

Since its birth, DP-SGD has gained popularity and has been widely adopted in both academic and industrial research. One well-known challenge when using DP-SGD is how to improve utility while maintaining privacy. To this end, recently we have seen several proposals that clip the gradients with adaptive thresholds rather than a fixed one. Although each proposal comes with some theoretical justification, the theories often rely on strong assumptions and are not compatible with each other. It is hard to know whether they are good in practice and how good they are. In this paper, we investigate adaptive clipping in DP-SGD from an empirical perspective. With extensive experiments, we were able to gain some fresh insights and proposed two new adaptive clipping strategies based on them. We cross-compared the existing methods and our new strategies experimentally. Results showed that our strategies did provide a substantial improvement in model accuracy, and outperformed the state-of-the-art adaptive clipping methods consistently.},

In this paper, Democratic Federated Learning (DemoFL) is proposed, which is a privacy-preserving FL framework that has sufficiently low communication overheads. DemoFL involves a consensus module to ensure the system is robust. It also utilizes a tree structure to reduce the time communication overheads and realizes high robustness without reducing accuracy. The proposed algorithm reduces the communication complexity of aggregation at training by times, being a controllable parameter. Sufficient experiments have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method.

This motivation offers opportunities that develop fascinating applications supported by analysis of different sports, especially soccer. Ball identification, in soccer images, is an essential task not only for goal-scoring but also for performance evaluation. However, ball detection suffers from several hurdles such as occlusions, fast-moving objects, shadows, poor lighting, color contrast, and other static background objects. Although several ball detection techniques have been introduced such as Frame Difference, Mixture of Gaussian (MoG), Optical Flow, and so forth; ball detection in soccer games is still an open research area. In this paper, a new Fuzzy Based Ball Detection (FBD) strategy is proposed for identifying the ball through a set of image sequences extracted from a soccer match video. FBD can accurately identify the ball even if it is attached to the white lines drawn on the playground or partially occluded behind players. FBD is compared to recent ball detection techniques. Experimental results show that FBD outperforms recent detection techniques as it introduces both the highest level of detection accuracy in the testing stage and the lowest possible error.},

We propose a model that predicts the human view scores of cartoon clips created on Scratch. Our method is divided into two steps to evaluate the aesthetic of the sequence images that compose cartoon clips. First, we train an image classification network to predict the relative aesthetics of individual images. Then we construct an aesthetic space for the sequence image and improve the rating within a specific range. We put forward ScratchGAN to generate a Scratch-cartoon-style aesthetic analysis data set for training the classification network. Experimental results show that our Generative Adversarial Network framework can well transform photos into a Scratch-cartoon style. The single image assessment network can generate predictions that fit human cartoon aesthetic opinions. Our method achieves satisfactory results in the aesthetic evaluation of sequence cartoon images.},

  abstract     = {Currently, named entity recognition (NER) is mainly evaluated on standard and well-annotated data sets. However, the construction of a well-annotated data set will consume a lot of manpower and time. In lots of applications of NER, data sets may contain a lot of noise, and a large part of noise comes from entities. At present, the training process of most models treat unlabeled entities as nonentities, which causes these models to lean toward predicting most words of an input context as nonentities and greatly affects their performances. In this paper, as the first attempt, we innovatively propose an adaptive positive-unlabeled (adaPU) learning technology, and integrate the adaPU into a machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework for NER, which can still perform well on data sets with a large proportion of unlabeled entities. In our framework, to leverage the above problem that a model may predict most words of an input context as nonentities, we propose an adaPU learning technology by adjusting a loss coefficient of positive and negative samples. Moreover, instead of just constructing a fixed query for each entity type as input to MRC, we propose a new method of dynamically constructing multiple queries for each entity type, which also brings slight performance improvement for NER. Accordingly, we explore new training and entity inference strategies for our learning framework. The experimental results show that our framework is effective on data sets that contain a large number of unlabeled entities. When the proportion of unlabeled entities reaches 50\%, our framework still can keep from losing effectiveness and maintain more than 80 F1-scores on several data sets. Also, the experiments show that our framework can achieve better or competitive performance on standard data sets. The ablation experiments further fully demonstrate our MRC framework with adaPU learning and dynamic query construction method can improve the performance of NER.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) wave is an electromagnetic wave with a frequency between far infrared ray and millimeter wave, which is widely used in hazardous material detection for its waveband fingerprint spectroscopy. THz time-domain spectroscopy technology based on deep learning can be used for nondestructive detection of various hazardous materials by recognizing the fingerprint spectrum of substances. However, due to the high cost of collecting spectral data, training samples are not easy to obtain and scarce for classification models, which leads to poor training effectiveness and low accuracy of classification. To address this problem, a fully connected layer-based auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (FC-ACGAN) data augmentation method is proposed in this paper, we realized the generator and discriminator with fully connected layers to fit original data distribution better and generate data with higher quality. First, THz time-domain spectral data from seven flammable liquids were augmented using Mixup and FC-ACGAN, and then we fed the generated data set and expanded data set into Residual Network (ResNet), convolutional neural network, fully convolutional network, and multilayer perceptron for training. It is demonstrated that our method can solve the overfitting of models because of insufficient data. Compared with direct training on original data set, the accuracy of models using augmented data set improved by 5.1325\% on average, which is 3.15\% higher than that using Mixup. Furthermore, we experimented on expanded data set with ResNet long short-term memory for classification, the final accuracy reaches 99.42\% on average, which is 1.09\% higher than that using the original data set.},

  abstract     = {Intrusion detection is an important defensive measure for automotive communications security. Accurate frame detection models assist vehicles to avoid malicious attacks. Uncertainty and diversity regarding attack methods make this task challenging. However, the existing works have the limitation of only considering local features or the weak feature mapping of multifeatures. To address these limitations, we present a novel model for automotive intrusion detection by spatial–temporal correlation (STC) features of in-vehicle communication traffic (intrusion detection system [IDS]). Specifically, the proposed model exploits an encoding-detection architecture. In the encoder part, spatial and temporal relations are encoded simultaneously. To strengthen the relationship between features, the attention-based convolutional network still captures spatial and channel features to increase the receptive field, while attention-long short-term memory builds meaningful relationships from previous time series or crucial bytes. The encoded information is then passed to detector for generating forceful spatial–temporal attention features and enabling anomaly classification. In particular, single-frame and multiframe models are constructed to present different advantages, respectively. Under automatic hyperparameter selection based on Bayesian optimization, the model is trained to attain the best performance. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicle attack data set demonstrate that STC-IDS has outperformed baseline methods and obtains fewer false-alarm rates while maintaining efficiency.},

How to accurately and objectively repair the morphology of craniomaxillofacial tissues and organs through surgery is a difficult problem, and the preoperative virtual design is crucial. Traditional preoperative virtual design methods include mirror technology, statistical shape model, and deformable template. However, these methods are complex, time-consuming, and only applicable to some types of defects. Therefore, a general, intelligent, and personalized craniomaxillofacial defect virtual reconstruction system is desired. To solve this problem, a novel deep learning method, RecGAN, is proposed in this paper. RecGAN can learn the bone morphology of normal people, repair the defect intelligently based on the patient&#39;s remaining bone, and fully adapt to the special conditions of different patients. Currently, there are no open-source maxillofacial data sets available. Thus, a new maxillofacial computed tomography image data set with 500 simulated cases and 100 clinical cases is constructed to train and validate the method. The experimental results show that RecGAN can effectively restore the normal bone and tissue morphology of the patient&#39;s craniomaxillofacial defect area, solve the problem that there is no objective repair method for craniomaxillofacial defect, and achieve the best effect in the same type of research. The proposed intelligent craniomaxillofacial defect virtual reconstruction system based on RecGAN is expected to be applied in future clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {Aggregate signatures allow someone to aggregate multiple signatures into one signature, which is suitable for resource-constrained and computationally inefficient environments. Identify-based aggregate signature can solve the storage problem of public key certificates while achieving efficient signature verification. However, in most of the identity-based aggregate signature schemes, the user identity revocation process is time-consuming and cannot resist quantum attacks. To solve above problems, this paper proposes a lattice-based aggregate signature scheme with dynamic identity revocation by combining lattice-based cryptography and an aggregate signature scheme. The security of the proposed lattice-based aggregate signature scheme with dynamic identity revocation has been proved in the random oracle model. In addition, the verification efficiency of the aggregate signature has been improved compared with multiple different signatures. Much of the data transfer in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is carried out wirelessly, which makes VANET vulnerable to identity spoofing attacks. Identity authentication technology can prevent attackers from impersonating legitimate users, thus ensuring the security of VANET. Based on the proposed lattice-based aggregate signature scheme with dynamic identity revocation, this paper proposes a lattice-based batch authentication scheme with dynamic identity revocation in VANET. Through the proposed batch authentication scheme, we can effectively resist the impersonation attack of VANET in the quantum computer environment, and the efficiency of authentication is improved.},

  abstract     = {Machine unlearning is the process through which a deployed machine learning model is enforced to forget about some of its training data items. It normally generates two machine learning models, the and the , indicating training results before and after data items are deleted. However, recent studies find that machine unlearning is vulnerable to membership inference attacks—as the of training and nontraining data (i.e., data items in the training set have high posterior probabilities), the attackers can utilize this property to infer whether an item has been used for original model training. Nevertheless, such attacks are incapable in settings, in which the attackers are infeasible to get the posteriors. In this paper, we propose a new label-only membership inference attack scheme targeted at machine unlearning to eliminate the dependence on posteriors. Our heuristic is that injected turbulence on candidate samples will present different behaviors for training and nontraining data. Thus, in our scheme, the attacker iteratively query on the original/unlearned models and inject turbulence to change their predicting labels; it determines whether an item is having-been-delated by observing the disturbance amplitude. Extensive experiments (i.e., on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10 data sets) show that our method achieves high inference accuracy (measured by AUC) in label-only settings, for example, AUC = 0.96 for MNIST data set. Besides, we analyze the existing countermeasures in mitigating inference attacks and find that our scheme can bypass most of them.},

To make the attacks less restrictive and more applicable, we propose an effective and practical gradient inversion method in this paper. Specifically, we use cosine similarity to measure the difference of gradients between the synthesized and ground-truth images, and then construct an input regularization for the fully connected layer to ensure the fidelity of the image. Moreover, we apply the total variation denoising strategy to the convolution feature map for further improving the smoothness of the reconstructed image.

  abstract     = {It is urgent to identify the development of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in countries around the world. Therefore, visualization is particularly important for monitoring the COVID-19. In this paper, we visually analyze the real-time data of COVID-19, to monitor the trend of COVID-19 in the form of charts. At present, the COVID-19 is still spreading. However, in the existing works, the visualization of COVID-19 data has not established a certain connection between the forecast of the epidemic data and the forecast of the epidemic. To better predict the development trend of the COVID-19, we establish a logistic growth model to predict the development of the epidemic by using the same data source in the visualization. However, the logistic growth model only has a single feature. To predict the epidemic situation in an all-round way, we also predict the development trend of the COVID-19 based on the Susceptible Exposed Infected Removed epidemic model with multiple features. We fit the data predicted by the model to the real COVID-19 epidemic data. The simulation results show that the predicted epidemic development trend is consistent with the actual epidemic development trend, and our model performs well in predicting the trend of COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Since the new crown epidemic, mask-wearing has become a new normal in people&#39;s work and life. The inspection mechanism for mask-wearing at the entrance and exit of public places is seriously insufficient. The phenomenon of “pick-up on entry” has led to the severe formalization of mask-wearing inspection. Manual detection of mask-wearing in an open and dynamic crowded environment is unrealistic, which is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also cannot achieve early warning throughout the entire process. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a real-time recognition and early warning method for mask-wearing in an open, dynamic, complex environment based on improved YOLOv5 R6.1. First, replacing the first Conv structure of the backbone network in the YOLOv5 R6.1 model with an improved Stem structure to minimize the computational overhead while improving the performance. Then by normalizing the data, the random erasure data expansion technique is used to enhance the antiocclusion robustness of the algorithm. Finally, according to the mask-wearing specification in the training data set, optimizing and adjusting the anchor box parameters of the YOLOv5 R6.1 model to improve the model&#39;s ability to recognize small targets. The experiments are based on open data sets, and the results show that the mean precision (mAP), precision, and recall of this method reach 92.9\%, 94.1\%, and 88.5\% on average, and the average frames per second (FPS) reaches 117. Moreover, the mAP and FPS are improved by an average of 6.5\% and 474\% compared with algorithms based on RetinaNet, Attention-Retina, Single Shot multibox Detector, Fast-RCNN, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5.},

To solve this problem, a nature way is to outsource images to cloud servers. Unfortunately, a range of security and privacy issues arise while delegating both storage and computing to the untrusted external servers. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving feature extraction and retrieval scheme over medical images, which allows images storage and processing on two separate cloud servers. We share the images using secret sharing technology and design a set of secure two-party computation protocols between the two cloud servers. Then a privacy-preserving convolutional neural networks (CNN) framework is constructed to achieve feature extraction, classification and retrieval of images in the encrypted domain. We analyse and evaluate our scheme in terms of both security and efficiency. The results indicate that the proposed secure protocols in our scheme can significantly reduce the computation overhead while protecting the privacy of images as well as the data generated during execution on cloud servers and final results. The performance of our scheme in image feature extraction, classification and retrieval is at a similar level comparable to the scheme based on original CNN in plaintext.},

APM has been widely utilized, such as gene matching and facial recognition. Yet, the genetic data are privacy-sensitive, resulting that the owners are unwilling to share the raw data. This inspires us to explore how to securely perform APM. After revisiting threshold private set intersection (TPSI), we first propose and formalize a functionality named Boolean threshold private set intersection (BTPSI). The new proposed BTPSI primitive returns a Boolean value (0 or 1) to the user, rather than the actual elements in TPSI. We then construct a secure protocol for the BTPSI functionality with semihonest security. Besides, we first combine oblivious transfer and BTPSI to achieve the efficient construction of secure approximate pattern matching (SAPM) protocol in a semihonest model. Furthermore, we implement our SAPM protocol to demonstrate its real practicality. The performance result shows that when the text length is and the pattern length is , the total runtime is less than 3 s.},

It is a challenge to design efficient semantic-aware ranked search (SRSE) schemes with privacy preservation. In this paper, two privacy-preserving SRSE schemes are developed for the cloud environments. The first scheme is the accuracy-first search scheme. In this scheme, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model is adopted to generate the topic-based semantic information-embedded vectors for documents and queried keywords, which supports semantic-aware relevance measurement. The bisecting -means clustering algorithm is used to build an accuracy-first filtering tree index (AFF-tree), and the AFF-tree-based search algorithm is proposed to achieve the accuracy-first ranked search. The second scheme is the efficiency-first search scheme. It performs a structure optimization on the AFF-tree, and a newly efficiency-first filtering tree index (EFF-tree) is designed. By using the EFF-tree, an anchor node-based search algorithm is designed to achieve the efficiency-first ranked search at the expense of a little decrease in search result precision. The secure inner product is used to perform privacy-preserving semantic-aware relevance measurement between documents and queried keywords in both schemes. To analyze the security of the proposed schemes, the game stimulation-based proof is presented. Experimental results show the better performance of the proposed schemes in search time cost.},

Because of that, they can learn excellent user and item embedding by using cooperative signals of high-order neighbors, and the GCNs technique shows great potential in the recommendation. The common problem with the bulk of GCN-based models is that it appears the situation of performance degradation during the stacking of network layers. The recently proposed IMP-GCN alleviates this problem to some extent. It aims to avoid the influence of downside information from high-order propagation on embedding learning. However, we consider that it ignores the multi-interest factor, in which users may have different interests. In this paper, we present a multi-interest GCN(MI-GCN) model for a recommendation, and it conducts high-order graph convolution operations in three sets of subgraphs. Users with similar interests and the corresponding interaction items belong to the identical subgraph. As for the formation of the subgraph, we adopt two varied clustering methods and the user feature to form a subgraph generation mechanism. This mechanism can generate three groups of differential subgraphs to divide users into multi-interest groups and make subgraph division more reasonable. We carry out massive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. Experimental results confirm that our presented MI-GCN outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based recommendation models.},

However, during the training, users were unable to select data and labels adaptively in the server, which made the trained models challenging in meeting user needs. Repeated model training not only wastes server resources, but also reduces query efficiency. In this paper, we combine two privacy-preserving technologies, searchable encryption and homomorphic encryption, and propose a highly flexible machine training framework. Homomorphic encryption technology is used to encrypt data, and symmetric searchable encryption technology is used to generate blind indexes and trapdoors. The server can perform ciphertext data search through blind query trapdoors and indexes, and can use the searched homomorphic ciphertext for model training. This framework significantly improves the flexibility of training and the fit of the model, and also ensures the security of dynamic data management. The server locally uses the header of the query trap and the storage address of the ciphertext model to build an automatically updatable ciphertext model table. On the basis of ensuring the effectiveness of the model, it greatly improves the efficiency of obtaining the model, effectively prevents redundant training when different users send the same request, and reasonably allocates resources in the server.},

The development of artificial intelligence provides new ideas to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel task scheduling and load balancing method based on optimized deep reinforcement learning in HCE. First, we formulate task scheduling problem as a Markov decision process and then adopt a dueling double deep learning network to search the optimal task allocation solution.

In these scenarios, using a linear model such as a Gaussian dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) can result in severe forecasting inaccuracies due to the structure and parameters of the model remaining constant without considering either the elapsed time or the state of the system. To approach this problem, we propose a hybrid model that combines a model tree with DBNs. The model first divides the original data set into different scenarios based on the splits made by the tree over the system variables and then performs a piecewise regression in each branch of the tree to obtain nonlinear forecasts. The experimental results on three different datasets show that our model outperforms standard DBN models when dealing with nonlinear processes and is competitive with state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods.},

Meanwhile, privacy leakage in the applications as a potential threat needs to be addressed urgently. However, removing private information from models is difficult once the user&#39;s sensitive data enters machine learning models, particularly neural networks. Most of the previous amnestic methods based on retraining require full access to the training set of the target model and have limited improvements in computational resources and time improvement. In this paper, we propose S, which removes sensitive data from the original model via influence estimation to produce an unlearning model that is approximately indistinguishable from the retrained model. S builds on the essential concept of influence function and reformulates the influence estimation as a closed-form update of forgetting. For learned models with strictly convex loss functions, our approach theoretically guarantees the effectiveness of forgetting while empirically demonstrating forgetting performance. For models with non-convex losses, we relax strictly convex assumptions by applying a damping term that allows us to make approximate estimates with negligible errors from the original assumption. Furthermore, experiments show that S only causes less than 1\% and 3\% accuracy drop with more than 80\% forgetting rate on average for logistic regression models and convolutional neural networks. The accuracy drop is reduced by 2\%–3\% compared to most state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, hybrid-order community detection has been proposed for addressing the hypergraph fragmentation issue suffered by the motif-based higher-order community detection. However, the existing attempts of hybrid-order community detection inadvertently damage the lower-order connectivity pattern and the higher-order connectivity pattern when constructing the fusion model. Additionally, like the higher-order community detection approaches, they also adopt a two-phase strategy that separately applies the existing graph node clustering methods to the proximity matrix derived from the lower-order connectivity pattern and the higher-order connectivity pattern. Therefore, the higher-order connectivity pattern is only utilized for constructing proximity matrix and hence has no direct effect on the final community results. In this paper, to address the above issues, we propose a enerative model for ybrid-rder ommunity detection (GHOC). The main idea lies in defining a likelihood function of a generative model that finds the optimal community membership strength vectors of nodes, based on which the original lower-order connectivity pattern and the higher-order connectivity pattern can be directly reconstructed simultaneously. From the community membership strength vectors, the final community structure can be derived. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several data sets, and the results have confirmed the superiority of the proposed GHOC method.},

  abstract     = {With regard to large dimensions of contemporary data sets and restricted computational time of intelligent systems, reducing the dimensions of data sets is necessary. Feature selection is a practical way to remove a set of redundant, irrelevant, and noisy features. In this way, the speed of decision-making procedure will be increased while the accuracy of decisions will be retained. To this end, numerous attentions have been attracted to the topic and consequently, extensive range of methods has been proposed. Regarding the goals of the feature selection concept, the proposed algorithms in this field must be fast and accurate. Therefore, this paper proposes a light meanwhile accurate algorithm to fulfill the mentioned goals. The presented algorithm takes the speed advantage of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to propose a novel feature selection method for intelligent systems. Moreover, to reach the goal of accuracy, the proposed strategy considers three important fitness objectives, namely, the number of selected features, the accuracy of classification, and information gain. The proposed scheme considers an accurate multiobjective fitness function instead of manipulating the basic algorithm. The reason is that improving the basic algorithms, WOA in our case, may lead to loading more computational complexity. Also, to make the proposed algorithm as light as possible, this paper considers K-nearest neighbor algorithm as the main classifier. The proposed light feature selection algorithm is run on different data sets.

  abstract     = {Payment channel networks (PCNs) are generally regarded as one of the most effective and promising scalability solutions for blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems, but suffer the issues of low success ratio and long confirmation latency in processing transactions. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of tremendously increasing the success ratio of transactions and improving their execution efficiency by enhancing network nodes&#39; connectivity and enforcing a balanced network channel capacity. To implement such ideas, multiple designs have been made. First, to extent nodes connectivity, we transform the nearly-linear ordered nodes into a star payment structured typology, and design an incentive financing mechanism to restructure a new landmark routing typology design. Especially, for the marginalized or dissociative nodes, we utilize specific financial loan strategies to encourage them to (re)join the system. Besides, we propose the Power Atomic Multi-Path Payments (Power AMP) traffic distribution method, which hierarchically allocates the bottleneck&#39;s currently-available capacity (to replace the random or equal division used in traditional AMP), and thus archives a balanced traffic usage. With such efforts, we improve the transaction success ratio and efficiency of transaction exertion by order of magnitude—compared with traditional PCN using the benchmark of landmark route, our method improves the success ratio by 11.06\%.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to train a classification model from the labeled source domain for the unlabeled target domain. Since the data distribution of the two domains are different, the model often performs poorly on the target domain. The existing methods align the global features of the source domain and the target domain, and learn the domain invariant features to improve the performance of the model, which ignores the difference between the foreground features and the background features, and does not consider the structural information in the image foreground object. Therefore we proposed a method called foreground object structure transfer (FOST), it avoids the problem of ignoring differences in the structure information of foreground features and background features, exploits foreground feature enhancement from source-to-target transfer during adaptation and structural contrast loss to drive the domain alignment process. FOST relies on prior knowledge to distinguish foreground and background features, and considers the structural information of the object, which makes the intra-class spatial distribution more compact, the interclass spatial distribution more separated, improves the transferability and improves the classification efficiency. Extensive experimental results on various benchmarks under different domain adaptation settings illustrated that our FOST compares favorably against the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, we achieved the accuracies of 95.3\%, 91.3\%, 76.6\%, and 87.55\% on the ImageCLEF-DA, Office-31, Office-Home, and Visda-2017 data sets, respectively.},

In addition, channel transformer is introduced in the encoder–decoder, so that the decoder better fuses the features in the encoder and reduces the semantic gap, and enhances the segmentation ability of anomalous regions of the model. The model is only trained with normal samples, and completes the localization of anomalous regions while detecting anomalies.

However, evaluating and for BNs containing both discrete and continuous variables (known as hybrid Bayesian networks [HBNs]) is generally difficult for analytical and simulation-based solutions. This paper describes the work addressing the problem of estimating the partition function for HBNs when exact methods become inefficient or numerically unstable. We use dynamic discretization to provide a discretized version of the model and then perform region-based free energy optimization to obtain the for the HBN efficiently, which is called the DDJT-region partition function (RPR) algorithm. It is novel since the region-based methods have previously only been applied to discrete BNs. We show that the obtained by DDJT-RPR is exact for discretized models and with space complexity equal to that in marginal inference, thus generally applicable to a wide range of applications. To demonstrate these properties, we combine the DDJT-RPR algorithm with an improved expectation-maximization algorithm to learn Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), for applications requiring data only and with prior knowledge, which performed more robustly than conventional GMM learning algorithms.},

The U-shaped structure and the skip connection layer of Unet can effectively achieve precise image segmentation. However, for complicated images, the network structure of Unet is not sufficient enough. In response to this problem, some scholars have designed Unet++ by adding a denser skip connection layer to U-Net. Compared to U-Net, Unet++ is more effective in dealing with complex images, but it has drawbacks in many aspects, and there is still a large loss of eigenvalues in the skip connection and up-sampling processes. To address these issues, this paper uses the channel and attention mechanism to improve the Unet++ model to obtain better image segmentation efficiency and accuracy.

  abstract     = {Under the influence of COVID-19, although upstream small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in construction industry chain suffer from high operating costs and tight cash flow problems, their financing demands are even stronger. As an electronic and platform-based comprehensive service, online supply chain finance can ease the financing problems of SMEs in the construction industry. However, it has become an important issue for financial institutions to effectively assess the credit risk in the process of online supply chain financing. In this paper, an online supply chain risk assessment method, which is based on a hybrid model chain, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique for Nominal and Continuous (SMOTENC), and Random Forest (RF), is proposed to identify and control the credit risk of financial institutions. Specifically, we establish the financial credit risk assessment system with respect to the characteristics of financing enterprises in the construction industry supply chain, including the status of financing enterprises, the status of core enterprises, the operating status of the supply chain, and the status of assets under financing. On the basis of the system, the best index number of the assessment system and the minority samples are obtained by the XGBoost algorithm and the SMOTENC algorithm, respectively. The classification method based on RF is applied to judge the credit risk of financing enterprises in the supply chain of construction industry. In the simulation stage, we take upstream SMEs in the supply chain of construction industry in China as an example for empirical analysis to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The credit risk assessment method proposed in this paper has better performance than the commonly used ones in the academic field with an average improvement on assessment accuracy for 6.39\% and an average increase of Area Under Curve for 6.95\%. Our study provides meaningful exploration on the fund monitoring system of the financing service platform to improve financing efficiency and risk management level.},

Current dynamic representation learning focuses on either discrete learning which results in temporal information loss, or continuous learning which involves heavy computation. In this study, we proposed a novel DGNN, sparse dynamic (Sparse-Dyn). It adaptively encodes temporal information into a sequence of patches with an equal amount of temporal-topological structure. Therefore, while avoiding using snapshots which cause information loss, it also achieves a finer time granularity, which is close to what continuous networks could provide. In addition, we also designed a lightweight module, Sparse Temporal Transformer, to compute node representations through structural neighborhoods and temporal dynamics. Since the fully connected attention conjunction is simplified, the computation cost is far lower than the current state-of-the-art. Link prediction experiments are conducted on both continuous and discrete graph data sets. By comparing several state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines, the experimental results demonstrate that Sparse-Dyn has a faster inference speed while having competitive performance.},

Besides, to reduce the computational burden caused by investigating message-passing, only the relevant representative node attributes are extracted by graph feature filters, allowing calculations to be performed in a category-oriented manner. Experiments on 10 node classification data sets show that GD achieves state-of-the-art performance while imposing a substantially lower computational cost. Additionally, since GD has the ability to explore the representative node attributes by category, it can also be applied to imbalanced node classification on multiclass graph data sets.},

The proposed method aims to improve the prediction accuracy of NR-IQA. The proposed method consists of three parts: multiscale distortion-level representation learning, single-image NR-IQA, and a representation affinity module, which can reduce NR-IQA computational complexity while maintaining a low-distortion representation of high-distortion inputs. The proposed NR-IQA method aims to extract distributional features of samples in real distorted images and predict ambiguity based on distortion-level learning.

Recently, the container microservices-based Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has gained popularity, a lightweight framework compared to the monolithic virtual machine-based system. MCC combines fog nodes or cloud nodes with a base station to run the applications. However, storing the sensitive data of IoT applications on the untrusted nodes and failure of services are critical challenges in the existing architecture. This study proposes a novel microservices-based by combining fog and cloud services with efficient schemes. The first scheme is the Latency Aware Task Assignment Algorithm, which determines the optimal assignment of tasks to minimize the makespan of all applications. The second scheme is Fully Homomorphism Encryption, which ensures data security before an offload to any external assistance for execution. The final one is the Failure Aware, which handles any transient failure during application execution in the architecture.

The BFS is viewed as a noncollaborative financing strategy, and the MPB and SPB are collaborative financing strategies. The financing strategies are obtained at the point where wholesale price, production quantity, and emission reduction are endogenously determined. We found that the collaborative financing strategy is beneficial to the supplier and the whole supply chain compared with the noncollaborative financing strategy, the SPB strategy may outperform the MPB strategy for the supplier and the whole supply chain, depending on sharing proportion. The advantage of the MPB and SPB strategies relative to the BFS strategy mainly depends on sharing proportion from the manufacturer&#39;s perspective.

  abstract     = {Password-based authentication is widely used in website access. Current studies on password security have focused considerable attention on letter-only passwords or passwords that include both letters and digits. However, little research has been conducted on commercial and digit-only passwords. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate digit-only passwords by analyzing approximately 130,000 passwords from the 12306 data set. We observe that approximately 20\% of six-digit passwords belonging to Chinese users include the user&#39;s identity document (ID) card information. Most of the passwords are found to be related to the user&#39;s birth dates. Additionally, we demonstrate that male users are more likely to set passwords with digits extracted from their ID card numbers than female users. It is the first time that the relation between real-user passwords and ID card series numbers was considered. It focuses on actual attack methodologies and real-user passwords, which renders this study an explicit study on digit-only password security. We propose a password-encryption authentication model based on FF3-1 to implement secure storage of passwords. We experiment with ciphertext and plaintext passwords using three–three and four–two structures combined with probabilistic context-free grammars. The cracking success rates of ciphertext passwords are found to be 0.086\% and 1.06\%, and they can recover 59.83\% and 33.2\% of the passwords in the test set. Conversely, using plaintext passwords results in the recovery of 98\% and 85\% of passwords in the test set. Our results demonstrate that the use of encryption for password storage can significantly reduce the cracking success rate of attackers.},

However, the supervision information is not well utilized in the process of exploring the consensus structure of the multiview data. In this paper, we propose a novel unified pseudolabel-guided multiview consensus (PMvC) learning framework for the semisupervised classification problem, which learns the consensus structure of multiview data by fully exploiting the supervised information of labeled samples. Specifically, PMvC first assigns multiple pseudolabels to the unlabeled samples by selecting the nearest labeled sample in each view separately, and then labels the part of unlabeled samples by selecting the pseudolabel that agrees across all views. By doing so, the high-confident pseudolabeled samples can be selected to enlarge the labeled sample pool and the supervision information can be exploited further in the learning process. In addition, to capture the consensus structure of the multiview data, PMvC learns a consensus graph from the view-specific self-representation graph guided by enhanced supervision information, which better preserves the manifold structure of samples. Meanwhile, the label information is also propagated from the labeled samples to the unlabeled samples by the learned consensus graph simultaneously. Accordingly, an effective optimization algorithm is derived to find the optimal solution for PMvC. Extensive experiment results on several real-world data sets demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of PMvC. The source code of PMvC is available at .},

In semisupervised deep learning, from the point of view of representation hierarchy, semantic information extracted from lower levels is the basis of that extracted from higher levels. The authors wonder if high-level semantic information extracted is also helpful for capturing low-level semantic information. This paper studies this problem and proposes a robust semisupervised model with self-distillation (SD) that simplifies existing semisupervised learning (SSL) techniques for TSC, called SelfMatch. SelfMatch hybridizes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and SD. In unsupervised learning, SelfMatch applies pseudolabeling to feature extraction on labeled data. A weakly augmented sequence is used as a target to guide the prediction of a Timecut-augmented version of the same sequence. SD promotes the knowledge flow from higher to lower levels, guiding the extraction of low-level semantic information. This paper designs a feature extractor for TSC, called ResNet–LSTMaN, responsible for feature and relation extraction. The experimental results show that SelfMatch achieves excellent SSL performance on 35 widely adopted UCR2018 data sets, compared with a number of state-of-the-art semisupervised and supervised algorithms.},

To address this problem, this paper proposes RT-Unet, which combines the advantages of Transformer and Residual network for accurate medical segmentation. In RT-Unet, the Residual block is taken as the image feature extraction layer to alleviate the problem of gradient degradation and obtain more effective features. Meanwhile, Skip-Transformer is proposed, which takes Multi-head Self-Attention as the main algorithm framework, instead of the original Skip-Connection layer in Unet to avoid the influence of shallow features on the network&#39;s performance. Besides, we add attention module at the decoder to reduce semantic differences. According to the experiments on MoNuSeg data set and ISBI_2018cell data set, RT-Unet achieves better segmentation performance than other deep learning-based algorithms. In addition, a series of further ablation experiments were conducted on Residual network and Skip-Transformer, which verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods in this paper.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores resource allocation strategy in the Baidu Over The Edge system to enable mobile edge computing (MEC) datacenters to effectively support cloud-native services downstream to the network edge. There are many challenges to this issue. First, MEC datacenters are resource-constrained to fully meet resource demands. Second, previous works regard the resource requirements of each service as an indivisible unit, resulting in idle MEC resources, even if the resources can meet the demands of some microservices decoupled by the service. Third, they are confined to optimize the allocation for a single slot, failing to adapt to the dynamic demands. To improve resource utilization, we propose performability-aware resource allocation (PARA), a PARA on the edges for cloud-native services. It takes microservices as the unit of resource allocation and allows services to perform with degraded services when only part of microservices&#39; demands are met. It also considers dependency among microservices, dynamic resource requirements, and resource supply characteristics of MEC and cloud. Performability is a unified performance-reliability measure for evaluating such degradable systems. To maximize the long-term overall performability, we model the resource optimization problem and then develop an online greedy heuristic algorithm. The algorithm predicts services&#39; resource demands and then adapts the online allocation. The experimental results show that PARA reduces the reallocation overhead by 47.7\%–53.6\%, and improves the long-term overall performability by 23.14\%–43.25\% of existing state-of-the-art works.},

To address these problems, we propose a decentralized federated meta-learning framework (DFMLF) for few-shot multitask learning. In DFMLF, the devices take the rapid adaptation as objective and learn the meta-knowledge shared by tasks to deal with the few-shot multitask problem. In addition, DFMLF conducts cross-validation and secure aggregation mechanism by a small number of committee nodes, which not only eliminates the central server to avoid the security risks brought by the malicious central server, but also avoids the attack of malicious devices. Moreover, to address the extra communication cost brought by the committee strategy, we propose a communication-efficient method to make the training and aggregation carried out in parallel.

In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed to combine these three market information types with different data structures, that is, numerical economic indicators represented as scalars, media represented as textual vectors, and the influences of related firms captured by graphs. More importantly, the unique data characteristics brought by such data fusion are well addressed in the proposed learning framework. Specifically, a matrix-based module is first proposed to fuse numerical economic data and textual media, which specifically considers the interactions of the fused features. Such fused information, along with the firm relevance represented in graphs, is further integrated by a novel self-adaptive graph neural network that can address the dynamic merging of multilinked listed firms.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the most common primary bone tumor is osteosarcoma, which mostly occurs in teenagers. A common diagnosis method is currently that doctors manually diagnose osteosarcoma in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images because it is nonradioactive and has no biological damage to brain tissue and more obvious performance in soft tissue components such as tumors, blood vessels, and muscles in MRI images. However, this method is labor-intensive and time-consuming work, and cannot guarantee the accuracy of the diagnostic results. Existing osteosarcoma MRI image segmentation methods either aim to model the global context to improve the inner consistency of objects, or multiscale feature fusion to refine the detail of objects along their boundaries, which all ignore the interaction between the body of the object and the object boundary. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel segmentation method for osteosarcoma MRI images based on DecoupleSegNet, which explores the relationship between body feature and edge feature. It can assist doctors in diagnosing osteosarcoma and improve their work efficiency. First, we warp the feature of MRI images through learning a flow field so we can make the object more consistent. We then make further work to optimize the resulting body feature and residual edge feature through explicitly sampling pixels from different parts under decoupled supervision. Through these steps, we finally obtain the final feature map with fine boundaries from the MRI image of osteosarcoma. We take a test by using more than 80,000 osteosarcoma MRI images obtained from three hospitals in China. We find that compared with existing osteosarcoma MRI image segmentation methods, our proposed method achieves 90.51 Intersection of Union\% with few parameters on the test, outperforming other models. In the test, we prove that our proposed method has better accuracy and lower resource consumption.},

  abstract     = {In system modeling arises a fundamental question about the level of difficulty one may encounter when designing a model on a basis of some training data. In this study, we advocate that such level of difficulty inherently depends upon the variability of the available function (data). If for a pair of input data which exhibits small differences, the differences of the corresponding outputs are substantial then building a model in the presence of such data becomes more challenging than in cases of data where the differences in the output data are far more limited. Dwelling on this observation, we introduce a variability index quantifying the nature of data in terms of variability observed in input and output data, respectively. The proposed index is model-neutral (model agnostic), namely describes and quantifies the modeling challenge implied by the data irrespectively of the specific model to be constructed. In case of functions, we show that the Lipschitz constant plays a similar role as the variability index computed for experimental data. An original way of reducing values of the variability index through a nonlinear transformation of original data completed by a fuzzy rule-based model is introduced. It is shown that such rule-based architecture gives rise to a piecewise linear transformation (multipoint linear approximation) exhibiting required contraction-dilation characteristics. The optimization of this transformation is carried out with the use of a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. We also demonstrate that the index can be used to quantify a concept of adversarial data. Along this line, we introduce a granular characterization of adversarial feature of individual data points. A series of experiments is provided to offer a thorough illustration and detailed insight into the nature and a thorough characterization of publicly available data.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been widely applied in engineering problems. However, many strictly constrained problems such as distributed optimization in engineering applications are still a great challenge to MARL. Especially for strict global constraints of agents&#39; actions, it is very easy to lead to sparse rewards. Besides, existing studies cannot solve the instability caused by partial observability while making the algorithm fully distributed. Algorithms with centralized training may encounter significant obstacles in real-world deployment. For the first time, we provide theoretical analysis for MARL to determine the adverse effects of partial observability on convergence, and a fully distributed and convergent MARL algorithm based on Reward Recorder is proposed. Each agent runs an independent reinforcement learning algorithm and uses the average-consensus protocol to estimate the global state-action value locally to achieve global optimization. To verify the performance of the algorithm, we propose a novel generalized constrained optimization model, which includes local inequality constraints and strict global constraints. The proposed distributed reinforcement learning algorithm is supported by several simulation examples. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm has high stability and excellent decision-making ability.},

However, in the coupling optimization of offloading decision and resource allocation, the existing numerical optimization algorithms are difficult to obtain high-quality optimization solutions. In this paper, we propose a differential dynamic gradient descent (DDGD) optimization algorithm to solve the above optimization problems. DDGD algorithm decomposes the constrained NP-hard optimization problem into two network layers and integrates the constraint function into a larger end-to-end training network. These two-layer networks encode the dependencies and optimization constraints between parameter hidden states, which cannot be captured by a numerical optimization model or a full connection layer neural network. Because the ring learning and self-repeating learning architecture are adopted and the information is stored in the differential dynamics network, the proposed algorithm can achieve better and more intelligent decision-making in searching the solution trajectory without setting accurate parameters in advance and reduce the complexity of the network. We show that compared with the baseline method, the DDGD method has superior optimization performance in the energy consumption optimization of COMEC.},

By losing the squared operation, the proposed method weakens the influence of outliers and noise and at the same time keeps the geometric structure of data. It can be solved through an effective nongreedy iterative algorithm, with each subproblem having a closed-form solution. The algorithm is further proved to be convergent.

However, it is a great challenge to measure the reliability of combinational circuits at register transfer level (RTL) rapidly and efficiently. In this paper, a new fast and accurate computational model based on stochastic computation (SC) is presented to meet these objectives. In the proposed approach, the circuit netlists at RTL are parsed to satisfy the requirements of SC on the bitstream structure of the circuits, and then a Sobol sequence-based algorithm for generating uniform non-Bernoulli sequences is built to reduce the random fluctuations occurred in probability calculations. After that, an adaptive algorithm based on a MAX–MIN ant system is constructed using graphics processing unit-based parallel schemes to greatly accelerate the calculation. The experimental results validate our proposed technique, showing that this approach was approximately 51 and 42 times faster than the traditional SC approach and the stochastic computational model (SCM), respectively; its required sequence length was approximately 1.66 times shorter than that of the traditional SC approach, and its relative error was two times smaller than that of the SCM.},

The most common threat is splicing forgery that copies a part of the area from one donor image to the acceptor one. Some research works were proposed to protect the image originality, whereas they are still difficult to apply in practice. There are two main reasons: (a) very limited data for learning models; (b) huge attribute differences between the donor and acceptor images. We propose two novel tasks to conquer the above challenges: Synthetic Adversarial Networks (SANs) and Hybrid Dense U-Net (HDU-Net). SAN finds the most secluded position for inserting tampered areas in an image by learning the association between scenes and objects, and can enlarge the original small data set by more than 40 times. We call the data set SF-Data generated by SAN. We combine the dense U-Net that detects the differences of the essential attributes of image with four spaces containing more available feature information to propose HDU-Net. Then, the synthetic data set SF-Data are used to train HDU-Net. We perform various attack experiments on several public data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.},

They either tend to overextend activations to the background, or they tend to activate the most discriminative object part. To alleviate this problem, we propose an object representation enhancement model to weaken background distraction and to mine complementary object regions during the object representation learning. Specifically, we first propose an Object-aware Representation Enhancement (ORE) module to estimate an object mask for each input image, guiding the model to disregard the background content and focus on the foreground object. The ORE module and the subsequent self-supervised learning can mutually reinforce each other. Then we propose a Masked Self-supervised Learning branch and design a masked attention consistency objective to induce the model to activate complementary parts of the object effectively. Extensive experiments on four fine-grained data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.},

Patch learning (PL), based on the improved adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and continuous local optimization for the input domain, is characterized by high accuracy. However, PL can only handle low-dimensional data set regression. Based on the parallel and serial ensembles, two deep patch learning algorithms with embedded adaptive fuzzy systems (DPLFSs) are proposed in this paper. First, using the maximum information coefficient (MIC) and Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficients for feature selection, the variables with the least relationship (linear or nonlinear) are excluded. Second, principal component analysis is used to reduce the complexity further of DPLFSs. Meanwhile, fuzzy C-means clustering is used to enhance the interpretability of DPLFSs. Then, an improved PL method is put forward for the training of each sub-fuzzy system in a fashion of bottom-up layer-by-layer, and finally, the structure optimization is performed to significantly improve the interpretability of DPLFSs. Experiments on several benchmark data sets show the advantages of a DPLFS: (1) it can handle medium-scale data sets; (2) it can overcome the curse of dimensionality faced by PL; (3) its precision and generalization are greatly improved; and (4) it can overcome the poor interpretability of deep learning networks. Compared with shallow and deep learning algorithms, DPLFSs have the advantages of interpretability, self-learning, and high precision. DPLFS1 is superior for medium-scale data; DPLFS2 is more efficient and effective for high-dimensional problems, has a faster convergence, and is more interpretable.},

The first case considers the products are replenished in bulk and packed in small quantities by the vendor and sent to the retailers. The second case presumes that the vendor replenishes the packed items from the supplier and sent to retailers without the packaging process. The wastage of products during the packaging process occurs in the first case and the deterioration of items occurs in both cases. The unpredictable parameters such as the proportion of wastage products and the proportion of deteriorated products lead the model under fuzzy logic. The VI model and the Vendor&#39;s fuzzy inventory (VFI) are framed. VFI model is formulated by assuming the wastage rate and the deterioration rate as triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) as well as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The defuzzification method of TFN and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers by the combination of Beta distribution and a uniform distribution is utilized in this paper. For both cases, the optimal ordering and purchasing period, the optimal retailer&#39;s replenishment period, and the optimal packaging period for case (i) is computed which minimizes the vendor&#39;s total cost.

  abstract     = {A new class of poisoning attacks has recently emerged targeting the client-side Domain Name System (DNS) cache. It allows users to visit fake websites unconsciously, thereby revealing their information, such as passwords. However, the current DNS defense architecture does not include DNS clients. Although relative encryption solutions can mitigate this attack, they require the cooperation of multiple parties, and the deployment speed is slow. Therefore, we propose an intelligent-driven proactive defense strategy. First, we model the offensive and defensive process as a stochastic game based on moving target defense. Second, we adopt and optimize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a deep reinforcement learning method, to solve problems caused by uncertain attack strategies and unknown state transition probability. Third, we design a self-checking component in PPO to solve the uncertainty of action space caused by game state constraints based on our previous work. Thus the convergence speed and stability of PPO are improved. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to game with intelligent attackers besides three conventional ones. Our strategy does not require any modifications to the DNS architecture. Through an extensive experimental campaign, the prototype system is proved to be effective against multiple attack modes. Its success rate is 98.5\% approximately, and network round-trip time is about 55 ms. Even for random attackers, our method can achieve the theoretical maximum defensive success rate.},

We propose identifying the critical network connections by considering the importance of channels. During runtime, the proposed method detects the task types and timely swaps the model parameters of the critical subnetworks from the external storage into dynamic random access memory (DRAM). Compared with conventional network pruning, the proposed approach further reduced the DRAM requirement by 34.6\% while maintaining a high inference accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and these adversarial examples stay malicious when transferred to other neural networks. Many works exploit this transferability of adversarial examples to execute black-box attacks. However, most existing adversarial attack methods rarely consider cross-task black-box attacks that are more similar to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a class of random blur-based iterative methods (RBMs) to enhance the success rates of cross-task black-box attacks. By integrating the random erasing and Gaussian blur into the iterative gradient-based attacks, the proposed RBM augments the diversity of adversarial perturbation and alleviates the marginal effect caused by iterative gradient-based methods, generating the adversarial examples of stronger transferability. Experimental results on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC data sets show that the proposed RBM generates more transferable adversarial examples on image classification models, thereby successfully attacking cross-task black-box object detection models.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Scratch, as a widely-used educational programming platform, has gathered a huge number of programming users all over the world. Facing massive programming resources, how to make satisfactory programming recommendations has attracted increasing attention, especially on explainable recommendations. Existing Scratch recommendation systems overlook to provide why a project is recommended, which prevents users from making better decisions and trusting in the system. To resolve this problem, we design the Scratch-RL, an explainable reinforcement learning framework over knowledge graphs for Scratch recommendation. First, we devise a preference-driven Actor-Critic network to simulate users&#39; local preferences and explore the potential interested projects along the reasoning paths. In the Actor-Critic network, we elaborate a preference state function, a preference-based reward function, and a preference-conditional action pruning strategy for the agent. Then, we leverage a directive discriminator network to help evaluate the correctness of recommendations from the agent and return an extra guidance reward accordingly. A high guidance reward is given when the agent generates correct recommendations, which guarantees that the agent quickly and accurately comprehends the preferences of users. Finally, we jointly train the Actor-Critic network and the discriminator, when the whole training is done, the reasoning paths are taken as the interpretability of the recommendations. Extensive experiments on both the Scratch data set and public data set show that, Scratch-RL obtains favorable recommendation results compared with the state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning is usually data starved, and the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is developed to introduce the knowledge in the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Recently, deep self-training presents a powerful means for UDA, involving an iterative process of predicting the target domain and then taking the confident predictions as hard pseudo-labels for retraining. However, the pseudo-labels are usually unreliable, thus easily leading to deviated solutions with propagated errors. In this paper, we resort to the energy-based model and constrain the training of the unlabeled target sample with an energy function minimization objective. It can be achieved via a simple additional regularization or an energy-based loss. This framework allows us to gain the benefits of the energy-based model, while retaining strong discriminative performance following a plug-and-play fashion. The convergence property and its connection with classification expectation minimization are investigated. We deliver extensive experiments on the most popular and large-scale UDA benchmarks of image classification as well as semantic segmentation to demonstrate its generality and effectiveness.},

As a result, it obtains (log )-block bandwidth cost, which affirmatively answers the above open question. Meanwhile, the data locality is reduced to (log ). In addition, the client storage is maintained at the small level of (log )-block, and the server storage is maintained at the unexpanded level of ()-block.

First, copy the coupled variables to obtain two independent variables. Meanwhile, an extra variable together with an equivalence constraint is introduced for problem consistency. Then, the transformed problem divides into subproblems with carefully derived loss functions. Subproblems own decoupled variables and shared policy networks, which means they can be optimized concurrently. Guided by the algorithm design, this paper further proposes an asynchronous parallel training scheme to accelerate training efficiency.

However, air traffic systems are extremely complicated since an air traffic system encompasses many components which could evolve over time. It is therefore challenging to analyze the evolution dynamics of air traffic systems. In this paper we propose a graph perspective to trace the spatial-temporal evolutions of air traffic systems. Different to existing studies which are model-driven and only focus on certain properties of an air traffic system, in this paper we propose a data-driven perspective and analyze a couple of properties of an air traffic system. Specifically, we model air traffic systems with both unweighted and weighted graphs with respect to real-world traffic data. We then analyze the evolution dynamics of the constructed graphs in terms of nodal degrees, degree distributions, traffic delays, causality between graph structures and traffic delays, and system resilience under airport failures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study on the American air traffic systems with respect to 12-month traffic data is carried out. It is found that the structures and traffic mobilities of the American air traffic systems do not evolve significantly over time, which leads to the stable distributions of the traffic delays as evidenced by a causality analysis. It is further found that the American air traffic systems are quite robust to random airport failures while, respectively, 20\% and 10\% failures of the hub airports will lead to the collapse of the entire system with respect to the two proposed cascading failure models.},

  abstract     = {Multisource fusion localization is a mainstream scheme for acquiring accurate locations in complex indoor scenes. To overcome the interference of indoor structures on radio and illumination variation on visual features, the semantic maps provide an effective way for multisource fusion localization. However, due to the lack of visual depth information, solutions of indoor semantic maps suffer from large semantic segmentation errors for similar objects, which leads to the unstable performance of localization systems. To overcome the issue in semantic and fusion localization, we develop a localization system to demonstrate the use of restudy semantic map and self-adapting fusion localization would achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy, termed VISEL. VISEL uses the proposed spatial attention-aware semantic model to enhance the discrimination of semantic features for capturing accurate semantic maps. On the basis of high-precision semantic maps, VISEL completes an enhanced particle filter fusion localization module with adaptive reassign weight to different localization modules, which successfully improves accuracy through complementary advantages between different signals while overcoming the drawbacks of each signal and interference of complex environment. The extensive experimental results show that VISEL outperforms current state-of-the-art positioning systems and achieves an average positioning accuracy of 0.4 m. VISEL utilizes semantic maps with depth features and enhanced particle filter to reduce the fusion localization error by 38\%, which suggests the high-precision semantic maps with depth features could provide a robust solution for the fusion localization system for indoor complex scenes.},

To learn generic data representations and improve the generalization ability of the model, this paper designs a three-stage framework for glaucoma diagnosis. In the first stage, preprocessing is utilized to extract the Region of Interesting around the Optic Disc to reduce the computational cost and nonobjective interference. In the second stage, Deep Sparse Autoencoder is designed to learn hybrid features between the deep features and the original features, which could improve the effectiveness of final high-level feature expression. Meanwhile, L1 regularization is introduced and applied on the hybrid features to obtain deep features with high complementarity under small sample problem. In the third stage, the obtained generic feature representations are fed into different classifiers, in which Support Vector Machine classifier achieves the best diagnosis performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on two publicly available databases. Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with the accuracy of 96.00\%, 97.00\% and Area Under Curve of 96.94\%, 98.28\% for REFUGE and Drishti-GS1 databases, respectively.},

To this end, we propose an attention mechanism and adaptive convolution actuated fusion network (AMACF) innovatively, which optimizes forecast effectiveness of user preference. To better model some contextual information such as category, temporal, we utilize long- and short-term memory network to learn contextual features of POIs in historical check-ins and embed self-attention mechanism to capture users&#39; preference in the long-term module. In the short-term module, for capturing the complicated interest, the adaptive convolution network (Ada-CN) is novelly proposed, which applies the attention mechanism to aggregate multiple parallel convolution kernels selectively and adjust to short-term preference according to users&#39; continuously updated check-ins. Furthermore, an attention-based fusion mechanism is designed to combine long- and short-term preferences, where contributions to the next POI of different users are evaluated sufficiently. Experimental results on two real-world data sets indicates that AMACF outperforms baseline methods for next POI recommendation.},

  abstract     = {As one of the essential deep learning models, a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a commonly used generative training model. By adaptively growing the size of the hidden units, infinite RBM (IRBM) is obtained, which possesses an excellent property of automatically choosing the hidden layer size depending on a specific task. An IRBM presents a competitive generative capability with the traditional RBM. First, a generative model called Gaussian IRBM (GIRBM) is proposed to deal with practical scenarios from the perspective of data discretization. Subsequently, a discriminative IRBM (DIRBM) and a discriminative GIRBM (DGIRBM) are established to solve classification problems by attaching extra-label units next to the input layer. They are motivated by the fact that a discriminative variant of an RBM can complete an individual framework for classification with better performance than some standard classifiers. Remarkably, the proposed models retain both generative and discriminative properties synchronously, that is, they can reconstruct data effectively and be established in considerable self-contained classifiers. The experimental results on image classification (both large and small), text identification, and facial recognition (both clean and noisy) reflect that a DIRBM and a DGIRBM are superior to some state-of-the-art RBM models in terms of the reconstruction error and the classification accuracy. Intuitively, they require models to avoid utilizing more hidden units than needed when confronted with various sizes of data, prioritizing smaller networks. In addition, the proposed models behave more robustly than other classic classifiers when dealing with noisy facial recognition.},

  abstract     = {Time series research in academic and industrial fields has attracted wide attention. However, the frequency information contained in time series still lacks effective modeling. The studies found that time series forecasting relies on different frequency patterns: short-term series forecasting relies more on high-frequency components, while long-term forecasting focuses more on low-frequency data. To better describe the multifrequency mode, a dual-stage multifeature adaptive frequency domain prediction model (DMAFD) is proposed in this paper. DMAFD contains two stages. First, it adopts the XGBoost algorithm to obtain a feature vector by analyzing the feature importance. Second, the frequency feature extraction of time series and the frequency aware modeling of the target sequence is integrated, for building an end-to-end prediction network based on the dependence of time series on frequency mode. The innovation is reflected in the fact that the prediction network can automatically focus on multifrequency components according to the dynamic evolution of the input sequence. Extensive experiments on four real data sets from different fields show that DMAFD obtains higher accuracy and smaller lags in time step analysis compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

For example, existing ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption schemes do not generally have in-place limits on the number of access or access duration, which can consequently be exploited to perform economic denial of sustainability and other attacks. In addition, improving system efficiency can be challenging in large-scale operations. Thus, in this paper, we present a blockchain-based access control with -times tamper resistance. Our proposed approach allows one to set and enforce quota/limits on the number of accesses allowed for each user, whose integrity is ensured using blockchain. In addition, our proposed approach also allows multiple attribute authorities to coexist and work together with a central authority to facilitate secret key distribution and improve system efficiency. We then evaluate the security and the efficiency of our proposed approach to demonstrate its utility.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNN) have been widely used in many machine learning tasks, such as text classification, sequence labeling, protein interface prediction, and knowledge graph. With increasing security concerns, GNN have been proved to be vulnerable and unreliable. Recent years, inspired by adversarial model in computer vision, various attacks on graph data begin to emerge. However, the exist attacks mostly focus on security violation and attack specificity, and very few attacks concern error specificity. In this paper, we focus on dealing with this kind of attack on one node of the graph by slightly manipulating the graph structure. Our goal is to change the label of the node to what we want after attack. We formulate this case as label specificity attack problem. The biggest challenge in solving this problem is the lack of theoretical guidance to perform this attack. For this, we reinterpret structural entropy and define differential structural entropy (DS-entropy) to guide the manipulation. Based on DS-entropy, we propose the target-label principle and max-degree principle to execute our attack, and then design the corresponding algorithm DSEM. We compare our algorithm DSEM with two benchmarks on three classical graph data sets. Results show that our algorithm is effective in performing label specificity attacks.},

Therefore, this way cannot assure a high-quality graph and furthermore brings some adverse influence to the following tasks. In this paper, we incorporate robust graph learning and dimensionality reduction into a unified framework which also seamlessly integrates the clustering task. On the basis of the framework, Euclidean distance-based robust graph (EDBRG) and self-expressiveness-based robust graph (SEBRG) are presented. Both EDBRG and SEBRG contain clustering information from which the clustering results can be obtained directly. By projecting the original data into a discriminative subspace where the negative effect of redundant features and noise is removed, EDBRG and SEBRG are informative, robust, and sparse. During the whole mapping process, the main energy of data is preserved. Finally, some data sets are adopted to test the performances of EDBRG and SEBRG. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed methods have many advantages for the task of clustering, comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The sustainability online prediction is of great significance for higher horizon time-series prediction in the future, and it embodies higher application value in equipment fault prediction and health management. However, compared with one-step time-series prediction, continuous online prediction faces many uncertainties, including error accumulation and lack of information. To realize continuous online prediction of time-series data in complex systems, this paper proposes a continuous online prediction strategy based on multihorizons transfer (OnMultiHorTS), which is used for continuous online prediction tasks of time-series data. The algorithm aims to use source domain data to provide more effective information for target prediction tasks. However, the time-varying characteristics of time-series data often lead to large differences in data distribution over a long time span, which is difficult to guarantee the assumption that the data are the same distribution. How to construct more effective source domain information based on historical data and existing data, and apply it to the target domain prediction tasks, is one of the focuses of our OnMultiHorTS algorithm. In addition, different from the typical iterative and multistep advance prediction methods, the proposed algorithm regards different prediction tasks as different horizons, which are independent of each other and can explore the correlation between them. Therefore, based on the correlation between horizons, the algorithm develops a set of multihorizons continuous online prediction schemes, which can continuously predict the next step time-series data based on the current observation data. Finally, we test the performance of the algorithm on four common time-series data sets and four aeroengine sensor data sets. At the same time, we test the impact of training step size and prediction step size on the performance of the algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed OnMultiHorTS algorithm has higher prediction accuracy in the time-series data prediction task of complex systems, and reflects higher engineering application value.},

To be specific, a well-tuned weighted extreme learning machine classifier is first learned from source data that has been completely labeled. Subsequently, another extreme learning machine classifier is obtained from the limited labeled target domain data to preserve the target domain structural knowledge and the decision boundary information. Finally, the target classifier is optimized by minimizing the outputs of the two classifiers on unlabeled target data.

  abstract     = {Due to the progressive complexity of traffic networks, the traffic pressure increases sharply and traffic accidents occur frequently, which is largely posed by imprecise traffic information service provided in existing Intelligent traffic service systems (ITSSs). To relieve traffic information trek encountered in complex traffic networks, the personalized traffic information recommendation based on click through rate (CTR) prediction has attracted extensive attention. However, the data sparsity and cold start problems in traditional recommendations hinder their real-time applications in ITSSs. In this paper, the multisource data with different types of context information are utilized to construct a personalized fine-grained recommendation method for intelligent traffic services (PF-ITS), which includes three components: a road condition optimization strategy (RCOS) to capture users&#39; behavior preferences and traffic patterns, an encoder–decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) model to address the data sparsity and cold start problems with rich context information, and an improved DeepFM model based on attention mechanism (DeepAFM) to exert personalized fine-grained traffic information recommendation with embeddings of multisource data. More specifically, the RCOS is proposed to perform coarse-grained route recommendation based on path planning theory, in which the traffic data and drivers&#39; preferences are fully utilized for comprehensive modeling. The encoder–decoder LSTM model is employed for representation learning, in which the traffic sequences and driving behaviors are mapped into dense distributed representations with rich semantic information. The DeepAFM is utilized to achieve effective driving safety guarantee according to an individual&#39;s requirements, in which the weighted low-order feature combinations and high-order feature interactions are incorporated for personalized fine-grained recommendation. We also conduct extensive experiments on public data sets and in real-world scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the PF-ITS method based on RCOS and DeepAFM outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models in effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item based on anonymous behavior session, which has become increasingly essential in various online services. Prior efforts mainly focus on modeling user preference based on the current session. Although some of them have been proven effective, they fail to address two main challenges in SBR. First, SBR suffers more from the problem of data sparsity due to the very limited user–item interactions, and hence it cannot sufficiently capture complicated item dependency relationships. Second, most of the user-item interaction sequences may be with noisy preference signals due to the uncertainty of user&#39;s behaviors, and it is difficult to distill high-quality item for recommendation. In this study, we propose a novel SBR model that exploits Cross-session information for Knowledge-aware Session-based Recommendation (CKSR) to address these two issues. Specifically, cross-session graph and knowledge graph are combined to model a cross-session knowledge graph, based on which a knowledge-aware attention mechanism is performed to capture the complicated transition pattern among interacted items. Each session is then represented as the composition of the global preference and the current interest of that session. Moreover, we leverage the similar sessions for the target session to establish a similar session referral circle and apply an influence coupler to judge the significance of different session referrals. An attentive network is designed to distill session preferences from its unique session referral circle. It dynamically extracts high-quality item from noisy session. Experiments on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that CKSR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently.},

It is noted that the assumption that the differentials of disturbances converge to zeros in the literature is removed. A novel compound strategy is designed by using the robust auxiliary function and the potential function.

The two-dimensional Logistic-adjusted-Sine map is first used to generate two chaotic sequences for pixel-level scrambling and bit-level diffusion of the watermark image, and URVD is applied to watermarking scheme. After fully considering the relationship between image channels, the watermark is embedded into the maximum URVD coefficient by using quantization index modulation based on variable quantization steps. The greatest contribution of this paper is to propose a new image correction algorithm as a pretreatment of watermark extraction, which mainly includes fast detection of feature points, image correction, and sawtooth processing, and it solves some problems existing in image correction algorithms based on geometric characteristics. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good invisibility, strong robustness, and high security. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme has better performance under the same actual embedding rate, especially stronger and more effective robustness against some common geometric attacks.},

Nevertheless, recent black-box adversarial attacks may struggle to balance their attack ability and visual quality of the generated adversarial examples (AEs) in tackling high-resolution images. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided black-box adversarial attack based on the large-scale multiobjective evolutionary optimization, termed LMOA. By considering the spatial semantic information of images, we first take advantage of the attention map to determine the perturbed pixels. Instead of attacking the entire image, reducing the perturbed pixels with the attention mechanism can help to avoid the notorious curse of dimensionality and thereby improve the performance of attacking. Second, a large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithm traverse the reduced pixels in the salient region. Benefiting from its characteristics, the generated AEs can fool target DNNs while being invisible by human vision. Extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed LMOA on the ImageNet data set. More importantly, it is more competitive to generate high-resolution AEs with the better visual quality than the existing black-box adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown convincing performance in learning powerful node representations that preserve both node attributes and graph structural information. However, many GNNs encounter problems in effectiveness and efficiency when they are designed with a deeper network structure or handle large-sized graphs. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed for improving and accelerating the training of GNNs, yet they ignore understanding the source of GNNs performance gain. The measurement of information within graph data can help the sampling algorithms to keep high-value information while removing redundant information and even noise. In this paper, we propose a tric-d (MeGuide) subgraph learning framework for GNNs. MeGuide employs two novel metrics: and to guide the subgraph sampling and mini-batch based training. is designed for analyzing the feature of nodes to retain the most valuable information, while can measure the structural information to control the size of subgraphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MeGuide in training various GNNs on multiple data sets.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, several image-based smart services have been widely used in our daily lives, generating many digital images. Since smart devices outsource digital images to the cloud, researchers prefer to select some desired targets from the massive images within the cloud for analysis and improve smart services. Therefore, protective image retrieval on the cloud has attained maximum concentration for privacy-preserving purposes, and the availability assurance of images on the cloud is also a crucial link. Ensuring image security and availability in the cloud environment and precisely preserving retrieval accuracy is comes as a utility-security dilemma while few existing works have explicitly addressed it. Therefore, this paper proposes privacy-preserving image retrieval in the distributed environment based on the combination of image encryption for similarity search and secret image sharing. On the basis of them, we define two-stage encryption. The first-stage encryption algorithm is introduced by modifying Wolfram&#39;s reversible cellular automata-based image encryption, which can create a set of processing images to ensure image security and retrieval accuracy. Then, the second-stage encryption algorithm is put forward based on secret image sharing to improve image security and availability. The color histogram could be extracted from the encrypted images for similarity retrieval, and the shadows could be extracted for similar image recovery. Security analysis demonstrates that image privacy and query privacy could be well protected. Moreover, the proposed work achieves more efficient performance for similarity search and similar image recovery compared with some recent works and realizes a reasonable retrieval accuracy on encrypted images for similarity search.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained widespread adoption in computer vision. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial example (AE) attacks, where an adversary introduces imperceptible perturbations to a test example for defrauding DNNs. The obstacles have urged intensive research on improving the DNN robustness via adversarial training, that is, the clean data set is blended with adversarial examples to carry out training. However, the adversarial example attack technologies are open-ended, and the adversarial training is insufficient to focus on improving robustness performance. To circumvent this limitation, we mitigate adversarial example attacks from another perspective, which aims at detecting adversarial examples. Feature autoencoder detector (FADetector), a novel defense framework that exploits feature knowledge is proposed. One of the hallmarks of FADetector is to not involve adversarial examples to train the detector. Our extensive evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets demonstrates that our defense outperforms the conventional autoencoder detectors in terms of detection accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Steganalysis is a detection technology against steganography that embeds secret data into digital media carriers. The selection channel, which indicates the embedding details of steganography, is well recognized in boosting the detection performance of image steganalysis. However, nearly all the selection channels are constructed in a hand-crafted manner, even when they are incorporated into end-to-end deep steganalytic networks, for which the embedding rate and steganographic algorithms also need to be predetermined. Such prior knowledge is usually assumed completely known in existing literature, which is obviously unreasonable and impractical. To address this issue, we propose to automatically learn the selection channels for deep learning-based image steganalysis in a progressive way. Specifically, we divide the image steganalysis task into two phases: selection channel estimation and steganalytic detection. For the first phase, we design a multistage progressive network, which enables the learning of selection channels in a coarse-to-fine fashion. For the second phase, we integrate the learned selection channels into the multilayers of the steganalytic network, allowing full exploitation of selection channels for accurate detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can learn the selection channels rapidly and precisely, and also significantly improve the detection accuracy of the existing state-of-the-art steganographic network without any prior knowledge.},

However, most searchable encryption models still use triples, in which hierarchical structures are neglected, and insecure intermediate nodes are exposed to external environment. Meanwhile, mainstream schemes adopting accurate retrieval are incompatible with IoT end users&#39; features of differentiation. To address these issues, we innovatively design an efficient and credible search model with an accurate multikeyword fuzzy ciphertext retrieval scheme in the context of IoT. First, based on network coding and key sharing, data are grouped, encoded, and transmitted in parallel to the receiver node through middle-layer nodes, with high efficiency and reliability. Second, to realize fuzzy retrieval of IoT, edit distance is selected as the standard of difference between keywords, and then document index vector and query vector are created based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and Bloom Filter. Furthermore, to improve the traditional scheme, query keywords are split into multiple single-word forms, inner products between each trapdoor of single word and encryption index vector are calculated, respectively, for the sum of each inner product and thus - sorting search. Ultimately, feasibility, safety, and efficiency of our improved scheme are verified by security analysis, while simulation results support that our scheme has better accuracy and efficiency.},

The choice of learning rates affects the convergence rate of SGD series optimization methods. Currently, learning rate adjustment strategies mainly face the following problems: (1) The traditional learning rate decay method mainly adopts manual manner during training iterations, the small learning rate produced from which causes slow convergence in training neural networks. (2) Adaptive method (e.g., Adam) has poor generalization performance. To alleviate the above issues, we propose a novel automatic learning rate decay strategy for SGD optimization methods in neural networks. On the basis of the observation that the convergence rate&#39;s upper bound enjoys minimization in a specific iteration concerning the current learning rate, we first present the expression of the current learning rate determined by historical learning rates. And merely one extra parameter is initialized to generate automatic decreasing learning rates during the training process. Our proposed approach is applied to SGD and Momentum SGD optimization algorithms, and concrete theoretical proof explains its convergence. Numerical simulations are conducted on the MNIST and Cifar-10 data sets with different neural networks. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms existing classical ones, achieving faster convergence rate, better stability, and generalization performance in neural network training.

However, the malware detection is still challenging, due to the ignore of the temporal correlation between malicious behaviors. In this study, we model the software behaviors with multiscaled API graph sequences to represent API-level behaviors as well as graph-level temporal behavior correlations. We then propose a novel Dynamic Evolving Graph Convolutional Network (DEGCN) model to capture dynamic evolving pattern of both local API-level and global graph-level software behaviors. In particular, we first extract the API-level (node) representations to capture the directed graph representations for each time slot. We then propose a Graph-encoding-based Gate Recurrent Unit (GGRU) network to capture the graph-level evolving features and their evolving status. The graph features of different time slots and different graph scales are concatenated to detect whether the software is benign or malicious.

As a novel component of CBE3, a scaling factor, which helps maintain a good balance between global model accuracy and convergence speed, is proposed to improve the algorithm&#39;s adaptability. Theoretically, we proved the regret bound of the proposed CBE3 algorithm, which demonstrates performance gaps between the CBE3 and the optimal choice. Empirically, extensive experiments conducted on Non-Independent Identically Distributed data demonstrate the superior performance of CBE3—with up to 10\% accuracy improvement compared with K-Center and Greedy and up to 100\% faster convergence compared with the Random algorithm.},

Second, by integrating the information theory and algebraic views under the multiperspective rough set model, multiview entropy measures are proposed to effectively measure the uncertainty in data. Moreover, a nonmonotonic feature selection algorithm based on the mutual information in the multiview entropy measures under the neutral perspective as the evaluation function of feature importance is designed to resolve the disadvantages of the algorithms based on the monotone evaluation function. Finally, Information Gain is introduced to preliminarily decrease the dimension of high-dimensional data sets to promote classification accuracy and reduce time consumption. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm is efficient in eliminating noise and increasing classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Many machine-learning-based intrusion detection methods have been proposed, however there is a lack of collaboration among these methods. Faced with a cascade of malicious behaviors and various running environments, coupled with the endless emergence of new malicious activities, it is difficult for us to choose an algorithm manually that is suitable for all scenarios. In addition, usually the binary detection models are applied that only “normal” or “abnormal” decision is made, and it is difficult for us to know how much confidence we have in the prediction model. In this study, we propose an intrusion collaborative detection framework (ICDF), an ICDF that allows heterogeneous detection models to effectively work together which have complementary expertise. A multialgorithm model ensemble learning method with confidence interval is adopted. In this process, each algorithm model only makes prediction judgments on its own credible probability interval and refuses to predict outside the interval. The final result is generated by voting based on the confidence of multiple models. Ten detection algorithms were tested on three different data sets. Compared with different single algorithms, ICDF could achieve high precision and recall rate, and the best F1 scores.},

For example, unmanned vehicles may be interfered with by adversaries in path planning, resulting in unmanned vehicles being unable to move according to the planned route, and even serious safety problems. On the other side, the portrait technology can extract highly refined characteristics of different attack strategies, so that unmanned vehicles can defend themselves based on the characteristics of each attack. Existing research lacks intelligent attack research on path planning in the field of unmanned vehicles, and lacks portraits of attack behaviors in this scenario. This paper combines multiagent reinforcement learning technology, time-series segmentation clustering technology, and knowledge graph technology to study the portrait technology of adversary intelligent attack behavior in the field of unmanned vehicle path planning. First, the simulation results of unmanned vehicle path planning are obtained, and the steps of adversary attack behavior are extracted by using Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering time-series segmentation cluster technology. Second, the knowledge graph is used to save the attack strategy, so as to form the attack behavior portrait of unmanned vehicle path planning. The test on the Neo4j platform shows that our method is universal, can effectively describe the attack steps for unmanned vehicle path planning, and provides the basis for attack detection to establish the defense system of unmanned vehicles.},

These models outperform other conventional fuzzy structures. The goal of this article is to develop some novel operational laws and “aggregation operators” (AOs) in a spherical fuzzy environment. For this goal, we define new neutral or fairly operational laws that incorporate the concept of proportional distribution to achieve a neutral or fair remedy of three indexes of spherical fuzzy numbers. Subsequently, we propose new “spherical fuzzy fairly weighted average operator” and “spherical fuzzy fairly ordered weighted averaging operator” based on suggested operational laws. The suggested AOs provide more generalized, reliable, and accurate information than other fuzzy techniques. Furthermore, a fairly multicriteria decision-making algorithm is developed using proposed fairly AOs with multiple decision-makers evaluations and partial weight information under SFSs.

However, the security and privacy of IoT and its devices have been challenged by malware, particularly polymorphic worms that rapidly self-propagate once being launched and vary their appearance over each infection to escape from the detection of signature-based intrusion detection systems. It is well recognized that polymorphic worms are one of the most intrusive threats to IoT security. To build an effective, strong defense for IoT networks against polymorphic worms, this study proposes a machine intelligent system, termed Gram-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (Gram-RBM), which automatically generates generic fingerprints/signatures for the polymorphic worm. Two augmented gram-based methods are designed and applied in the derivation of polymorphic worm sequences, also known as fingerprints/signatures. These derived sequences are then optimized using the Gaussian–Bernoulli RBM dimension-reduction algorithm. The results, gained from the experiments involved three different types of polymorphic worms, show that the system generates accurate fingerprints/signatures even under “noisy” conditions and outperforms related methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

Asset prices are affected by several random and nonrandom factors, which makes them difficult to forecast. This paper proposes a two-phase dynamic portfolio optimization approach. In the first phase, assets are clustered into buy, sell, and hold groups using technical indicators. We provide a methodology to integrate the investor attitude (optimistic, pessimistic, or neutral) during the clustering phase. In the second phase, we input the clustered groups into a portfolio optimization model to obtain the optimum asset allocations. We use coherent fuzzy numbers to model the asset returns to integrate the investor attitude in this phase. The optimization model is solved using a genetic algorithm. The portfolios are rebalanced at regular intervals as new data becomes available. We illustrate the proposed methodology on a 100-asset problem of the US stock market. We analyze the real-world performance of the obtained portfolios. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with the mean–variance model, and other portfolios, such as the naïve portfolio and the NASDAQ-100 index.},

To eliminate the negative impact of noisy channels and improve the utilization efficiency of deep features in DCF-based trackers, we present an adaptive feature channel selection method for robust visual tracking. Our method adaptively chooses the most discriminative channels to learn a more robust target appearance model, which is achieved by evaluating the energy relationship between background and foreground in each feature channel. Moreover, according to the feedback of channel selection, an adaptive model update strategy is proposed to alleviate the model degradation problem caused by incorrect model updating. Extensive experimental results obtained on five popular tracking benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its superiority over the state-of-the-art trackers.},

Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE) is a packet-switched core network solution for high-speed and high-quality end-to-end services which usually applied to the communication between intelligent systems. However, covert channels using inter-packet delays and packet order in VoLTE services are limited by specific rules. Since minor modifications to overt traffic can be detected, existing covert channel solutions cannot be directly applied to VoLTE. Therefore, this study presents a robust packet loss covert timing channel by cascade hash coding with intelligent system. To ensure robustness and undetectability, we design hash-based inter-codeword verification, codeword self-verification based on cyclic redundancy check, and adaptive mapping matrix. The sender modulates the covert messages according to the sequence number of the actively dropped packets, and the receiver can retrieve the covert messages using a specialized verification method. To evaluate undetectability, robustness, throughput, and construction costs, a large number of experiments in mobile intelligent terminals have been conducted. The experimental results prove that the proposed scheme is feasible for VoLTE communication, as the covert message is shown to be transmitted secretly, and the bit error and throughput are within acceptable ranges.},

First, an NABC model is designed. The model combines features and advantages of a parallel feature extraction network (PFEN), a bidirectional gate recurrent unit (BiGRU), and the attention mechanism (ATT). The PFEN module is composed of parallel sparse autoencoders which extract key data from different network attack behaviors. The BiGRU module gets the time-series relationship from the state of three different time periods, finds potential representation rules from network attack behaviors. The ATT module pays more attention to the network traffic key information and improves the NABC accuracy. Second, the NABC detects and classifies attacks from network behaviors, the occurrence number of each attack behavior, and the error probability matrix are counted. Finally, the occurrence number of each attack behavior is corrected according to the error probability matrix, and the network security situation value is calculated through combining the severity factor of each attack behavior. The experimental results show that the precision and recall of the NABC model are improved by 5.28\% and 5.65\%, respectively, compared with the conventional method. The comparison experiment with the classical situation assessment method also proves that the proposed method can assess the overall situation of network security more effectively and comprehensively.},

However, for non-PoW consensus (e.g., proof-of-stake and delegated proof-of-stake consensus) blockchain systems, a different approach to introducing entropy, such as the distributed random number generation (dRNG) algorithm, must be established. The dRNG algorithm is one of the key challenges in developing the consensus mechanism, as well as one of the relevant parameters for determining the merit of the consensus mechanism. In this paper, we first derive a publicly verifiable quantum random numbers generation protocol based on the certifiable randomness scheme from any untrusted quantum device, which offers features, such as fairness, no trusted third party, and publicly verifiable. Then, based on verifiable quantum random numbers, we propose a new consensus algorithm. The algorithm selects block proposer and block verification committees for each round using verifiable quantum random numbers, resulting in better randomness, fairness, and efficiency of the entire consensus process. In addition, the new consensus algorithm is not only resistant to adaptive adversary models as well as to collusion attacks, but also requires negligible computation for each user to avoid unnecessary consumption of power resources. Finally, we analyze the verifiable randomness, fairness, liveness, and communication complexity of the consensus algorithm.},

We also introduce an end-to-end approach based on generative flows to approximate the posterior distribution of time series with exact likelihoods. Our model is powerful as adding stochasticity to different factors (e.g., reservoir capacity and water-flow measurements) and thus overcomes the expressiveness limitations of deterministic prediction methods.

  abstract     = {In recent years, it has been difficult for multilabel classification to obtain complete multilabel data in real-world applications, and even a large number of labels for training samples are randomly missed. As a result, the classification task of incomplete multilabel data with missing labels faces formidable challenges. This paper presents a two-stage-neighborhood-based multilabel classification method for incomplete data with missing labels in neighborhood decision systems. First, to solve the problem of selecting the neighborhood radius manually, as well as balancing the samples in the neighborhood, the neighborhood radius based on the feature distribution function is defined, and the differences and similarities between samples through the identifiable and indiscernible matrices are, respectively, computed. Then, a restoration method for missing feature values is proposed for use in the first stage. Second, to consider the nonlinear relationship among features, a neighborhood-based fuzzy similarity relationship between samples is investigated based on the Gaussian kernel function. By integrating the fuzzy similarity relationship matrix, label-specific feature matrix, and label correlation matrix, an objective function based on the regression model is presented, the optimal solutions to the label-specific feature and label correlation matrices based on the gradient descent strategy are provided, and a new multilabel classification method with missing labels is developed during the second stage. Finally, two-stage multilabel classification algorithms are designed. Experiments on 18 multilabel data sets demonstrate that our designed algorithms are effective not only for recovering missing feature values, but also for improving the classification performance of data with missing labels.},

  abstract     = {Supplier selection is vital for enterprises to operate stably and achieve and sustain a competitive advantage. However, from the initial establishment to the gradual development and maturity of the enterprise, the supplier selection criteria change dynamically, and decision-makers are hardly in agreement in each stage, which creates challenges for enterprises when choosing suitable suppliers. As such, this paper proposes a multicriteria group decision-making method based on an interaction and feedback mechanism (IFM) and rung orthopair fuzzy sets theory. We introduce an IFM to achieve consensus among different decision-makers. We then develop the rung orthopair fuzzy weighted partitioned Bonferroni mean (ROFWPBM) operator to address the aggregation problem of dynamic multicriteria. A group decision-making algorithm combining the IFM and ROFWPBM operator is proposed to analyze the Hongxing Erke supplier selection. The results show that the proposed method can not only account for large differences of opinion among decision-makers during group decision-making but also consider the dynamic changes of supplier selection criteria in different stages of enterprise development and help enterprises choose suppliers suitable for their own development characteristics.},

However, in a real situation, as the network structure changes, connectivity becomes a dynamically variational parameter, and its changing will affect other parameters to make corresponding changes. In this study, we treat all parameters as a complex system that restricts each other, consider their mutual constraints from a geometric point of view, and apply high-dimensional surfaces to characterize their relationships. Seven network parameters including toughness and binding number are considered, and the concrete expression form of the surfaces in several specific settings are obtained.

  abstract     = {The need for energy sources in India has increased abnormally in recent years due to industrial and societal growth. To meet this demand, it was a necessary choice of renewable energy sources (RESs) as a solution to lack of nonrenewable energy sources. Due to the multiplicity of involved factors, selecting the most appropriate RESs is a multiattribute decision making (MADM) problem. There is a large number of work associated with the development of MADM techniques, especially under ambiguous and uncertain conditions. However, the effective embedding of uncertainty and ambiguity and in decision-making remains a difficult challenge, and thus this study introduces a new framework for solving the problem of selecting the most suitable RESs which is based on the neutrosophic set and TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision-making) method. It also reduces human intervention by being systematically applied. First, it transforms the linguistic terms presented into neutrosophic values and implements systematic techniques to compute missing values in the decision matrix using the case-based technique. Second, it calculates the weight of every linguistic variable as well as those of the decision-makers (DMs) and weighted attributes. Furthermore, it creates an aggregated single valued neutrosophic decision matrix for DMs. Finally, it calculates the overall dominance-degree matrix, derives the overall values, and ranks the alternatives. It is applied to select RESs in Karnataka, India, and the obtained results show that wind energy is the most suitable RES for India, with small hydroenergy second most appropriate.},

  abstract     = {Cross-view vehicle Reidentification (ReID) has attracted widespread attention as an increasingly important vision task in intelligent transportation and urban surveillance. Benefiting from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), recent studies have promoted the development of vehicle ReID by extracting discriminative local features. However, two fundamental challenges of small interclass discrepancy caused by different views and large intraclass distance caused by similar appearance still hinder the performance of cross-view vehicle ReID. In this paper, a novel View-aware Sphere Learning Network (VSLN) is proposed to alleviate the above issues while maintaining the merits of CNN-based approaches to generate view-aware sphere-based features. First, a Sphere Feature Embedding Network (SFEN) is proposed to constrain the images into hypersphere for extracting sphere features. On the other hand, this study presents a sphere similarity triple loss to help SFEN concentrate more on robust and discriminative vehicle parts. Second, since the vehicle images are usually captured from different viewpoints, this study further extends SFEN by introducing a Vehicle Viewpoint Predictor (VVP) combined with global attention mechanism to enlarge the discrepancy of interclass and shorten the distance of intraclass. Moreover, a city-scale data set, named Vehicle from Different Viewpoints, containing image-level viewpoint labels, is collected for training VVP. As a result, the proposed VLSN can achieve 96.31\% Top-1 accuracy and 79.46\% Top-1 accuracy on VeRi-776 and VRIC data sets, respectively. Overall, extensive experimental results on two benchmark data sets show that the proposed VSLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive disorder where a large number of brain cells and their connections degenerate and die, eventually destroy the memory and other important mental functions that affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior. Not a single test can effectively determine AD; however, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to observe the decrease in size of different areas (mainly temporal and parietal lobes). This paper proposes an integrative deep ensemble learning framework to obtain better predictive performance for AD diagnosis. Unlike DenseNet, we present a multiresolutional ensemble PartialNet tailored to Alzheimer detection using brain MRIs. PartialNet incorporates the properties of identity mappings, diversified depth as well as deep supervision, thus, considers feature reuse that in turn results in better learning. Additionally, the proposed ensemble PartialNet demonstrates better characteristics in terms of vanishing gradient, diminishing forward flow with better training time, and a low number of parameters compared with DenseNet. Experiments performed on benchmark AD neuroimaging initiative data set that showed considerable performance gain (2 +\%) and (1.2 +\%) for multiclass and binary class in AD detection in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, traffic forecasting has gradually attracted attention in data mining because of the increasing availability of large-scale traffic data. However, it faces substantial challenges of complex temporal-spatial correlations in traffic. Recent studies mainly focus on modeling the local spatial correlations by utilizing graph neural networks and neglect the influence of long-distance spatial correlations. Besides, most existing works utilize recurrent neural networks-based encoder–decoder architecture to forecast multistep traffic volume and suffer from accumulative errors in recurrent neural networks. To deal with these issues, we propose the memory attention (MA) enhanced graph convolution long short-term memory network (MAEGCLSTM), a novel deep learning model for traffic forecasting. Specifically, MAEGCLSTM combines the MA and the vanilla graph convolution long short-term memory to capture global and local spatio-temporal dependencies, respectively. Then MAEGCLSTM utilizes a simplified GCLSTM to effectively fuse the global and local information. Moreover, we integrate the MAEGCLSTM into an encoder–decoder architecture to forecast multistep traffic volume. Besides MAEGCLSTM, we add the convolution neural network and encoder–decoder attention into the decoder to ease accumulative errors caused by iterative prediction and gain whole historical information from the encoder. Experiments on four real-world traffic data sets show that our model significantly outperforms by up to improvement in measure over 14 baselines.},

  abstract     = {Optimization algorithms with momentum have been widely used for building deep learning models because of the fast convergence rate. Momentum helps accelerate Stochastic gradient descent in relevant directions in parameter updating, minifying the oscillations of the parameters update route. The gradient of each step in optimization algorithms with momentum is calculated by a part of the training samples, so there exists stochasticity, which may bring errors to parameter updates. In this case, momentum placing the influence of the last step to the current step with a fixed weight is obviously inaccurate, which propagates the error and hinders the correction of the current step. Besides, such a hyperparameter can be extremely hard to tune in applications as well. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization algorithm, namely, iscriminative wight on daptive omentum (DEAM). Instead of assigning the momentum term weight with a fixed hyperparameter, DEAM proposes to compute the momentum weight automatically based on the discriminative angle. The momentum term weight will be assigned with an appropriate value that configures momentum in the current step. In this way, DEAM involves fewer hyperparameters. DEAM also contains a novel backtrack term, which restricts redundant updates when the correction of the last step is needed. The backtrack term can effectively adapt the learning rate and achieve the anticipatory update as well. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEAM can achieve a faster convergence rate than the existing optimization algorithms in training the deep learning models of both convex and nonconvex situations.},

To address the problem of inappropriate information included between images and texts, we propose two cross-modal recovery techniques established on a dual-branch neural network defined on a common subspace and the hashing learning method. First, a cross-modal recovery technique established on a multilabel information deep ranking model (MIDRM) is provided. In this method, we introduce a triplet-loss function into the dual-branch neural network model. This function takes advantage of the semantic information of the bimodal components, focusing on not only the similarities between similar images and text features but also the distances between dissimilar images and texts. Second, we establish a new cross-modal hashing technique said to be the deep regularized hashing constraint (DRHC). In this method, the regularized function is used to replace the binary constraint, and the discrete value is constrained to a certain numerical range so that the network can achieve end-to-end training. Overall, the time complexity is greatly improved, and the occupied storage space is also greatly reduced. Different experiments on our proposed MIDRM and DRHC models demonstrate their superior performance to those of the state-of-the-art methods on two widely used data sets. The experimental results show that our approach also increases the mean average precision of cross-modal recovery.},

The significant contributions and rapid developments of advanced artificial intelligence-based technologies and approaches, like, machine learning and deep learning, which are applied for extracting accurate information from extensive data, perform a potential role in IoT applications. Moreover, blockchain technology&#39;s fast adoption also contributes a significant role in the development of the new digital smart city ecosystem. Thus, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology convergence revolutionize smart city infrastructures to establish sustainable ecosystems for IoT applications. Nevertheless, these advancements and technological improvements also provide both opportunities and challenges for developing sustainable IoT applications. This paper aims to examine the convergence of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, a unique driver towards technological transformation in intelligent and sustainable IoT applications. We mainly discussed the advantages of blockchain technology that might promote the advancement and development of sustainable IoT applications. On the basis of the discussion, we introduced a smart and sustainable conceptual framework that leverages cloud computing, IoT devices, and artificial intelligence to process and obtain necessary information.

  abstract     = {Despite their tremendous success in various machine learning tasks, deep neural networks (DNNs) are inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are maliciously crafted inputs to cause DNNs to misbehave. Intensive research has been conducted on this phenomenon in simple tasks (e.g., image classification). However, little is known about this adversarial vulnerability for object detection, a much more complicated task, which often requires specialized DNNs and multiple additional components. In this paper, we present DS, a uniform platform for robustness analysis of object detection models. Currently, DS implements 13 representative adversarial attacks with 7 utility metrics and 13 defenses on 18 standard object detection models. Leveraging DS, we conduct the first rigorous evaluation of adversarial attacks on the state-of-the-art object detection models. We analyze the impact of the factors including DNN architecture and capacity on the model robustness. We show that many conclusions about adversarial attacks and defenses in image classification tasks do not transfer to object detection tasks, for example, the targeted attack is stronger than the untargeted attack for two-stage detectors. Our findings will aid future efforts in understanding and defending against adversarial attacks in complicated tasks. In addition, we compare the robustness of different detection models and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. The platform DS will be open source as a unique facility for further research on adversarial attacks and defenses in object detection tasks.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial examples pose many security threats to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Most defense algorithms prevent these threats by finding differences between the original images and adversarial examples. However, the found differences do not contain features about the classes, so these defense algorithms can only detect adversarial examples without recovering the correct labels. In this regard, we propose the Adversarial Feature Genome (AFG), a novel type of data that contain both the differences and features about classes. This method is inspired by an observed phenomenon, namely, the Adversarial Feature Separability, where the difference between the feature maps of the original images and adversarial examples becomes larger with deeper layers. On top of that, we further develop an adversarial example recognition framework that detects adversarial examples and can recover the correct labels. In the experiments, the detection and classification of adversarial examples by AFGs has an accuracy of more than 90.01\% in various attack scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first method that focuses on both attack detecting and recovering. AFG gives a new data-driven perspective to improve the robustness of CNNs.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the emergency group decision-making problem based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy language sets (IVPFLSs). The frequent occurrence of emergency events can bring huge economic damage to human beings. To reduce the loss, it is very important to make reasonable emergency decisions effectively and timely. In the emergency decision making (EDM), these problems are few studied, such as high dimension problem, data nonlinearity, and correlation. For EDM problems, the advantage of IVPFLSs is that it can reasonably express the evaluation information given by decision makers (DMs) through both qualitative and quantitative aspects. However, if the dimension and nonlinear relationship of the decision data keep growing, and the traditional decision-making methods will fail. The distance measure between decision data is necessary to calculate in the process of dimensionality reduction, and the current research does not propose the definition of IVPFLSs distance measure. On the basis of this, this paper first uses the attributes and DMs as variables to define the standard Euclidean distance measure between IVPFLSs. For nonlinear features, we construct the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy language kernel principal component analysis (IVPFL-KPCA) model to reduce the dimensionality. What is more, we also obtain the reasonable weight vectors of the attribute and DMs from cumulative contribution rate. For low-dimensional decision data, according to the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution method, the best emergency plan is selected for the information variables after dimensionality reduction. In sum, the IVPFL-KPCA model not only avoids multicollinearity and nonlinear separability between decision data, but also obtains reasonable weights. It further improves the efficiency of decision-making operations and reduces the difficulty of the algorithm. Finally, an example of earthquake emergency plan is shown to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method. Besides, we also compare it with the existing methods, which proves the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {Network function virtualization is a promising technology for providing personalized services via agile service function chains (SFCs). Flexible SFC orchestration and rational resource allocation are pivotal for improving the SFC&#39;s quality of service (QoS). However, the requirements for computational load and resources have frequently been changing. Consequently, static resource allocation can result in resource insufficiency when SFCs turn busy and resource waste due to resource overplus when SFCs are idle. Since a dynamic resource allocation is necessary, the existing dynamic resource allocation methods&#39; responses have often been delayed. This paper proposes an SFC active reconfiguration mechanism (SARM) based on computational load and resource demand. The SARM predicts nodes&#39; computation loads and SFCs&#39; resource demands and uses these predictions to estimate future QoS and develop the SFC reconfiguration strategy. The SARM considers multiple factors and applies a heuristic algorithm to achieve the tradeoff between migration cost and QoS preservation. The experiments demonstrate that the SARM can effectively predict the nodes&#39; load and the resource demand of SFCs. In addition, the SARM can successfully identify the SFCs to reconfigure and reduce the QoS maintenance costs. The simulation results indicate that the average delays of the SFCs can be reduced by at least 26\%.},

An polar fuzzy set (mPFS) is the strong model to express multipolarity with membership grades (MGs) in the unit closed interval . A rung orthopair fuzzy set (qROFS) is the strong model to express vague and uncertain information with MGs and nonmembership grades (NMGs). The notion of rung orthopair polar fuzzy set is a new hybrid extension of both mPFS and qROFS. An ROmPFS is a generalized concept that has the ability to deal with multipolarity with ordered pairs of MGs and NMGs. Motivated by these robust concepts, in this article, various aggregation operators (AOs) for the aggregation of rung orthopair polar fuzzy numbers are proposed, including rung orthopair polar fuzzy weighted averaging operator, symmetric rung orthopair polar fuzzy weighted averaging operator, rung orthopair polar fuzzy weighted geometric operator, symmetric rung orthopair polar fuzzy weighted geometric operator, and -rung orthopair polar fuzzy Maclaurin symmetric mean operator. On the basis of proposed AOs, a robust multicriteria decision-making approach is proposed. An application of proposed AOs is presented to address economic crises during COVID-19. Furthermore, the comparison analysis is designed to discuss the validity and rationality of proposed AOs.},

The continuous growth of scientific publications has brought challenges to track the development trends of scientific research topics. The existing topic trend prediction methods have proved that the research topic trend of a publication is influenced by other peer publications. However, they ignore the fact that the research topics of different publications belong to different research topic space. Moreover, the existing topic prediction methods do not fully consider the interactive influence among publications that the research topic of one publication affects the topics of other publications, it is also influenced by the research topics of other publications. In line with this, this paper proposes a scientific research topic trend prediction model based on multi-long short-term memory (multi-LSTM) and Graph Convolutional Network. Specifically, multiple LSTMs are employed to map research topics of different publications into their respective topic space. Then, the graph convolutional neural network is applied to learn the scientific influence context of each publication, so that the research topic of each publication not only integrates the influence of neighbor nodes, but also considers the influence of the neighbors of the neighbor node on the research topic of the publication, so as to more accurately fuse scientific influence context of research topic of peer publications. Experiments results on the data set of scientific research papers in the field of artificial intelligence and data mining demonstrate that the model improves the prediction precision and achieves the state-of-the-art research topic trend prediction effect compared with the other baseline models.},

Moreover, this proposed penalty overcomes the drawback of a traditional network penalty without considering the sign of the coefficient. the model can now consider the noise level in gene expression data, lower the impact of high noise samples in data to model training, and provide better prediction accuracy. We compare the proposed method with six alternative approaches in various experimental scenarios, including a comprehensive simulation, four benchmark gene expression datasets, one lung cancer data set, and three lung cancer validation sets. Results show that SLNL can identify fewer meaningful biomarkers and obtain the best or equivalent prediction performance. Moreover, biological analysis shows that the genes selected by the SLNL might be helpful to tumor diagnosis and treatment.},

Fortunately, secure wildcard pattern matching with query (SWMQ) extends standard secure WPM by allowing the pattern holder to obtain the matched positions and the actual data, which has important applications in many scenarios, such as electronic healthcare and gene matching. This also motivates the research of SWMQ in this paper. In this study, we focus on the efficient construction of SWMQ in the semihonest adversary setting. First, we propose two new primitives, hereafter referred to as shared wildcard pattern matching (Sh-WPM) and choice-sharing oblivious transfer (CSOT). Furthermore, we propose an SWMQ protocol via Shared WPM and CSOT. In addition, we evaluate the performance of SWMQ. More specifically, the running time in local area network and wide area network settings is less than 0.4 and 2 s, respectively, when the text length is and the pattern length is . In fact, our evaluation results suggest that SWMQ is not only more broadly functional, but also comparable in efficiency to state-of-the-art approaches.},

To improve the driving behaviors recognition accuracy and robustness, we propose an algorithm based on oft Thresholding and emporal onvolutional etwork (S-TCN) for driving behavior recognition. In this algorithm, we first introduce a soft attention mechanism to learn the importance of different sensors. The TCN has the advantages of small memory requirement and high computational efficiency. And the soft thresholding can further filter the redundant features and extract the main features. So, we fuse the TCN and soft thresholding to improve the model&#39;s stability and accuracy. Our proposed model is extensively evaluated on four real public data sets.

  abstract     = {Clothing attribute prediction is a fundamental image classification task in the field of computer vision. Motivated by the human recognition system, we investigate the task relationship and spatial importance where people usually utilize these useful clues to assist in recognizing clothing attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel Holistic Relation Network (HRNet) for clothing attribute recognition, considering the fusion of multiple relations, including spatial and spatial relation via a spatial relation module, spatial and task relation via a task attention module, and task and task relation via a graph context reasoning module. Specifically, we first use the backbone network to extract features from the input image, two types of attention models followed will further learn the features, then the graph context reasoning module will be used to further enhance the features, and finally, a classifier exploited to classify the clothing attributes with the learned representation information. Without using manual image feature filtering methods, this paper aims to achieve clothing attribute recognition by deeply exploring the relationships among different clothing attribute recognition tasks. In this paper, we use double-branches of the attention model to model the relevance of spatial context information and learn more discriminative feature representations from multitask features for clothing attribute prediction. Derived from the prior knowledge learned from the two above-mentioned attention models, we further propose a graph-relation model constructing relationships among different clothing attribute tasks by integrating the spatial association relationships among multitask. The proposed HRNet only uses image-level annotation but it owns a good ability for obtaining distinguishing feature representations. We obtain state-of-the-art performance, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments on three mainstream benchmarks, for example, woman clothing data set, man clothing data set, and shop-domain clothing data set.},

  abstract     = {As international trade has been developing at an unprecedented rate, export product competitiveness is significant in a country&#39;s trade system. At present, neural network algorithms are extensively used in economic forecasting. Scholars have verified the effectiveness of neural networks, especially long short term memory (LSTM) model, compared with other nonlinear prediction methods. However, there are still research blanks in forecasting economic indicators related to export product competitiveness, and there is little research on the improved LSTM model combined with other algorithms. To address this limitation, this article established a quantitative index system for export product competitiveness composed of four highly recognized indicators such as revealed comparative advantage index, net export revealed comparative advantage index, international market share index, and economic value added. After collecting the relevant economic data, the single LSTM model was used to predict the future trend of China&#39;s machinery and equipment export product competitiveness. Based on the shortcomings exposed in applying single LSTM prediction, the article innovatively designs a combined forecast model of LSTM and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, and whose effectiveness and superiority are proved by the mean square error value. Finally, the article points out that this model plays an important role in national trade policy making. It is optimistic about the development of deep learning in international trade product competitiveness indicators prediction.},

  abstract     = {Fall is a major threat to stroke survivors with the problems of gait and balance disorders in the rehabilitation phase following severe consequences on quality of life and a heavy burden to their families. Many solutions have been proposed to assess fall risk for elders based on inertial sensor-based signals, however, there still exists a great challenge of transferring them from elderly populations to the stroke-survivors populations as gait disorder patterns are significant difference between elders and stroke survivors. In this study, we conduct a pilot study to collect inertial sensor-based signals from stroke survivors when they performed the timed up and go test, and build an automatic fall risk assessment model with the architecture of Siamese network, with a merit of mitigating the problem of small sample size. Specifically, the proposed automatic fall risk assessment model consists of two parallel convolutional neural networks, each of which is composed of three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers. To utilize the space relation among accelerator-based and gyroscope-based signals, two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform extracts image-like features, wavelet coefficients, from inertial sensor-based signals as the input. Experimental results show that the proposed fall risk assessment model has achieved a promising results, which outperform cutting-edge methods with a big margin. The proposed fall risk assessment model with low computational complexity and limited memory consuming can be deployed on an embedded system to provide fall risk assessment service for stroke survivors in point-of-care environments or community settings.},

  abstract     = {Finding Nash equilibrium in the domain of imperfect information games as a challenging problem has received much attention. Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) is a popular model-free machine learning algorithm and has computed approximate Nash equilibrium on such games. However, the deep reinforcement learning method used to approximate the best response in NFSP requires reaching a fully observable Markov state, while the states in imperfect information games are partially observable and non-Markovian, which results in a poor approximation of the best response. Thus, NFSP needs more iterations to converge. In this study, we present a new reinforcement learning method that is inspired by counterfactual regret minimization to relax the Markov requirement by iteratively updating policy according to the regret matching process. Combining this new reinforcement learning algorithm with fictitious play, we further present a novel algorithm to find approximate Nash equilibrium in zero-sum imperfect information games. Experimental results in three benchmark games show that this new algorithm can find approximate Nash equilibrium effectively and converge much faster compared with baseline.},

Here, we analyze 40 MLC data sets by using 50 meta features describing different properties of the data. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, the most prominent meta features that describe the space of MLC data sets are the ones assessing different aspects of the label space. Second, the meta models show that the most important meta features describe the label space, and, the meta features describing the relationships among the labels tend to occur a bit more often than the meta features describing the distributions between and within the individual labels.

CLBFV defines the error tolerance property for authenticated communication, which allows a tolerance threshold for the messages that are unable to pass authentication. In addition, our proposed scheme is proved to be secure and existentially unforgeable under the chosen message attack and fuzzy identity attack in the random oracle model.

In this novel method, the joint class metric and sparse representation regularized DBN is considered as a pretraining method to extract data features. It combines advantages of both class metric and sparse representation, which can optimize the distance of features in the same class and penalize the distance of features in different classes, and generate sparse features. Specifically, a new metric matrix is constructed to avoid using the same structural parameters for the local structure of each sample. The J-DBN-based fault diagnosis is implemented by the pretraining learning method, which contributes to better classification capabilities. Finally, gearbox and bearing fault diagnosis experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method. The results show that the ability of the J-DBN method to extract features is significantly enhanced, and the clustering of features of the same data is more obvious; furthermore, the proposed method has higher diagnostic accuracy than other fault diagnosis methods.},

Therefore, person Re-ID has been widely used in the field of video surveillance. However, person Re-ID still suffers from a series of challenges, such as illumination changes, pose variations, and occlusions. Although the person Re-ID methods based on attention mechanism give an effective and feasible solution for the above challenges, attention mechanism may make a network focus too much on the most salient discriminative features and ignore other potential discriminative features. To solve this problem, we propose a two-level salient feature complementary network (TSFC-Net) to extract the most salient discriminative features and the secondary salient discriminative features of pedestrian images for person Re-ID. Specifically, TSFC-Net first extracts the most salient discriminative features of pedestrian images by embedding the spatial and channel attention modules in the backbone network, and then extracts the secondary salient discriminative features of pedestrian images by a secondary salient feature mining module (SSFM). Since the final features of pedestrian images fuse the most salient discriminative features and the secondary salient discriminative features, TSFC-Net can significantly improve the richness and discrimination capability of pedestrian representations. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments on the Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03 data sets, and the experimental results indicate that our TSFC-Net has a better performance compared with most of the state-of-the-art person Re-ID methods.},

However, the effect of parameter remains unchanged for all the input values. In this study, we generalize further the condition of abstract homogeneity by introducing -homogeneity, which is defined with respect to a family of functions, enabling a different behavior for each of the inputs. Next, we study the properties that are satisfied by this family of functions and, moreover, we link this concept with the condition of directional monotonicity, which is a trendy property in the framework of aggregation functions. To achieve that, we generalize directional monotonicity by directional monotonicity, which is defined with respect to a family of functions and a family of vectors .

  abstract     = {Person reidentification (P-Reid) is an emerging research domain in the field of information retrieval that has gained exponential growth due to its wide range of applications in pedestrian tracking and crime prevention. The primary goal of P-Reid is to recognize a person based on previous appearance in multiview surveillance videos. The mainstream approaches apply fully supervised learning techniques that have poor scalability when deployed in complex real-world scenes, due to the overfitting problem, caused by the lack of sufficient annotated data. Further, optimization of these models for unlabeled data in real-time surveillance is a challenging task. To tackle these issues, an intelligent framework (LR-Net) is proposed, consisting of three tiers including fine-tuning (FT), siamese network (SN), and fusion strategy (FS). In the first tier, a deep learning model is fine-tuned for P-Reid that can handle both labeled and unlabeled data. Next, with the assistance of transfer learning, an SN is proposed that has a strong discriminative capability in terms of similarity between a pair of images. Finally, a learning-to-rank strategy is applied to optimize the learning capability of the SN, in which a triplet network extracts spatial-temporal patterns from unlabeled samples. In addition, a bayesian fusion model (BFM) is introduced to integrate the spatiotemporal and visual features, which yields 4.4\%, 9.3\%, and 0.8\% improvement in the matching score over Market-1501, DukeMCMT-reID, and CUHK03 data sets, respectively. The conducted experiments and ablation study on the benchmark data sets empirically validate the proposed system, which obtains a high Rank-1 score as compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based recommendation has recently attracted significant attention in the recommender system community. Although current studies propose various GCNs to improve recommendation performance, existing methods suffer from two main limitations. First, user–item interaction data is generally sparse in practice, highlighting these methods&#39; ineffectiveness in learning user and item feature representations. Second, they usually perform a dot-product operation to model and calculate user preferences on items, leading to inaccurate user preference learning. To address these limitations, this study adopts a design idea that sharply differs from existing works. Specifically, we introduce the knowledge distillation concept into GCN-based recommendation and propose a two-phase knowledge distillation model (TKDM) improving recommendation performance. In Phase I, a self-distillation method on a graph auto-encoder learns the user and item feature representations. This auto-encoder employs a simple two-layer GCN as an encoder and a fully connected layer as a decoder. On this basis, in Phase II, a mutual-distillation method on a fully connected layer is introduced to learn user preferences on items with triple-based Bayesian personalized ranking. Extensive experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate that TKDM outperforms classic and state-of-the-art methods related to GCN-based recommendation problems.},

However, privacy leakage remains an issue. This paper proposes xMK-CKKS, an improved version of the MK-CKKS multi-key homomorphic encryption protocol, to design a novel privacy-preserving federated learning scheme. In this scheme, model updates are encrypted via an aggregated public key before sharing with a server for aggregation. For decryption, a collaboration among all participating devices is required. Our scheme prevents privacy leakage from publicly shared model updates in federated learning and is resistant to collusion between participating devices and the server. The evaluation demonstrates that the scheme outperforms other innovations in communication and computational cost while preserving model accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Estimating human poses from a video is at the foundation of many visual intelligent systems. Various convolutional neural networks have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance on different image datasets. However, most existing approaches are image based, which deliver unreliable estimations on videos since they fail to model temporal consistency across video frames. Recently, another line of work leverages temporal cues for multi-frame person pose estimation, yet still in an instance-unaware fashion, disregarding the specific traits of different instances (persons) or different joints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn specific keypoint motion representations for each person, termed Personalized Motion-Aware Network (PMAN). In the PMAN, we devise three components: (i) an Instance-Sensitive Extractor that adaptively computes the spatial features according to human physical characteristics; (ii) a Keypoint Motion Encoder that separately generates convolution kernels with fine-grained keypoint motion encoding; (iii) a Motion Driven Decoder that parses multi-frame spatial features of the same person to provide precise human pose estimations. Extensive experiments on PoseTrack2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets demonstrate that our approach greatly improves the performance of multi-frame human pose estimation. It is worth mentioning that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art method by +1.7 mAP and achieves 82.9 mAP on PoseTrack2017 dataset.},

  abstract     = {As an effective global optimization technique, artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has become one of the hottest research topics in the fields of evolutionary algorithms. However, the solution search equation is not rotationally invariant, which causes the problem that the performance of ABC is sensitive to the coordinate system. Although many improved ABC variants have been developed, they rarely considered the problem. Hence, to solve the problem, we propose a new ABC variant with bi-coordinate systems (BSABC), including the original coordinate system and the eigen coordinate system. The two coordinate systems own different characteristics: (1) the former one aims to maintain the population diversity, and (2) the latter one is to adapt the search to the fitness landscape of the problems. Based on the characteristics, in the BSABC, the two coordinate systems are used in the employed bee phase and onlooker bee phase, respectively. Meanwhile, two new solution search equations are designed by utilizing the elite information, and they are respectively performed in the two coordinate systems to further improve the algorithm performance. As another contribution of this study, in the scout bee phase, the multivariate Gaussian distribution is constructed to replace the original method to generate offspring, which is helpful to save the search experience. The performance of the BSABC is verified by extensive experiments on the CEC2013 test suite and one real-world optimization problem, and four well-established ABC variants and three other evolutionary algorithms are included in the performance comparison. The comparison results confirm that the BSABC shows competitive performance by achieving better results on the majority of test functions.},

The current mainstream methods for image classification of digestive tract endoscopy images are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, due to their inherent defects, CNNs are not strong enough in learning deformation-invariant global features which is essential in gastrointestinal endoscopic image classification. To solve this problem, in this paper we present a two-stage endoscopic image classification method which can effectively combine complementary advantages of midlevel CNN features and a capsule network. Specifically, the core of our method is a lesion-aware CNN feature extraction module which can encode sufficiently detailed information of lesions in midlevel CNN features and in turn enable the subsequent capsule classification network to effectively learn deformation-invariant relationships between image entities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art methods with the classification accuracy of 94.83\% on the Kvasir v2 data set and the classification accuracy of 85.99\% on the HyperKvasir data set.},

  abstract     = {Software similarity in different programming codes is a rapidly evolving field because of its numerous applications in software development, software cloning, software plagiarism, and software forensics. Currently, software researchers and developers search cross-language open-source repositories for similar applications for a variety of reasons, such as reusing programming code, analyzing different implementations, and looking for a better application. However, it is a challenging task because each programming language has a unique syntax and semantic structure. In this paper, a novel tool called Cross-Language Software Similarity (CroLSSim) is designed to detect similar software applications written in different programming codes. First, the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) features are collected from different programming codes. These are high-quality features that can show the abstract view of each program. Then, Methods Description (MDrep) in combination with AST is used to examine the relationship among different method calls. Second, the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency approach is used to retrieve the local and global weights from AST-MDrep features. Third, the Latent Semantic Analysis-based features extraction and selection method is proposed to extract the semantic anchors in reduced dimensional space. Fourth, the Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based features extraction method is proposed to mine the deep features. Finally, a hybrid deep learning model of CNN-Long-Short-Term Memory is designed to detect semantically similar software applications from these latent variables. The data set contains approximately 9.5K Java, 8.8K C#, and 7.4K C++ software applications obtained from GitHub. The proposed approach outperforms as compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In crowdsourcing scenarios, we can often obtain each instance&#39;s multiple noisy labels from different crowd workers and then use a label integration method to infer its integrated label. In spite of the effectiveness of label integration methods, a certain level of label noise still exists in integrated labels. To reduce the impact of label noise, noise correction has attracted much attention from researchers, and therefore a certain number of noise correction methods were proposed in recent years. Among them, Between-class Margin-based Noise Correction (BMNC) has demonstrated remarkable denoising performance. However, BMNC can only handle binary classification tasks. For multiclass classification tasks, we propose an effective but very simple noise correction method in this paper. We refer to our proposed method as Label Distribution-based Noise Correction (LDNC). At first, LDNC transforms each instance&#39;s multiple noisy labels into a label distribution. Then, LDNC uses the margin between the first- and second-largest label probabilities in the label distribution to identify and filter each possible noise instance and thus obtains a clean set and a noise set. Finally, LDNC builds a classifier on the clean set to relabel all instances in the noise set. The experimental results on 16 simulated and one real-world multiclass crowdsourced data sets show that LDNC significantly outperforms all the other existing state-of-the-art noise correction methods.},

  abstract     = {Data stream mining has recently emerged in response to the rapidly increasing continuous data generation. While the majority of Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) rule induction algorithms have proved to be successful in producing both accurate and comprehensive classification models in nonstreaming (batch) settings, currently ACO-based algorithms for classification problems are not suited to be applied to data stream mining. One of the main challenges is the iterative nature of ACO algorithms, where many procedures—for example, heuristic calculation, selection of continuous attributes, pruning—require multiple passes through the data to create a model. In this paper, we present a new ACO-based algorithm for data stream classification. The proposed algorithm, called Stream Ant-Miner (Ant-Miner), uses a novel hybrid pheromone model combining both a traditional construction graph and solution archives models to efficiently handle a large number of mixed-type (nominal and continuous) attributes directly without the need for additional procedures, reducing the computational time required to complete an iteration of the algorithm. Our results show that Ant-Miner produces statistically significant concise models compared with state-of-the-art rule induction data stream algorithms, without negative effects on their predictive accuracy.},

In this paper, a revised underwater imaging model is proposed first, which reanalyzes the generation of background light from the atmosphere to the underwater and provides important support for underwater color correction. And then a network framework via the revised model is designed, which can decompose the captured image into different components corresponding to the revised model. The proposed network consists of a decomposition architecture with residual blocks that learns a complete separation of clear image and transmittance features. These two features are used along with the raw image to predict the background light. Finally, combining three constraints of the imaging model, the proposed framework can converge rapidly along the desired direction. By comparison with the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms, the designed network shows excellent visibility and is capable of removing water on both synthetic and real-world images in different water types.},

  abstract     = {Conversational emotion recognition (CER) is a significant task due to its application in human–computer interaction. Existing work treats CER as an utterance-level classification task without considering that empathic response also reflects contextual emotion understanding. Previous work has proven that accurate recognition of emotions in the dialogue history is helpful to generate high-fit responses. In this paper, we investigate whether this conclusion is a sufficient and necessary condition. Specifically, we define an auxiliary empathic multiturn dialogue generation (MDG) task to enhance emotion understanding. Correspondingly, we present a Sequence-to-Sequence oriented framework that combines CER and MDG in a multitask learning manner to verify the complementarity between the two tasks. First, we use alternate recurrent neural networks to encode the content of historical utterances and represent the states of multiparty emotions, which are used for emotion classification. Second, since most MDG methods ignore the emotional coherence of the dialogue context itself, we use affine transformation to fuse hidden states of content and emotions to initialize the decoder. Finally, at each step of generation, an attention mechanism is used to fuse information from the dialogue history to ensure emotional coherence. The CER results of our models outperform the state-of-the-art on three prevalent emotional dialogue data sets. Further analysis demonstrates the mutual promotion and empathy interpretability between MDG and CER. Furthermore, our framework is scalable for different coding strategies and multimodal fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore CER from the perspective of empathy through multitask learning with dialogue generation.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation technique plays a crucial role in Internet of Things applications, such as industrial robotics and self-driving. Recently deep learning approaches have boosted semantic segmentation accuracy greatly. However, their comprehensive performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency is still far from satisfactory. We observe that (1) accuracy-oriented methods rely on numerous convolution layers and sophisticated architectures, which result in heavy computational complexity and usually take a long time for inference; (2) efficiency-oriented methods fail to capture the multiscale context information for discriminative representations during the feature fusion process, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Previous semantic segmentation approaches fail to address these two challenges simultaneously. To tackle the dilemma of precise segmentation and efficient inference, we propose a novel lightweight Multiscale Information Fusion Network (MIFNet). Specifically, the proposed MIFNet mainly consists of two core components, that is, Pyramid Refinement Connection Module (PRCM) and Lightweight Information Fusion Module (LIFM). The PRCM exploits skip learning to establish dependency between different stages. Meanwhile, the pyramid attention mechanism (PAM) in PRCM, which adjusts the weight of hybrid pyramid attention vector to refine spatial features of low-level, is developed to alleviate the semantic gap. Moreover, the LIFM is designed to detect objects at multiple scales from the global-local perspective. In LIFM, the proposed multiscale dense concatenation (MDC) adopts various dilated convolution to extract multiscale local context information. Extensive experimental results on benchmarks data sets demonstrate the significantly better performance of the proposed MIFNet compared with most existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Limited by the closeness of railway scenes, not much research has been conducted on the perception and understanding of rail transit. In view of the above, we propose multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI), the first multimodal proximity remote sensing data set for rail scene understanding. MRSI consists of 27 images collected from freight rail and metro following the pixel and box annotations labeled and checked manually. We used a variety of sensing devices mounted on locomotives to record track scenes under different lighting and weather conditions, including straight, curve, and fork during daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as under rainy days. We also include an additional infrared thermometer in the metro environment, propose a new image registration method after synchronous acquisition, and thus construct MRSI combining spatial and radiometric properties. With this data set, we can achieve segmentation of the track area and recognition of obstacles by sensing the environment in front of the train, which lead to rail scene understanding.

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is adapted as a novel unit in upcoming wireless infrastructures wherein UAVs can play various roles in different applications. The UAV is utilized for navigating commands to attain surveillance. However, routing and localization are the major issues that own higher mobility and unstable links. This paper devises a novel technique for initiating secured communication in a UAV network (UAVN). At first, the simulation of the UAVN is done. After that, the data transmission is carried out amongst nodes using a routing path; hence, an optimal routing path is formed using the newly devised Tunicate Swarm Political Optimization (TSPO) algorithm. The newly devised TSPO algorithm integrates the Tunicate Swarm Algorithm and Political Optimizer. In addition, the data communication is done using an evaluation and monitoring agent. In addition, the malicious detection is done by a decision-making agent using the deep residual network (DRN). Here, the newly devised TSPO algorithm is used to train the deep residual. The input parameters considered in the DRN are round trip time, signal strength, packet delivery, packet size, and the number of incoming packets. Once a DRN classifies the attack and genuine users, the defensive agent is employed for attack mitigation. Thus, the attacks in data are mitigated by the defensive agents. The newly devised TSPO-based DRN obtained enhanced performance with the smallest delay of 0.0014 s, the highest detection rate of 0.9325\%, and the highest packet delivery ratio of 11491.2\%.},

  abstract     = {Utility pattern mining is a branch of data mining that extracts valid patterns by considering the quantity and weight of the items. In addition, utility occupancy pattern mining, which considers the quantity, importance, and proportion of the pattern in the transaction, has been proposed. Despite this advantage, there is no utility seizing approach to handle the dynamically generated data flows. As electronics are interconnected and intelligent systems are constructed, data is generated in real-time and accumulated rapidly. Therefore, a method to read data immediately in a dynamic environment and efficiently analyze massive data is required. To overcome the limitations of the existing utility occupancy methods, we propose a novel mining approach, HUOMI, which performs quickly on an increasing database. The suggested algorithm has an optimized data structure and an improved pruning technique, which can respond to the dynamic environment promptly. To indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, performance evaluations were conducted on real and synthetic data sets. In the experimental results, the suggested algorithm showed a better performance than the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is gradually becoming a key learning paradigm in Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) systems. In FL, a large number of clients cooperate with a central server to learn a shared model without sharing their own data sets. However, since there is a great disparity between the client data sets, standard FL is often hard to tune and suffers from performance degradation due to the inharmony among local models. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel FL scheme, termed client reputation federated learning (CRFL), which dynamically assesses the reputation of the clients participating in FL. Our method leverages techniques from model explanation, and aims at precisely measure each client&#39;s impact to the global model. To be specific, we first calculate the saliency-weighted variance on pixelwise relevance scores as the quality factor of a single sample. Then we extract activation function values at the last hidden layer to compute the divergence factor of individual data set. Finally, the server integrates these two factors as an assessment of the client reputation. By leveraging such assessment, CRFL can dynamically adjust the weights of the clients in each aggregation round, thus leading to a significant improvement over the baseline method in terms of model accuracy and convergence rate. Intensive experiments are conducted on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets, and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Second, we apply a modified PSO algorithm to the consensus reaching process to improve the collective consensus level. In the context of probabilistic linguistic information, each participant can be recognized as a particle moving towards the best position. The consensus level can be regarded as the objective function that is used to construct the fitness function. In the update function, the trust relationship and the similarity measure between experts are exploited to determine the adjustment coefficient. The new consensus model based on PSO can ensure that the ultimate evaluation achieves a high level of consensus. Afterward, we propose the extended VIKOR method to obtain the optimal solution, which not only avoids the loss of decision information, but also considers the separation of each alternative from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution when criteria are interactive. The advantages of the proposed method are highlighted through a numerical example. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis and a sensitivity analysis to reveal the effectiveness and applicability of the method.},

To this end, we develop two novel methods for the Kantorovich and Monge formulations, which are the fundamental problems in OT. First, we learn the optimal joint distribution in the Kantorovich formulation and propose an algorithm, namely Cop-OT, which transforms the primal objective of the Kantorovich problem into a tractable objective with respect to the copula parameter. Second, based on the copula formulation of the joint distribution, we learn the optimal map in the Monge problem and propose an algorithm, namely Map-OT, which describes the optimal map using a parameterized function estimated by approximating the barycentric projection of the optimal joint distribution and then obtains a tractable objective with respect to parameters of interest. Both of them can be solved by stochastic optimization with a stable optimizing process. Empirical results demonstrate that Cop-OT and Map-OT can gain more accurate approximations of the Kantorovich and Monge problems compared with the baseline methods.},

However, when these systems deal with their environments, problems such as leakage of identities may occur. The adversary can damage the system communication and attack important nodes. To handle resource-constrained wireless sensor network environments, we propose a secure and anonymous data aggregation scheme. First, based on the bilinear mapping operation and onion routing concepts, we propose a key negotiation and secure information transmission scheme, which conducts confidential transmission and anonymous forwarding of messages in data aggregation. Second, an aggregation routing scheme based on link direction and residual energy is proposed to pledge messages that can arrive the base station without passing through many nodes, which saves network resources to a certain extent. Third, on the basis of the first two contributions, we propose an identity-privacy-aware secure and anonymous data aggregation scheme that protects the identity&#39;s privacy. This scheme can conceal the real identity of important nodes and protect the anonymity of messages and link relationships. In addition, an anonymous identity update and synchronization scheme is also proposed to ensure the reliability and security of communication. Meanwhile, our performance evaluations and simulations show that the proposed framework is more effective than several standard schemes with respect to the ability against various attacks, security, and overhead.},

In this paper, a novel two-stream network is proposed to detect and locate the forgery regions of document images. One stream captures forgery traces from the spatial information, including unnatural boundaries, contrast/brightness inconsistencies, and blurring. The other stream eliminates the image semantics by six residual filters, then capture the anomalous features between neighboring pixels introduced by upsampling, downsamping, and inpainting. Finally, the discriminant network is introduced to deeply fuse features from the two streams, and discriminates whether each image patch is forged or not using global average pooling and fully connected layer. Extensive experimental results on our constructed document image data set and the Security AI Challenger Program data set demonstrate the proposed two-stream network outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This proposed two-stream network is also better than each single stream, and is robust to some common forgery postprocessing operations.},

To solve the above problems, we propose BenchSubset, a framework for selecting benchmark subsets based on consensus clustering, which includes Group Principal Components Analysis, consensus clustering, and a new evaluation method considering the universal and the diversity characteristics of the benchmark suite.

Therefore, the adaptive strategy with the fitness distance correlation proposes to effectively balance the global exploration and local exploitation capabilities, which is the particle swarm adaptive network neighborhood topology. The neighborhood topology construction strategy with a complex network is used to construct the neighborhood topology for each particle. Therefore, the local optimal particles in the neighborhood participate in the search process of particle swarm optimization and eliminate the situation of only learning the global optimal particles. Moreover, it improves the solution accuracy of the particle swarm optimization algorithm. In addition, to avoid the particle swarm falling into premature convergence, this study introduces a random drift strategy to make the particles drift slightly and reduces the risk of premature convergence. The experimental results on twenty-four benchmark functions show that CNAPSO has great improvements in the accuracy of the solution and the speed of convergence compared with the six representative PSO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Due to the growing needs in decision-making under uncertainty, existing studies introduced consistency and consensus-driven algorithms for group decision-making (GDM) problems with hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs). A decision support system (DSS) that can host these GDM algorithms to provide decision-support services or tools for practical use is urgently needed. However, the state-of-the-art architectures cannot organize these algorithms and related data to run within one framework. This is mainly due to the running environments for these GDM algorithms are different since these algorithms were not originally designed to be compatible. Given the multilingual consistency and consensus-based decision support algorithms, how to design and implement a cloud-based DSS in a multilingual environment is still an open question. To fill this gap, this paper provides a web-based and cloud-based DSS with a novel architecture that utilizes the advantages of microservices. The proposed system implements a multilingual support framework to dynamically upload, manage and run multilingual consistency and consensus-based decision support algorithms. An algorithm recommendation module is developed to help users choose suitable decision support algorithms. Tokenization is applied to deal with regulatory issues of knowledge protection, data privacy, and security while storing, analyzing, and transforming data into different algorithms for effective decision-making. An expert feedback study verified that our web and cloud-based DSS is a right artifact to fulfill the objective claimed in this paper.},

Social media users&#39; concerns about their privacy have spiked in recent years. Incidents of data breaches have alarmed many users and forced them to rethink their relationships to social media and the security of their personal information. There can be many risks to information sharing, which is considered an attack on software and information hacking. Today, the password has a threat to any security system. Hackers steal people&#39;s passwords and misuse them. Peoples are worried about hacking their information and data. In this paper, we present the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach under the environment of q-rung orthopair double hierarchy linguistic term set (q-RODHLTS) and its some fundamental operations. For this purpose, we use the q-RODHLAHP in the multi-attribute decision-making process. Examples of security systems are demonstrated to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach. Security has become a significant issue as information technology is spreading rapidly in our daily lives. Finally, numerical applications of the security system have been presented to show the validity of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The definitive diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as a highly prevalent cancer, requires invasive, expensive, and time-consuming diagnostic tests. ALL diagnosis using peripheral blood smear (PBS) images plays a vital role in the initial screening of cancer from non-cancer cases. The examination of these PBS images by laboratory users is riddled with problems such as diagnostic error because the nonspecific nature of ALL signs and symptoms often leads to misdiagnosis. Herein, a model based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed to detect ALL from hematogone cases and then determine ALL subtypes. In this paper, we build a publicly available ALL data set, comprised 3562 PBS images from 89 patients suspected of ALL, including 25 healthy individuals with a benign diagnosis (hematogone) and 64 patients with a definitive diagnosis of ALL subtypes. After color thresholding-based segmentation in the HSV color space by designing a two-channel network, 10 well-known CNN architectures (EfficientNet, MobileNetV3, VGG-19, Xception, InceptionV3, ResNet50V2, VGG-16, NASNetLarge, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet201) were employed for feature extraction of different data classes. Of these 10 models, DenseNet201 achieved the best performance in diagnosis and classification. Finally, a model was developed and proposed based on this state-of-the-art technology. This deep learning-based model attained an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.85, 99.52, and 99.89\%, respectively. The proposed method may help to distinguish ALL from benign cases. This model is also able to assist hematologists and laboratory personnel in diagnosing ALL subtypes and thus determining the treatment protocol associated with these subtypes. The proposed data set is available at and the implementation (source code) of proposed method is made publicly available at .},

  abstract     = {Automatic identification of function clones on cross-platform aims at determining whether two functions are identical or not without access to the source code, which is a fundamental challenge in vulnerability search, code plagiarism detection, and malware classification. With the rapid development of deep neural network in program analysis, the state-of-the-art neural network-based function clone identification methods propose to represent functions as embeddings by graph neural network (GNN). However, such a novel representation of functions brings in two challenges. (1) The feature engineering that accurately maps the raw data of binary code to machine learning features is complicated. (2) A highly accurate embedding of functions requires a customized GNN to focus on the most critical features to identify binary code. To the best of our knowledge, currently, a comprehensive work that can overcome the above challenges is still missing. In this paper, we propose a novel prototype named as , which is designed to accurately and efficiently identify similar functions. Specifically, inspired by natural language processing techniques which effectively learns text semantic across natural languages, can learn representative semantic features of functions by a customized learning model. To address the second challenge, a multi-head attention mechanism can be employed to capture the critical features of a function. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that achieves high accuracy of function clone identification on a broad range of eight architectures. In particular, the identification performance (AUC value) of is 97\% and 99\% for cross-platform and single-platform, respectively. Furthermore, the evaluation in real world applications shows that our identifies 24 vulnerable functions among the top-30 candidates, which is one time higher than the baseline approaches.},

We employ Aczel–Alsina operations to remedy the MADM issue, wherein all data supplied by decision-makers is conveyed as interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) decision matrices with all components described by an IVIF number (IVIFN). This allows us to satisfy much more demands from fuzzy decision-making concerns (IVIFN). In the framework of IVIFNs, we primarily describe several novel Aczel–Alsina operations. On the basis of these operations, we construct several novel IVIF aggregation operators, such as the IVIF Aczel–Alsina weighted averaging operator, the IVIF Aczel–Alsina order weighted averaging operator, and IVIF Aczel–Alsina hybrid averaging operator. We built up several features of such operators. We recommend an MADM technique dependent on the advanced IVIF aggregation operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique, we present an overview of research scientist selection. The experimental results show the viability and benefits of the created strategy by contrasting it with the different strategies. This paper reveals that some existing IVIF aggregation operators are particular instances of the operators induced in this paper.},

In this paper, we proposed a JPEG steganalysis network which based on denoising network and attention module, mainly including a noise extract block, a noise analysis block, and a judgment block. Specifically, a professional denoising convolutional neural network is first introduced in noise extract block to obtain better steganalysis features. The noise analysis block is integrated with the attention module to finely extract the steganographic signals hidden in the complex texture regions, which is quite effective in improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the stego signal. The judgment block is primarily a classifier to distinguish between cover images and stego images. Comprehensive experiments show a significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art steganalysis scheme. Moreover, the proposed network has better generalization capability than the compared steganalysis network for the case of cover-source and quality factor mismatch, which is critical for future steganalysis systems.},

Previous studies that performed information extraction primarily focused on scattering targeted fields to achieve a balance between precision and recall. Therefore, this study aims to create a comprehensive information extraction system for TCM articles. This system will extract all relevant information from research articles on a broad research field, including the 11 diseases that can be efficiently treated with TCM, with high precision and efficient measurement to address bias in every study. It covers the most essential information related to patients, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) principles in TCM clinical trials. This system covers 34 target fields on 14 topics. Impediments such as the various typesetting of TCM clinical articles were managed by a hybrid of machine vision and optical character recognition. Thus, TCM researchers can be spared of laborious, unscalable, and inefficient manual extraction processes. Our system could also enhance TCM researcher awareness of frequently missing information or TCM clinical trial design methods that could introduce bias, by analyzing the overall information integrity of TCM clinical articles, which is beneficial for future research designs.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for the detection of four classes of coffee leaf diseases, Rust, Miner, Cercospora, and Phoma by using a fast Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) color space segmentation and a MobileNetV2 architecture trained by transfer learning. The proposed HSV color segmentation algorithm constitutes of separating the leaf from the background and separating infected spots on the leaf by automatically finding the best threshold value for the Saturation (S) channel of the HSV color space. The algorithm was compared to the YCgCr and k-means algorithms, in terms of Mean Intersection Over Union and F1-Score. The proposed HSV segmentation algorithm outperformed these methods and achieved an MIoU score of 72.13\% and an F1 score of 82.54\%. The proposed algorithm also outperforms these methods in terms of execution time, taking on average 0.02 s per image for the segmentation of diseased spots from healthy leaf spots. Our MobileNetV2 classifier achieved a 96\% average classification accuracy and 96\% average precision. The segmentation accuracy and faster execution make the proposed algorithm suitable for deployment on mobile devices and as such has been successfully implemented on smartphones running the Android operating system.},

The shared task included two subtask types: one that consisted in discriminating between the Moldavian and Romanian dialects and one that consisted in classifying documents by topic across the two dialects of Romanian. Participants achieved impressive scores, for example, the top model for Moldavian versus Romanian dialect identification obtained a macro- score of 0.895. We conduct a subjective evaluation by human annotators, showing that humans attain much lower accuracy rates compared with ML models. Hence, it remains unclear why the methods proposed by participants attain such high accuracy rates. Our goal is to understand (i) why the proposed methods work so well (by visualizing the discriminative features) and (ii) to what extent these methods can keep their high accuracy levels, for example, when we shorten the text samples to single sentences or when we use tweets at inference time. A secondary goal of our work is to propose an improved ML model using ensemble learning. Our experiments show that ML models can accurately identify the dialects, even at the sentence level and across different domains (news articles vs. tweets). We also analyze the most discriminative features of the best performing models, providing some explanations behind the decisions taken by these models. Interestingly, we learn new dialectal patterns previously unknown to us or to our human annotators. Furthermore, we conduct experiments showing that the ML performance on the MRC shared task can be improved through an ensemble based on stacking.},

This paper proposes a new variant of GWO, named SCGWO, which combines GWO with an improved spread strategy and a chaotic local search (CLS) mechanism to overcome these performance limitations. In detail, a spread strategy is introduced into the basic GWO to change the search agent&#39;s ability to avoid the local optima, the global exploration capability, and the individual movement&#39;s randomness. Then, a CLS mechanism is adopted to accelerate the convergence rate of the evolving agents. This method&#39;s effectiveness is illustrated by comparing the proposed SCGWO method with various algorithms, including seven GWO variants and eight well-known state-of-the-art algorithms on a comprehensive set of benchmark functions with the type of unimodal, multimodal, and composition functions. The experimental results confirmed that the established SCGWO algorithm has apparent advantages in processing unimodal, multimodal, and composition functions. Additionally, the proposed algorithm was utilized for finding the approximate optimal feature subset when applied to the feature selection problems on a set of 32 real-world data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the binary variant also reveals a very competitive performance in dealing with feature selection. Our findings and analysis suggest that the proposed method can be a very suitable tool for realizing the optimal solutions to global optimization and wrapper-based feature selection tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cranes are widely deployed for lifting and moving heavy objects in dynamic environments with human coexistence. Suddenly appeared workers, vehicles, and robots can affect the safety of the cranes. To avoid possible collisions, the cranes must have prediction ability to know how dangerous the situation is. In this paper, we address the safety issues of bridge cranes based on its online physical states and control model. Due to the swing of the payload, the safe braking distance cannot be a constant value. Therefore, we here propose a model prediction control (MPC)-based anti-swing method for non-zero initial states, where a new reference trajectory and a new cost function for optimization are proposed, such that the proposed MPC method can control the crane to follow the proposed reference trajectory and achieve a stable stop state with anti-swing. Furthermore, an offline learning mechanism is introduced to learn a statistical model between the velocity of the crane and the safe braking distance achieved by using the proposed MPC braking control method. In this way, we can predict how far the crane would require to safely stop without swing based on its current velocity, which is the safe distance prediction to evaluate the dangerous level of the dynamic obstacle. Experiments using both a simulated crane and a real crane demonstrate that the proposed safe braking distance prediction method is effective for safe braking control of the bridge cranes.},

  abstract     = {Image watermarking is an effective way to secure the ownership of digital photographs. This paper proposes a new methodology for integrating a watermark on the basis of various integrative strengths. The image is separated as 8 × 8 pixels blocks that do not overlap. The pixel size for each image block has been determined. For the embedding areas, picture blocks with the highest value have been chosen. Therefore, discrete cosine transformation (DCT) is transformed. The DCT coefficients are chosen in the midfrequency and the average selected DCT blocks are determined using a series of rules to produce various integration strengths. The watermarking bits were merged with the proposed deep learning convolution neural network (DLCNN) through a series of integration standards. The binary watermark has been scrambled by an Arnold transform until it is incorporated for additional stability. During the image carrier, a pattern recognition model depending on DLCNN is utilized to identify and extract the watermark and to recognize the watermark using the Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm. The findings of the tests demonstrated that the system suggested is most imperceptible than the other current systems. The proposed method attains the efficiency watermarked picture with 46 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio value. This paper focuses on robust medical image watermarking exploiting DCT by using the HHO algorithm. The watermark lossless compression reduces watermark payload without data loss. In this research work, watermark is the consolidation of DCT and image watermarking secret key. The performance of robust medical image watermarking exploiting DCT with the HHO algorithm is compared with other conventional compression methods. HHO is found better and used to control watermarked image degradation in medical images watermarking. The proposed system also created a high resistance to remove watermarks during many attacks.},

  abstract     = {Indoor positioning systems are becoming increasing popular recently. While most existing indoor positioning studies focus on improving accuracy, less attention is paid to the latency problem. The traditional fusion algorithm uses the received signal strength-based (RSS-Based) positioning result to correct the current position of the system. However, it fails to keep up with the actual moving speed of the user during the navigation. The location retrospective adjustment (LRA) method proposed in this paper uses the RSS-Based positioning result to correct the past position of the system, which can effectively eliminate positioning delay and improve the real-time response of navigation. We tested in a 70 m linear promenade and found that the addition of LRA results in a reduction of the positioning error around −0.3 to +0.4 m, which improves 85\%. Additionally, the LRA method alleviates the requirements for the immediate response of RSS positioning, and the RSS positioning algorithm can be moved to the cloud. It reduces the download resources and computing load on the mobile phone. The complete indoor navigation application is presented in HTML5 which allows users to navigate without having to download the APP in advance, and it takes only 4–9 s for users to launch the application for the first time. We tested the application in a hospital with a total floor area of 79,000 m in 7 buildings. The system achieves an average positioning accuracy of 0.65 m at a long navigation distance of 220 m. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider the latency issue in indoor navigation. The proposed LRA approach improves real-time navigation performance, lightens the computation load on the mobile phone, and allows cloud-based positioning systems to provide stable and accurate navigation even under poor network quality in crowded areas.},

For growers, crop planning, usually a yearly business plan, is a key decision to make on when, what, and how many to plant. It is a challenging task as it deals with multiple constraints in volatile economic and/or climate environment. Most crop planning models have difficulty in adapting to changing situation. In this study, a parallel system of crop planning composed of the artificial system, computational experiment, and parallel execution is proposed. The farmers are described as agents, and the decision is made based on the heuristic searching of optimal plan; the adaption of plan is triggered autonomously given strong environment changes. Focus is given to economic environment, which is indicated as product price. In a case study, the economic environment of the artificial system is built based on the monthly and weekly price information for 13 products during 7 years. The computational experiment provides the initial cropping plan and harvest time, with social and ecological constraints. Result shows that the cropping plan can further adapt to price variation. This flexible cropping plan system can strengthen the capability of cooperatives serving small-scale farmers.},

A blind colour image watermarking algorithm combined spatial domain and singular value decomposition (SVD) is designed to protect the rightful ownership of color image in this paper. The theoretical principle combined SVD and spatial domain is first discussed and proposed in this paper. Based on the derived principle, the watermark information can be directly embedded into the maximum singular value (MSV) of the host image in the spatial domain by the new quantization index modulation with variable quantization step, and the embedded watermark information can be directly extracted from the MSV of the watermarked image block in the spatial domain with geometrical correction. The contributions of this paper include the following four points: (1) the relationship between the changed MSV of SVD and the average changed value of image pixel in the spatial domain is the first derived in this paper; (2) the presented method has the merits of both spatial-domain technique and transform-domain technique; (3) the relationships of each component of the color image are used to improve the invisibility and the geometrical correction of watermarked image is also adapted to further improve the robustness; and (4) this presented method overcomes the false-positive problem that existed in many watermarking methods based on SVD. Simulation results demonstrate the new presented color image watermarking technique has better imperceptibility, higher robustness and shorter running-time compared with some state-of-the-art methods.},

To date, it remains largely unknown whether and how dynamic characteristics of the functional networks differ from cognitively normal (CN) to AD. Here, we propose an AD dynamic network complexity intelligent detecting algorithm based on visibility graph. The focal regions that caused the dynamic abnormality of the connection mode were intelligently detected by creating a dynamic complexity network on the basis of the dynamic functional network. The results showed that the brain areas with different dynamic complexity gradually shifted from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe and the occipital lobe. This was significantly related to the disorder of clinical patients from mood to memory and language. The increased dynamic complexity illustrates the compensatory effect of the brain area of AD lesions. In addition, the small-world topological properties of the dynamic complexity network have significant differences from CN to AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a concept is proposed. Our method of intelligently detecting the complexity of AD dynamic network provides new insights for understanding the internal dynamic mechanism of AD brain.},

As far as the author knows, no decision-making method can rank alternatives with future performance target values. This study article introduced a novel decision-making technique, namely DEcision Making Technique to Achieve Stratified TArget Performance (DEMTASTAP), for ranking the alternatives with the future performance values. In recent years, the concept of stratification has become the central concept in the decision-making process. Here, the target level of each alternative under each factor regard as the stratification level. We validate the introduced DEMTASTAP method by testing the completeness of the ranking, the correlation of the order, the inversion of the scale, and the sensitivity. Demonstrate the efficiency of the DEMTASTAP method by solving the Science and Technology Innovation Policy (STIP) investment issues. Using the introduced method, we have obtained an effective investment rate to achieve the expected growth rate of all alternative (or) regions.

The weight of the nonlinear function was used to calculate the input and output results of overlapping area information. Combined with the input mode of 3D medical image information, the error between the information output and the expected output was set. The nonlinear function weight of the overlapping area information of 3D medical images was modified by using the learning rate and the use time of the overlapping area information, and the influence factors of the overlapping information detection were obtained by increasing the situation terms, so as to complete the detection of the surface reconstruction information of 3D medical images.

The machines are considered unrelated because the processing speed is dependent on the job being executed and not on the individual machines. Generally, the problem is considered NP-hard, as it presents additional complexity to find an optimal solution in terms of minimum makespan. An advanced firefly metaheuristic optimization algorithm is introduced to solve this problem. The proposed method, called the FAII algorithm, aims to improve the standard firefly algorithm&#39;s performance by incorporating an enhanced global best solution update mechanism and adaptive mutation-based local and global neighborhood search scheme to improve the quality of the proposed algorithm&#39;s generated solution. Several experiments were conducted to compare and validate the proposed algorithms&#39; performance on small and large-scale benchmarked problem instances with up to 12 machines and 120 job combinations. Moreover, the performance of the FAII was also compared with eight other metaheuristic algorithms, which were implemented in parallel with the FAII method. Furthermore, the numerical results of the FAII algorithm were compared with the scheduling results of six other well-known metaheuristics from the literature. The comparison results backed with a comprehensive statistical analysis showed the superiority of the enhanced FA-style scheduling optimization over other metaheuristic methods to find good quality solutions or minimum average makespan.},

Most of the existing techniques are unable to manage multiple dimensions of a data set, due to which the computational complexity escalates with the increasing size of a data set. Many machine learning (ML) methods are unable to handle predictions. This paper presents a new forecasting method in the neural network structure based on the induced ordered weighted average (IOWA) weighted average (WA) and fuzzy time series. The proposed model is more efficient than existing complexity handling fuzzy time series prediction methods and other traditional time series prediction methods. The proposed model can accommodate the IOWA operator, weighted average, and relevance degree of each concept in a particular problem for a fuzzy nonlinear prediction. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it contributes to theory by proposing a new IOWAWA layer in the neural network to handle complex nonlinear prediction for a large data set. The second contribution is the application of the approach to predict nonlinear stock market data. The robustness of the approach is tested using Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) stock data by considering a case study of the housing and property sector. We further compare the prediction accuracy of the approach with sixteen existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) has achieved superior classification in many applications due to its capability of extracting features from the data. However, the success of DL comes with the tradeoff of possible overfitting. The bias towards the data it has seen during the training process leads to poor generalisation. One way of solving this issue is by having enough training data so that the classifier is invariant to many data patterns. In the literature, data augmentation has been used as a type of regularisation method to reduce the chance for the model to overfit. However, most of the relevant works focus on image, sound or text data. There is not much work on numerical data augmentation, although many real-world problems deal with numerical data. In this paper, we propose using a technique based on Fuzzy -Means clustering and fuzzy membership grades. Fuzzy-related techniques are used to address the variance problem by generating new data items based on fuzzy numbers and each data item&#39;s belongings to different fuzzy clusters. This data augmentation technique is used to improve the generalisation of a Deep Neural Network that is suitable for numerical data. By combining the proposed fuzzy data augmentation technique with the Dropout regularisation technique, we manage to balance the classification model&#39;s bias-variance tradeoff. Our proposed technique is evaluated using four popular data sets and is shown to provide better regularisation and higher classification accuracy compared with popular regularisation approaches.},

However, it is challenging to utilize the network information for providing Scratch users with personalized services, despite there are already some useful network representation learning models. In this paper, a network representation learning model with preference-based generative adversarial nets for Scratch (ScratchGAN) is proposed to resolve this problem. In ScratchGAN, we first design a node-vector initialization approach to preserve structure information and side information of Scratch network. Then, considering to learn the fine-grained user preference information of network, we propose a novel Scratch adversarial learning model which includes a Scratch generative adversarial net and a user preference difference constraint component. The former aims to capture user preferences through a new generating strategy based on the delivery nature of preference. The latter attempts to embed users&#39; detailed preference differences according to their interaction behaviors. ScratchGAN can mine user preferences while preserving network structure information and side information. Extensive experiments on the Scratch network show that ScratchGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in link prediction and recommendation tasks.},

  abstract     = {The modern industrial sector generates enormous amounts of high-dimensional heterogeneous data daily. However, mostly the vectored data (rank-one tensor) have been considered for anomaly detection, whereas the data in real-life is high dimensional. The expressive power of methods based on vector data is restrictive as they may destroy the structural information embedded in data and lead to the curse-of-dimensionality and overfitting. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection approach for large-scale tensor data. We first present novel one-class support tensor machines (OCSTM) with bounded loss function. We further extend it by leveraging the randomness to design a scalable approach that can also be used for large-scale anomaly detection. To solve the corresponding optimization of the objective function, we utilize half-quadratic optimization followed by solving it like a traditional OCSTM optimization at each iteration. We demonstrate the proposed randomized OCSTM with bounded hinge loss through experiments on 14 benchmark data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against anomalies and a significant reduction in the computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Cache prefetching technology has become the mainstream data access optimization strategy in the Industrial Intelligent Systems (IIS) and the data centers. However, the rapidly increasing of unstructured data generates massive pairwise access relationships. Therefore, researchers have to make a choice between spatial locality and temporal locality to ensure an acceptable computational complexity. We propose cache-transaction-based data grouping model (CTDGM) to solve the problems described above by optimizing the feature representation method and grouping efficiency. First, we provide the definition of the cache transaction and propose the method for extracting the cache transaction feature (CTF). Second, we design a data chunking algorithm based on CTF and spatiotemporal locality to optimize the relationship calculation efficiency. Third, we propose CTDGM by constructing a relation graph that groups data into independent groups according to the strength of the data access relation. Based on the results of the experiment, compared with the state-of-the-art and traditional methods, our algorithm achieves an average increase in the cache hit rate of 5\%–20\% on the MSR, VDI-LUN, and KC data set, which in turn reduces the number of data I/O accesses by 30\%–60\%.},

However, despite FL advantages regarding security and flexibility, current constructions still suffer from some limitations. Namely, heavy computation overhead on limited resources EDs, communication overhead in uploading converged local models&#39; parameters to a centralized server for parameters aggregation, and lack of guaranteeing the acquired knowledge preservation in the face of incremental learning over new local data sets. This paper introduces a secure and resource-friendly protocol for parameters aggregation in federated incremental learning and its applications. In this study, the central server relies on a new method for parameters aggregation called orthogonal gradient aggregation. Such a method assumes constant changes of each local data set and allows updating parameters in the orthogonal direction of previous parameters spaces. As a result, our new construction is robust against catastrophic forgetting, maintains the federated neural network accuracy, and is efficient in computation and communication overhead. Moreover, extensive experiments analysis over several significant data sets for incremental learning demonstrates our new protocol&#39;s efficiency, efficacy, and flexibility.},

  abstract     = {Managing and estimating the availability information of parking lots is of great importance to travelers and managers. However, the task is very challenging since the occupancy rate is affected by various factors, including spatial-temporal features, parking lot attributes features, and environmental changes. Previous studies mostly focus on the short-term prediction by capturing the historical sequential dependencies among inputs and outputs, which leads to low estimation accuracy for long-term prediction and limited scalability for real deployment in parking lots. To address the challenges, a comprehensive framework for real-time Smart Parking Data Management and Prediction (SPDMP) system is proposed. Three types of data sources, including historical sequential data, real-time sequential data, and attributes category data, are sufficiently integrated into a customized Parking Availability Prediction (PAP) neural network by representation learning and heterogeneous feature embedding. Specifically, instead of using parking lot property information and environmental data directly, the authors design an Attributes Tensor Embedding Component (ATEC) to integrate the intra-class affection and interclass representations and correlations by two steps of customized embedding process. To balance the impact of the indiscriminate features for various prediction targets, this study proposes a multi-factor attention mechanism to learn the weights and help the PAP achieve a stable performance for time-various tasks. From extensive experiments on two real-world large-scale data sets collected in China and USA (including 19 urban parking and 2 truck parking lots), PAP achieves superior prediction results on both urban parking (6.69\% average MAPE) and truck parking prediction (7.63\% average MAPE) for five prediction time slots (5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h). Furthermore, even with limited training data, PAP still shows better transferability and adaptability for various types of lots. The proposed SPDMP is selected and used as a pilot test bed by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) for truck parking information promotion.},

The design of our method includes a generator and a discriminator. The generator mainly contains an encoder, a decoder, and a prediction module. Specifically, the encoder and the decoder comprise multihead convolutional self-attention to learn the sequence of historical movement, and the prediction module incorporates the Mish Feed-Forward Network to yield the predicted target. The discriminator takes both the predicted paths and ground truth as input, classifies them as socially acceptable or not. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently boosts the performance of trajectory forecasting, and our framework surpasses several existing baselines by evaluating the results on various data sets.

To alleviate the semantic gaps and sparsity, we propose a cross-media search method based on complementary attention and generative adversarial networks (CAGS). To obtain high-quality feature representations, we build a complementary attention mechanism containing the focused and unfocused features of images to realize the consistent association of cross-media data in social networks. By designing the cross-media adversarial learning process, we can obtain a common semantic representation of cross-media data and further alleviate the semantic gap and sparsity issues for social networks. Finally, we perform a similarity calculation to realize an accurate cross-media search. We construct four search tasks utilizing two standard cross-media data sets to verify the search performance of the proposed CAGS.},

The prediction model consists of an ensemble of four regression models. The learning samples consist of feature vectors, where features are source code metrics computed for a class. The samples are labeled by the Coverageability values computed for their corresponding classes. We offer a mathematical model to evaluate test effectiveness in terms of size and coverage of the test suite generated automatically for each class. We extend the size of the feature space by introducing a new approach to define submetrics in terms of existing source code metrics. Using feature importance analysis on the learned prediction models, we sort sources code metrics in the order of their impact on the test effectiveness. As a result of which we found the class strict cyclomatic complexity as the most influential source code metric.

A high-strength key that is easy to store and manage can be generated from biological characteristics, which can improve the convenience and security of user-encryption operations. However, the generation of a high-strength, stable, and robust key using the currently available fingerprint bio-key generation technology is difficult. This paper proposes a three-layer framework for fingerprint bio-key generation that is composed of a fingerprint bio-key preprocessor, fingerprint bio-key stabilizer (FPBK_Stabilizer), and fingerprint bio-key fuzzy extractor. In the FPBK_Stabilizer, feature selection and layer-by-layer convolution projection characteristics from deep neural networks are used to effectively eliminate the instability between fingerprint samples. Furthermore, a suitable multilayer convolutional projection fingerprint bio-key generation model is designed for generating the fingerprint bio-key. The results of a fingerprint bio-key generation experiment involving a fingerprint library comprising 100 people verified the efficacy of the proposed framework. Specifically, the proposed framework exhibited a generation intensity 1024 bits, accuracy rate 98.0\%, and misrecognition rate 1.5\%, thereby verifying its high-strength, stable, and robust fingerprint bio-key generation capability.},

This method is capable of simultaneously determining the model&#39;s complexity and estimating the model&#39;s parameters. Moreover, due to the nature of Bayesian nonparametric approaches, it can also avoid the problems of underfitting and overfitting.

Previous white-box adversarial example generation algorithms used the Jacobian gradient information to add the perturbation. This imprecise and inexplicit information can cause unnecessary perturbation when generating adversarial examples. This paper aims to address this issue. We first propose to apply the more informative and distilled gradient information, namely, integrated gradient, to generate adversarial examples. To further make the perturbation more imperceptible, we propose to employ the restriction combination of and  second, which can restrict the total perturbation and the perturbation points simultaneously. Meanwhile, to address the nondifferentiable problem of , we explore a proximal operation of third. On the basis of these three works, we propose two ntegrated gradient-based hite-box dversarial example generation algorithms (IWA): Integrated gradient-based Finite Point Attack (IFPA) and Integrated gradient-based Universe Attack (IUA). IFPA is suitable for situations where there are a determined number of points to be perturbed. IUA is suitable for situations where no perturbation point number is preset to obtain more adversarial examples. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both structured and unstructured data sets, and compare them with five baseline generation algorithms.

  abstract     = {Formalization of rough sets is a key issue in rough set theory. When rough sets are formalized by propositional logic, predicate logic, or modal propositional logic, it easily suffers from some problems. For instance, an incomplete system is obtained. The concepts of “” or “” of rough sets cannot be described. To tackle these issues, a new noncontingency axiomatic system is proposed for formalizing rough sets in this paper. First, a new concise accessibility relation is defined for the axiomatic system; then, two simpler axiom schemas of the axiomatic system are designed to replace the axiom schema . This is helpful to prove the soundness and completeness theorems for the axiomatic system. Finally, rough sets can be perfectly formalized by our proposed axiomatic system. Theoretical analysis proves that a complete formal system is achieved. In addition, the concepts of “” or “” of rough sets can be described without the help of semantics functions of metalanguage.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems are one of the main applications of machine learning (ML) used across different industries. This paper presents a new automated machine learning (AutoML) method of providing recommendations by processing data sets using ML algorithms, targeting, and offering cluster recommendations for new observations and as a new decision support method. The AutoML conducts a complete procedure and includes analysis and division of data into an efficient number of clusters. We apply the k-means, using the elbow method to calculate costs per cluster, followed by analyzing the allocation of the data into the clusters, thus providing a method for prediction and for allocating new observations to the relevant clusters (knn). This study includes two experiments using the complete AutoML procedure conducted on a data set, with more than two million records and dozens of attributes. This was done to demonstrate how the AutoML method can be implemented and successfully run with a high-capacity analysis procedure. The motivation was to analyze, examine, assign, and integrate new observations into existing clusters that have been defined. The results showed that the AutoML method provided efficient recommendations for new observations with an accuracy rate of 99.99\%. Hence, the AutoML procedure can offer a full system for any organization to efficiently split existing data into clusters, assign to clusters, and predict the cluster allocation of new observations. The significant contribution of this study is a simple method that can achieve fast and high accuracy clustering for ongoing (new) classified data acquired by an organization.},

These challenges show an immense impact on the power system&#39;s inertia and load pattern. The traditional load frequency control (LFC) mechanism may not be efficient to sustain the frequency regulation against these new challenges. Hence an intelligent, effective, and efficient controller is indispensable for various operating conditions of the power system. With this motive, a new intelligence-based controller (i.e., fuzzy (FOPI) + PIDN) is proposed and explored for the LFC of the modern power system. Besides, an opposition-based volleyball premier league algorithm is deployed to obtain optimal control parameters for the most promising results. The justification of the controller is evaluated on a nonlinear interconnected hybrid deregulated power system for several case studies. The effectiveness of the proposed controller has been verified by comparing it with several popular strategies for the step and random perturbation in load. Also, the firmness in the dynamic response against a wide range of system parameter variations has been analyzed. Moreover, the participation of a modified high voltage direct current model with inertia emulation technique in the system&#39;s inertia build-up has been demonstrated. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed LFC scheme has been verified over previously published literature on their platform.},

  abstract     = {Building green airports can be regarded as among the most promising routes to sustainable development of ecosystems and human health. This study aims at addressing the problem of green airport plan selection under an uncertain context by developing an uncertain multiattribute group decision making (MAGDM) model. In the proposed model, the assessment information is characterized in the form of a proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic term set (PH2TLTS), which incorporates in binary form linguistic information that can accurately quantify subjective assessment information provided under uncertainty. The weights of assessment attributes of green airport plans are obtained automatically through a nonlinear programming model, which enhances the robustness of the decision-making method. Subsequently, on the basis of PH2TLTSs, three distance measures are proposed: the proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic Jaccard distance (PH2TLJD), the supplementary proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic normalized Minkowski distance (SPH2TLNMD) and the cluster-based proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic normalized Minkowski distance (CBPH2TLNMD). The TOPSIS-based comparison method proposed here can better determine the priorities of PH2TLTSs. The ranking and selection of green airport plans are derived using the PH2TL-VIKOR model. Finally, a case study accompanied by sensitivity and comparative analyses is performed to verify the rationality and feasibility of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {The aim of temporal action localization (TAL) is to determine the start and end frames of an action in a video. In recent years, TAL has attracted considerable attention because of its increasing applications in video understanding and retrieval. However, precisely estimating the duration of an action in the temporal dimension is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an effective one-stage TAL method based on a self-defined motion data structure, called a dense joint motion matrix (DJMM), and a novel temporal detection strategy. Our method provides three main contributions. First, compared with mainstream motion images, DJMMs can preserve more pre-processed motion features and provides more precise detail representations. Furthermore, DJMMs perfectly solve the temporal information loss problem caused by motion trajectory overlaps within a certain time period. Second, a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer, which is widely used in the object detection and tracking fields, is innovatively incorporated into the proposed method for multi-scale feature learning. Moreover, the SPP layer enables the backbone convolutional neural network (CNN) to receive DJMMs of any size in the temporal dimension. Third, a large-scale-first temporal detection strategy inspired by a well-developed Chinese text segmentation algorithm is proposed to address long-duration videos. Our method is evaluated on two benchmark data sets and one self-collected data set: Florence-3D, UTKinect-Action3D and HanYue-3D. The experimental results show that our method achieves competitive action recognition accuracy and high TAL precision, and its time efficiency and few-shot learning capabilities enable it to be utilized for real-time surveillance.},

  abstract     = {Although Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fingerprinting localization has become a hot research topic with encouraging results, it is difficult to predict the location depending on a short duration received signal strength indication (RSSI) sequence in realistic scenarios due to the severe fluctuation of RSSI. We introduce a new perspective to view the indoor positioning problem by radio map fingerprint. We argue that even though beacons may be independently deployed, the RSSI series bear certain spatial relation because of their copresence in the same physical space. The latent relation implicitly conveyed by the coexistence of their signals at various indoor locations. Unlike existing approaches that try to find a direct mapping between sensed signals and the corresponding location, we explore the spatial relation of beacons from the input data to estimate location. We propose a deep learning localization system, termed DRVAT, which is based on the distributed representation vector (DRV) and self-attention (AT) among the pairs of MAC-RSSI. First, we obtain DRVs which represent dense features in low dimensionality through pre-training on all MAC-RSSIs. Then we exploit self-attention mechanism to learn the latent spatial relation of beacons. Finally, MAC-RSSIs labeled with locations are used to fine-tune the model for estimating location. Localization accuracy results demonstrated the superior performance as compared with other positioning methods, and the visualization of DRV and attention mechanism are consistent with the spatial deployment of BLE.},

Biological key have the advantage of convenience and fast application without carrying any document; however, they also have the disadvantage of biological characteristic leaks and the inability to change. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of biological key, we propose the concept of semantic key. Language, a medium that fills the lives of people, has similar characteristics of convenience and fast application as biological key; however, semantic key will not reveal biological information. As the amount of semantic information is large, it can be changed at any time. Compared with biological key, it provides better security and flexibility. Therefore, we propose a semantic key generation framework of semantic extraction + feature stabilization + fuzzy extraction that improves the existing semantic extraction model and feature stabilization model and design the semantic key extraction model. In terms of artificial sentence formation, semantic key can be extracted with an accuracy of more than 99\%, and an error rate of less than 0.5\%.},

  abstract     = {The Corona Virus Disease 2019 has a great impact on public health and public psychology. People stay at home for a long time and rarely go out. With the improvement of the epidemic situation, people began to go to different places to check in. To maintain public mental health, it is necessary to propose a point-of-interest (POI) prediction model which can mine users&#39; interests. However, the current techniques suffer from lower precision during prediction and the practical value is poor, which is due to the sparse data of users&#39; check-in. Faced with this challenge, we propose an attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) model for POI category prediction (ABG_poic). We regard the user&#39;s POI category as the user&#39;s interest preference because the fuzzy POI category is easier to reflect the user&#39;s interest than the POI. This method can alleviate the data sparsity, and protect users&#39; location privacy. Since users&#39; preferences are variable, we utilize a bidirectional GRU to capture the dynamic dependence of users&#39; check-ins. Furthermore, since the neural network is similar to a “black box” in feature learning, the decision-making stage is opaque. Thus, we combine the attention mechanism with bidirectional GRU to selectively focus on historical check-in records, which can improve the interpretability of the model. Considering the time impact on users&#39; check-in, we utilize the time sliding window in the ABG_poic model. Experiments on two data sets demonstrate that our ABG_poic outperforms the comparison models for POI category prediction on sparse check-in data.},

  abstract     = {A large class of sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty, with broad applications from preventive maintenance to event-triggered control can be modeled in the framework of semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs). Unlike Markov decision processes (MDPs), SMDPs are underexplored in the online and reinforcement learning (RL) settings. In this paper, we extend the well-known deterministic policy gradient (DPG) theorem in MDPs to SMDPs under average-reward criterion. The existing stochastic policy gradient methods not only require, in general, a large number of samples for training, but they also suffer from high variance in the gradient estimation when applied to problems with deterministic optimal policy. Our DPG method can potentially remedy these issues. On the basis of this method and depending on the choice of a critic, different actor–critic algorithms can easily be developed in the RL setup. We present two example actor–critic algorithms. Both algorithms employ our developed policy gradient theorem for their actors, but use two different critics; one uses a simple SARSA update while the other one uses the same on-policy update but with compatible function approximators. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method both mathematically and via simulations.},

Honeypot makes an environment that attracts the attacker to pay their operations to steal sources. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are efficiently noticed using the proposed honeypot method. The issues of the previous technique are that the DoS attack is a malicious act with the goal of interrupting the access to a computer network. The result of the DoS attack can cause the computers on the network to squander their resources to serve illegitimate requests that result in a disruption of the network&#39;s services to legitimate users. To overcome these challenges this method is proposed. In this manuscript, the Deep Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Honeypots (DARLH) is proposed. Here, honeypot environment, the proposed DARLHs system implements Deep Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (DARL) with Intrusion Detection System (IDS) agents and Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) with IDS agent for observing multiruntime DoS attack. In the next level, the system creates DRNN and DARL IDS agent integration modules for effective runtime attack detections. The Knowledge Data Discovery data set pattern, UNSW-NB20, and Bot-IoT data sets are used to the scenario of DoS attack. The method is executed in Python 3.7. The experimental outcomes are likened through different existing methods, such as Game and Naïve-Bayes Honeypot, Block Chain Honeypot, and Recurrent Neural Network-based Signature Generation and Detection. The proposed method is compared with External DoS Attack, Internal DoS attack, Brute-force attack, DoS attack, Web attack, and Botnet attacks with the existing methods. From the comparison, the proposed method offers 5\%–10\% better outcomes than another existing method. Lastly, the test results determine that the proposed method performance is most efficient with another existing system.},

In this paper, we suggest a two-parametric version of the knowledge measure in fuzzy settings. Further, we investigate its novelty and advantages from various viewpoints, such as attribute weight computation, ambiguity computation, and appropriate handling of the structured linguistic variables. We also introduce a two-parametric generalized fuzzy accuracy measure (GFAM) and demonstrate its application in pattern analysis. Additionally, we contrast the effectiveness of the suggested fuzzy accuracy measure with several existing compatibility measures. We also consider the Multiobjective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) method of multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) based on the proposed two-parametric generalized fuzzy knowledge measure and two-parametric GFAM. We also contrast the MADM method with the conventional MOORA method.},

  abstract     = {As a common mental disorder, depression has attracted many researchers from affective computing field to estimate the depression severity. However, existing approaches based on Deep Learning (DL) are mainly focused on single facial image without considering the sequence information for predicting the depression scale. In this paper, an integrated framework, termed DepNet, for automatic diagnosis of depression that adopts facial images sequence from videos is proposed. Specifically, several pretrained models are adopted to represent the low-level features, and Feature Aggregation Module is proposed to capture the high-level characteristic information for depression analysis. More importantly, the discriminative characteristic of depression on faces can be mined to assist the clinicians to diagnose the severity of the depressed subjects. Multiscale experiments carried out on AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 databases have shown the excellent performance of the intelligent approach. The root mean-square error between the predicted values and the Beck Depression Inventory-II scores is 9.17 and 9.01 on the two databases, respectively, which are lower than those of the state-of-the-art video-based depression recognition methods.},

  abstract     = {Pneumonia is a major cause of death among children below the age of 5 years, globally. It is especially prevalent in developing and underdeveloped nations where the risk factors for the disease such as unhygienic living conditions, high levels of pollution and overcrowding are higher. Radiological examination (usually X-ray scans) is conducted to detect pneumonia, yet it is prone to subjective variability and can lead to disagreements among different radiologists. To detect traces of pneumonia from X-ray images, a more robust method is therefore required, which can be achieved by using a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. In this study, we develop a two-stage framework, using the combination of deep learning and optimization algorithms, which is both accurate and time-efficient. In its first stage, the proposed framework extracts feature using a customized deep learning model called DenseNet-201 following the concept of transfer learning to cope with the scanty available data. In the second stage, we then reduce the feature dimension using an improved sine cosine algorithm equipped with adaptive beta hill climbing-based local search algorithm. The optimized feature subset is utilized for the classification of “Pneumonia” and “Normal” X-ray images using a support vector machines classifier. Upon an evaluation on a publicly available data set, the proposed method demonstrates the highest accuracy of 98.36\% and sensitivity of 98.79\% with a feature reduction of 85.55\% (74 features selected out of 512), using a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Extensive additional experiments on continuous benchmark functions as well as the CEC-2017 test suite further showcase the superiority and suitability of our proposed approach in application to real-valued optimization problems. The relevant codes for the proposed method can be found in .},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the trajectory tracking control problem of a planar underactuated tendon-driven truss-like manipulator (UTTM) by using fuzzy logic control methods, including type-1 fuzzy and interval type-2 fuzzy approaches. The UTTM is a novel designed underactuated robot that excels in manipulating in harsh environments due to its tendon-driven parallelogram structure. This unique structure, however, poses challenges for UTTM&#39;s trajectory tracking controller design, including underactuation, excessive nonlinearity, parameter uncertainty, and so on. To solve these problems, a fuzzy logic-based approach is proposed. First, the dynamic model of UTTM is transformed into a partially linearized form. Then a type-1 fuzzy controller is designed according to a linear quadratic regulator controller for the linearized system. Then by blurring the membership functions of type-1 fuzzy controllers, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller is designed, aiming at dealing with uncertainties. The proposed type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers are validated through simulations, and made comparisons with each other, especially when the system is involved with uncertainties. Simulation results show that the interval type-2 fuzzy-based trajectory tracking controller provides better performance than the type-1 counterpart in terms of tracking accuracy and capacity against uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, which is an extension of Bayesian probability theory, is a useful approach to realize multisensor data fusion. It uses mass functions to represent uncertainty, which can produce a satisfactory fusion result. However, when the evidence is highly conflicting, using Dempster–Shafer evidence theory fusion rule to combine the evidence will generate the result contrary to common sense. To solve this issue, we propose a new method for conflict management based on Renyi divergence (RD). Then, by combining RD with the mass function, we develop Renyi-Belief divergence (RBD). To expand its utility, we modify it and define the modified Renyi-Belief divergence (MRBD). Our method MRBD integrates the characteristics of mass functions and can handle conflict by measuring the differences between mass functions. Experiments show that MRBD can effectively deal with conflicts. After dealing with the conflicting evidence, we realize multisensor data fusion based on the Dempster–Shafer combination rule. Moreover, we also consider the information quality and belief entropy to reinforce the credibility of evidence. A large number of examples show that the proposed method is feasible and efficient. Finally, in the application of fault diagnosis, our method can effectively determine the fault type.},

  abstract     = {Online clustering of multivariate streaming data has attracted considerable interest in recent years due to the abundance of data sources. Numerous studies in this field have been performed, but they usually suffer from the practical problems associated with discovering arbitrary-shaped clusters, specifying major parameters in advance, and detecting aberrant observations. Addressing these issues is important for online-clustering tasks, where data arrive in continuous streams and group behaviors change simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a kernel-based online dependence clustering, namely, , that not only estimates the cluster membership using one-class support vector machines (OC-SVMs), but also detects outliers distant from the identified clusters by aggregating OC-SVM decisions in a realtime basis. At the base level, we use a new measure of connective dependence that forms the graph connected via modified Markovian transitions to enable large-scale clustering. The proposed framework introduces the coherence threshold to extract data points, which can represent a cluster to which they belong, thus controlling the computational complexity without degrading the clustering performance. To track the pattern evolution over time, also updates the classifier configuration maximizing the total group connective dependence. We evaluate this framework on both several synthetic and real-world data sets involving multivariate streaming data, and compare it experimentally with other popular online-clustering methods in terms of four evaluation metrics. The results show that our framework effectively identifies the clusters and outliers, especially in various shaped data subject to change over time, without requiring any prior knowledge of the data.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, customer support systems are one of the key factors in maintaining any big company&#39;s reputation and success. These systems are capable of handling a large number of tickets systemically and provides a mechanism to track/logs the communication between customer and support agents. Companies invest huge amounts of money in training support agents and deploying customer care services for their products and services. Support agents are responsible for handling different customer queries and implementing required actions to solve a particular issue or problem raised by the service/product user. In a bigger picture, customer support systems could receive a large amount of ticket raised depending upon the number of users and services being offered. Customer care service gets directly affected due to the high volume of tickets and a limited number of support agents. Therefore, providing support agents with the recommendations about the possible resolution actions for a new ticket would be helpful and can save a lot of time. This study is focused on the development of an end-to-end framework for suggesting resolution actions rather than recommending free form resolution text against a newly raised ticket. To develop such a system, the pipeline is broadly divided into four components that are data preprocessing, actions extractor, resolution predictor, and evaluation. In actions extractor module, we have proposed a technique to identify and extract actionable phrases from resolution text. For resolution predictor, we have proposed two different pipelines that are referred as “Similarity Search Model” and “End-to-End Model.” The similarity search method is based on a ticket similarity search to find the most relevant historical tickets which then leads to corresponding resolution actions. On the other hand, end-to-end model make use of actions extractor module directly and implemented in a way to directly predict resolution actions. To compare and evaluate the mentioned methods on the same ground, we also proposed an actions evaluation criterion which uses BertScore and METEOR score jointly to compute the score against actual and predicted actions for a particular test ticket. The analysis and experiments are performed on the real-world IBM ticket data set. Overall, we observed that end-to-end model outperformed similarity search-based methods and achieved better performance and scores comparatively. The trained models and code are available at .},

  abstract     = {The physical properties required in polypropylene composites (PPCs) vary depending on the purpose of use. In the manufacturing of PPCs, it is crucial to determine the types and quantities of numerous reinforcements to meet the required physical properties. Owing to industrial complexity, most PPC manufacturers produce the composites repeatedly until the desired physical properties are obtained. Hence, to reduce trial and error, we developed prediction models for the physical properties of PPCs based on commercial recipe data. The recipe data included information about five physical properties of composites manufactured using 90 materials. In complex industrial environments, because one recipe is usually composed of 2–12 materials, numerous combinations of data sets are created. It causes the lack of the same material combination data sets and thus makes it difficult to develop a good performance model. Therefore, a novel categorization process is suggested as data preprocessing to overcome the data imbalance problem. The models for predicting the five physical properties (flexural strength, melting index, tensile strength, specific gravity, and flexural modulus) were developed using random forest, and the performance of the prediction models was improved via hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, the effects of the materials on the performance of the models were numerically described through variable importance analysis. Finally, a software was developed to implement the prediction models in the industry. The software was applied to a commercial composite and achieved high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of this study. Thus, the software suggests decision-making solutions to save cost and time by reducing the trial and error in the industrial environment with high complexity.},

  abstract     = {Considering the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the government and health sectors are incapable of making fast and reliable decisions, particularly given the various effects of decisions on different contexts or countries across multiple sectors. Therefore, leaders often seek decision support approaches to assist them in such scenarios. The most common decision support approach used in this regard is multiattribute decision-making (MADM). MADM can assist in enforcing the most ideal decision in the best way possible when fed with the appropriate evaluation criteria and aspects. MADM also has been of great aid to practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, MADM shows resilience in mitigating consequences in health sectors and other fields. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the rise of MADM techniques in combating COVID-19 by presenting a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art COVID-19 applications. Articles on related topics were searched in four major databases, namely, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from the beginning of the pandemic in 2019 to April 2021. Articles were selected on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the identified systematic review protocol, and a total of 51 articles were obtained after screening and filtering. All these articles were formed into a coherent taxonomy to describe the corresponding current standpoints in the literature. This taxonomy was drawn on the basis of four major categories, namely, medical ( = 30), social ( = 4), economic ( = 13) and technological ( = 4). Deep analysis for each category was performed in terms of several aspects, including issues and challenges encountered, contributions, data set, evaluation criteria, MADM techniques, evaluation and validation and bibliography analysis. This study emphasised the current standpoint and opportunities for MADM in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and promoted additional efforts towards understanding and providing new potential future directions to fulfil the needs of this study field.},

  abstract     = {Handing computing assets to cloud service providers (CSPs) to obtain cloud services is one of the important strategies for enterprises to embrace the digital era, and CSP selection is a crucial decision-making process for cloud deployment. However, there are many criteria involved in selecting an optimal CSP, not all of which can be accurately quantified. Therefore, CSP selection is a typical hybrid-information decision-making problem, in which criterion evaluation values are expressed in various forms. Meanwhile, the psychological behavior of the CSP selection team also has a significant impact on the decision-making result, which is poorly considered in the existing research results on CSP selection. Thus, in this paper, a new group decision-making support framework incorporating regret theory is constructed to select CSPs with hybrid information. Initially, various forms of hybrid information are processed separately to avoid the distortion of heterogeneous information caused by traditional conversion methods. Then, considering the psychology of regret aversion, the respective regret–rejoice functions for hybrid information are defined. Subsequently, regret–rejoice values are introduced into the evaluation of mixed data method framework, and a decision-making support procedure based on it is established, in which an expert weight determination method based on the maximizing consensus model is proposed, and the group best–worst method is used to calculate criteria weights. Afterwards, an illustrative example of CSP selection is given to clarify the implementation process of the proposed method. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed decision-making framework in selecting CSPs are explained through parameter analysis and comparison with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Outcome prediction aims to predict the future health condition of patients from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Because of the sequential characteristic of EHR data, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based outcome prediction methods have achieved state-of-the-art results. However, the major drawback of RNN-based outcome prediction methods is lack of interpretability, which would lead to trust issues. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes interpretable outcome prediction model with hierarchical attention (IoHAN), an interpretable outcome prediction model by leveraging attention mechanism. The main novelty of IoHAN is that it can pinpoint the fine-grained influence on the final prediction result of each medical component by decomposing the attention weights hierarchically into hospital visits, medical variables, and interactions between medical variables. We evaluated IoHAN on MIMIC-III, a large real-world EHR data set. The experiment results demonstrate that IoHAN can achieve higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art outcome prediction models.

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art adversarial attacks in the text domain have shown their power to induce machine learning models to produce abnormal outputs. The samples generated in these attacks have three important attributes: attack ability, transferability, and imperceptibility. However, compared with the other two attributes, the imperceptibility of adversarial examples has not been well investigated. Unlike the pixel-level perturbations in images, adversarial perturbations in the text are usually traceable, reflecting changes in characters, words, or sentences. The generation of imperceptible samples in texts is more difficult than in images. Therefore, how to constrain adversarial perturbations added in the text is a crucial step to construct more natural adversarial texts. Unfortunately, recent studies merely select measurements to constrain the added adversarial perturbations, but none of them explain where these measurements are suitable, which one is better, and how they perform in different kinds of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we fill this gap by comparing the performance of these metrics in various attacks. Furthermore, we propose a stricter constraint for word-level attacks to obtain more imperceptible samples. It is also helpful to enhance existing word-level attacks for adversarial training.},

Uncertainty theory is suitable for subjective estimation or situation, such as lack of historical data, and it can be employed to effectively express the uncertainty of trust and preference information in LSGDM problems. This paper studies the dimensionality reduction and subgroup optimization in LSGDM by utilizing linear uncertain variables in social networks. A clustering method is proposed to decompose the large group into several subgroups of higher consilience degrees and higher preference similarities, and lower the dimension of information for LSGDM. In the clustering process, two measurement attributes, trust relationship and preference relationship of decision-makers, are combined, and information consistent degree is utilized as the clustering indicator. This approach does not need to preset the threshold and the number of subgroups, and can be employed to obtain subgroups with similar preferences and stable trust relationship. Through the clustering reliability evaluation of subgroups, the rationality of large-scale group clustering results is verified. Subgroup consensus contribution is used to identify superior subgroups and quantify the role of subgroups in improving the consensus level. An example of emergency decision-making and comparative analysis is provided to explain the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The recommender system is of great significance to alleviate information overload. The rise of online social networks leads to a promising direction—social recommendation. By injecting the interaction influence among social users, recommendation performance has been further improved. Successful as they are, we argue that most social recommendation methods are still not sufficient to make full use of social network information. Existing solutions typically either considered only the local neighbors or treat neighbors’ information equally, even or both. However, few studies have attempted to solve these social recommendation problems jointly from both the perspective of social depth and social strength. Recently, graph convolutional neural networks have shown great potential in learning graph data by modeling the information propagation and aggregation process. Thus, we propose an (abbreviated as SAN) model to build a recommendation system. Different from previous work, our proposed SAN model simulates the recursive social aggregation process to spread the global social influence, and simultaneously introduces social attention mechanism to incorporate the heterogeneous influences for better model user embedding. Instead of a shallow linear interaction function, we adopt multi-layer perception to model the complex user–item interaction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed model SAN, and further analysis verifies the generalization and flexibility of the model.},

  abstract     = {Recently several novel cost-sensitive attribute-scale selection approaches have been proposed based on measurement errors. They are significant because they can simultaneously select attributes and scale combination to minimize the cost consumed in data processing. However, these approaches cannot deal with hybrid data with test cost constraint, and most of them do not consider the scale diversity between different attributes; and these approaches do not touch the uncertainty measurement, all of which are important issues in real applications. To address this situation, in this paper an effective cost-sensitive attribute-scale selection approach is presented based on the rough set theory, and multiple relevant uncertainty measures are developed. The main contributions of the paper are threefold. First, a generalized confidence level vector-based neighborhood rough set model is constructed. It takes into account the scale diversity between different attributes of hybrid data. Then, multiple uncertainty measures are developed. They consider both attributes and scales, thus are more general than existing ones which consider only attributes or only scales. Finally, an efficient heuristic attribute-scale selection algorithm is designed, which can select attributes and their respective scales to minimize the consumed total cost of hybrid data under any rational value of test cost upper bound. Detailed experiments thoroughly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed cost-sensitive attribute-scale selection approach. The experiments also reveal the influences of different test cost upper bounds to the attribute-scale selection and some related quantities including the uncertainty measures. This study would enrich the rough set theory to some extent, and provide an effective support for some test cost-constrained decision makings.},

  abstract     = {Pattern recognition from two-dimensional (2D) images is an indispensable tache in computer vision. However, one legacy hinders its progress: multifarious visual distortions (e.g., partially occluded signs, fisheye respective, affine or 3D projections) caused by spatiotemporal-varying perturbations (e.g., shrunk, sharpening, overexposure, jitter, and motion) significantly degrade the performance of neural networks in terms of high-level intelligent behaviors (e.g., target localization and recognition). Leveraging the growing availability of capsule network (CapsNet), we suppress the deformation effect to the final prediction by proposing a CapsNetORB framework to implement distorted target recognition. Two highlights, the customized Siamese CapsNet (S-CapsNet) and vector-based oriented fast and rotated brief (VB-ORB), can cast a mutual positive stimulation: the former encodes capsule feature vectors for the later, whilst the later detects space-scale invariant interval dimensions (instead of pixels) to bridge association between source standard images (high-quality training images) and distorted ones (testing images). Thus, the category of one source standard image owning the most correspondences is the final predicted category. We believe that capsule vectors own higher representability and stability compared with conventional pixels/feature maps, which can be well exploited in feature learning while resisting visual distortions. Experimentally, we show that employing our pipeline for distorted target categorization can outperform state-of-the-arts by delivering promising performance on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and our hand-crafted data set.},

  abstract     = {Gradient-based optimizer (GBO) is a metaphor-free mathematic-based algorithm proposed in recent years. Encouraged by the gradient-based Newton&#39;s method, this algorithm combines with population-based evolutionary methods. The disadvantage of the traditional GBO algorithm is that the global search ability of the algorithm is too strong, and the local search ability is too weak; accordingly, it is difficult to obtain the global optimal solution efficiently. Therefore, a new improved GBO algorithm (GOMGBO) is developed to mitigate such performance concerns by introducing a Gaussian bare-bones mechanism, an opposition-based learning mechanism, and a moth spiral mechanism enhanced GBO algorithm. The proposed GOMGBO has been compared against many famous methods and improved variants on 30 benchmark functions. The experimental results show that GOMGBO has apparent advantages in convergence speed and precision. In addition, this paper analyzes the balance and diversity of the GOMGBO algorithm and compares GOMGBO with other algorithms on several engineering problems. The experimental results show that the GOMGBO algorithm is also better than the competitive algorithm in engineering problems. This study uses the GOMGBO algorithm to optimize kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), and a new GOMGBO-KELM model is proposed. The model is used to deal with four clinical disease diagnosis problems. Compared with GBO-KELM, back propagation neural network algorithm, and other models, comparative experiments show that GOMGBO-KELM has high performance in dealing with practical cases. We invite the community to investigate further our method for solving problems more efficiently with reasonable speed and efficiency. Readers of this study can refer to for any guidance about the proposed GOMGBO method.},

However, most of them suffer from the irrelevance of semantic awareness when identifying various manipulation categories. This leads to false alarms on recognizing forged regions. In this paper, we propose a rogressively-efined Neural work (PR-Net), to localize the tampered regions progressively under a coarse-to-fine workflow. Specifically, PR-Net is composed of a Feature Extractor (FE) that captures feature intrinsic correlations and a Mask Generation Module (MGM) with three refining generators. The FE takes a CNN to extract the image features and introduces an attention mechanism Convolution Block Attention Module (CBAM) to suppress the image content and guide the extractor in exploring the inconsistencies between the manipulated and authentic regions. The MGM comprises three generators where the Coarse Mask RR-Generator generates a localization result roughly, the Candidate Mask RR-Generator generates a possible tampered region according to the rough localization measure, and the Fine Mask RR-Generator produces the final prediction of manipulated regions. We also utilize the Rotated Residual (RR) structure to suppress the image content during the generative process. The extensive experimental results on four benchmark data sets (NIST16, COVER, CASIA v1.0, and In-The-Wild) demonstrate the superior performance of PR-Net compared with the state-of-the-art methods in localizing the manipulated regions.},

However, DNNs show vulnerability to adversarial examples, which results in security risks. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately study the internal mechanism of adversarial examples to build more effective supervision models. When coming to practical applications, supervision models are mostly faced with black-box attacks, where cross-model transferability of adversarial examples has attracted increasing attention. In this paper, to improve the transferability of adversarial examples, we propose , which incorporates an attention mechanism to disrupt the most distinctive features and simultaneously ensures adversarial attack invariance under different transformations. Specifically, we . Meanwhile, considering the lack of semantics in low-level features, .

To this end, we propose a two-stage semisupervised learning framework. In the first stage, we train two Self-supervised Models (SSMs). One model is initialized by predicting the rotation angles of pretransformed training images and then further trained by the labeled images. The other model is initialized by making consistent predictions for the transformed images in color, shape, and quality from the same sample image, and then further trained by the labeled images. In the second stage, we fuse the two SSMs through deep mutual learning, which enhances each of the two SSMs with the complementary information provided by the other such that the correct prediction could be shared. Experimental results on CIFAR and Caltech-256 data sets demonstrate the effect of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the widespread deployment of face and speaker recognition systems, research on attacks on neural-network-based biometric systems, which involves face or voice signal classification problems with a low-dimensional output vector, has drawn increasing attention. Recently, cross-modal voice-to-face (VTF) systems have learned to generate faces from voices by matching several biometric characteristics of the generated faces to those of speakers. However, attacks focusing on VTF systems with high-dimensional face image outputs have not yet been conducted. In this paper, we introduce various adversarial attack methods for the VTF system under different attack conditions. These methods can generate a fake face close to the target face or far from the original face, by adding subtle perturbations to the original voice. Under the white-box setting, we formulate a multiobjective optimization to generate target faces and improve the imperceptibility of the adversarial sample. Further a stepwise iterative optimization strategy is proposed to achieve faster and more effective attacks. Finally, the results of comparative experiments with various methods are demonstrated. Under the black-box setting, the adversarial samples generated from surrogate models are able to generate the fake face far from the original one. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results show the high target face-matching rate and irrelevance to the original face, as well as the imperceptibility of the adversarial audio. This study provides useful insights for privacy protection and improving generation robustness for information security.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has become an emerging technical for image manipulation localization, which can automatically recognize abnormal traces caused by manipulation. However, as manipulations mainly happens in the foreground regions, these methods largely focus on the foreground contents and neglect the background, which contain complementary signal for fully understanding the image and are meaningful for manipulation localization. We propose a Mutually-Complementary Network (MC-Net), which is a two-branch network to operate the foreground and background features, respectively. To distill complementary signals from the features, we propose a mutual attentive module composed of self-feature attentive, and cross-feature attentive components to advance the communication across the foreground and background branches. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed MC-Net distinctly improves the prediction of foreground and background, obtains consistent performance increments on four benchmark data sets, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the prevalence of digital cameras, multimedia data have been used to record facts and provide evidence of events. However, the integrity of multimedia data is vulnerable to attacks with the proliferation of data tampering tools. In fact, an effective multimedia content authentication system should support compliant editing (cropping, rotation, compression, and so forth) and have the ability to detect malicious data tampering. Data traceability is a feasible strategy to verify the integrity and provenance of multimedia data. Besides, the privacy of multimedia data needs to be protected to prevent unauthorized access. In this paper, we trace transformations of multimedia data privately by integrating a transparent and immutable blockchain with trusted hardware that provides the capability of private computation. Our system exploits a hybrid storage pattern that separately stores multimedia data off the blockchain and their hashes on the blockchain. With this, our system ensures data integrity and addresses the issue of blockchain&#39;s storage capability. Experimental results and analysis show that our solution is efficient and verifiable. A lightweight verifier merely needs to store block headers and is able to validate query results returned by full nodes.},

  abstract     = {Media recommender systems aim to capture users’ preferences and provide precise personalized recommendation of media content. There are two critical components in the common paradigm of modern recommender models: (1) representation learning, which generates an embedding for each user and item; and (2) interaction modeling, which fits user preferences toward items based on their representations. In spite of great success, when a great amount of users and items exist, it usually needs to create, store, and optimize a huge embedding table, where the scale of model parameters easily reach millions or even larger. Hence, it naturally raises questions about the heavy recommender models: Do we really need such large-scale parameters? We get inspirations from the recently proposed lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), which argues that the dense and over-parameterized model contains a much smaller and sparser sub-model that can reach comparable performance to the full model. In this paper, we extend LTH to media recommender systems, aiming to find the winning tickets in deep recommender models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study LTH in media recommender systems. With Matrix Factorization and Light Graph Convolution Networks as the backbone models, we found that there widely exist winning tickets in recommender models. On three media convergence data sets—Yelp2018, TikTok and Kwai, the winning tickets can achieve comparable recommendation performance with only , and of parameters, respectively.},

To avoid the time-consuming and tedious labeling of real images, virtual data sets with large-scale synthetic images have recently been constructed to perform annotation-free model training. However, current methods fail to exploit the potential of virtual data search, that is, searching valuable and representative virtual subdata set for efficient training. This paper presents a novel data sampling strategy from both semantic and feature levels to perform an effective data search. The semantic level determines the sample number of each vehicle identity via the consistency constraint of attribute distribution for source domain and target domain; while the feature level searches valuable and representative samples of each vehicle identity. To our knowledge, we are among the first attempts to search effective virtual data to perform annotation-free vehicle re-ID. Extensive cross-domain experiments from virtual vehicle re-ID data sets to real vehicle re-ID data sets show that our data sampling strategy can significantly reduce the training data volume and even boost the re-ID performance.},

Recently, some methods have been proposed to address this problem. However, they all employ unidirectional difference localization to identify the changes. This can lead to ambiguity about the nature of the changes. Instead, we propose a framework with bidirectional difference localization and semantic consistency reasoning to describe the image changes. First, we locate the changes in the two images by capturing bidirectional differences. Then we design a decoder with spatial-channel attention to generate the change caption. Finally, we introduce semantic consistency reasoning to constrain our bidirectional difference localization module and spatial-channel attention module. Extensive experiments on three public data sets show that the performance of our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art change captioning models by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {Grayscale image colorization, especially for ethnic costume images, is highly challenging due to its rich and complex color features. The existing image colorization methods usually take the costume image as a whole in practical applications that lead to the ignorance of the semantic information of different parts of the costume. It is known that each part&#39;s color distribution of the ethnic costume is different. So, the color mapping of other parts is also diverse, which is determined by distinctive ethnic characteristics. This study introduces fine-grained level semantic information and proposes a high-resolution image colorization model for ethnic costumes targeting enhancement, inspired by semantic-level colorization. The semantic information of different regions of ethnic costumes has a significant impact on the performance of the coloring task. Using Pix2PixHD as the backbone network, we create a new network architecture that maintains color distribution correspondence and spatial consistency of costume images using fine-grained semantic information. In our network, we take the splice result of fine-grained semantic for ethnic costume and grayscale image as the conditions and then feed them into the generative adversarial networks. We also discuss and analyze the influences of the grayscale channel and fine-grained semantics on discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs well compared with other state-of-the-art automatic colorization methods.},

Generative ZSL models synthesize the visual features of unseen classes and convert ZSL task into a classical supervised learning problem. These generative ZSL models are trained by using the seen classes. Although promising progress has been achieved in the ZSL and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) tasks. The existing approaches still suffer from a strong bias problem between unseen and seen classes, where unseen objects in the target domain tend to be recognized as seen classes in the source domain. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel named semantic consistent Wasserstein generative adversarial network (scWGAN), which uses a semantic reconstructor to reconstruct semantic embeddings from generated visual features by incorporating a novel Semantic Consistent Loss noted . The Semantic Consistent Loss guides our proposed scWGAN to generate visual features that mirror the semantic relationships between seen and unseen classes. We also introduce a visual classifier to constrain visual feature generator. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach is superior to previous state-of-the-art works under both traditional ZSL and challenging GZSL settings on six popular data sets AWA1, AWA2, CUB, APY, and SUN.},

The experimental results show that Qianhai is the key monitoring area, and its impact range is 10.36 m. On this basis, we deploy the sensors using particle swarm optimisation.

The content of these opinions is very challenging, including information about the hospital services but also stories about their own patients, their families, and personal feelings or beliefs before or after leaving a hospital. Therefore, the task of recommending hospitals according to the quality of their services becomes really complicated. This study describes an application for ranking hospitals based on the user preferences about the different offered services as well as the opinions about them. First, it semiautomatically classifies all predefined hospital aspects, calculates the sentiment orientation, and represents their associated polarity by intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Second, by means of the user preferences towards the different aspects, an aggregation operator, and a multicriteria decision-making algorithm, all hospitals are ranked. To assess this methodology, a large set of reviews about hospitals have been collected. Further, considering all patient ratings about the different hospitals, an algorithm for ranking them is proposed, which develops baselines for comparison. In addition, an interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy approach has been also implemented to compare the obtained results. These results confirm the soundness of the proposal.},

Advances in analytical tools, such as global news dashboards, can provide current information on changes to global sentiment. In particular, identifying unexpected shifts in sentiment following a major news event may better inform stakeholders’ actions. This paper defines a methodology to evaluate global sentiment for periods before, during, and after a major event. Each period&#39;s sentiment can be derived from news articles generated by news outlets. The sentiment is expressed in terms of hesitant linguistic terms to capture the range of sentiments articulated in each article. This representation is advantageous as it permits the interpretation of sentiments without conversion to numerical values. Sentiment from each article considered is aggregated into three centralized sentiments representing periods before, during, and after a particular event. This leads to a second enhancement to existing methods where the concept of a central opinion is represented in hesitant linguistic terms. Each of these sentiments is associated with a measure of consensus indicating the degree of agreement among the articles within their corresponding periods. A real case is presented for a noteworthy event in recent history. Three thousand three hundred fifty-two articles that referenced both the World Health Organization and President Trump during the 2-week period surrounding the event are analyzed. The results show that the methodology presented can detect changes in aggregated sentiment and consensus. When compared with means of aggregation based on crisp approaches, our model is more sensitive to shifts in sentiment. This type of information can better inform policy makers about public opinion as it not only detects shifts in sentiment but also discourses among citizens.},

One of the key characteristics of such indices is the Pigou–Dalton (P-D) principle, also known as the principle of progressive transfers, whereby proportional redistribution from larger to smaller arguments should increase (or decrease, depending on the context) the overall measure of social or economic welfare, diversity and so on. Previous studies have identified the ordered weighted averaging operators as being appropriate for welfare measurement, subject to conditions on the weighting vectors. We propose the Choquet integral, defined with respect to a capacity or fuzzy measure, as a candidate for defining nonsymmetric measures of welfare. This allows for importance and interaction to be modelled between inputs while still satisfying the P-D principle. We extend the buoyancy concept to fuzzy measures and characterise the resulting classes of buoyant and antibuoyant fuzzy measures. We then turn to the problem of optimisation of the Choquet integral subject to linear constraints, which in the case of antibuoyant fuzzy measures permits an efficient linear programming solution.},

Additionally, it enables to consider high-order relationships, so not only essential genes related to the disease are considered, but also the combined effect of various secondary genes that can influence different pathways directly or indirectly related to the disease. The prime hypothesis is that splitting genomic cancer data into two subsets, that is, cases and controls, will allow us to determine which genes, and their expressions, are associated with different cancer types. The possibilities of the proposal are demonstrated by analyzing RNA-Seq data for six different types of cancer: breast, colon, lung, thyroid, prostate, and kidney. Some of the extracted insights were already described in the related literature as good cancer bio-markers, while others have not been described yet mainly due to existing techniques are biased by prior knowledge provided by biological databases.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning algorithms are widely used for cybersecurity applications, include spam, malware detection. In these applications, the machine learning model has to face attack by adversarial samples. Therefore, how to train a robust machine learning model with small samples is a very hot research problem. portable document format (PDF) is a widely used file format, and often utilized as a vehicle for malicious behavior. There have been various PDF malware detectors based on machine learning. However, the labeling of large-scale data samples is time-consuming and laborious. This paper aims to reduce the size of training set while maintain the performance of detection. We propose a novel PDF malware detection method, using active learning to boost training. Particularly, we first make clear the meaning of uncertain samples in this paper, and theoretically explain the effectiveness of these uncertain samples for malware detection. Second, we present an active-learning based malware detection model, using mutual agreement analysis to choose the uncertain sample as the data augmentation. The detector is retrained according to the ground truth of the uncertain samples rather than the whole test samples in the previous epoch, which can not only improve the detection performance, but also reduce the training time consumption of the detector. We conduct 10 epochs of retraining experiments for comparison, using the uncertain samples and the whole test samples from the previous epoch respectively as training set augmentation. The experimental results show that our active-learning based model can achieve the same performance as the traditional model in the tenth epoch of retraining, while the former only needs to use one thirtieth of the latter&#39;s training samples.},

  abstract     = {Most existing studies that employ social-trust information to solve the data sparsity issue in recommender systems assume that socially connected users have equal influence on each other. However, this assumption does not hold in practice since users and their friends may not have similar interests because social connections are multifaceted and exhibit heterogeneous strengths in different scenarios. Therefore, estimating the diverse levels of influence among entities (users/items/social connections) is very important in advancing social recommender systems. Towards this goal, we propose a new model named Social-Trust-Aware Variational Recommendation (SOAP-VAE). Particularly, SOAP-VAE leverages graph attention network techniques to capture the varying levels of influence and the complex interaction patterns among all the entities collectively and holistically. In doing so, heterogeneity among entities is obtained seamlessly. Consequently, we generate social-trust-aware item embedding representations in which the right level of influence has been integrated. Next, based on these rich social-trust-aware item representations, we formulate the social-trust-aware prior in literature. Unlike priors utilized in earlier VAE-based recommendation models, this novel prior aids in dealing with the issue of posterior-collapse and can effectively capture the uncertainty of latent space. In effect, the model produces better latent representations, which significantly alleviates the data sparsity issue. Finally, we empirically show that SOAP-VAE outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world data sets.},

The agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach is applied to group experts into subclusters based on the constructed similarity—trust degrees. The centrality concept from SNA is then used to determine the expert&#39;s similarity–trust centrality (STC) index, which is the basis for the construction of a new aggregation operator, STC-induced ordered weighted averaging operator, to fuse the individual experts&#39; preferences into a collective one, from which the consensus solution is derived. An analysis of results with different levels of trust degree is carried out.

COVID-19 continues to cause widespread economic and social turmoil, and while the current focus is on both minimising the spread of the disease and deploying a range of vaccines to save lives, attention will soon turn to future proofing. In line with this, this paper proposes a prediction and containment model that could be used for pandemics and natural disasters. It combines selective lockdowns and protective cordons to rapidly contain the hazard while allowing minimally impacted local communities to conduct “business as usual” and/or offer support to highly impacted areas. A flexible, easy to use data analytics model, based on Self Organising Maps, is developed to facilitate easy decision making by governments and organisations. Comparative tests using publicly available data for Great Britain (GB) show that through the use of the proposed prediction and containment strategy, it is possible to reduce the peak infection rate, while keeping several regions (up to 25\% of GB parliamentary constituencies) economically active within protective cordons.},

The structured framework is developed using an integrated fuzzy lambda–tau and fuzzy multicriteria decision-making methods. Reliability parameters are formulated for assessing the failure behavior of AHU using the fuzzy lambda–tau approach. Repair time parameter for the AHU system shows an increasing trend with a 0.6840\% increase as the spread increases from ±15\% to ±25\% and 0.5981\% when spread increases from ±25\% to ±60\%. Furthermore, the availability of the system decreases by 0.0335\% with increase in spread from ±15\% to ±25\% and further decreases to 0.0315\% with spread increases from ±25\% to ±60\%. Under risk analysis, possible failure causes with their fuzzy rating are listed under the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) approach. Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) and combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) methods are further applied within the FMEA approach for identifying the most critical failure causes. Improper design (BT), excessive gas volume (FH), chocking/blockage (WA), and scanty lubrication/greasing (SP) associated with bottom ash handling, the fly ash handling system, wetting unit and ash disposal pipeline, and slurry pump with EDAS outputs (0.1464, 0.1090, 0.0918, 0.000) and CODAS outputs (3.3962, 3.5208, 2.6562, 2.0877) are found responsible for sudden failure of the considered unit.

Several data sets stimulate original, and resolutive data analysis approaches, demonstrating the importance of the dropout phenomenon. This study proposes a novel approach to predicting massive online open course (MOOC) students at risk of dropout stressing the need to consider the temporal dimension in the data log. The proposal aims to build a data-driven decision support system able to identify students at risk of dropout based on the conceptualization of such students&#39; behavior and its evolution along the time dimension. The primary theoretical model behind the proposed method is the formal concept analysis, and its temporal extension (i.e., temporal concept analysis) for analyzing timestamped data and carrying out a timed lattice. The main result of the paper is a method to extract behavioral patterns of MOOC students at risk of dropout. Such patterns are defined as Time-based Behavior Rules extracted from the aforementioned timed lattice obtained through the preprocessing of MOOC platform log files. The resulting rule set can be easily integrated for implementing educational DSS, as shown in the last part of the paper. The conducted experiments reveal promising results in terms of F-score and students&#39; monitoring time.},

To alleviate the information lag between the release of the Centers for Disease Control&#39;s influenza-like illness (ILI) reports and real-time influenza activity, we incorporate Google search data and holiday effects to facilitate the ILI nowcasting. We develop a deep learning framework by extending the spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) to nowcast ILI rates in irregular-shaped region. We investigate the effect of temporal and spatial dependencies among irregular-shaped regions as well as external influence on ILI nowcasting. Various forecasting models, including time series models, penalized regression models, and other deep learning models, are employed for evaluating the performance of the proposed framework. Moreover, based on city-level ILI data in Taiwan, we conduct extensive experiments for methods validation. The results show that the extended ST-ResNet can effectively capture the complex spatiotemporal dependencies of ILI activity and the effects of external variables. Additionally, the strategy of incorporating Google search data and holiday effects improves the prediction. The findings may provide insights into the utility of various statistical and deep learning methods for effective ILI tracking at regional level and facilitate informed decision making for public health authorities.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty is often occurred in real-life decision-making problems due to the lack of complete information, imprecise data, and the vagueness of decision making experts in qualitative judgment, thus, the crisp values of criteria may be insufficient to handle such types of complex real situations. As the extension of fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set and Pythagorean fuzzy set, the Fermatean Fuzzy Set (FFS) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to handle the uncertainty arisen in practical decision-making problems. Thus, this study aims to introduce an integrated Fermatean fuzzy information-based decision-making method by combining method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) and additive ratio assessment (ARAS) methods with the application in a food waste treatment technology selection problem. By using Fermatean fuzzy numbers, the suggested approach successfully handle the qualitative data and uncertain information that often occur in practical situations. This study consists of four phases. First, entropy measure is developed for FFS and further utilized for determining the experts’ weights. Second, some Fermatean fuzzy Heronian mean operators and their properties are introduced to aggregate the Fermatean fuzzy information. These operators can provide us a valuable means to handle practical multicriteria decision-making problems on FFSs context. Third, an extended MEREC technique is originated to assess objective criteria weights within FFS context. Fourth, an integrated ARAS method is introduced with the combination of proposed entropy measure, generalized weighted Fermatean fuzzy Heronian mean operator and MEREC technique to evaluate and rank the alternatives. To confirm the reasonableness and practicality of the proposed methodology, an empirical case study of food waste treatment technology selection is discussed on FFSs settings. Further, a comparison with extant models and a sensitivity investigation are performed to confirm the validity and robustness of the obtained outcomes.},

Traditional feature-based methods heavily rely on the quality of handcrafted features, requiring extensive domain knowledge and hard to generalize to new domains. Recently, inspired by the success of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, researchers have developed neural network-based approaches for tackling this problem. However, existing deep learning-based methods either focused on modeling the temporal characteristics of cascades but ignored the structural information or failed to take the order-scale and position-scale into consideration in modeling structures of information propagation. This paper proposed a novel graph neural network-based model, called MUCas, to learn the latent representations of cascade graphs from a multi-scale perspective, which can make full use of the direction-scale, high-order-scale, position-scale, and dynamic-scale of cascades via a newly designed MUlti-scale Graph Capsule Network (MUG-Caps) and the influence-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world data sets demonstrate that our MUCas significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning has made tremendous progress and applied to various critical practical applications. However, recent studies have shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to malicious attackers, such as neural network backdoor triggering. A successful backdoor triggering behavior may cause serious consequences, such as allowing the attacker to bypass the identity verification and directly enter the system. In image classification, there is always only one target label triggered by one backdoor trigger in previous works. The position of the backdoor trigger is also fixed, which brings limitations to the attack. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes one trigger pattern to correspond to multiple target labels, and the location of the trigger is not limited. In our method, the trigger guarantees that the malicious output is within the range of multiple targets chosen by the attacker, but the specific target depends on the original image where the trigger is pasted. Due to the original images&#39; diversity, it is difficult for the defender to predict which target the image with the trigger is classified as. Besides, the attacker can use only one trigger pattern to achieve multitarget attacks at different locations, which brings more flexibility. We also proposed to train a neural network as a detector to distinguish backdoor images and clean images for multitarget backdooring attacks. Experiment results show that the detection method can also successfully detect the backdoor image with a trigger at a random location of the image, and the detection success rate is as high as 86.02\%.},

  abstract     = {Secure data-sharing technology is a bridge for various collaborative operations among intelligent terminals in the edge-cloud collaborative application scenario. For the shared data involves different levels of confidentiality, intelligent terminals for collaborative operations may be distributed in multiple management domains, and the private information of intelligent terminals is easy to be leaked in edge-cloud collaboration scenarios, the security of data sharing is severely threatened. To solve these problems, this paper proposed a fine-grained and traceable multidomain secure data-sharing model for intelligent terminals. In this model, a key self-certification algorithm is proposed, which avoids potential security threats of key leakage during the key distribution process. The model combines attribute encryption and threshold function to achieve more fine-grained and more flexible secure data sharing; it uses blockchain technology to achieve integrity verification of stored data and traceability of shared data, and it combines on-chain and off-chain databases to achieve rapid retrieval and positioning of shared data distributed among multiple domains, which improves the efficiency of data sharing among domains. The security of the model proposed by us is proved, and compared with the cited literature, it is shown that the proposed model has certain advantages in terms of computational complexity and time consumption.},

  abstract     = {The increasing desire for distributed computing systems has attracted huge interest in memory and computing resources. The cloud provides on-demand access to provide a flexible allocation of resources for reliable services. Therefore, there should be a provision in which resources are accessible to request users to satisfy user needs. In classical techniques, the allocation of resources by satisfying power and Quality-of-Services is a challenging aspect. This paper devises a novel technique for optimal resource allocation, namely, Exponentially Spider Monkey Optimization (E-SMO). Here, the proposed E-SMO is devised by combining Exponential Weighted Moving Average and Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO). Besides, the fitness function is newly devised considering resource utilization and resource cost. After that, the cloud resources employ a switching strategy to reduce power consumption to prevent the switching of redundant servers. For optimal switching, the proposed E-SMO is utilized with other fitness factors that compute the number of applications assigned in the physical machine using the switching state is in OFF condition. Thus, the server switching model is incorporated to activate or deactivate the server when not in use for effective resources utilization. The proposed E-SMO algorithm outperformed other methods with the maximal resource utilization of 0.874, the minimal resource cost of 0.302, and the minimal power usage of 0.275.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of Extensible Markup Language (XML) for data representation, there is a lot of interest in searching XML data. Due to the structural heterogeneity of XML, it is daunting for users to formulate exact queries and search for accurate answers. Especially when performing queries on fuzzy spatiotemporal data, the imprecision and uncertainty of information make the amount of query results is small or even empty. In this case, query relaxation is necessary. Existing efforts are mainly made on expanding simple queries. Once there are multiple conditions in the query, the existing algorithms often have poor performance. To address this problem, we first propose an adaptive query relaxation algorithm based on XML, which can handle complex queries efficiently. The approach does not depend on any specific domain or user, it can adaptively relax the initial query requirements, and classify the results into two sets after query relaxation. Moreover, the algorithm prestores the potential matching objects in the auxiliary structure, which provides support for efficient query. In addition, after query relaxation, we present the result sorting algorithm to address the problem of information overload. Finally, we report experimental results to show that our algorithms are superior to previous approaches.},

  abstract     = {Decision-making under uncertainty is consistently an essential fear and the most challenging circle of exploration. To manage the uncertainty, the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) assumes a critical part in taking care of the conditions wherein decision-makers furnish an alternative with a grade of membership and a nonmembership. Distance measures of IFSs are apparatuses used in different decision-making problems, such as medical investigation, pattern recognition, multicriteria decision-making, clustering problems, and other real-world problems. As such, various distance measures were developed by different researchers and applied to decision-making problems with situation-based deficiencies. Motivated by this, in this paper, a symmetric distance formula is being proposed for effectively determining the distance between the information held by IFSs. The distance formula involves membership degree, nonmembership degree, the difference of the minimum of the cross-evaluation factor, and the difference of the maximum of the cross-evaluation factor. Furthermore, it is being proved that the proposed distance formula follows all the axiomatic definitions of a distance measure. Numerical examples depict the efficiency of the proposed distance measure. Hence, this measure is being applied to practical problems of decision-making, pattern recognition, and clustering problems. This measure is not restricted to a particular domain of study; it can be effectively applied in diverse decision-making problems.},

This study first develop a fractional fuzzy set (FFS) and their operations, the FFS is a more generalized and accurate tool for describing uncertainty in real-life data information. A new form of decision technique for dealing with the issue of choice based on DTRSs is included in the three-way decisions. The loss function of DTRSs is being used in the proposed decision method model. Initially, the idea of fractional fuzzy α-covering (FF α-covering), fractional fuzzy α–neighborhood (FF α–neighborhood) was introduced. Under the fractional fuzzy state, we integrated the loss function of DTRSs with covering-based fractional fuzzy rough sets. Furthermore, we proposed and established performance characteristics for a new fractional fuzzy α-covering decision-theoretical rough sets model (FFCDTRSs). Then, according to the level of fractional fuzzy numbers (FFN&#39;s) positive and negative membership and related three-way decision-making, four methods to solve the expected loss expressed in the form of (FFNs) are described. We have developed a multicriteria decision algorithm (MCDM) based on FFCDTRS. Then an example is used to prove the feasibility of the four methods to solve the MCDM problem. Finally, the results of four distinct decision procedures with various loss functions are compared. The proposed three-way decision-making models are more accurate as compared with particular fuzzy sets.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient motion policies for multiagents is a challenge in a decentralized dynamic situation, where each agent plans its own paths without knowing the policies of the other agents involved. This paper presents an efficient learning-based motion planning method for multiagent systems. It adopts the framework of multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to directly map partially observed information to motion commands for multiple agents. To improve the efficiency of MADDPG in sample utilization, so as to train more brilliant agents that can adapt to more complex environments, a strategy named mixed experience (ME) is introduced to MADDPG, and this has led to our proposed ME-MADDPG algorithm. The novel ME strategy can be embodied into three specific mechanisms: (1) an artificial potential field-based sample generator to produce high-quality samples in the early training stage; (2) a dynamic mixed sampling strategy to mix the training data from different sources with a variable proportion; (3) a delayed learning skill to stabilize the training of the multiple agents. A series of experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed ME-MADDPG algorithm, and it has been demonstrated that, compared with MADDPG, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the convergence speed and convergence effect in the training process, and it has also shown better efficiency and better adaptability in complex dynamic environments while it is used for multiagent motion planning applications.},

In this paper, the slime mould algorithm (SMA) is optimized by introducing the composite mutation strategy (CMS) and restart strategy (RS). The improved SMA is named CMSRSSMA, which stands for the CMS, RS, and the improved SMA. The CMS is utilized to increase the population diversity, and the RS is used to avoid the local optimum. In this paper, the CEC2017 benchmark function is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed CMSRSSMA. Then, the CMSRSSMA-SVM model is proposed for feature selection and parameter optimization simultaneously. The performance of the model is tested by 14 data sets from UCI data repository. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, number of features and fitness value on most selected data sets.},

Source domain feature space was divided into multiple bins and the features of the target domains were sampled to fill the bins. The most similar domains were selected based on the similarity statistics of the sample features. We implemented the BS algorithm combined with the popular convolutional neural networks, pretrained the network on the selected similar subdata sets, and subsequently fine-tuned it on the fine-grained data sets.

  abstract     = {Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) is an extremely hot topic issue in One-Class Classification (OCC), which has displayed outstanding performance in dealing with many novelty detection problems. However, SVDD just takes the data description by the kernel-based distance among each instance into consideration rather than considering the distribution of the data. Therefore, Fuzzy Support Vector Data Description (Fuzzy-SVDD) has been developed to distribute a fuzzy membership to each input sample so that different samples cause different contributions to classification boundary. The majority of the methods in Fuzzy-SVDD are based on the sample density, but there are remaining two problems. These density-based Fuzzy-SVDD methods would decrease the contribution of support vectors (SVs) in low densities. What is more, these methods cannot get a precise density when there are few target samples. These two problems would lead to a poor classification boundary. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel method called Boundary-based Fuzzy-SVDD (BF-SVDD) is proposed in this paper. BF-SVDD uses a new definition called local–global center distance to search for the samples near the boundary. Then, it enhances fuzzy memberships of these samples because they carry more significant information for the decision boundary than other data. The contribution of this paper can be summarized into three main points. First a novel concept called local–global center distances is proposed to find the SVs better. Second, fuzzy memberships with local–global center distance make SVs more informative to create the decision boundary. Furthermore, the experiments based on University of California, Irvine and Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning also show that the proposed method has excellent performances. Even for the minority class in imbalance data sets, the proposed method can also have a good classification.},

SNNs have become one of the mainstream frameworks in the field of brain-like computing. However, most of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron models currently used by SNNs based on direct training of backpropagation (BP) do not consider the changes in the recurrent connections and the dynamic strength of neuron connections over time. This study presented the LIF neuron model with recurrent connections and a method for dynamically changing the presynaptic currents. Recurrent LIF neurons have an additional cyclic connection compared with classic LIF neurons. Their postsynaptic current stimulates a change in membrane potential at the next time point. Their dynamics were more similar to the activities of biological neurons. We also proposed an efficient and flexible BP training method for recurrent LIF neurons. On the basis of the above methods, we proposed the recurrent SNN with dynamic presynaptic currents based on backpropagation (RDS-BP). We test the proposed RDS-BP on three image data sets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10) and two text data sets (IMDB and TREC). The results showed that the performance of RDS-BP not only exceeded the naive SNN models based on BP but also exceeded the SNN methods proposed in previous studies in recent years, which had excellent performance in previous experiments. Our work provides a new LIF neuron model with a recurrent connection and dynamic presynaptic current and a BP training arrangement for the proposed neuron, which could merit developments with neuromorphic and brain-like computing.},

In a multisource fusion indoor positioning system, providing the guidance information for the deployment of positioning sources is a key technology, which can optimize the infrastructure resources to provide higher positioning accuracy. The error models of single-source positioning such as the received signal strength (RSS) fingerprint and the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) should be extended to meet the requirement of multisource indoor positioning for positioning error estimation. This paper proposes a model that combines the RSS fingerprint and PDR positioning error models for fusion positioning error simulation, which weights the PDR and RSS fingerprint positioning results and calculates the mean square error for the fusion positioning according to their positioning variances. This model is also used to establish an indoor positioning simulation system. To validate the proposed model, an experiment is performed which compared the actual positioning errors using the fusion positioning with the errors of the simulate model.

  abstract     = {Real-world applications often involve multifaceted data with several reasonable interpretations. To cluster this data, we need methods that are able to produce multiple clustering solutions. To this purpose, it is interesting to learn a finite mixture model with multiple latent variables, where each latent variable represents a unique way to partition the data. However, although there is an extensive literature on multipartition clustering methods for categorical data and for continuous data, there is a lack of work for mixed data. In this paper, we propose a multipartition clustering method that is able to efficiently deal with mixed data by exploiting the Bayesian network factorization and the variational Bayes framework. We show the flexibility and applicability of the proposed method by solving clustering, density estimation, and missing data imputation tasks in real-world data sets. For reproducibility, all code, data, and results can be found in the following public repository: .},

This paper intends to propose a deep learning-based image compression model with a lifting scheme for predicting high-frequency subbands. Moreover, the fine-tuning in lifting factorization is done by a new Sea Lion with Averaged Update Evaluation that includes new cosine estimation under the COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer algorithm. Similarly, this study defines a new single objective function that merges the multiconstraints, like, “Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Compression Ratio (CR)”.

There exist several research works regarding optimal feature subset selection from high-dimensional data sets, but the obtained results are not satisfying when multidimensional data sets (MDDs) are employed in large amount during disease analysis. In this article, an effective feature subset selection and classification method suitable for MDD is proposed. At first, the important and distinct features are extracted from the mammogram images using a Deep Neural Network with wrapper-based extraction technique. Then, a novel two-phase mutation strategy integrated with grey wolf optimizer algorithm is employed for selecting the most relevant feature subsets. Finally, a learning-based semilazy Bayesian network classifier with parallel implementation is proposed for the precise categorization of the breast cancer stages. The proposed method is executed in MATLAB platform and analyzed using mammogram images taken from MAMMOSET database. The proposed method is likened with three state-of-the-art existing feature subset selection and classification approaches for validating the efficiency of the proposed approach. For Data set 1, the proposed method shows an accuracy of 90\%, 92\% and 98\%, which is better than the existing methods taken for comparison. Also for Data set 2, the proposed method shows an accuracy of 97\%, 91\% and 94\%, which is much better than the accuracy achieved by the existing approaches. Thus, the proposed approach outperforms the compared existing approaches by providing better precision, recall, -measure, specificity and accuracy.},

The SVN set (SVNS) handles uncertainties more broadly than the intuitionistic fuzzy set by considering the three independent degree systems with a scale rating of 0–1 and is symmetrical about 0.5. However, for asymmetrical distribution, Saaty discusses the 1–9 scale to display the information. Driven by the advantages of the scale of 1–9 and the independence nature of degrees in SVNS, in this paper, we introduce the concept of SVNMPR with ratings values as SVN numbers with range with . The main advantages of the proposed relation are the asymmetric and nonuniform distributions of about 1. To complete address this, we divide the stated work into three parts. First, an idea of SVNMPR is added wherein pairwise evaluation values are represented the usage of SVN numbers over a scale of with . Also, we outline the idea of the SVN multiplicative preference set (SVNMPS). Second, to rank the proposed SVNMPS, we define a new ranking method with improved score functions by adding the expert&#39;s attitude to the analysis. The relationship between the proposed and the existing functions is also derived. Third, we are defining some new operation laws for SVNMPS to preserve the closeness property. On the basis of these laws, we define a number of operators to aggregate the different pairs of the SVNMPSs and to derive a number of relations and inequalities. Finally, a group decision-making approach is established and the practicality of it is demonstrated with a numerical example and compared with a number of existing approaches.},

The response to prices and incentives is described as “changes on electricity usage from conventional consumption patterns to end-use customers.” In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed for Electric Vehicle Based Grid connected to the distribution generation (DG). The proposed system is joined performance of student psychology optimization algorithm (SPOA) and AdaBoost algorithm, thus it known as SPOAB approach. The major aspire of this study is “to minimize the peak power cutoff, voltage regulation, spin reserve for making the optimization mode ideally convex, and accurate second-order conic relaxations.” Additionally, the SPOAB method is a proficient deal by standard business solvers with allocation models, and then acquires least annualized costs. In this study, the electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) is linked to DG, and then it gives charging service to electric vehicles (EVs). When the EV appears at the charging station, it informs the EVCS operator of their own energy requirement with anticipated departure time. Every EVCS can capture the information of all EVs using an SPOAB technique. By then, the proposed system is performed on MATLAB/Simulink site and the efficiency is compared with other processes. The number of iteration, like, 100, 250, 500, and 1000, the simulation time of the proposed technique is 14.8, 29.2, 69.9, and 77.1 s, respectively.},

For original MSVM, the hyperplane distance refers to the classification interval between classical margin and hyperplane, which is equality. However, the IDH-MSVM introduces parameters to adjust distance between every classification hyperplane and classical margin, which makes the hyperplane distance inequality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimented on UCI standard data sets and compared with several multiclassification algorithms.

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) is a fundamental personalized-tutoring technique for learners in online learning systems. Recent KT methods employ flexible deep neural network-based models that excel at this task. However, the adequacy of KT is still challenged by the sparseness of the learners&#39; exercise data. To alleviate the sparseness problem, most of the exiting KT studies are performed at the skill-level rather than the question-level, as questions are often numerous and associated with much fewer skills. However, at the skill level, KT neglects the distinctive information related to the questions themselves and their relations. In this case, the models can imprecisely infer the learners&#39; knowledge states and might fail to capture the long-term dependencies in the exercising sequences. In the knowledge domain, skills are naturally linked as a graph (with the edges being the prerequisite relations between pedagogical concepts). We refer to such a graph as a knowledge structure (KS). Incorporating a KS into the KT procedure can potentially resolve both the sparseness and information loss, but this avenue has been underexplored because obtaining the complete KS of a domain is challenging and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel KS-enhanced graph representation learning model for KT with an attention mechanism (KSGKT). We first explore eight methods that automatically infer the domain KS from learner response data and integrate it into the KT procedure. Leveraging a graph representation learning model, we then obtain the question and skill embeddings from the KS-enhanced graph. To incorporate more distinctive information on the questions, we extract the cognitive question difficulty from the learning history of each learner. We then propose a convolutional representation method that fuses these disctinctive features, thus obtaining a comprehensive representation of each question. These representations are input to the proposed KT model, and the long-term dependencies are handled by the attention mechanism. The model finally predicts the learner&#39;s performance on new problems. Extensive experiments conducted from six perspectives on three real-world data sets demonstrated the superiority and interpretability of our model for learner-performance modeling. Based on the KT results, we also suggest three potential applications of our model.},

The REGIME methodology is a well-founded evaluation technique suitable for multiple criteria choice analysis owing to it has good applicability to the processing of qualitative information and to complex scenarios. Unlike the existing REGIME techniques, this paper takes advantage of a new Minkowski-type distance measure and an evolved Gaussian preference function to propound a ground-breaking T-SF REGIME model.

Next, this paper concerns an ascertainment of the evolved Gaussian preference function as a part of the proposed T-SF REGIME mechanism. This paper focuses on an advancement of the REGIME structure to T-SF uncertain contexts and unfolds an inventive T-SF REGIME methodology by virtue of superiority identifiers/indices, guide identifiers/indices, and joint generalized indices. The usefulness and strength points of the advanced methodology are scrutinized through a realistic application in the field of solar plant to prioritize the options of photovoltaic cells.

However, how to accurately measure the distance between two Fermatean fuzzy sets is still a problem to be solved. In this paper, we devise two novel distance measure methods for Fermatean fuzzy sets. One is the distance measure of Fermatean fuzzy sets based on the Hellinger distance, which is called the FFSH distance. The other is the distance measure of Fermatean fuzzy sets based on the triangular divergence, which is called the FFSTD distance. Then, we prove that the proposed distance measure methods satisfy the axiomatic requirements of the distance function. Afterward, numerical examples are given to reveal that the proposed distance measures are more effective and reasonable than the normalized Euclidean distance measure, which can overcome the counter-intuitive situation. Besides, we utilize the proposed distance measure methods to address the problems of pattern recognition and medical diagnosis under Fermatean fuzzy environment and achieved excellent results. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed distance measure methods can efficiently handle the practical application under Fermatean fuzzy environment, and are more reliable than the normalized Euclidean distance measure.},

First, complex network topology is reconstructed by merging higher-order topology with lower-order connectivity features, where higher-order topology is captured by mining network motifs. Second, We design a label propagation characteristic model according to nodes influence, then a new label update rule is formulated based on reconstructed weighted network, the rule integrates frequency among neighbor labels, influence of nodes, propagation characteristics and closeness of nodes to update the node label, the purpose is to overcome the randomness of label selection and identify a better and more stable community structure.

In this paper, a Chaos Integrated Deep Neural Networks (Chaos-DNN) using Sandpiper Optimization Algorithm (SPOA) is proposed to enhance the performance of the multimodal contactless biometric pattern recognition system. The most significant advantage of palm vein and palm dorsal vein recognition is that it provides relatively high accuracy, reliability and also liveness detection. In this recognition process, the palm and its dorsal vein images are segmented using multilevel segmentation of region of interest (ROI) depending on Adaptive Hyper Kernel Optimized Fuzzy Clustering Technique (Adapt-HKFCT), and then ROI extracted based on the valley points among the index and ring finger using the Knuckle points. Then, the features of the ROI amid the index and ring finger are extracted using centre-symmetric local binary pattern algorithm and fed to the Chaos-DNN for training and classification. The efficiency of the features is optimized using SPOA. The extracted feature points help in authenticating a person using his/her chosen biometric traits for security purposes. The objective of this system is to increase the efficiency of the biometric system, and the performance is calculated depending on equal error rate, correct recognition rate, decidability index, false acceptance rate and false rejection rate. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB platform. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed palm vein recognition depending Adapt-HKFCT with Chaos-DNN using SPOA method (PVR-AHKFCT-CDNN-SPOA) attains higher performance metrics with an accuracy of 98.3\% and is also more efficient likened to the other existing methods, such as K Nearest Neighbour with Particle Swarm Optimization (PVR-KNN-PSO), Fuzzy Brain Storm Optimization based on Adaptive Thresholding (PVR-FBSO-AT), multiscale local binary pattern with ant colony optimization (PVR-MSLBP-ACO) and Deep Learning with Bayesian Optimization (PVR-DL-BO).},

  abstract     = {The compromise solution of the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem by the existing VIKOR method for Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PyFSs) is not closest to the positive ideal solution. This is because the defining function for VIKOR does not obey the axioms for a dissimilarity measure. Thus in this context, the existing notion of dissimilarity measures and the VIKOR method are controversial. This study aims to provide a new dissimilarity measure and refine the VIKOR method for PyFSs accordingly. We define a new dissimilarity measure for PyFSs and refine the existing VIKOR method. We discuss the additional properties of dissimilarity measures and improve the ideas of remoteness and ranking indexes. We provide numerical examples to support the analysis and findings of our study. Finally, we solve the MCDM problems to illustrate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture 4.0 is the usage of advanced technologies for ensuring sustainability and efficient use of resources in agriculture, which can be accepted one of the biggest challenges of mankind. With Agriculture 4.0 technologies, it is aimed to raise productivity, reduce waste and costs. To ensure that agriculture 4.0 technologies are adopted by farmers as soon as possible, the perspective and perception of farmers to these technologies should be analyzed firstly. For this purpose, we propose a decision-making framework to measure farmers&#39; view of Agriculture 4.0 technologies and to perform a prioritization study based on the perception of use among these technologies. Multicriteria decision analysis is also utilized to deal with all qualitative and quantitative factors in the decision process. Within the scope of this study, interval-valued spherical fuzzy numbers are used to model the vagueness in the process in the best manner and to be able to reflect the uncertainty arising from the usage of linguistic variables in the decision process. The SWARA and MAIRCA multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods, which have been used frequently in the literature and are applied very successfully in MCDM problems, have been firstly extended by spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs) and the advantages for these methods have been utilized within the framework of fuzzy logic. The proposed method allows decision-makers to mirror their hesitations in decision-making using a linguistic evaluation scale established upon interval-valued SFSs. A comparative analysis based on the ordinary fuzzy sets is also performed for the obtained results and the clear superiority of the proposed approach is presented. In addition, the robustness of the model is tested with sensitivity analysis. After these analyzes it is obtained that this paper provides a unique perspective to the literature due to its originality in both the subject and adopted fuzzy methodology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a multi-item capacitated lot-sizing problem with setup times and backlogging (MICLSP_SB) is addressed with respect to two conflicting objective functions. This nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard problem consists of finding optimal production plans while minimizing, simultaneously, the total cost and the total inventory level. To effectively solve the considered problem, two new versions of multiobjective binary particle swarm optimization are designed. In the first proposed version “standard multiobjective particle swarm optimization” (S-MOBPSO) algorithm, two main contributions are introduced. First, a new particle encoding and decoding method is developed to treat the MICLSP_SB decision variables. Second, the overall violation minimization method and the constraint handling method are combined to effectively handle the problem constraints. To further enhance the overall performance, an improvement procedure that minimizes the capacity constraints violations is developed and embedded into the S-MOBPSO algorithm. This second version is named improved MOBPSO (I-MOBPSO). An illustrative example is presented to explain the application of the proposed algorithms. Five performance metrics are considered to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the S-MOBPSO and I-MOBPSO algorithms compared to each other as well as the basic MOBPSO and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II.},

Since it is so widely used, the nearest neighbor search should be as fast as possible. This paper explores lower bound-based approaches to speed up the exact nearest neighbor search in high dimensional Euclidean space. We compute the lower bound of Euclidean Distance by using the block vectors and Cauchy–Schwartz inequality. The proposed lower bound is calculated efficiently and is close to the real Euclidean Distance. Besides, the preprocessing step of the proposal has linear time complexity. Given a query, during the procedure of identifying the nearest neighbor, our method can eliminate many expensive actual distance computations using the lower bound to approximate Euclidean Distance. In addition, we develop a multilevel lower bound strategy, which calculates the lower bound step by step and utilizes the multistep filtering mechanism to improve the searching process further. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that the proposals can guarantee to obtain the same result as the brute-force search. Comprehensive experiments on 16 public data sets collected from various domains demonstrate that our approach performs well in finding the exact nearest neighbor compared to related competitors. The experimental results also illustrate that the multilevel lower bound strategy is effective.},

However, there is still a huge amount of unlabeled samples in the real-world application, which are not applicable for the supervised algorithm. To fully utilize the spatial distribution information of the unlabeled samples, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised multiple empirical kernel learning (SSMEKL). SSMEKL enables multiple empirical kernel learning to achieve better classification performance with a small number of labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples. First, SSMEKL uses the collaborative information of multiple kernels to provide a pseudo labels to some unlabeled samples in the optimization process of the model, and SSMEKL designs pseudo-empirical loss to transform learning process of the unlabeled samples into supervised learning. Second, SSMEKL designs the similarity regularization for unlabeled samples to make full use of the spatial information of unlabeled samples. It is required that the output of unlabeled samples should be similar to the neighboring labeled samples to improve the classification performance of the model. The proposed SSMEKL can improve the performance of the classifier by using a small number of labeled samples and numerous unlabeled samples to improve the classification performance of MEKL. In the experiment, the results on four real-world data sets and two multiview data sets validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SSMEKL.},

This paper presents a lightweight and low cost wireless inertial motion capture system for the simultaneous reconstruction of human body attitude and displacement. First of all, the device is based on human sensor networks and distributes 15 sensor nodes on the key human limbs. Then, after an initial sensor alignment with the reduced error, a zero-speed update algorithm is used to calculate foot displacement. In addition, to constantly update the human posture information, a kind of motion reconstruction method based on the gradient descent method was used to fuse the sensor data. Finally, a new method of three-dimensional human body reconstruction is proposed, which is different from the traditional motion capture system. Through unconstrained traversal of the root, the human posture and foot trajectory are combined to realize the synchronous reconstruction of posture and displacement. It is concluded from the experiment results that the estimation errors are well controlled, and motion patterns are consistent with the actual situation.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has been widely applied into image inpainting. However, traditional image processing methods (i.e., patch-based and diffusion-based methods) generally fail to produce visually natural contents and semantically reasonable structures due to ineffectively processing the high-level semantic information of images. To solve the problem, we propose a stacked generator networks assisted by patch discriminator for image inpainting by multistage. In the proposed method, our generator network mainly consists of three-layer stacked encoder-decoder architecture, which could fuse different level feature information and achieve image inpainting via a coarse-to-fine hierarchical representation. Meanwhile, we split the masked image into different patches in each layer, which could effectively enlarge the receptive field and extract more useful features of images. Moreover, the patch discriminator is introduced to judge the patches of inpainting image are real or fake. In this way, our network can effectively utilize the semantic information to complete a fine result. Furthermore, both perceptual loss and style loss are used to improve the inpainting results in verse. Experimental results on Places2 and Paris StreetView illustrate that our approach could generate high-quality inpainting results, and our method is more effective than the existing image inpainting methods.},

In this study, we intended to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system based on artificial intelligence to automatically identify the COVID-19 in chest computed tomography images. We utilized transfer learning to obtain the image-level representation (ILR) based on the backbone deep convolutional neural network. Then, a novel neighboring aware representation (NAR) was proposed to exploit the neighboring relationships between the ILR vectors. To obtain the neighboring information in the feature space of the ILRs, an ILR graph was generated based on the -nearest neighbors algorithm, in which the ILRs were linked with their -nearest neighboring ILRs. Afterward, the NARs were computed by the fusion of the ILRs and the graph. On the basis of this representation, a novel end-to-end COVID-19 classification architecture called neighboring aware graph neural network (NAGNN) was proposed. The private and public data sets were used for evaluation in the experiments. Results revealed that our NAGNN outperformed all the 10 state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization ability. Therefore, the proposed NAGNN is effective in detecting COVID-19, which can be used in clinical diagnosis.},

The security risk indexes were quantified by the general vulnerability scoring system, and the data flow security transmission model of the cytopathology image storage system was constructed. Different transmission nodes and cytopathological image storage system devices were set as attack graph nodes to collect and configure data and optimize data flow transmission path. Deploy the network node equilibrium state, control the time slot window interval equilibrium, output transmission delay allocation, and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data stream transmission of the cytopathological image storage system. The simulation results show that the proposed method has a higher transmission efficiency of about 11.76 Mb/s.

We set up different properties of these operators. It is demonstrated that suggested averaging operators have the properties of idempotency, boundary, monotonicity, and commutativity. Then, we design new techniques dependent on these operators to fix multiattribute decision making issues. We present an example of human resource selection to elaborate on the performance of our proposed approach. The outcome shows the practicality and viability of the new technique.

  abstract     = {Networks are ubiquitous in the real world such as social networks and communication networks, and anomaly detection on networks aims at finding nodes whose structural or attributed patterns deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes. However, most of the traditional anomaly detection methods neglect the relation structure information among data points and therefore cannot effectively generalize to the graph structure data. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model of Deep Dual Support Vector Data description based Autoencoder (Dual-SVDAE) for anomaly detection on attributed networks, which considers both the structure and attribute for attributed networks. Specifically, Dual-SVDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute autoencoder to learn the latent representation of the node in the structure space and attribute space, respectively. Then, a dual-hypersphere learning mechanism is imposed on them to learn two hyperspheres of normal nodes from the structure and attribute perspectives, respectively. Moreover, to achieve joint learning between the structure and attribute of the network, we fuse the structure embedding and attribute embedding as the final input of the feature decoder to generate the node attribute. Finally, abnormal nodes can be detected by measuring the distance of nodes to the learned center of each hypersphere in the latent structure space and attribute space, respectively. Extensive experiments on the real-world attributed networks show that Dual-SVDAE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The concept of granulized Z-numbers improves information utilization and manages the degree of uncertainty in decision-making. In this paper, a novel scoring method, namely, ordered weighted averaging-based expected granulized Z-number, a new aggregation operator, named, granulized Z-number-based ordered weighted averaging operator, and a novel fuzzy risk assessment scheme is proposed. The proposed scoring method is used to order the granulized Z-numbers and takes care of the possibilistic as well as probabilistic information contained in the granulized Z-numbers. The maximum entropy principle-based nonlinear optimization model is formulated to capture the aforesaid probabilistic information during the scoring process. Based on the proposed scoring and ordering method, the granulized Z-number-based ordered weighted averaging operator is developed, which judiciously integrates the benefits of the granulized Z-numbers and the ordered weighted averaging operator to provide an improved aggregation of the decision-making information collected from multiple sources (experts). The required properties are also proved. Finally, the novel fuzzy risk assessment scheme is developed using the granulized Z-number-based ordered weighted averaging operator, the average linkage-based ordered weighted averaged similarity measure between two granulized Z-numbers, and the basic operations of logical gates of a fault tree. This scheme provides the system-level failure probability in an easy-to-understand form with reliability. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the usability and feasibility of the proposed models and schemes.},

  abstract     = {Smart cameras, as typical IoT devices, are widely adopted to provide surveillance on individuals, homes, and the environment. The unavoidably captured sensitive visuals via these cameras may raise significant security concerns, while the prevalent software defects and authentication misconfiguration issues aggravate the vulnerability of such devices. However, traditional cryptography techniques are inadequate to provide full protection of these devices due to the large computation overhead. In this context, realizing accountability for these surveillance systems shall be the last line of defense in the presence of fast-evolving and high-influential threats. We propose EviChain, a scalable blockchain-based solution to trace the operations on intelligent surveillance cameras and reserve the evidence for any misuse in tamper-proofing manipulation records. Building a blockchain over the distributed cameras is challenging due to the limited capacity of on-board memory. To tackle this challenge, we design a cooperative mechanism that enables cameras to adaptively join in groups and share storage for recording blocks. In addition, we present a computation efficiency and delay-aware block generation strategy to reduce the cost of the consensus process. We perform extensive simulations to validate the superior performance of EviChain over other baselines, for example, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).},

To apply the new structure in practices, we provided a new object recognition method combining the fractal feature and credible evidence.

The sharp demand and price fluctuations caused by these promotional activities distress stocks over an inventory period if customer satisfaction is maintained. This article develops a chance-constrained multiobjective programming model to obtain optimal order quantities in an e-commerce inventory system with stochastic demand and prices. Traditional techniques for coping with the stochastic coefficients using an expected value operator or probability measures are usually inefficient in estimating quantities. With rational assumptions regarding market behavior, stochastic demand and price are characterized with a normal distribution based on historical data. A novel method called rough approximation is designed to flexibly formulate the feasible region, from which a crisp model is obtained that has no uncertain information. A proxy ideal point-based genetic algorithm (PIP-GA) is then developed to solve the model, allowing decision makers to fix the optimal order quantities for different promotional activity scales. Finally, the results are illustrated using a practical example from the Chinese B2C e-commerce giant “JD.COM.” Some special features are discussed to show the availability of the proposed model and the solution methodology.},

  abstract     = {The real-world complex networks, such as biological, transportation, biomedical, web, and social networks, are usually dynamic and change over time. The communities which reflect the substructures hidden in the networks usually overlap each other, and detecting overlapping communities in the dynamic complex networks is a challenging task. Prior researchers have applied multiobjective optimization method to the detection of dynamic overlapping communities and achieved some excellent results. However, in terms of multiobjective processing, the prior studies all adopt the decomposition method based on weight parameters, and different weight parameters or different parameter values can easily affect the community detection results which further results in the uneven distribution of the detected results in the target space. To solve the above problems, a hybrid algorithm, that is, Collaborative Particle Swarm multiobjective Optimization-based Dynamic Overlapping Community Detection (CPSO-DOCD) algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, to improve the diversity of particles, the encoding/decoding of the particle and the cross inheritance and the variation of particle are redefined first based on label propagation. In each network snapshot, multiple particle swarms are initialized based on Community Overlap Propagation Algorithm (COPRA) to generate particles with uniform distribution. Multiple different objective functions are optimized using multiple particle swarms respectively to avoid the incorrect selection of weight parameters. In addition, a reference-point-based is adopted in the particle selecting stage to solve the uneven distribution of detected results in the target space. Second, a node label entropy-based particle swarm algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of community detection of current network snapshots. Finally, when one snapshot switches to another over time, a migration strategy based on COPRA local-search and clique generation is utilized to adjust the prior community detection results, which enables the former results can be adapted to the new network snapshots. The experiments are implemented based on four dynamic networks which are Cit-HepPh, Cit-HepTh, Emailed-EU-core-temporal, and CollegeMsg. The hypervolume value of the overlapping community detection result obtained by CPSO-DOCD is 0.5\%–2\% higher than MDOA, MCMOEA, SLPAD, and iLCD. Furthermore, CPSO-DOCD also performed better than MDOA, MCMOEA, SLPAD, and iLCD on -metric values, and CPSO-DOCD can approach approximately to the Pareto frontier.},

First, the exploration capability of neural network algorithm (NNA) is enhanced by addition of a learning factor, α in MNNA. Then, to evaluate the performance of MNNA in terms of its exploration and exploitation capabilities, extensive statistical analysis has been carried out on 23 benchmark functions consisting of unimodal, multimodal and fixed dimension multimodal functions against 12 state of the art algorithms. The results are encouraging and marks the superiority of MNNA against NNA as well as 11 other state of the art techniques. It is followed by application of Kharitonov theorem as a design tool to derive the Interval AVR system. Next, NNA and MNNA have been used for tuning of PID controller parameters in such a way that maximum value of the closed loop eigen values of K-extreme polynomials is minimized. Further to show the robustness of the proposed methods, the results are taken on set point tracking, noise suppression, load disturbance rejection, and minimum controller effort utilized by these controllers and compared against seven state of the art techniques namely PSO, GA, ABC, MOEO, NSGA-II, FSA and variants of constrained GA. The results demonstrate the high performance of the PID controller optimized using MNNA for control of I-AVR and guarantees stability for a wider range of system parameter uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {The wide deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices enables the controller to continuously collect massive volume data in automation systems, and makes it possible to make intelligent decisions based on machine learning techniques. In fact, data-driven intelligent automation systems have been common in the industrial community. Nevertheless, how to effectively store the collected stream data and ensure their integrity is still challenging. To this end, the notion of verifiable data streaming (VDS) protocol, which enables a client to outsource the stream data to an untrusted server in a verifiable manner, was introduced. However, we argue that existing VDS protocols based on the chameleon authentication tree (CAT) are inefficient in the data update, since the whole CAT must be updated accordingly to avoid acute exposure of chameleon hashing. Thus, they are infeasible for intelligent automation systems that need to frequently update data. In this article, we first introduce a new primitive called double-trapdoor chameleon hash tree (DCHT) based on the double-trapdoor chameleon hash families, where each leaf of DCHT is calculated and fixed by using a double-trapdoor chameleon hash family, making the entire DCHT always unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a novel VDS protocol based on the DCHT. Due to the distinctive properties of the underlying DCHT, the proposed VDS protocol has a constant update cost and more efficient than previous VDS protocols based on CAT. Besides, we prove that the proposed VDS protocol is secure in the standard model.},

  abstract     = {As the gig economy continues to grow, behaviors of workers on gig service platforms have an increasing impact on service satisfaction. For example, fatigue driving behaviors of drivers in ride-hailing platforms may cause serious damages, both for individuals and society. Therefore, regulating behaviors of workers is urgent and challenging. A lot of studies are conducted to detect workers&#39; noncompliance behaviors, such as detecting fatigue driving by computer vision or pattern recognition methods. However, few of them indicate how to efficiently exploit the detection results to regulate workers&#39; behaviors. In this paper, we point out that workers&#39; noncompliance behaviors and their incomes should be correlated, and propose a quantifiable computation framework that includes a price-based incentive mechanism and a method to verify the effectiveness of the mechanism. Historical behaviors of workers are summarized as credits and stored in nonfungible token called CreditToken to ensure that it cannot be tampered with. CreditToken will further affect workers&#39; incomes. We abstract the decision-making behavior of workers as a Markov decision process and demonstrate the effectiveness of the incentive mechanism with model checking and formal methods. The analysis shows that our framework is able to provide a rational price strategy formation for gig service platforms, and can be flexibly integrated into existing pricing schemes to maximize the value of the detection results. Extensive experiments illustrate the advanced nature and practicality of our framework.},

Hence it is commonly named as PCA-NPOGBDT strategy. Here, three stages are occupied using fault analysis on microgrid to differentiate among inverter faults on microgrid and symmetric/unsymmetric faults on distribution line, in addition to detect/classify that faults and recognize that faulty section.

  abstract     = {Automatic image colorization without manual interventions is an ill-conditioned and inherently ambiguous problem. Most of existing methods focus on formulating colorization as a regression problem and learn parametric mappings from grayscale to color through deep neural networks. Due to the multimodalities of color-grayscale space, in many applications, it is not required to recover exact ground-truth color. Pair-wise pixel-to-pixel learning-based algorithms lack rationality. Techniques such as color space conversion techniques are then proposed to avoid such direct pixel learning. However, the coloring results after color space conversion are blunt and unnatural. In this paper, we hold viewpoints that a reasonable solution is to generate some colorized result that looks natural. No matter what color a region is to be assigned, the colorized region should be semantically and spatially consistent. In this paper, we propose an effective semantic-aware automatic colorization model via unpaired cycle-consistent self-supervised network. Low-level monochrome loss, perceptual identity loss and high-level semantic-consistence loss, together with adversarial loss, are introduced to guide network self-training. We train and test our model on randomly selected subsets from PASCAL VOC 2012. The experimental results including human subjective studies demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed model can achieve more convincing and superior results.

  abstract     = {Source location privacy (SLP) protection is an emerging research topic in wireless sensor networks. Because the source location represents the valuable information of the target being monitored and tracked, it is of great practical significance to achieve a high degree of privacy of the source location. Although many studies based on phantom nodes have alleviates the protection of SLP to some extent. It is urgent to solve the problems, such as complicate the ac path between nodes, improve the centralized distribution of phantom nodes near the source nodes and reduce the network communication overhead. In this paper, protection scheme based on sector phantom routing (PSSPR) routing is proposed as a visible approach to address SLP issues. We use the coordinates of the center node to divide sector domain, which act an important role in generating a new phantom node. The phantom nodes perform specified routing policies to ensure that they can choose various locations. In addition, the directed random route can ensure that data packets avoid the visible range when they move to the sink node hop by hop. Thus, the source location is protected. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that this protocol achieves higher security of source node location with less communication overhead.},

According to the error data discriminating rules, the error data in the traffic flow data is discriminated, all lanes are detected according to the data discriminating result, the traffic data of each lane are recorded in chronological order, and the traffic data is converted. Fuzzy data mining technology is used to predict the converted traffic flow, combined with traffic flow sequence segmentation and BP neural network model to realize the intelligent calculation of the smart traffic flow index.

  abstract     = {Meta-path-based random walk strategy has attracted tremendous attention in heterogeneous network representation, which can capture network semantics with heterogeneous neighborhoods of nodes. Despite the success of meta-path-based random walk strategy in plain heterogeneous networks which contain no attributes, it remains unexplored how meta-path-based random walk strategy could be utilized on attributed heterogeneous networks to simultaneously capture structural heterogeneity and attribute proximity. Moreover, the importance of node attributes and structural relations generally varies across data sets, thus requiring careful considerations when they are incorporated into representations. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel method, ttributed eterogeneous etwork embedding based on ggregate-path (AHNA), which generates aggregate-path-based random walks on attributed heterogeneous networks and adaptively fuses topological structures and node attributes based on the learned importance. Specifically, AHNA first converts node attributes to additional links in the network to deal with the heterogeneity of structures and attributes, which is followed by an adaptive random walk strategy to strike the importance balance between node attributes and topological structures, thereby generating high-quality representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets, where AHNA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by up to 22.7\%, 2.6\%, and 2.3\% on link prediction, community detection, and node classification, respectively. Moreover, our qualitative analysis indicates that AHNA can capture different balances of topological structures and node attributes on various data sets and thus boost the quality of node representations.},

  abstract     = {The best-worst method (BWM) is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach for solving several types of real-life decision-making problems. The basic BWM determines the priority order by pairwise comparisons of the best and worst criteria. The strength of the preference assigned via numerical value for linguistic interpretations of relative comparisons ranges from 1 to 9, representing preferences among the criterion. However, the amount of strength is entirely dependent on the choice of the decision-makers. Though expert&#39;s opinions may differ due to various reasons such as incomplete information, lack of knowledge, ambiguity in linguistic terms, and so forth. Therefore, it is highly likely that the expert may provide multiple viewpoints for the preferences values. Thus, this study proposes a novel extension of the BWM named the multi-choice best-worst method (MCBWM), dealing with the concept of multiple choices of preference relations to compare the criterion. The MCBWM overcomes the limitation of BWM, where the pairwise preferences in the comparisons are multi-choice parameters rather than single parametric values. Multiple real-world MCDM applications are illustrated in experimental studies to show the quality, performance, and applicability of our proposed MCBWM. A detailed comparative analysis of the proposed approach has been done with the well-known existing decision-making techniques and their optimal results are compared. The proposed method offers a new direction for the MCDM approaches for solving real-life problems.},

Although demonstrating promising performance in various applications, most of existing approaches adopt the min–min formulation, which could be sensitive to perturbation with adversarial samples. Moreover, existing MKC algorithms often involve several hypermeters preventing them into further real applications. To address these issues, we propose a parameter-free effective sparse simple multiple kernel -means algorithm with max–min optimization formulation in this paper. To be specific, we propose to optimize the widely used unsupervised kernel alignment criterion by minimizing the kernel coefficient and maximizing the clustering partition matrix. Unlike traditional min–min formulation, the max–min kernel alignment is robust to adversarial sample perturbation and free of hyper-parameters. An optimization method based on semi-infinite linear program is designed to solve the complicated optimization problem. Extensive experiments on six multiple kernel benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, web servers pay attention to privacy and anonymity protection and choose to rely on hidden service to avoid exposure of the real geographic locations. Several studies have confirmed that hidden service is vulnerable to flow correlation attacks, specifically, the attacker has the ability to synchronize the behavior of both sides of the communication after observing the flow for an extended period of time. However, since hidden service publish descriptor flow is transient behavioral traffic, automatically capturing and analyzing publish flow becomes a challenge. In this paper, our focus is the intelligent identification of the descriptor publishing flow. We propose a model for the descriptor publishing flow correlation attack (DPFCA). The model resolves the complex relationship between the circuit establishment flow and the publishing flow, and is able to intelligently process the sequence identification and content classification of the descriptor correlation flow of the existing version and tags. It is worth mentioning that the DPFCA is based on the automated homology comparison of the profile-hidden Markov model (PHMM). The descriptor publishing flow is converted to an amino symbol sequence and then compare with the known homologous sequence group in the library of Profile. The experimental results show that our model can achieve higher performance in terms of accuracy and reliability of transient flow identification compared with the traditional flow correlation attack model.},

To diagnose the faulty section(s) correctly, an improved binary variant of gaining-sharing knowledge-based algorithm (GSK) named LOBGSK is presented in this paper. It stretches the original GSK over binary search space so as to solve the 0-1 integer programming FSD problem. In LOBGSK, individuals are encoded by binary numbers and logical operations instead of real arithmetic operations are designed to update the individuals. By this, LOBGSK can avoid transcoding in solving the FSD problem. To validate the effectiveness of LOBGSK, it is first applied to a 4-substation test system considering various fault scenarios. Then it is further implemented to the IEEE 118-bus system and an actual fault event occurred in a practical power grid in Jilin province of China. In addition, the influence of three key parameters of LOBGSK is also investigated. Simulation results show that LOBGSK is robust against its key parameters and can offer a 100\% successful rate to diagnose different faults quickly, which is demonstrated by the reported results of some published FSD methods. Furthermore, it outperforms seven state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms and the original GSK in solving the FSD problem of power systems.},

  abstract     = {Complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (CQROFSs) are proposed to convey vague material in decision-making problems. The CQROFSs can enthusiastically modify the region of proof by altering the factor for real and imaginary parts based on the variation degree and, therefore, favor further uncountable options. Consequently, this set reverses over the existing theories, such as complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CIFSs) and complex Pythagorean fuzzy sets (CPFS). In everyday life, there are repeated situations that can occur, which involve an impartial assertiveness of the decision-makers. To determine the best decision to handle such situations, in this study, we propose modern operational laws by joining the characteristics of the truth factor sum and collaboration between the truth degrees into the analysis for CQROFSs. Based on these principles, we determined several weighted averaging neutral aggregation operators (AOs) to collect the CQROF knowledge. Subsequently, we established an original multiattribute decision-making (MADM) procedure by using the demonstrated AOs based on CQROFS. To evaluate the effectiveness, in terms of reliability and consistency, of the proposed operators, they were applied to some numerical examples. A comparative analysis of the investigated operators and other existing operators was also performed to find the dominance and validity of the introduced MADM method.},

  abstract     = {Most of existing multi-view clustering methods assume that different feature views of data are fully observed. However, it is common that only portions of data features can be obtained in many practical applications. The presence of incomplete feature views hinders the performance of the conventional multi-view clustering methods to a large extent. Recently proposed incomplete multi-view clustering methods often focus on directly learning a common representation or a consensus affinity similarity graph from available feature views while ignore the valuable information hidden in the missing views. In this study, we present a novel incomplete multi-view clustering method via adaptive partial graph learning and fusion (APGLF), which can capture the local data structure of both within-view and cross-view. Specifically, we use the available data of each view to learn a corresponding view-specific partial graph, in which the within-view local structure can be well preserved. Then we design a cross-view graph fusion term to learn a consensus complete graph for different views, which can take advantage of the complementary information hidden in the view-specific partial graphs learned from incomplete views. In addition, a rank constraint is imposed on the graph Laplacian matrix of the fused graph to better recover the optimal cluster structure of original data. Therefore, APGLF integrates within-view partial graph learning, cross-view partial graph fusion and cluster structure recovering into a unified framework. Experiments on five incomplete multi-view data sets are conducted to validate the efficacy of APGLF when compared with eight state-of-the-art methods.},

These methods have made gratifying progress. However, since the quality of the saliency maps will be affected by boundary features, it is still worth exploring how to extract effective boundary features and fuse them with semantic features. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-branch Mutual Assistance Network (DMANet) to simultaneously detect salient objects and salient boundaries. To combine the respective advantages of the two task features, we merge the features of the two branches to generate complementary features and adopt the complementary features to refine semantic and boundary information. Through the interaction of the two branches, the semantic features can gradually use the boundary features to improve themselves, so that the predicted salient regions have clear boundaries. In addition, we design a novel Feature Multi-pathway Compression and Reconstruction (FMCR) module, and embed multiple such modules in the network. Compression means seeking a concise expression of the original features. Reconstruction is to discriminate the key information in the compressed features and further analyze it. By combining the analysis results of multiple pathways, the FMCR module can enhance the network&#39;s ability to identify salient objects based on the various saliency cues obtained. The experimental results on five data sets show that our method surpasses the 15 state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved performance.},

In contrast to the agricultural sector, the automatic techniques for recognizing plant disease have different benefits and pose several issues. In addition, inappropriate diagnoses are ineffectual in treating the disease and may affect the crop yield. This paper presents a novel technique for plant health monitoring by estimating sulphur dioxide. Here, the simulation of IoT was performed for improved functioning. After that, the cluster head selection and routing are performed using the proposed invasive water cycle (IWC) algorithm, which is devised by integrating the water cycle algorithm (WCA) and invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm. Here, the fitness function is newly modeled using certain factors involving Energy, intra and intercluster distance, and delay. After the cluster head selection and routing, the sulphur dioxide content from the soil is estimated. For sulphur dioxide estimation, the soil data is considered the input data, and then the data transformation is performed to transform the data. After that, the feature selection is performed by Mahalanobis distance, and then sulphur dioxide from the soil is estimated using Deep Q-Network, where training is performed using the proposed IWC algorithm. The proposed IWC-based Deep Q- Network offered improved performance with the highest accuracy of 0.941, and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.242.

  abstract     = {The real-world optimal problems frequently encountered by various industries are the nonlinear constrained optimization problems (NCOPs), where the constraints represent the limitations of practical resources. Many researchers have attempted to improve particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the past decades; however, in solving the NCOPs, the PSO-based approaches often cause premature convergences. The problem-specific constraints frequently generate many infeasible regions that block the movements of particles. The particles&#39; behavior causes the exploration abilities of particles that tend to weaken along with time. The decreasing of exploration ability often comes from the particle becoming stagnant or moving unusefully. This study proposes a neutrino-like particle (NLP) with adaptive NLP hyperparameters that simulate the natural neutrino behavior. The proposed NLPs can be embedded in the PSO-based approaches for overcoming premature convergence. The experiment results demonstrate that all referenced PSO-based methods with the NLPs improved significantly compared with those without the NLPs to solve the NCOPs. All referenced PSO-based methods that embedded the NLPs also significantly outperform four recent strong algorithms in most IEEE CEC 2020 benchmark problems.

  abstract     = {Most existing performance evaluation standards for iris segmentation algorithms, such as the typical recall, precision, and F-measure (RPF-measure) protocol, are based on a pixel-to-pixel comparison between the mask image obtained after segmentation and the corresponding ground truth (GT) image. However, one of the most important problems is that if the published GT images have errors when locating the iris region, then the reference value of these evaluation indicators will be reduced, which is not conducive to the development of iris recognition technology. To address this problem, this paper proposes to use a mask image segmented by a deep learning method to replace the corresponding GT image. The main work of this paper is as follows. First, a dual attention densely connected network (DADCNet) containing two attention modules and an improved skip connection is proposed to segment the real iris region more accurately than the corresponding GT image. Second, the recognition performance of the two input classes obtained from the mask image after DADCNet segmentation and the corresponding published GT image in the same recognition network is utilized to further show that the former is more reliable in positioning the real iris than the latter. To make the proposed network more convincing, extensive experiments are conducted on four representative and challenging iris databases, which is obtained under different spectral conditions. These results show that the proposed DADCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and that the mask image obtained after DADCNet segmentation can replace the published corresponding GT image.},

  abstract     = {In multi-agent reinforcement learning, transfer learning is one of the key techniques used to speed up learning performance through the exchange of knowledge among agents. However, there are three challenges associated with applying this technique to real-world problems. First, most real-world domains are partially rather than fully observable. Second, it is difficult to pre-collect knowledge in unknown domains. Third, negative transfer impedes the learning progress. We observe that differentially private mechanisms can overcome these challenges due to their randomization property. Therefore, we propose a novel differential transfer learning method for multi-agent reinforcement learning problems, characterized by the following three key features. First, our method allows agents to implement real-time knowledge transfers between each other in partially observable domains. Second, our method eliminates the constraints on the relevance of transferred knowledge, which expands the knowledge set to a large extent. Third, our method improves robustness to negative transfers by applying differentially exponential noise and relevance weights to transferred knowledge. The proposed method is the first to use the randomization property of differential privacy to stimulate the learning performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning system. We further implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Object detection consists of two key steps: class recognition and object localization. Class recognition is fundamental because the quality of the obtained feature representations is key to detection accuracy; for locating the object, bounding box refinement is the most intuitive method for improving the localization accuracy of the utilized detector; that is, selecting a better loss function metric when computing the best-fitted bounding box for the object of interest. However, current class activation mapping (CAM) scores cannot help effectively distinguish the object from background noise and involve fixed weights for the geometric characteristics of the anchor box, leading to inaccurate object detection. In this paper, we proposed a mixed-CAM method to obtain improved category scores for class recognition, and an adaptive intersection-over-union method (AIoU) that improves the localization performance for object detection. The mixed-CAM method combines an original image response and CAM information to provide a confidence score for the final feature map and, in the meantime, considers this score as a sample selection criterion for the following localization regression stage. The AIoU method designs a new loss function metric for bounding box localization regression. In doing so, the proposed method considers the weight of each geometric characteristic of the bounding box in the network training process via a hyperparameter and adopts a new positive and negative sample selection mechanism for sample training. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves better prediction accuracy and a higher average precision value than those yielded by the classical backbone networks. Moreover, the AIoU method can be easily coupled with existing convolutional neural network architectures and thus possesses the great potential of adaptability in many application fields, such as intelligent transportation.},

  abstract     = {The application of intelligent computing in Internet of Things (IoTs) makes IoTs systems such as telemedicine, in-vehicle IoT, and smart home more intelligent and efficient. Secure communication and secure resource sharing among intelligent terminals are essential. A secure communication channel for intelligent terminals can be established through group key agreement (GKA), thereby ensuring the security communication and resource sharing for intelligent terminals. Taking into account the confidentiality level of the shared resources of each terminal, and the different permissions of the resource sharing of each terminal, a GKA protocol for intelligent IoTs is proposed. Compared with previous work, this protocol mainly has the following advantages: (1) The hidden attribute identity authentication technology can achieve the security of identity authentication and protect personal privacy from being leaked; (2) Only intelligent terminals satisfying the threshold required of the GKA can participate in the GKA, which increases the security of group communication; (3) Low-level group terminals can obtain new permissions to participate in high-level group communication if they meet certain conditions. High-level group terminals can participate in low-level group communication through permission authentication, which increases the flexibility and security of group communication; (4) The intelligent terminals in the group can use their own attribute permission parameters to calculate the group key. They can verify the correctness of the calculated group key through a functional relationship, and does not need to exchange information with other members in the same group. Under the hardness assumption of inverse computational Diffie-Hellman problem and discrete logarithm problem, it is proven that the protocol has high security, and compared with the cited literatures, it has good advantages in terms of computational complexity, time cost and communication energy cost.},

(), is a judicious integration of hesitant fuzzy sets and number. Here, is the expert&#39;s opinion and is the reliability of the expert&#39;s opinion. Further, the randomness of the information brings uncertainty to the decision-making process. To circumvent this issue, DHZN is quantified with Cloud model theory and fuzzy envelope. To enhance the information utilization and to reduce the information loss problem while quantifying CD-DHZN, the correlation and the underlying hidden probabilistic relationship between the two parts of a DHZN are captured using the Pearson correlation coefficient, the maximum entropy principle, and Hellinger distance. Then, the extended failure mode and effect analysis (E-FMEA) is proposed with the help of DHZN, CD-DHZN, and VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija IKomoromisno Resenje technique for prioritization of risks. Similarly, extended bow-tie (E-BT) is also proposed for the quantification of basic events (BEs), top event, and accident scenarios. Two case studies with systematic experimental investigations are presented and results are compared with other existing techniques. The results show that the proposed models are able to effectively prioritize the failure modes in E-FMEA and quantify the BEs in E-BT.

The normal cloud and trapezium cloud are integrated to represent hybrid-length linguistic variables of HFLHC model, which can effectively avoid evaluation information loss and distortion. Aiming at applying HFLHC model to MCDM, some hybrid operations for normal cloud and trapezium cloud are developed. Moreover, an improved method for aggregating multiple linguistic concepts into an integrated trapezium cloud in HFLHC model is proposed, with consideration of the different representation region of each linguistic concept. Furthermore, a novel HFLHC-based best-worst method is proposed to obtain optimal criteria weights with developing a HFLHC optimization programming model and a modified consistency ratio.

With the continuous exploitation of data value and the proliferation of machine learning-as-a-service, convolutional neural network prediction schemes on privacy preservation have been introduced one after another, which makes much more attention focused on the privacy leakage and services offered to be efficient and light. Therefore, how to improve the convolutional neural prediction scheme on the premise of privacy preservation turns out to be an imperative research issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving convolutional neural network prediction scheme (PCP-LL) that supports low latency and lightweight users. The scheme starts from the perspective of lossless accuracy from underlying networks. First, we construct a secure activation function computing protocol (SActF) utilizing a commodity-based secure comparison protocol, which reduces the complexity and latency during the activation function computing under ciphertexts compared with common schemes. Second, to further support lightweight users, we introduce a secure output layer protocol (SOut) that enables users to obtain the prediction results without extra decryption after simple operations. Then, the scheme adopts the distributed two trapdoors public-key cryptosystem (DT-PKC) to achieve both data and model security, which well avoids security issues especially such as wiretapping by semi-honest participants commonly in secret sharing schemes. Finally, through relevant evaluations, the scheme not only achieves privacy preservation and low latency, but also supports lightweight users.},

Our defined notion of BCFS is more closed to bipolarity as compared with already existing BCFS and CBFS, and more accurate. BCFS is the fusion of bipolar fuzzy set (BFS) which a decision analyst needs to describe the positive and negative aspects of an object and complex fuzzy set (CFS) which a decision analyst needs to handle two-dimensional (two variables) information. When there is information of two variables with positive and negative aspects then a decision analyst needs BCFS to handle this information. In this article, we also interpreted some basic operations on BCFS like a complement, intersection, and union and explained them with the help of examples. Additionally, we defined the concept of type-1 partially BCFS and type-2 partially BCFS. Further, we interpreted some generalized trigonometric similarity measures such as generalized cosine similarity measure, generalized tangent similarity measure, generalized cotangent similarity measure, and generalized hybrid trigonometric similarity measure for BCFS. The weighted generalized trigonometric similarity measures are also presented in this article. After that, we applied these similarity measures (SMs) in two real-life applications (pattern recognition and medical diagnosis) to show the benefits and advantages of our proposed SMs. Finally, we did a comparison of our demonstrated SMs with some existing SMs to show the superiority, usefulness, and effectiveness of our proposed SMs.},

This paper develops a new framework for distributed GANs, where two groups of discriminators and generators are involved in a zero-sum game. Under connected graphs, such a framework is reformulated as a constrained minmax optimisation problem. Then, a fully distributed training algorithm is proposed without exchanging any private data samples.

Before investment, one should select such a mutual fund that can fulfill his or her anticipation as much as possible within the risk–return skeleton. Therefore the selection of a mutual fund is rigorously a multicriteria decision making. This paper has considered five open-ended, large-cap, direct, suspended sales mutual funds for the research work. In the first stage, we have shortlisted the more crucial criteria comparatively from a list of criteria with the help of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process. In the second stage, we have applied the Pythagorean fuzzy Gray Relation Analysis approach to determine the weights of shortlisted criteria as well as the rank of those mutual funds. Finally, a comparison has been drawn between the present model and the Pythagorean fuzzy Interactive Multicriteria Decision-Making model, to show the effectiveness of the present model.},

  abstract     = {The creative introduction of the smart contracts in Ethereum, which are Turing-complete programs, boosted blockchain to the second generation. Meantime, the specifically designed young and fast-evolving programming languages, such as Solidity, become the key factors behind smart contracts being the breeding ground of ubiquitous defects. As many contract defects occur within certain compiler versions, knowing the specific compiler version used to generate the contract&#39;s bytecode, facilitates the design of more targeted defect detection approaches, and provides ways to estimate the risks faced of invoking it. To this end, we propose VSmart (compiler Version identification for Smart contract), which takes in the bytecode of the smart contract to be analyzed and outputs the major compiler version used to produce it. The basic idea is to leverage deep neural networks to grasp version-indicative features from contracts&#39; normalized opcode sequences, and train classifiers on a data set consisting of 131,546 smart contracts with ground-truth labels we collected from Etherscan. The performance evaluation conducted shows that VSmart achieves nearly 98\% accuracy in identifying major Solidity compiler versions. Further, on the basis of VSmart, we perform an empirical study on the distribution of the Solidity compiler versions on a wild data set consisting of 15,326,672 nontrivial smart contracts actually deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The landscape estimation results show that the Solidity version distribution is rather imbalanced, with Solidity 0.4 being the most popular one; and the developers&#39; Solidity usage practices conflict with the official&#39;s suggestion of always using the latest version, while they tend to gradually switch to newer versions.},

  abstract     = {Radar echoes have emerged as a rapid technology that is utilized in a wide range of applications especially in target identification under sea-clutter background. The detection of moving targets under a sea-clutter background is still a complex task because of the entering and evacuating of targets, which is highly unpredictable and unexpectable. Because of the lack of essential information, target detection and parameter estimations have become key constraints. Besides, it is very difficult to differentiate directly the small targets from the clutter background. However, the accurate location of the target cannot be determined exactly by the existing approaches. To address such limitations, an efficient strategy is proposed in this study for recognizing the moving targets under sea-clutter background using the proposed Magnetic Ant Lion Optimization algorithm, which is derived by the integration of Magnetic Optimization and Ant Lion Optimization. However, the proposed method achieves effective performance in terms of detection rate, mean-squared error, and the missed target rate with the values of 0.988, 0.012, and 0.224 for vertical–horizontal polarity.},

  abstract     = {To accurately recognize similar objects in different domains, the key for domain adaptation is to learn new metrics so as to minimize the discrepancy of two domains. Recent works utilize joint probability domain adaptation to tackle this problem but get poor performance due to poor discriminability or transferability of data sets. The inaccurate pseudo-labeling in the feature subspace can lead to a chain reaction of errors during iterations, and varieties of the joint probability distribution values further aggravate the miscalculation. To cope with the above problems, this paper proposes a unified framework by introducing Incremental Confidence Samples into Classification (ICSC). ICSC includes both incrementally labeling and adaptively adjusting. With the increase of confidence samples in each iteration, incrementally labeling is used to reduce error accumulations and progressively guarantee good classification performance effectively. Moreover, the tradeoff weight between within-class and between-class distance is adaptively adjusted according to the importance of transferability and discriminability. Consequently, the discrepancy minimization of within-class and the discrepancy maximization of between-class are achieved. Extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, due to the nature of fuzzy calculations, this situation imposes more computational load. The aim of this study is to propose methods for obtaining accurate weights from fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices with the least amount of computational load possible. In this context, two different fuzzy AHP (FAHP) methods based on fuzzy numbers ranking methods have been proposed and these proposed methods are compared with commonly accepted FAHP methods. Magnitude-based fuzzy AHP (MFAHP), which is one of the proposed methods, has outperformed all other methods according to accurate weight and computational load. Although the other proposed method, called the total difference-based fuzzy AHP (TDFAHP), gave better results than the frequently used Chang&#39;s fuzzy extent analysis method, it could not produce more accurate weight results than many other methods in general. But performance analysis shows that it is as good as the MFAHP in terms of computational load.},

We construct the cognitive controller based on a nonlinear controller by transforming its representation into a FCM. This representation gives the opportunity to prove the stability of the cognitive controller in the framework of nonlinear control theory. Moreover, with the deployment of IT2-fuzzy sets which are known to be capable to handle high level of uncertainty, the proposed cognitive controller has the ability to deal with uncertainty that are encountered in real-time world applications. To accomplish the design of the cognitive controller, we present a systematic approach based on genetic algorithm to optimize its parameters and learn fuzzy rules by extracting them from model space (e.g., a set of rules). Within the paper, all steps in constructing and designing the IT2-FCM-based cognitive controller are presented. We first show the performance improvements of the proposed IT2-FCM-based tracking controller with extensive and comparative simulation results and then with experimental results that were collected on real-world mobile robot. The results clearly show the superiority of proposed cognitive control systems when compared to its conventional and fuzzy controller counterparts. We believe that the proposed genetically evolved design approach of the IT2-FCM-based cognitive controller will provide a bridge between the well-developed cognitive sciences and control theory.},

To mitigate this issue, email classification is an important solution with the aim of distinguishing legitimate and spam emails. Artificial intelligence especially machine learning is a major tool for helping detect malicious emails, but the performance might be fluctuant according to specific datasets. The previous research figured out that supervised learning could be acceptable in practice, and that practical evaluation and users&#39; feedback are important. Motivated by these observations, we conduct an empirical study to validate the performance of common learning algorithms under three different environments for email classification.

To do this, a new uncertain environment, interval type-2 Pythagorean fuzzy set (IT2PFS) is introduced to assist the experts for assuring secure and reliable outcomes in hesitant situations. The operational laws on IT2PFS under Dombi -norm and -conorm are defined, which are further utilized to develop geometric Bonferroni mean and Bonferroni mean operators based on Choquet integral (CI) under IT2PFS. The aggregation operators can ennoble the pliability of the information blending process through the adjustment of several parameters and can make good interactions among the criteria with their weights. Thereafter, to determine the weights of the criteria, an empirical method, namely the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is amplified by conjoining CI and IT2PFS into it. A multicriteria decision making method, namely, the multiattribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) and subsequently the CI based grey relational analysis method are then employed to classify the suppliers and derive their corresponding weights with reference to the sustainable criteria. Over and above, a new multiobjective optimization model is exhibited to uphold the purchasing managers for assembling suppliers keeping in mind the sustainability aspects and overall risk of suppliers by following Markowitz portfolio theory. A real-life supply chain management problem is demonstrated to elucidate the aptness and efficiency of the proposed work. Furthermore, the effectiveness and importance of the study are validated via the comparative analysis with existing approaches.

Therefore, the proposal of a greenhouse climate prediction model provides a way to solve this challenge. We focus on the six climatic factors that affect crops growth, including temperature, humidity, illumination, carbon dioxide concentration, soil temperature and soil humidity, and propose a GCP_lstm model for greenhouse climate prediction. The climate change in greenhouse is nonlinear, so we use long short-term memory (LSTM) model to capture the dependence between historical climate data. Moreover, the short-term climate has a greater impact on the future trend of greenhouse climate change. Therefore, we added a 5-min time sliding window through the analysis experiment. In addition, sensors sometimes collect wrong climate data. Based on the existence of abnormal data, our model still has good robustness. We experienced our method on the data sets of three vegetables: tomato, cucumber and pepper. The comparison shows that our method is better than other comparison models.},

  abstract     = {The search for food stimulated by hunger is a common phenomenon in the animal world. Mimicking the concept, recently, an optimization algorithm Hunger Games Search (HGS) has been proposed for global optimization. On the other side, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a commonly utilized nature-inspired algorithm portrayed by a straightforward construction with easy parameters imitating the hunting behavior of humpback whales. However, due to minimum exploration of the search space, WOA has a high chance of trapping into local solutions, and more exploitation leads it towards premature convergence. The concept of hunger from HGS is merged with the food searching techniques of the whale to lessen the inherent drawbacks of WOA. Two weights of HGS are adaptively designed for every whale using the respective hunger level for balancing search strategies. Performance verification of the proposed hunger search-based whale optimization algorithm (HSWOA) is done by comparing it with 10 state-of-the-art algorithms, including three very recently developed algorithms on 30 classical benchmark functions. Comparison with some basic algorithms, recently modified algorithms, and WOA variants is performed using IEEE CEC 2019 function set. Statistical performance of the proposed algorithm is verified with Friedman&#39;s test, boxplot analysis, and Nemenyi multiple comparison test. The operating speed of the algorithm is determined and tested with complexity analysis and convergence analysis. Finally, seven real-world engineering problems are solved and compared with a list of metaheuristic algorithms. Numerical and statistical performance comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms confirms the efficacy of the newly designed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Data augmentation (DA) is a ubiquitous approach for several text generation tasks. Intuitively, in the machine translation paradigm, especially in low-resource languages scenario, many DA methods have appeared. The most commonly used methods are building pseudocorpus by randomly sampling, omitting, or replacing some words in the text. However, previous approaches hardly guarantee the quality of augmented data. In this study, we try to augment the corpus by introducing a constrained sampling method. Additionally, we also build the evaluation framework to select higher quality data after augmentation. Namely, we use the discriminator submodel to mitigate syntactic and semantic errors to some extent. Experimental results show that our augmentation method consistently outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art methods on both small and large-scale corpora in eight language pairs from four corpora by 2.38–4.18 bilingual evaluation understudy points.},

  abstract     = {Dempster–Shafer theory is invaluable for handing uncertain problems in multisource information fusion field. But how to fuse highly conflicting information remains a pending issue. To deal with the issue, we propose a novel reinforced belief divergence measure (named as divergence) to calculate the conflict degree between evidence. The proposed divergence comprehensively considers the effects of the single-element subset and the multielement subset. In addition, the divergence has been proved to be a bounded, nondegenerate, and symmetrical divergence measure. Then, we design a new divergence-based multisource information fusion method. This method combines information volume weights and supports degree weights to modify the evidence before fusion. Finally, an application for fault diagnosis is provided to show that the proposed method is superior to other existing methods.},
