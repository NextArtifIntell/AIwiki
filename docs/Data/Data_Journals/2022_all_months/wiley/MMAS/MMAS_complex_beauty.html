Both estimators utilize either higher order or cross-terms of log-return and they hence have been demonstrated having better convergence property than existing ones (e.g., the widely known realized volatility). However, the proof of the convergence property of RVB/RVQ is rather cumbersome and algebraically complicated. Besides, imposing the spot volatility to be deterministic function of time in the log-price process seems to have deviated from reality. This article devotes attention to (1) relaxing the volatility restriction on the semimartingale process of asset&#39;s price and (2) substantially shortening the original proofs by alternatively employing two useful lemmas (called high-order Itô isometry and adjoint Itô identity ) developed in this study.},

Nevertheless, this recurrence procedure may be applied in cases with any number of factors and levels, even when it is neither a prime nor a power of a prime. We illustrate the method with an application to real data, where the percentage of total deaths due to cancer, diabetes, and any circulatory system disease in three European countries, in 3 years, is compared.

  abstract     = {Let B ^ be a Bézier curve in D 3 , that is, the control points of B ^ are the vectors in D 3 = { u = ( u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) : u i ∈ D ,i = 1,2,3} which is the set of dual vectors whose each coordinate components are dual numbers defined as a + εa * : a , a * ∈ R , ε ≠ 0; ε 2 = 0. So the spherical projection of B ^ is a spherical curve denoted by B ~ on the unit sphere in D 3 and every point of B ~ corresponds to a directed line in real space R 3 by Study transformation. In this study, the ruled surface X ( t , ν ) corresponding to this projection curve B ~ ⁡ ( t ) of dual Bézier curve B ^ ⁡ ( t ) is stated in terms of the parametric equation of the real and dual part of a given dual Bézier curve B ^ ⁡ ( t ) . Also, in this study, some fundamental characteristics such as the striction curve, the Gaussian curvature, and the distribution parameter of the ruled surface X ( t , ν ) corresponding to this projection curve of the dual Bézier curve are investigated. These concepts at any point are stated in terms of the control points of the given dual Bézier curve .},

The main advantage of this method is to reduce the number of independent variables by one. We obtained a special class of self-similar solutions to the problem, and the flow profiles are depicted graphically behind the shock followed by a brief discussion on the behavior of solutions through graphs. The effects of variation in non-ideal parameter, adiabatic index of the gas, Alfven–Mach number and ambient azimuthal velocity exponent on the flow variables are presented.

However, this paper has two main objectives. The first objective is to establish a simple relationship between the Rayleigh waves velocity ( V R ), fundamental Lamb modes ( A 0 and S 0 ), and the shear wave velocity (V S ) in unidirectional viscoelastic carbon–epoxy at high frequency. The second objective is to study the second harmonic Lamb modes. Numerical codes based on Legendre polynomial and Newton–Raphson methods are developed and implemented to predict dispersion and attenuation curves. The second harmonic generation was investigated with the hysteretic and Kelvin–Voigt viscoelastic models. Results showed that rheological models have a much larger effect on the attenuation curves than the ones on the dispersion trajectories. Additionally, the optimal angles of Lamb and SH modes in unidirectional carbon–epoxy under Snell-Descartes law was investigated. The present numerical results may render as a useful message for the rheological community.},

First, the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the model are proved by means of the fixed point theorem. Then, the optimality conditions for achieving the optimal harvesting policy are given by solving the extremum point of the cost functional. Furthermore, the existence of a unique optimal harvesting strategy is demonstrated with the use of Ekeland&#39;s Principle. Finally, the numerical simulations indicate that the creation of marine reserves is indeed conducive to the recovery of fishery resources, increasing fish abundance and protecting biodiversity as well as ecosystem structure.},

  abstract     = {This study concentrates on the dynamics of a prey–predator model incorporating the fear effect in the birth and death rate of prey, whose physiological changes may give rise to undirect predation. In the presence and absence of time delay, single parameter numerical continuation with respect to two parameters, that are (i) fear level in the death rate of prey and (ii) conversion efficiency by which new predators are introduced through prey consumption in the system, is performed. Basic results on extinction and delay-driven Hopf bifurcation criteria are investigated. Then, the model is extended to involve the spatial dynamics with and without time delay. Theoretical results for orientation and stability of Hopf bifurcation in spatial system are provided by applying the normal form recipe and also the center manifold theory. Classical reaction–diffusion-type models, incorporating self-diffusion, can induce regular (periodic) and irregular (chaotic) oscillations in space. However, space periodic oscillations are not common in prey–predator interactions. Here, it is shown that the dynamics of only diffusion involved model is periodically arranged in space and time. However, introducing a very small value of time delay in predator maturation, spatial dynamics with chaos is initiated as a result of the joint effect of time delay and diffusion. This reassures that time delay has a crucial role in population dynamics incorporated with the role of indirect predation and gives some useful intuition into underlying species interactions. Theoretical results of the model in this paper are supported with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a steady, viscous, incompressible, and electrically non-conducting laminar flow of biomagnetic fluid, namely, the flow of blood with magnetic particles over a stretched cylinder in the presence of magnetic dipole, is studied. Since magnetic particles with low cytotoxicity can carry away unwanted reactive oxygen species and provide safeguard for biomedical applications, this study has immense applications in medical and bio-engineering sections like cancer treatment, drug delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The problem is first analyzed by applying group theoretical method, namely, one parameter group method. The invariance property of system of partial differential equations (PDEs) under one parameter group method transformations yields the weeny generators. By using the basic theorem of one parameter group method including invariance conditions, the set of PDEs is converted into ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and consequently, the number of independent variables is reduced into one variable. Afterwards, the resulting coupled nonlinear set of ODEs is numerically solved by introducing an efficient numerical technique that based upon common finite difference with central differencing, a tridiagonal matrix manipulation, and finally, an iterative procedure. A comparative graphical analysis of velocity, temperature profiles, skin friction coefficient and rate of heat transfer for blood-Mn-ZnFe 2 O 4 magnetic fluid has been carried out for various physical parameters such as ferromagnetic interaction parameter and magnetic particles volume fraction etc. The important findings from the present investigation are that the temperature of blood is enhanced for larger values of magnetic particles volume fraction and more effectively than pure blood. It is also found that blood velocity is increased as the ferromagnetic number increases. The skin friction coefficient is enhanced 132.22%, and the rate of heat transfer is increased by 5.86% by the application of magnetic field; whereas for particles volume fraction, skin friction decreases about 0.61%, and rate of heat transfer declines about 4%. Additionally, this study also discloses that the application of group theoretical method is justified in biomagnetic fluid dynamics especially research on blood flow and heat transfer, where the blood flow significantly influenced by the ferromagnetic number. A comparison has been also performed, and the results are found in excellent agreement with previous published in literature. The present study could be considered for magnetic driving of biologically suitable magnetic particles filled with medicine.},

Second of all, we investigate the stability behavior and the onset of Hopf bifurcation of the involved network models by applying the stability theory and the related Hopf bifurcation knowledge on fractional-order differential equations. A sufficient condition to ensure the stability and onset of Hopf bifurcation of the considered network models is established. The importance of time delay in dynamical behavior of the fractional-order delayed BAM neural networks has been displayed.

This method is based on the lowest equal-order approximation (piecewise constants) for both velocity and pressure unknowns. A macro-volume (i.e., a small group of volumes) condition is introduced to build the local stabilized finite volume formulation for the problem. We prove that a stabilization term based on the jump of the discrete pressures over the interior edges of the macro-volume gives a stable scheme. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution are proved. The error estimate of the stabilized finite volume formulation is derived. Finally, some numerical tests are performed to exhibit the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

With the help of eigenfunction expansion, the problem is reduced to four weakly singular integral equations involving horizontal component of velocity across the gaps below the two barriers and above the two corners of the trench. The integral equations are solved by employing Galerkin technique involving expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials for the two unknown velocities across the gaps below the barrier multiplied by an weight function having square root singularity at an end and Gegenbauer polynomials for the other two unknown velocities above the two corners of the trench multiplied by an weight function having one-third singularity at an end. Numerical results for the reflection and transmission coefficients are presented graphically against wavenumber for different configurations of the barriers and trench. The accuracy of the numerical results is validated by comparing the reflection coefficients and the known results associated with barriers and trench available in the literature.},

The other feature here, which is in fact the main one, is the treatment of time-dependent activation functions. The time-independent case has been discussed by one of the authors in Tatar (2020). Unfortunately, it is not applicable to the present situation. Indeed, when applied, it will require a uniform boundedness condition.

Furthermore, the model incorporates three distributed time delays for the production of active infected hepatocytes, mature capsids, and virions. The well-posedness of the proposed model is established by showing the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. Five equilibria of the model are identified in terms of five threshold parameters R 0 , R 1 , R 2 , R 3 $$ {R}_0,{R}_1,{R}_2,{R}_3 $$ , and R 4 $$ {R}_4 $$ .

Exact boundary controllability is proved in the range of both subcritical and critical potentials and for sufficiently large time, through a boundary controller acting away from the degenerate/singular point. By duality argument, we reduce the problem to an observability estimate for the corresponding adjoint system, which is proved by means of the multiplier method and new Hardy-type inequalities.},

  abstract     = {Health education directly affects the different behaviors of individuals who visit and do not visit after illness by reporting the number of patients and their changing rate. As a result, visiting and non-visiting patients have different infection rates, cure rates, and disease-related mortality. In response to this impact, this article establishes a model to further analyze the impact of health education on the spread of diseases. We divide patients into visiting and non-visiting patients and introduce a weighting function that depends on the number of visiting patients and their changing rate. We constructs an implicit differential equations and use the properties of Lambert W function and its inverse function to transform it into piecewise smooth systems with explicit definitions. According to the analysis method of switched system, the two subsystems are analyzed qualitatively. The results show that health education cannot affect the basic reproduction number of disease transmission, but it causes the system to produce many types of equilibria. In addition, the difference in the healing rate and self-healing rate between visiting and non-visiting patients will affect the number of visiting and non-visiting patients and the stability of the equilibria. Moreover, the system will generate fold branch. In addition, the patient&#39;s healing/self-healing rate and the implementation of health education will affect the appearance of virtual or false equilibrium. Numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis further confirm that the total number of visiting and non-visiting patients will decrease with the increase of health education. Finally, our research results show that health education can reduce the infection rate only if there are enough susceptible people receiving health education.},

  abstract     = {The Wenzel and Cassie–Baxter wetting states are treated as basis states producing a continuous spectrum of intermediate states. The model considering them as a linear combination of the basis states is proposed and successfully applied to independent data converted within this framework from the terms of absolute vertical deviations as roughness characteristics into the Wenzel r -based roughness concept. Roughness dependences of apparent contact angles are reproduced therewith. The degree of symmetry is shown to influence measurements, calculations and possibly definition of the contact angle. The cotangent formula linking the drop size and apparent contact angle is derived from the well-known non-linear differential model for a drop shape. This enables one to pre-estimate changes in contact angles due to drop size changes what is important for a more precise definition of superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity. The analysis of an oval-shaped curve as the most general contact line on inclines is performed. The dependence of apparent contact angle on incline tilt and azimuthal angle is derived for the regime of pinning the drop onto a flat surface having been tilted before, unlike the well-known case of tilting the flat surface with a sessile drop whose contact line is circle-shaped. The contact angle is found to be a non-monotonous function of azimuthal angle because the contact line possesses now a reduced symmetry and, therefore, a varying curvature with extrema. Drop ensembles on incline are discussed, and their modeling with application to macroscopic processes requires treatment of the contact line in its most general case, that is, oval shaped.},

In this model, the retailer offers a price discount to customers if they can commit their orders prior to the sales period. It encourages the retailer to order a large quantity that can be stored in an owned warehouse and then in a rented warehouse if there are excess items. Shortages are allowed and partially backlogged. The objective of this paper is to simultaneously determine the optimal price discount, the optimal order quantity, and the optimal replenishment schedule in such a way that the expected total profit is maximized. Two theorems are proved in order to verify that the expected total profit function is concave and to identify that an optimal replenishment decision exists. We further propose an algorithm to find the optimal replenishment policy by the retailer. Finally, we use numerical examples to illustrate the results presented herein. Moreover, based upon the sensitivity analysis, some important managerial implications are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {The world has been suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since late 2019. COVID-19 is caused by a virus called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in many patients around the world. This has raised the alarm for the importance of understanding the dynamics of coinfection and its impact on the lives of patients. As in other pandemics, mathematical modeling is one of the important tools that can help medical and experimental studies of COVID-19. In this paper, we develop a within-host SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection model. The model consists of six ordinary differential equations. It depicts the interactions between uninfected epithelial cells, infected epithelial cells, free SARS-CoV-2 particles, uninfected CD4 + T cells, infected CD4 + T cells, and free HIV particles. We confirm that the solutions of the developed model are biologically acceptable by proving their nonnegativity and boundedness. We compute all possible steady states and derive their positivity conditions. We choose suitable Lyapunov functions to prove the global asymptotic stability of all steady states. We run some numerical simulations to enhance the global stability results. Based on our model, weak CD4 + T cell immune response or low CD4 + T cell counts in SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfected patient increase the concentrations of infected epithelial cells and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This causes the coinfected patient to suffer from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This result agrees with many studies which showed that HIV patients are at greater risk of suffering from severe COVID-19 when infected. More studies are needed to understand the nature of SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection and the role of different immune responses during infection.},

Matched disturbances are coped through a nonlinear controller, while mismatched disturbances are rejected by a pseudo-state feedback, whose gain is adjusted by solving alinear matrix inequality. Since nonsmooth techniques induce not-necessarily integer-order differentiable solutions, the dynamical systems under consideration are defined through an operator that extends the distributed-order differentiation of integer-order differentiable functions to the case of not necessarily integer-order differentiable ones. Numerical simulations highlight the reliability of the proposed scheme.},

Using the reproducing kernel functions of the Sobolev spaces on the unit interval [ 0,1 ] $$ \left[0,1\right] $$ , we construct a dictionary to implement the W-POAFD. Based on orthonormalizataion, we can select the crucial parameters successively by adopting the weak maximal selection strategy of the W-POAFD method. Then the numerical solutions have “sparse”  representations, which converge to the analytic solution with fast convergence rate. Some numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the W-POAFD method in this three-point boundary value problem.},

Two convenient and effective numerical techniques namely the Adams–Bashforth Method (ABM) and Milne-Simpson Method (MSM) are employed to analyze the epidemic model. The influences of the contact rate parameter (β), recovery parameter (μ) and death parameter (α) on the variables including S, I and R are studied comprehensively.

The model consists of the Navier–Stokes–Voigt equations where the instantaneous kinematic viscosity has been replaced by a memory term incorporating hereditary effects coupled with the Cahn–Hilliard equation with Flory–Huggins potential. The resulting system is subject to no-slip condition for the (volume averaged) fluid velocity u $$ \mathbf{u} $$ and to no-flux boundary conditions for the order parameter ϕ $$ \phi $$ and the chemical potential μ $$ \mu $$ . We first establish the well-posedness of the initial and boundary value problem. Then, taking advantage of an Ekman-type damping, we obtain a dissipative estimate. Thus, we can define a dissipative dynamical system on a suitable phase space. Also, we show that any weak solution is such that regularizes in finite time, and in dimension two, it stays uniformly away from pure phases; that is, the instantaneous strict separation property holds. Finally, we prove the existence of the global attractor, and exploiting the strict separation property, we demonstrate that an exponential attractor exists in dimension two.},

  abstract     = {The calibration method has been widely used to incorporate auxiliary information in the estimation of various parameters. Specifically, some authors adapted this method to estimate the distribution function, although their proposal is computationally simple, its efficiency depends on the selection of an auxiliary vector of points. This work deals with the problem of selecting the calibration auxiliary vector that minimizes the asymptotic variance of the calibration estimator of distribution function. The optimal dimension of the optimal auxiliary vector is reduced considerably with respect to previous studies so that with a smaller set of points, the minimum of the asymptotic variance can be reached, which in turn allows to improve the efficiency of the estimates.},

The fourth-order derivative of the solution function is expanded in Haar series and then integrated to get the approximations for the lower order derivatives of the solution function. The convergence of the proposed method is analyzed. The analysis shows that the error bound is inversely proportional to the wavelet resolution. The method is applied on three test problems to check its performance. The proposed method is computationally fast, cheap, and reliable, even considering low-order wavelet resolutions. Another important advantage of the proposed method is that it can be easily extended to similar classes of problems with a variety of boundary conditions.},

In the algorithm, the movement of each individual toward the best member of the population is not represented as a linear vector; instead, it can change nonlinearly according to the discrete-time that is represented by the iteration number. By implementing this change, the speed of each member of the population can be controlled, which results in finding a better solution. As there is a dependency on the iteration number, it is named the Iteration Dependent Optimizer (IDO). The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on unconstrained unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions and constrained engineering optimization problems. Then the algorithm is used to solve a practical problem in civil engineering, in which unknown parameters of the model of a large-scale magnetorheological (MR) damper, which is commonly used in structural control, are identified. The results of statistical study and direct comparisons demonstrate the advantages and capabilities of the proposed model and indicate that IDO can compete favorably with some other well-studied algorithms.},

Vaccinating a population with reduction in number of infected individuals at minimal cost is considered as an optimization problem.

  abstract     = {In this study, a stable observer-based feedback controller has been designed for treatment of hepatitis C infectious disease under interferon (IFN) therapy. In order to consider the memory behavior and uncertain nature of this biological system, an unknown dynamics fractional-order (FO) model has been utilized for describing the interactions between the healthy cells, infected cells, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). To cope with unknown dynamics, the fuzzy logic system (FLS) has been utilized. Limitation of the drug efficacy due to its negative side effects has been taken into account as an input saturation. In order to estimate the unknown states which are required for treatment, a full-order fuzzy observer has been designed. Stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of observer dynamics, input limitation, and unknown system dynamics has been established via the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller has been demonstrated via a simulation study. Simulation results indicate that under the proposed treatment strategy, all system states remain bounded, and the infected cells concentration decreases to the cure boundary.},

The observation set is usually used as a supervised set to train a neural network or to build functions for machine learning. In order to solve the problem, we propose applying optimal control tools. To this effect following Vapnik, we define the risk functional depending on probability distribution functions, and we construct a set of functions based on the observation set. The construction draw on using only those functions that satisfy some differential equation with suitable properties as it is usually done in optimal control theory. Next, we apply a dual dynamic programming to formulate a new optimal control problem. As a consequence, we state and prove a verification theorem for an approximation of an unknown probability distribution function defining the observation set. We estimate the difference between the approximate probability distribution function and the best probability distribution with distance defined by the risk functional.},

The desired trajectory tracking objective is achieved via a novel adaptive control strategy, in which the existing concept of pinning control is extended to an adaptive pinning control. The adaptive control is based on a recurrent high-order neural network identification strategy for unknown pinned nodes dynamics. The combined pinning-neural features in tracking control constitute the novelty of this approach. The proposed control law operates properly with a different reference along with unknown dynamics and coupling variations. In contrast to the linearization approach, less restrictive assumptions for node dynamics are imposed. Moreover, matrix conditions that include network topology and control properties for both pinned and non-pinned nodes are obtained. The applicability of this control scheme is illustrated via simulations.},

This is a full splitting approach, in the sense that non-smooth functions are processed individually via their proximity operators. The convergence of the IPDFP is obtained by reformulating the problem to the sum of three non-smooth convex functions. Furthermore, we propose a preconditioning technique for the IPDFP. The key idea of the preconditioning technique is that the constant iterative parameters are updated self-adaptively in the iteration process. What&#39;s more, we also give a simple and easy way to choose the diagonal preconditioners while the convergence of the iterative algorithms is maintained. This work brings together and notably extends several classical splitting schemes, like the primal-dual method proposed by Chambolle and Pock, and the recent proximity algorithms of Charles et al. designed for the /TV image denoising model. The iterative algorithm is used for solving non-differentiable convex optimization problems arising in image processing.},

First, we perform an analysis of the symmetry reductions for this parabolic partial differential equation by applying the Lie symmetry method. The invariance property of a partial differential equation under a Lie group of transformations yields the infinitesimal generators. By using this invariance condition, we present a complete classification of the Lie point symmetries for the different forms of the functions that the partial differential equation involves. Afterwards, the optimal systems of one-dimensional subalgebras for each maximal Lie algebra are determined, by computing previously the commutation relations, with the Lie bracket operator, and the adjoint representation. Next, the reductions to ordinary differential equations are derived from the optimal systems of one-dimensional subalgebras. Furthermore, we study travelling wave reductions depending on the form of the two arbitrary functions of the original equation. Some travelling wave solutions are obtained, such as solitons, kinks and periodic waves.},

We use the thermodynamic relations between free energy, entropy, and internal energy to find the functions of the cluster size distribution in the statistical mechanics of extensive and nonextensive. By comparing these obtained functions with the probability function predicted by Penrose, we provide a suitable approximate probability function.

Different from the classical Khasminskii-type conditions in the literature, we provide some sufficient conditions for the mean square and almost sure exponential stability for controlled HNSFDEswID by using the M $$ M $$ -matrix technique and a suitable Lyapunov functional. In this sense, the main contributions of our results, compared with those in the literature, are the infinite time delay, the neutral term, and the new Lyapunov functions.

First, the asymptotic behavior of solutions for scalar difference equation Δ ⁢ x ⁡ ( n ) = − a ⁡ ( n ) ⁢ x ⁡ ( n ) + B ⁡ ( n , x n ) $$ \Delta x(n)&amp;#x0003D;-a(n)x(n)&amp;#x0002B;B\left(n,{x}_n\right) $$ is discussed, and some new criteria on the asymptotic stability of the zero solution are obtained under weaker assumptions. Then the dissipativity of a nonautonomous delay difference system with superlinear nonlinearities is investigated. By using the inequalities established here, it is shown that the discrete set-valued process generated by the system possesses a unique global pullback attractor.},

The dynamic system is governed by Itô-type controlled stochastic differential equation. The coefficients of the dynamic depend on the state process and of its probability law and the continuous control variable. In terms of a classical convex variational techniques, we establish a set of necessary conditions of optimal singular control in the form of maximum principle.

  abstract     = {The axisymmetric problem of the theory of elasticity for the radially heterogeneous transverse-isotopic nonclosed spheres is studied, which does not contain any of the poles 0 and π. The elasticity modules are taken as the linear functions of the radius of the sphere. It is assumed that the lateral surface of the sphere is free from stresses, and in the conical sections, the arbitrary stresses are set that provide equilibrium for the sphere. After consideration of the homogeneous boundary conditions, set on the lateral surfaces of the sphere, the characteristic equation for the spectral parameter is obtained. On the basis of the asymptotic analysis, a classification of the roots of the characteristic equation is made relatively small parameter that characterizes the thickness of the sphere. Corresponding asymptotic solutions are constructed depending on the roots of the characteristic equation. The behavior of the constructed solutions is studied in the internal parts of the sphere, as well as in the neighborhood of the conical sections.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, to investigate the synthetic effect of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and ART (antiretrovial therapy) on HIV transmission among MSM (men who have sex with men) in heterogenous environment, a realistic HIV epidemic model with spatial diffusion is established. Here, HIV infectious people are divided into three immunity based compartments, that is, CD4+ T cell count less than 350, between 350 and 500, and more than 500, respectively. The basic reproduction number R 0 is established and proved as a threshold parameter: The global asymptotic stability of the disease-free steady state holds for R 0 &lt; 1 , and the disease will be present if R 0 &gt; 1 . Considering the substantial advantages of PrEP and ART in controlling HIV transmissions among MSM, the optimal control problem is presented for the case of positive constant diffusion coefficients, which minimize the total population of susceptible individual and HIV infected individual, the cost of PrEP and ART therapy. As an illustration of our theoretical results, we conduct numerical simulations. We also conduct an optimal control case study where model parameters are estimated from the demographic and epidemiological data from China. This work suggests the following: (1) Spatial factors cannot be ignored during the HIV intervention; (2)taking the PrEP intervention measure for HIV transmissions among MSM as early as possible will help to improve the control efficiency and reduces its cost; (3) reducing the PrEP drug costs will promote the efficiency of PrEP treatment in preventing the spread of HIV among MSM.},

The analytical method is to solve steady-state response and transient response solutions of the system by means of average method and then the total displacement response solution is the sum of steady-state solution and transient solution. The numerical method is to use the Grünwald–Letnikov definition of fractional derivatives to discretize the fractional differential term in the system and then to reduce the order of the original system. Then, the approximate response solution of the system under the general periodic excitation is obtained by using the Fourier series expansion method and the superposition principle of linear system. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the analytical technique are verified by numerical simulation, and the influence of fractional order, linear damping coefficient and fractional derivative coefficient on the amplitude of the steady-state response and the total displacement response of the system is analyzed.},

By applying a control force at the center body of the spacecraft, we shall suppress these vibrations; namely, we establish stability results of the system under appropriate assumptions imposed on the relaxation function.

Studying the simplified case of two agents, we show that, depending on the parameter regime, anticipation may have both a stabilizing and destabilizing effect on the solutions. In particular, we demonstrate numerically that moderate level of anticipation generically promotes convergence towards consensus, while too high level disturbs it. Motivated by this observation, we derive sufficient conditions for asymptotic consensus in multiple-agent systems, which are explicit in the parameter values delay length and anticipation level. The proofs are based on construction of suitable Lyapunov-type functionals.},

Moreover, there exists a threshold value for predator capturing rate , below or equal to which the predators always tend to extinction, above which the predators and preys will coexist in the form of multiple steady states or periodic oscillations for all positive initial populations.

Secondly, based on it, the explicit formula of the solution of homogeneous Riemann–Liouville (RL) fractional-order delay difference system is obtained. Thirdly, the explicit formulas of the solutions of nonhomogeneous RL fractional-order delay difference systems are also derived in terms of the superposition principle and the new discrete delayed Mittag–Leffler matrix function. Furthermore, a finite-time stability (FTS) criterion of nonhomogeneous RL fractional-order delay difference system is given using the properties of the new discrete delayed Mittag–Leffler matrix function.

  abstract     = {When a real-life problem is mathematically modeled by differential equations or another type of equation, there are always intrinsic phenomena that are not taken into account and can affect the behavior of such a model. For example, external forces can abruptly change the model; impulses and delay can cause a breakdown of it. Considering these intrinsic phenomena in the mathematical model makes the difference between a simple differential equation and a differential equation with impulses, delay, and nonlocal conditions. So, in this work, we consider a semilinear nonautonomous neutral differential equation under the influence of impulses, delay, and nonlocal conditions. In this paper we study the controllability of these semilinear neutral differential equations with some of these intrinsic phenomena taking into consideration. Our aim is to prove that the controllability of the associated ordinary linear differential equation is preserved under certain conditions imposed on these new disturbances. In order to achieve our objective, we apply Rothe&#39;s fixed point Theorem to prove the exact controllability of the system. Finally, our method can be extended to the evolution equation in Hilbert spaces with applications to control systems governed by PDE&#39;s equations.},

The aim of this research is to study the combined effects of the white noise, regime switching, and toxin-producing phytoplankton (TPP) on the dynamics of the system. Firstly, the existence and uniqueness of global positive solution of the system is investigated. Then some sufficient conditions for the extinction, persistence in the mean, and the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution of the system are derived. Significantly, some numerical simulations are carried to verify our analytical results and show that high intensity of white noise is harmful to the survival of plankton populations, but regime switching can balance the different survival states of plankton populations and decrease the risk of extinction. Additionally, it is found that an increase in the toxin liberation rate produced by TPP will increase the survival chance of phytoplankton, while it will reduce the biomass of zooplankton. All these results may provide some insightful understanding on the dynamics of phytoplankton–zooplankton systems in randomly disturbed aquatic environments.},

Then, by employing a new type of fixed-time control lemma, two flexible control strategies are designed to realize the output fixed-time synchronization of the multiweighted CNNs, and less conservative criteria are obtained.

  abstract     = {In recent years, there appeared a growing interest in the inverse spectral theory for functional-differential operators with frozen argument. Such operators are nonlocal and belong to the so-called loaded differential operators, which frequently appear in mathematics as well as natural sciences and engineering. However, to various classes of nonlocal operators, classical methods of the inverse spectral theory are not applicable. For this reason, it is relevant to develop new methods and approaches for solving inverse problems for operators of this type. We establish a deep connection between the inverse problem for operators with frozen argument and Chebyshev polynomials of the first and the second kinds. Appearing to be of an interest from the point of view of the Chebyshev polynomials theory itself, this connection gives a new perspective method for studying inverse problems for operators with frozen argument. In particular, it allows one to completely describe all non-degenerate and degenerate cases, that is, when the corresponding inverse problem is uniquely solvable or not, respectively. Moreover, it gives a convenient description of all isospectral potentials in the degenerate case, which is demonstrated by some illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a wavelet method is introduced for solving Caputo–Hadamard fractional differential equations on an arbitrary interval. The proposed method is the fractional-order generalization of sine–cosine wavelets (FGSCWs). The operational matrices of fractional-order integration are constructed for solving initial value problem as well as boundary value problem. Furthermore, numerical solution of nonlinear Caputo–Hadamard fractional differential equation is obtained with the conjunction of proposed method with quasilinearization technique. We have constructed the FGSCW operational matrix, FGSCW operational matrix of Hadamard fractional integration of arbitrary order, and FGSCW operational matrix of Hadamard fractional integration for Caputo–Hadamard fractional boundary value problems. Convergence analysis of the proposed method is investigated. Numerical procedure is given for both Caputo–Hadamard initial and boundary value problems. Illustrative examples show the reliability and efficiency of the proposed method and give solution with less error.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we study the asymptotic behavior of two laminated beams systems formed by two identical layers of uniform thickness, whose surfaces are held together by an adhesive layer that allows interfacial sliding. We prove that when single Kelvin–Voigt damping acts on the transverse displacement equation, the system is not exponentially stable. When the system has two frictional dampings, one working on the transverse displacement and the other on the interface, the system is exponentially stable as long as the wave propagation speeds are equal. Then, one could think that if we replace the frictional damping (weak damping), acting on the transverse displacement, with Kelvin–Voigt damping (strong damping), the system should also be exponentially stable, at least when the wave speeds are equal. However, as we show in this work, Kelvin–Voigt damping causes the loss of exponential stability of the system, even when the system&#39;s waves&#39; propagation speeds coincide. Therefore, we are in a situation where the weak damping (frictional) is stronger than the strong damping (Kelvin–Voigt). Due to these results of lack of exponential decay, we study the polynomial stability of each of these two systems by obtaining an optimal decay rate in each case.},

Firstly, MEW-Burgers equation is transformed into an equivalent planar dynamical system by using traveling wave transformation. Then the global structure of the planar system is presented, and solitary waves, kink waves (anti-kink waves), and periodic waves are found. Secondly, Jacobi stability for the planar system is studied based on KCC theory, and Jacobi stability of any point on the trajectory of system is dicussed. The dynamical behavior of the deviation vector near the equilibrium points is analyzed, and the numerical simulation is consistent with the theoretical analysis. Lyapunov stability and Jacobi stability of the equilibrium points are also compared and analyzed. The obtaining results show that Lyapunov stability of the equilibrium points of the system is not exactly consistent with Jacobi stability. Finally, the planar system with periodic disturbance is transformed into a six dimensional nonlinear system, and the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamical behaviors of the system are numerically simulated.},

The final value problem is transformed into a dimensionless initial value problem; also, to avoid the large truncation error, the infinite domain is truncated into a finite domain. A noteworthy observation is that the proposed Haar wavelet scheme is effective and easy to implement to analyze the different physical and numerical aspects of the options&#39; Greeks. It explicitly provides the numerical approximation of all the derivatives of the solution function. Also, the non-smooth payoff functions are approximated well with the Haar wavelet approximation technique of estimating the spiked functions, so there is no need to deal with the discontinuity separately. We prove the consistency and stability of the proposed method and show that the proposed method is the first- and second-order accurate in the temporal and spatial directions, respectively. A variety of test examples conclusively demonstrates the computational proficiency and the theoretical results of the proposed scheme. Different attributes of the Greeks of distinct binary options are analyzed graphically. The motivational work of the study of various Greeks of different binary options significantly impacts the hedging strategies used by different financial institutes.},

The model is constructed using a system of nonlinear delay differential equations. In the model, there are three state variables: plant populations (P 1 &amp; P 2 ) and density of allelochemical (T). It is assumed that in the presence of density of allelochemicals, plant populations are affected. It further delays the conversion of resource into the density of allelochemicals and hence affects the plant population adversely. This effect is observed by using delay in the competition model. Equilibrium points are calculated. Using the Routh–Hurwitz theorem, certain explicit formulations defining the stability and path of the Hopf-bifurcation periodic solutions at the positive equilibrium are obtained.

The method is based on statistical moments but does not require all samples. This is achieved by relating the probability distribution with these statistical moments. The novelty of the method is the calculation of coefficients associated with the mpdf on a suitable Riesz basis chosen for L 2 ⁡ ( Ω ) $$ {L}&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0005E;2\left(\Omega \right) $$ . The chosen base has several advantages. First, once the coefficients are known to calculate the mpdf, it does not require any matrix inversion. Second, these coefficients can be precalculated and stored. Third, the method is modular, which makes it possible to parallelize the process. These advantages lead us to a very accurate and economical procedure from a cost perspective of computational efforts and time savings. Different numerical examples are presented to prove the effectiveness of our proposed methodology and are compared with more traditional approaches, such as the kernel density method.},

By using the nonlocal vector calculus, in a manner analogous to the local partial differential equations counterpart, we proved that the cost functional is a strictly convex functional with a unique global minimizer. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of parameter identification are further demonstrated.

For the electromagnetic field, mixed boundary conditions are given. Also, the viscosity, magnetic permeability, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat of the fluid depend on the temperature. Special attention is paid to the meaning of non-homogeneous mixed boundary conditions for magnetic field. For the problem involving the static pressure and stress boundary conditions for fluid, it is proven that if the data of problem are small enough, then there exists a solution and the solution with small norm is unique when the viscosity, magnetic permeability, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat are independent of the temperature. For the problem involving the total pressure and total stress boundary conditions for fluid, the existence of a solution is proven when a datum concerned with non-homogeneous boundary conditions for magnetic field is small, but without smallness of other data.},

We consider the problem in the setting of a 2D rectangular box where an instability of the homogeneous steady state occurs due to the perturbations in the direction of several modes becoming critical simultaneously. Our main results are twofold: (1) a rigorous characterization of the types and structure of the dynamic transitions of the model from basic homogeneous states and (2) the relation between the dynamic transitions and the pattern formations. We observe that the Brusselator model exhibits different transition types and patterns depending on the nonlinear interactions of the pattern of the critical modes.},

  abstract     = {Since the pioneering work of Turing, it has been known that diffusion can destablise a homogeneous solution that is stable in the underlying model in the absence of diffusion. The destabilisation of the homogeneous solutions leads to the generation of patterns. In recent years, techniques have been developed to analyse so-called localised spatial structures. These are solutions in which the spatial structure occurs in a localised region. Unlike Turing patterns, they do not spread out across the whole domain. We investigate the existence of localised structures that occur in two predator-prey models. The functionalities chosen have been widely used in the literature. The existence of localised spatial structures has not investigated previously. Indeed, it is easy to show that these models cannot exhibit the Turing instability. This has perhaps led earlier researchers to conclude that interesting spatial solutions can therefore not occur for these models. The novelty of our paper is that we show the existence of stationary localised patterns in systems which do not undergo the Turing instability. The mathematical tools used are a combination of Linear and weakly nonlinear analysis with supporting numerical methods. By combining these methods, we are able to identify conditions for a wide range of increasing exotic behaviour. This includes the Belyckov-Devaney transition, a codimension two spatial instability point and the formation of localised patterns. The combination of spectral computations and numerical simulations reveals the crucial role played by the Hopf bifurcation in mediating the stability of localised spatial solutions. Finally, numerical solutions in two spatial dimensions confirms the onset of intricate spatio-temporal patterns within the parameter regions identified within one spatial dimension.},

Moreover, new algorithms for their processing and calculation, including tone value increase (TVI)-based ones, are being constantly proposed. However, due to the fact that TRCs are just one-dimensional curves covering only one colorant, they are not able to produce an exact match of all colors. Color adjustment with the help of the TRC is unstable, that is, a slight change in one color channel has a dramatic effect on the color reproduction in output. The use of gradation trajectories (GT) as an analytical model within the CIE Lab color space describing the behavior of the entire color gamut of the reproduction device makes it possible to more accurately adjust the individual color channel. Describing GT using the parametric Bézier curves further simplifies this process. In this work, we use GT to fit the TRC/TVI with the parameters recommended by ISO 12647-2:2013.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy and repeatability of the color reproduction in print is determined by the fine-tuning of the tone reproduction curves of the basic printing colorants (most often this is CMYK). However, the diversity of manufacturers of printing equipment and dyes introduces an element of significant uncertainty about color uniformity. In addition, the traditional approach does not take into account the effect of hue change when applying the original dyes, as well as the nonlinearity of the hue rise in high- and low-density areas. Determining the color of base colorants that produces the most uniform tone change is an important engineering challenge. Previously, there was no scientific basis for such calculations. We recently proposed an alternative color correction model based on gradation trajectories as an analogue of gradation curves in the CIE Lab space. We have also described the extension of the approach to double color overlay (gradation surfaces) and its analytical and discrete implications. The trajectories are the geodetic lines on gradation surfaces. In this paper, we propose using the gradation trajectories to determine “ideal” or “true” initial printing dyes for electrophotography. To simplify calculations, natural color discretization in digital printing is used.},

Comparison with the solution of the corresponding unperturbed spherical problem is included, together with numerical demonstration of the produced errors in special deformation cases. The results suggest that significant errors are caused when large inaccuracies in the head-brain structure in the vicinity of EEG source are not taken into account.

  abstract     = {The discrete element method (DEM) is the method of choice in many cases of simulation and analysis of processes in granular matter, providing the data at the level of individual particles. In most applications and experiments, however, the bulk behavior is of interest; therefore, larger scale structures must be identified from the DEM simulation data. We present the method for detection of particle groups involved in collective motion based on network analysis. Knowing the positions and velocities of individual particles, a “velocity similarity graph” is built, where the graph vertices represent the particles. The vertex pairs are connected by the edge if the distance between the respective particles is small enough. The edge weight is calculated to be inversely proportional to the difference in the respective particle velocities, that is, the vertex pairs representing nearby particles having similar velocities are connected by edges of larger weight. If a group of particles moves in a coordinated matter, the particles in this group will have similar velocities; therefore, the corresponding vertices in the graph will be connected by edges of larger weight in the representing graph. Having produced the velocity similarity graph, identification of particle groups becomes equivalent to the problem of “community detection” in graph analysis. The algorithms and techniques developed for community detection in graphs can be thereby applied for identification of particle groups involved in coordinated motion in granular matter. We illustrate this approach by an example of granular media filled in a rotating cylinder.},

The properties of an alloy are determined by its composition and are subject to careful modeling. A set of basic refractory elements makes a special contribution to the parameters of the alloy. One of the main mechanical properties of the alloys is the high-temperature tensile strength. Determining the influence of certain elements on certain properties of an alloy is a complex scientific and engineering problem that affects the time and cost of developing new materials. Simulation is a great chance to cut costs. In this article, we predict high temperature strength based on the composition of refractory elements in alloys using a specially designed deep learning artificial neural network. We build the model based on prior knowledge of alloy composition, information on the role of alloying elements, type of crystallization, test temperature and time, and tensile strength. Successful simulation results show the applicability of this method in practice.},

  abstract     = {Type 1 diabetes is the worldwide issue nowadays. Partial differential equations (PDEs) models are used to control the disease with different techniques. Efforts are being made to find the controllability of the model for designing the feedback loop control. The concept of controllability and observability is used for the purpose to control the human glucose insulin systems by designing a feedback loop control if the system is controllable and observable. Return method is used to find controllability of the model. This technique is more reliable in case of PDE model to design the fully automatic artificial pancreas to control the diseases.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of matrix–vector multiplication is of considerable importance. No current approaches can optimize this sufficiently well under severe time constraints. All major existing methods are based on either manual-tuning or auto-tuning and can therefore be time-consuming. We introduce an alternative model-driven approach, which is used to map the implementation of matrix–vector multiplication to a target architecture and analytically obtain its parameters. The approach yields the performance that is competitive with optimized Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)-like dense linear algebra libraries without the need for manual-tuning or auto-tuning. Our method provides competitive performance across hardware architectures and can be utilized to obtain single-threaded and multi-threaded implementations on multicore processors. We expect that this approach allows the community to progress from valuable engineering solutions to techniques with a broader application.},

The inverse problem of finding the multiple surfaces that divide the constant density layers is an ill-posed one described by a nonlinear integral equation of the first kind. To solve it, it is necessary to apply the regularization ideas. The new regularized variants of the gradient type methods with the weighting factors are constructed, namely, the steepest descent and conjugate gradient method. We suggest the empirical rule for choosing the regularization parameters. On the basis of the constructed methods, we elaborate the parallel algorithms and implement them in the multicore CPU using the OpenMP technology. A set of experiments with the disturbed data is performed to test the gradient algorithms and study performance of the developed code. For the test problems with quasi-real data, these new regularized algorithms increase the accuracy and speed up computation in comparison with the unregularized ones. By using the 8-core CPU, we achieve the speedup of 8 times.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, major attention has been devoted to fractional-order partial differential equations since they seem to be more efficient in modeling complex processes. Fractional-order partial differential equations are considered as generalizations of classical integer-order partial differential equations. In many areas of electrophysiology and in modeling neuronal dynamics, the cable equation plays a major role. In this article, the authors constructed to approximate the numerical solutions of the two-dimensional fractional cable equation using the time-space Jacobi pseudospectral method. The proposed method is established in both time and space to approximate the solutions. Moreover, we use fractional Lagrange interpolants polynomial as a test function, which satisfies the Kronecker delta property at Jacobi–Gauss–Lobatto (JGL) points. The fractional derivative is defined in the modified Riemann–Liouville fractional derivatives formula at JGL points. Using the proposed method, the approximate solution is obtained by solving a diagonally block system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The stability analysis of the proposed method, uniqueness of the solution, and error estimate are also provided. Finally, numerical solutions are demonstrated to justify the theoretical results and confirm the expected convergence rate. The pseudospectral solutions are more accurate as compared to the available results to date in the same vicinity.},

The stochastic soliton and periodic solutions are denoted as functional solutions with Brownian motion environment. For the acquired solutions, comparisons and graphical representations with three-dimensional graphs are shown for peculiar values of the existing parameters.

As additional information for solving inverse problems, the solution of the direct problem for x = x 0 is given. At the beginning, an auxiliary problem, which is equivalent to the original problem, is introduced. Then the auxiliary problem is reduced to an equivalent closed system of Volterra-type integral equations with respect to unknown functions. Applying the method of contraction mappings to this system in the continuous class of functions with weighted norms, we prove the main result of the article, which is a global existence and uniqueness theorem of inverse problem solutions.},

We give optimality and comparison results of the corresponding HJB equation having unique non-smoothness and discontinuity. To numerically compute HJB equations, we propose a new fast-sweep method resorting to neither pseudo-time integration nor vanishing discount. The optimal policy and the effective Hamiltonian are then computed simultaneously. Convergence rate of numerical solutions is computationally analyzed. An advanced robust control counterpart where the dynamics involve uncertainties is also numerically considered.},

It is noteworthy that the integro-differential equations are studied for integers in the literature, and we have proposed the solutions of proportional delayed integro-differential equations for fractional order. The evaluated results are verified numerically by considering some test examples of fractional integro-differential equations and fractional models of the system of multi-pantograph differential equations. The outcomes conclude that evaluated series solutions via FDTM promise more appropriate approximations possess very negligible error and represent the convergent approximations.

Their research results often deviate from the actual situation. For decision-makers, the delay of quarantine measures according to its formulation is liable to bring losses. Given this, we establish a new class of SIQRS models based on the nonlinear incidence and focus on the effect of time delay on the propagation characteristics of the system. Firstly, we calculate the basic reproduction number of the transmission dynamics model to obtain the expression of the transmission threshold. Secondly, by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, we prove the stability of the disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point of the system. Thirdly, we add model immune parameters to study three different immunization strategies, namely, uniform immunization, targeted immunization, and acquaintance immunization. Studies show that compared with uniform immunization, targeted and acquaintance immunization have better control effects. When the immunization ratio increases, the number of infected people decreases, and immune factors can control the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, we calculate the optimal quarantine level value to solve the problem of financial costs in quarantine measures to control infectious diseases. Finally, we verify conclusions of the theoretical research by numerical simulation and further discover that when an infection is in the high-density outbreak, the time delay will lead to a slower convergence rate of the disease. And with the increase of time delay, the control cost will also increase gradually.},

For this reason, various deterministic and stochastic models have been studied in the past decades. However, the effect of transitions which is caused by either internal or external environmental noise has given less attention. In this work, we introduce a robust and an efficient numerical scheme based on Legendre spectral collocation method (LSCM) to explore the asymptomatic behavior of stochastic influenza avian model. We consider the model in which both birds and human population are exposed class, while for the human population, the asymptomatic class is also considered, taking into account that the asymptomatic human beings may get re-infected and migrate to symptomatic class. A fragmented treatment gives more consideration as they relocate symptomatic individuals towards the asymptomatic class. A generation approach is utilized to figure out the essential propagation number (called reproduction number) denoted by R 0 . For R 0 &lt; 1, the system is asymptotically stable locally and has an ailment disease free equilibrium (DFE) and may have up to five endemic equilibria. Our simulations results recommend that the pace of complete predominance of influenza will be high, if all the individuals show symptoms upon infection and experience a deficient treatment. Further, the predominance pace of influenza is low, if all the individuals first move to symptomatic class and then treated effectively. An average rate of total prevalence is secured when more individuals upon disease move towards asymptomatic class. Our numerical simulations justified the theoretical results.},

How to prevent and control the second-wave COVID-19 has become an important issue in many countries and regions. By analyzing the transmission of the second-wave COVID-19 caused by an imported case in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, China, in January 2021, we establish a new mathematical COVID-19 model to simulate the transmission characteristics of the second-wave COVID-19. First, we analyze the basic properties of the model, prove the existence of the equilibrium point, and obtain the expression of the basic reproduction number with important biological significance. Secondly, we use the weighted nonlinear least square estimation method to fit the cases in Tonghua City of Jilin Province in January 2021, and get the estimated value of the parameters. The basic reproduction number of the second-wave COVID-19 in Tonghua City is , which is much smaller than that of the first-wave COVID-19 in Wuhan in 2020. Finally, in the optimal control part, we consider two control methods (keeping social distance and nucleic acid detection of all people in the city) to simulate the control of the disease. The results show that the control intensity of the two control methods needs to be dynamically changed and adjusted, so that the cost can be minimized with the least infection. The results of this paper can not only provide suggestions for health management departments, but also provide a reference for the analysis of the second-wave COVID-19 in other countries or regions.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical model is proposed that describes the kinetics of the formation and evolution of competing phases, one of which is a disordered system of topologically stable excitations (vortices) and the second one is an ordered (crystalline) phase. This model is intended to be the simplest model which can demonstrate such important characteristics of solidification process as a sensitivity to the cooling speed, natural appearance of the relaxation times of kinetic phase transformations, and particular features of the rapidly solidified systems. The model was studied numerically showing the crucial properties relevant to the obtained in the experiments on the amorphization in metals. In the present work, we derive a general form of the system&#39;s Hamiltonian and stochastic dynamical equations to describe the rapid solidification and a competing formation of amorphous and crystalline phases. The numerical study of the formation of both phases shows the competition of inherited phases during the simultaneous growth from nuclei. The cooling speed has a significant impact on the regimes of the phase formation. We find that solidification during fast cooling leads to the preferred selection of the disordered phase, then the subsequent evolution leads to the aging and to continuous transition to a solid ordered phase. Also, it is shown that further cooling leads to the spinodal decomposition, and the mobility of phases plays a significant role in the dynamics of the defects migration.},

Conductive heat and mass transfer boundary conditions are replaced by convective conditions, where the flux of heat (or solute) is proportional to the temperature or concentration difference between the surface of the dendrite and far from it. The marginal mode of perturbation wavelengths is calculated using the linear morphological stability analysis. Combining this analysis with the solvability theory, we have derived a selection criterion that represents the first condition to define a combination of dendrite tip velocity and tip diameter. The second condition—the undercooling balance—is derived for intense convection. The theory under consideration determines the dendrite tip velocity and tip diameter for low undercooling. This convective theory is combined with the classical theory of dendritic growth (conductive boundary conditions), which is valid for moderate and high undercooling. Thus, the entire range of melt undercooling is covered. Our results are in good agreement with experiments on Al–Ge crystallization.},

The particle-size distribution function, solid-phase fraction in a supercooled two-phase layer, its thickness and permeability, solidification velocity, and desupercooling kinetics are defined. This solution enables us to characterize the mushy layer composition. We show that the region adjacent to the liquid phase is almost free of crystals and has a constant temperature gradient. Crystals undergo intense growth leading to fast mushy layer desupercooling in the middle of a two-phase region. The mushy region adjacent to the solid material is filled with the growing solid-phase structures and is almost desupercooled.},

For this stochastic excitement, the phenomenon of coherence resonance was discovered. On the contrary, in another parameter zone of the model, noise can suppress EADs. We analyze these stochastic phenomena using the stochastic sensitivity functions technique, Mahalanobis distance, the methods of principal directions, and confidence domains.},

The kinetic and balance equations for the bubble-size distribution function and liquid temperature are solved analytically using the Laplace transform and saddle-point methods with allowance for an arbitrary dependence of the bubble growth rate on temperature. The rate of bubble appearance therewith is considered in accordance with the Dering–Volmer and Frenkel–Zeldovich–Kagan nucleation theories. It is shown that the initial distribution function decreases with increasing the dimensionless size of bubbles and shifts to their greater values with time.},

Specifically, we investigate the global dynamics for the given master ordinary differential equation to understand the evolution of solutions for various initial conditions as also to investigate the existence of asymptotic solutions. Moreover, with the application of Lie&#39;s theory, we can reduce the order of the master differential equation, while an exact similarity solution is determined. Finally, the master equation possesses the Painlevé property, which means that the analytic solution can be expressed in terms of a Laurent expansion.},

This family uses the FSAL (first stage as last) devise. Selecting these extra coefficients properly we may construct methods with better properties. Here, we exploit the free parameters in order to derive a pair with coefficients trained to furnish better results on problems with periodic solutions.

Due to the reflection phenomenon at the free surface, five kinds of coupled elastic waves are generated. The reflection coefficients are evaluated numerically. Graphs are plotted, and detailed discussion is presented to elaborate the effects of initial stresses, rotation, and flexoelectric coefficient on the reflection coefficients. It is observed that aforementioned parameters have remarkable influence upon the reflection coefficients of the reflected waves.},

  abstract     = {One of the significant problems in demand response (DR) participation in the smart power system is calculating how much electrical power is required to extract from DR ( ∆ P DR ) to keep the power system frequency in the allowable range. Calculating the precise amount of this value is impossible due to the random nature of load disturbance (LoD). In this paper, a new method is presented to control the DR participation in the load frequency control considering communication time delay. Extended State Observer is used to estimate the magnitude of the LoD, considering the structural uncertainty of the power system parameters. Then, the DR program is implemented in load frequency control to compensate the whole or part of LoD considering the available electrical power at the aggregators ( P AV-AGG ) and communication time delay. Afterward, Active Disturbance Rejection Control is modified and adopted to control the uncompensated LoD. The salp swarm algorithm is employed to design the parameters of the proposed method, which is verified in comparison with the previous methods. The results demonstrate that the presented approach has potentially significant performance, assisting the power system frequency to be damped immediately with the small overshoot and undershoot.},

  abstract     = {The Legendre polynomial series approach (LPSA) has been widely used to solve guided wave propagation in various structures since 1999. The LPSA directly introduces the boundary conditions into the control equations through the rectangular window function. However, in the solving process, the Legendre polynomial series, the rectangular window function, and their derivatives are introduced into the integral kernel functions, which results in a lot of CPU time on the abundant numerical integration calculations. To overcome this defect, an analytical integration Legendre polynomial series approach (AILPSA) is presented and is used to solve the Lamb waves in fractional order thermoelastic multilayered plates. Coupled wave equations and heat conduction equation are solved by the AILPSA and the LPSA, respectively. Comparison between two approaches indicates the computational efficiency of the AILPSA is improved by more than 90%. In addition, a backward error estimation is given in the convergency analysis to make up for the deficiency of the numerical experiments. Finally, the influence of fractional order on the thermoelastic Lamb wave is discussed.},

  abstract     = {A common type problem of optimization is to find simultaneously n $$ n $$ parameters that globally minimize an objective function of n $$ n $$ variables. Such problems are seen in signal and image processing and in various applications of mathematical analysis of several complex variables and Clifford algebras. Objective functions are usually assumed to be Lipschitzian with maybe unknown Lipschitz constants. A number of methods have been established to discard the sets called “bad sets” in a partition that is impossible to contain any optimal point, as well as to treat the unknown Lipschitz bound problem along with the algorithm. In the present paper, a simple criterion of eliminating bad sets is proposed for the first time. The elimination method leads to a concise and rigorous proof of convergence. The algorithm, on the range space side, converges to the global minimum with an exponential rate, while on the domain space side, converges with equal accuracy to the set of all the global minimizers. To treat the unknown Lipschitz constant dilemma, we propose a practical pseudo-Lipshitz bound process. The methodology is of fundamental nature with straightforward mathematical formulation applicable to multivariate objective functions defined on any compactly connected manifolds in higher dimensions. The method is tested against an extensive number of benchmark functions in the literature. The experimental results exhibit considerable effectiveness and applicability of the algorithm.},

First, we apply the iterative scheme and the m -accretivity of operator A to establish existence, uniqueness, and a priori estimate for strong solutions to an approximate problem. Based on this result, we obtain existence, regularity of the strong solution for MCKFIDEs on interval [ − τ , T ] or the maximum interval [ − τ , t max ) , 0 &lt; t max ≤ T .

  abstract     = {We present impedance boundary conditions for the viscoacoustic equations for approximative models that are in terms of the acoustic pressure or in terms of the macroscropic acoustic velocity. The approximative models are derived by the method of multiple scales up to order 2 in the boundary layer thickness. The boundary conditions are stable and asymptotically exact, which is justified by a complete mathematical analysis. The models can be discretized by finite element methods without resolving boundary layers. In difference to an approximation by asymptotic expansion for which for each order 1 PDE system has to be solved, the proposed approximative are solutions to one PDE system only. The impedance boundary conditions for the pressure of first and second orders are of Wentzell type and include a second tangential derivative of the pressure proportional to the square root of the viscosity and take thereby absorption inside the viscosity boundary layer of the underlying velocity into account. The conditions of second order incorporate with curvature the geometrical properties of the wall. The velocity approximations are described by Helmholtz-like equations for the velocity, where the Laplace operator is replaced by , and the local boundary conditions relate the normal velocity component to its divergence. The velocity approximations are for the so-called far field and do not exhibit a boundary layer. Including a boundary corrector, the so-called near field, the velocity approximation is accurate even up to the domain boundary. The results of numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical foundations.},

A semi-analytical solution has been obtained here for nonstationary creeping approximation of plane-parallel flow slowly moving on inclined surface. The main motivation of the current development is that each additional enhancement of knowledge in regard to this phenomenon should obviously improve the accuracy of calculations for possible applications in technological or engineering areas of fluid dynamics researches. Even in such simple formulation, equations of motion that govern the dynamics of rivulet flows of non-Newtonian fluids are hard to be solved analytically. Nevertheless, we have succeeded in obtaining analytical expressions for the components of velocity in { Ox , Oy }-directions of motion for slowly moving the advancing front of rivulet flow (where Ox -axis coincides to the initial main direction of slowly moving rivulet flow). Restrictions to the form of flow (stemming from the continuity equation) have been used accordingly.},

Our results specify how the regularity of the solution at the boundary is dictated by the level of smoothness of the relevant initial and boundary data. To the best of our knowledge, for unbounded domains like the half-line { x &gt; 0 } $$ \left\{x&amp;amp;gt;0\right\} $$ , such results are not available in the literature. The corresponding analysis for the derivatives of the solution is also performed and yields additional compatibility conditions on the initial and boundary data which guarantee the extension of the solution to a C ∞ $$ {C}&amp;amp;#x0005E;{\infty } $$ function up to the boundary, that is, on { x ⩾ 0 , t ⩾ 0 } $$ \left\{x\geqslant 0,t\geqslant 0\right\} $$ . The analysis relies on the explicit solution formula provided by the unified transform, also known as the Fokas method, whose rigorous derivation is presented. The main advantage of this formula, namely, its uniform convergence at the boundary, largely reduces the proof of our results to fundamental tools from real and complex analysis such as Lebesgue&#39;s dominated convergence theorem and Cauchy&#39;s theorem. Moreover, thanks to uniform convergence, the unified transform solution formula can actually be directly evaluated at the boundary to yield the prescribed initial and boundary data.},

We prove that the proposed schemes are unconditionally stable, compatible, and second-order convergent in both time and space.

  abstract     = {The propagation of waves of water on the surface is characterized by various mathematical models. In this work, we adopt the simplest equation method as well as the Kudryashov&#39;s new function method, to a variety of some nonlinear models of surface wave propagation to extract their abundant solitary wave structures. These nonlinear models include the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation, the Ostrovsky (OS) equation, the Ostrovsky-Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (OS-BBM) equation, and the Boussinesq system of equations. Based on the solutions of two distinct auxiliary equations, various wave solutions are successfully obtained. In addition, the geometric interpretations of the obtained solutions are analyzed. To illuminate the physical nature of the obtained solutions of this paper, some graphical representations (numerical simulations) of the acquired solutions have been depicted in two-dimensional density, two- and three-dimensional graphs. Furthermore, a comparison between the obtained results of this paper and the solutions for the considered models obtained in the literature is also provided. It is shown that the used approaches are very effective and powerful strategies for a wider class of nonlinear partial differential equations in physical problems.},

  abstract     = {Many autoimmune diseases are chronic in nature, so that in general, patients experience periods of recurrence and remission of the symptoms characterizing their specific autoimmune ailment. In order to describe this very important feature of autoimmunity, we construct a mathematical model of kinetic type describing the immune system cellular interactions in the context of autoimmunity exhibiting recurrent dynamics. The model equations constitute a nonlinear system of integro-differential equations with quadratic terms that describe the interactions between self-antigen presenting cells, self-reactive T cells, and immunosuppressive cells. We consider a constant input of self-antigen presenting cells, due to external environmental factors that are believed to trigger autoimmunity in people with predisposition for this condition. We also consider the natural death of all cell populations involved in our model, caused by their interaction with cells of the host environment. We derive the macroscopic analogue and show positivity and well-posedness of the solution and then we study the equilibria of the corresponding dynamical system and their stability properties. By applying dynamical system theory, we prove that steady oscillations may arise due to the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation. We perform some numerical simulations for our model, and we observe a recurrent pattern in the solutions of both the kinetic description and its macroscopic analogue, which leads us to conclude that this model is able to capture the chronic behaviour of many autoimmune diseases.},

The model consists of two elliptic equations which describe the concentration of nutrient and the tumor tissue pressure, respectively, an ordinary differential equation describing the cell location characterizing the time delay and a partial differential equation for the free boundary. In this paper, we establish the well-posedness of the problem; namely, first, we prove that there exists a unique flat stationary solution ( σ ∗ , p ∗ , ρ ∗ , ξ ∗ ) for all μ &gt; 0 . The stability of this stationary solution should depend on the tumor aggressiveness constant μ . It is also unrealistic to expect the perturbation to be flat. We show that, under non-flat perturbations, there exists a threshold such that is linearly stable if and linearly unstable if . Furthermore, the time delay increases the stationary tumor size. These are interesting results with mathematical and biological implications.},

  abstract     = {The paper devoted to asymptotic mean-square boundedness of several numerical methods for stochastic complex-valued neural networks with Poisson jumps. The definition of asymptotic mean-square boundedness of the numerical solution is presented, and some sufficient conditions for the underlying systems which are asymptotic mean-square boundedness are derived. By taking the advantage of the compensated split-step backward Euler (CSSBE) method and compensated backward Euler (CBE) method, sufficient criteria promising the asymptotic mean-square boundedness of CVNNs without any restriction on time stepsize, while the split-step backward Euler (SSBE) method and backward Euler (BE) method can derive asymptotic mean-square boundedness under a time stepsize constraint. The obtained theoretical results show that the compensated numerical methods own an incredible advantage over the noncompensated numerical methods on the part of asymptotic mean-square boundedness. Finally, an example is proposed and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed results.},

The ability of the pathogen to resist commonly used hospital disinfectants ensures its persistent contamination of hospital surfaces and medical equipment readily leading to patient colonization. Colonized patients shed the pathogen into their surroundings thereby increasing the fungal concentration in the hospital environment. We analyze the model for its basic mathematical properties, perform sensitivity analysis, and formulate an optimal problem to determine the efficiency of control interventions, namely, standard transmission precautions, proper laboratory identification, and isolation of patients identified with colonization in reducing the contamination and transmission of C. auris infections. We characterize the optimal controls using Pontryagin&#39;s Minimum Principle and further prove the uniqueness of the optimality system. Numerical simulations are performed to substantiate the theoretical analysis, and the results are illustrated graphically.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a uniparametric generalization of the iterative method due to Kurchatov is presented. The iterative model presented is derivative-free and approximates the solution of nonlinear equations when the operator is non-differenciable. As the accessibility of the Kurchatov method is usually a problem in the application of the method, since the set of initial guesses that guarantee the convergence of the method is small, the main objective of this work is to improve the Kurchatov iterative method in its accessibility while maintaining and even increasing its speed of convergence. For this purpose, we introduce a variable parameter in the iterative function of the Kurchatov method that allows us to get a better approximation of the derivative by using a symmetric uniparameteric first-order divided difference operator. We perform a complex dynamic study that corroborate the improvements in the accessibility region. Moreover, a complete analysis of the local and semilocal convergence is established for the new uniparametric iterative method. Finally, we apply the theoretical results to solve a nonlinear integral equation showing the usefulness of the work.},

  abstract     = {Recent field experiments have shown that predators influence the prey population not only by direct consumption but also by stimulating various defensive strategies. The cost of these defensive strategies can include energetic investment in defensive structures, reduced energy income, lower mating success, and emigration which ultimately reduces the reproduction of prey. To explore the effect of these defensive strategies (anti-predator behaviors), a modified Leslie–Gower predator–prey model with the cost of fear has been considered. Gestation delay is also incorporated in the system for a more realistic formulation. Boundedness, equilibria and stability analysis are performed for the temporal system. By considering gestation delay as a bifurcation parameter, the existence of Hopf-bifurcation around the interior equilibrium point is discussed together with the direction, stability, and period of bifurcating solutions arising through Hopf-bifurcation. The spatial extension of the proposed model incorporating density-dependent cross-diffusion is also investigated and the conditions for diffusion-driven instability are obtained. To illustrate the analytical findings, detailed numerical simulations are performed. Biologically realistic Turing patterns such as spots, spots and stripes mixture, and labyrinthine type patterns are identified. It is found that the fear level has a stabilizing impact on delay induced destabilization and both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on Turing instability.},

The error analysis is carried out, and it is shown that the numerical solution converges to the exact solution. Further analysis proves that the scheme is of order O ⁡ ( τ γ 1 ) over the entire region, but it is of order O ( τ ) on any subdomain away from the origin. τ denotes the mesh parameter.

The solution of the boundary layer problems poses a huge challenge to both traditional numerical methods and artificial neural network methods. By theoretically analyzing the changing rate of the weights of the first hidden layer near the boundary layer, a mapping strategy is added in traditional neural network to improve the convergence of the loss function. Numerical examples are carried out for the 1D and 2D convection–diffusion equation with boundary layer. The results demonstrate that the modified neural networks significantly improve the ability in approximating the solutions with sharp gradient.},

Second, an augmented LKF is tailored for the use of the DPT integral inequality; then, more information about the instant state and the delayed states is taken into account. Third, by using the DPT integral inequality and the augmented LKF, some less conservative conditions that ensure the stability of systems with time-varying delay are derived.

Qualitative agreement of the prediction on the epidemics of COVID-19 with the actual situations convinced the rationality of the present model. The study showed that enhancing both NPIs (including public vigilance, quarantine measures, and hospitalization) and the physical condition of the public (including susceptibility and recovery speed) contributed to decreasing the prevalence of COVID-19 but only increasing public vigilance and decreasing the susceptibility of the public could also reduce the virulence of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, controlling the contact rate and infection rate was the key to control not only the epidemic scale of COVID-19 but also the extent of its harm. On the other hand, the best way to control the epidemics was to increase the public vigilance and physical condition because both of them could reduce the prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19. In addition, the enhancement of quarantine measures and hospitalization could bring the (slight) increase in the CFR of COVID-19.},

However, since the availability and quality of data vary dramatically from region to region, accurate modeling directly from a global perspective is difficult. Nevertheless, via local data collected by certain regions, it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools, which may be coupled to develop global models. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of COVID-19 via a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Utilizing a large amount of data available from the ebbing outbreak in Hubei, China, as a testbed, we predict the trajectory of daily cases, daily deaths, and other features of the Hubei outbreak. Through numerical experiments, we observe the effects of social distancing on the dynamics of the outbreak. Using knowledge gleaned from the Hubei outbreak, we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of the outbreak in Turkey. We provide forecasts for the peak of the outbreak and the daily number of cases and deaths in Turkey, by varying levels of social distancing and the transition rate which is from infected class to confirmed infected class.},

Shallow water moment equations describe shallow flows for complex velocity profiles which vary in vertical direction and the models can be seen as extensions of the standard shallow water equations. Equilibrium stability is an important property of balance laws that determines the linear stability of solutions in the vicinity of equilibrium manifolds, and it is seen as a necessary condition for stable numerical solutions. After an analysis of the hyperbolic structure of the models, we identify three different stability manifolds based on three different limits of the right-hand side friction term, which physically correspond to water-at-rest, constant-velocity, and bottom-at-rest velocity profiles. The stability analysis then shows that the structural stability conditions are fulfilled for the water-at-rest equilibrium and the constant-velocity equilibrium. However, the bottom-at-rest equilibrium can lead to instable modes depending on the velocity profile. Relaxation toward the respective equilibrium manifolds is investigated numerically for different models.},

The article begins with a theoretical proof of the convergence of fractional order derivatives using function approximation and interpolation inequality theorems. Finally, through multiple simulations, it can be obtained that the fractional-order neural network can maintain a higher accuracy rate compared with the integer-order neural network, and also can well solve the problem of longer convergence time of the neural network. The convergence time can be reduced by nearly 10% compared to the integer order.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT) has been widely applied by researchers for the analysis of nanostructures. In this theory, the appropriate selection of small-scale parameters and the type of high-order boundary conditions is of great importance. In the current paper, free vibrations of carbon nanotubes are studied using a nonlocal strain gradient Timoshenko beam model, and the small-scale parameters are calibrated based on the molecular dynamics (MD) results. The calibration process is conducted by defining an optimization problem, and the genetic algorithm is applied for obtaining the best values of the small-scale parameters. The governing equations are derived based on Hamilton&#39;s principle and solved analytically using the modified Fourier series method. The variational consistent high-order boundary conditions are obtained applying the weighted residual approach. The small-scale parameters are calibrated for the first three natural frequencies considering two different boundary conditions. Moreover, the type of high-order boundary conditions that is more consistent with the MD results is determined. The outcomes of this paper provide an appropriate reference for researchers who are using the NSGT for the analysis of micro/nanobeams.},

First, we analyze the existence and stability of constant positive steady states. Second, taking the cost of minimum fear as the bifurcation parameter, the direction and stability of spatially homogeneous/inhomogeneous periodic solutions are investigated. Then, some properties of nonconstant positive steady states are investigated, such as nonexistence, existence, and steady state bifurcation. Applying the fixed point index theory, the existence of the nonconstant positive steady state is discussed, indicating that the proper diffusion rate of prey and larger diffusion rate of predator are beneficial to survival of populations. Moreover, taking the diffusion rate of predator as the bifurcation parameter, the steady state bifurcations from simple and double eigenvalues are intensively established. At last, the validity of the theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations. Biological interpretation reveals that the fear effect and the diffusion rate of populations can lead to the emergence of Hopf and steady state bifurcation, thereby destroying the stability of populations and promoting the benign evolution of populations.},

The strong convergence of iterative sequences generated by the method is established under some suitable conditions imposed on control parameters.

By transforming the competitive system into a cooperative system, the existence of the traveling wave solutions and speed determinacy of the spread speed are studied via the upper–lower solution method as well as the comparison principle. Through constructing specific types of upper and lower solutions to the system, some sets of sufficient conditions composed of the parameters in the system are established to justify the linear and nonlinear selection of the spread speed. As the positive periodic functions in system reduces to the constant coefficients, parts of our results could cover the previous works, and the other results are novel.},

  abstract     = {The original pharmacokinetics (PK) two-compartment model illustrates the change law of the drug in the central and peripheral chambers after administration, respectively. Although this deterministic model has derived many practical conclusions, it is based on simplifications and neglects noise, which is inherent to pharmacological processes. The actual pharmacological processes are always influenced by factors that cannot be entirely understood or modeled explicitly. Modeling without considering these phenomena may impact the accuracy and the related conclusions. A stochastic type of model can capture such noise. We proposed a novel two-compartment PK model concerning drug administration through intravenous route by combining optimal control theory and stochastic analysis. The selection of the objective function was based on the goal of obtaining the best possible therapeutic effect with the least possible drug dosage. Firstly, we extended the original PK two-compartment model based on optimal control and proved the existence and uniqueness of the switch in the control. Moreover, considering the possible uncertain factors, we added disturbances to the distance between the drug concentration and equilibrium point of the dynamic system and extended the model to a stochastic differential equation model. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that optimal controls were bang-bang, that is, alternating the drug dosages at a full dose with rest-periods in-between. Our analysis provided a schedule for optimal dosage and timing. The solutions of the model provided estimates of the drug concentration at any given time. Finally, we simulated the model using R and showed that the numerical method is stable.},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, we investigate blow-up and lifespan estimates for a class of semilinear hyperbolic coupled system in ℝ n with n ⩾ 1 , which is a part of the so-called Nakao&#39;s type problem weakly coupled a semilinear damped wave equation with a semilinear wave equation with nonlinearities of derivative type. By constructing two time-dependent functionals and employing an iteration method for unbounded multiplier with slicing procedure, the results of blow-up and upper bound estimates for the lifespan of energy solutions are derived. The model seems to be hyperbolic-like instead of parabolic-like. Particularly, the blow-up result for one-dimensional case is optimal.},

Four different boundary conditions can be produced in the limit, depending on the convergence of ∂ Ω ϵ to ∂ Ω. In one particular case, we obtain a ‘strange’ boundary condition featuring a microscopic energy term related to the shape of the approaching domains. Many aspects of our analysis could be generalised to an arbitrary order elliptic differential operator of order 2 m and to more general domain perturbations.},

  abstract     = {In this work, new controllability results for a class of nonlinear fractional delay integrodifferential evolution equations with nonlocal conditions and a parameter have been derived under a new concept that we define as fast-time complete controllability. Nonlinearity here is only supposed to be continuous rather than Lipschitz continuous by contrast. The major tools we adopt are resolvent operator theory and the theory of nonlinear functional analysis. Theoretical and practical applications are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the new abstract results.},

A compact difference scheme is designed for discretization of space variable. The convergence of the method is discussed in detail. It is shown that the proposed method has fourth order accuracy in space and ( 3 − α ) − th order accuracy in time. One numerical example with the known exact solution is considered to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of present numerical scheme. Moreover, the suggested numerical scheme is employed for pricing three European option problems, namely European call option, European double barrier knock-out option and European put option. The effect of fractional order derivative on option price profile is investigated. Furthermore, the effects of three relevant parameters, namely volatility, strike price and interest rate on the price of European double barrier knock-out option are investigated.

Both surfaces are examples of Riemannian manifolds realized as two-dimensional manifolds with strictly positive Gaussian curvature under the condition λ &lt; 1/3 for the λ -spheres. A convenient parametrization of λ -spheres embedded as two-dimensional surfaces of revolution into the three-dimensional Euclidean space is derived. The so-obtained parametrization is expressed in a concise form via the elliptic integrals of the first, second, and third kind. Next, the geodetic motion is considered. The explicit solutions for two branches of the incompressible motion are obtained in the parametric form. For the special case of geodetics corresponding to meridians taken as geodesics their analysis is performed in detail. In the latter case, the so-obtained geodetic solutions are reduced to the incomplete elliptic integrals of the first, second, and third kind.},

In the Maxwell–Cattaneo case, we reformulate the problem by using enthalpy instead of relative temperature. In both cases, we prove the existence of the global attractor for the weak solutions of the problem. Moreover, for both laws, we establish that every full trajectory in the global attractor converges to a single stationary point as t → ∞ and another single stationary point as t → − ∞ . Consequently, we infer that the global attractor is equal to a union of the unstable manifolds emanating from the stationary points.},

The dynamics on each ray are regulated by linear transition rates, whereas the switching among rays at the origin occurs according to a general stochastic matrix. We perform a detailed investigation of the transient and asymptotic behavior of this process. We also obtain a diffusive approximation of the considered model, which leads to an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck diffusion process over a domain formed by semiaxis joined at the origin, named spider. We show that the approximating process possesses a truncated Gaussian stationary density. Finally, the goodness of the approximation is discussed through comparison of stationary distributions, means, and variances.},

  abstract     = {Chytridiomycosis is the most significant reason for amphibian decline and extinction. It is caused by a fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( B d ) and affects many species of amphibians. This paper is mainly concerned with designing conservation policies for the frog population (corroboree, an endangered species), diminishing due to this disease. Our research aims at demonstrating mathematically and supporting the role of zooplankton as a potential biological control for B d . For this purpose, we designed a stochastic as well as diffusive ecoepidemic model consisting of B. dendrobatidis , frog, and zooplanktons. We have shown the global existence, nonnegativity, and long-term behavior for the designed stochastic model. Existence and stability analysis of the equilibrium points for the corresponding ODE and diffusive model is also done. We have also done bifurcation plotting for the ODE model and found the existence of Hopf bifurcation. We adopted the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) to conduct global sensitivity analysis to estimate the most sensitive parameters responsible for disease prevalence and frog mortality. We provided a complete numerical analysis of our deterministic, stochastic, and diffusive models and compared the result. We found that the persistence and extinction of the frog population depend on the environmental stochasticity of zooplanktons. Numerical simulation of corresponding spatially explicit systems brings out complicated spatiotemporal dynamics, typically resulting in the formation of a patchy pattern. It also reveals that B d tends to decline in the places resided by zooplankton.},

The resulting nonlinear minimization problem is approximated using the MATLAB optimization toolbox routine l s q n o n l i n .

In the aid of a Lyapunov functional based on stochastic variables, the sufficient conditions on design of a dynamic output feedback control law and bilateral event-triggering conditions are derived to guarantee the exponentially mean-square stability for NCSs. Furthermore, an improved iterative algorithm is given to obtain the output-based control law and event-triggering parameters from a set of nonconvex inequalities.

The current work sheds light on the approximate proposition to the damped third-order nonlinear differential equations. The fast estimated solution is simulated to the accurate solution gained through the numerical methods.

A mathematical model using a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is presented for the considered problem. The density of the undisturbed medium is assumed to be constant. Approximate analytic solutions to the considered problem are obtained using the power series method by extending the power series of the flow variables. This work discusses the first-order and second-order approximate solutions and provides closed-form solutions for the first-order approximation. The behavior of the flow variables is depicted via figures behind the shock front for the first-order approximation. Furthermore, the effects of geometry factor α , adiabatic exponent γ , and various dusty gas parameters such as K p (the mass fraction of the dust particles), G 0 (the ratio of the density of the dust particles to the initial density of the gas), and σ (the relative specific heat) are analyzed on the flow variables and total energy of disturbance J 0 for the first-order approximation. It is observed that an increase in any of the parameters K p or σ causes the fluid velocity to increase and density and pressure to decrease. Increase in the parameter G 0 causes the density and pressure to increase, whereas the fluid velocity does not get affected. An increase in the value of α results in a decrease in the density and pressure, while the fluid velocity remains the same. An increase in the value of γ results in a decrease in the fluid velocity; however, it has opposite effect on the pressure. The density decreases near the shock front and increases as we move towards the axis/center of symmetry with an increase in γ . Also, it is observed that J 0 increases on increasing the value of G 0 or σ , while it decreases on increasing the value of K p , γ or α .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the crucial condition to achieve rational solutions of the multi-component nonlinear Schrödinger equation is proposed by introducing two nilpotent Lax matrices. Taking the series multisections of the vector eigenfunction as a set of fundamental eigenfunctions, an explicit formula of the n th-order rational solution is obtained by the degenerate Darboux transformation, which is used to generate some new patterns of rogue waves. A conjecture about the degree of the n th-order rogue waves is summarized. This conjecture also holds for rogue waves of the multi-component complex modified Korteweg–de Vries equation. Finally, the semi-rational solutions of the Manakov system are discussed.},

By implementing both the derived computational formulas and the constructed generating functions in Mathematica, we present some tables and plots for these numbers and polynomials, and their generating functions to illustrate the effects of their parameters for some special cases. Moreover, by making an observation on some results of this paper, we derive some novel computational formulas for the finite sums that contain the Dirichlet characters and falling factorials. We also assess some cases of these special finite sums. In the sequel, we pose some open problems regarding these special finite sums. Apart from these findings, we also give not only Fourier series expansion but also asymptotic estimates for the mentioned combinatorial numbers. In addition, we give some Raabe-type multiplication formulas for the mentioned combinatorial polynomials.

Therefore, we investigate the existence of mild solutions for fractional-order time-delay evolution equation of Sobolev type with multiorders in a Banach space with the help of two various methods. First, we study abstract problem by assuming the existence and compactness of E −1 and introduce a closed-form representation of a mild solution via a newly defined delayed Mittag–Leffler-type function which is generated by nonpermutable and permutable linear-bounded operators. Our second method is based on the theory of Sobolev-type delayed resolvent families generated by the pair ( A , E ) and a subordination principle, and in this case, any restrictive assumptions are not required on E . Furthermore, we derive an exact analytical representation of solutions for multidimensional fractional functional dynamical systems with nonpermutable and permutable matrices. As an example, the Sobolev-type delayed wave equation with a damping term is provided to illustrate the applications of the abstract results.},

However, it does not take advantage of any support information of the original signal. Therefore, our main contribution in this paper is to extend the theoretical framework for phaseless compressed sensing to incorporate with prior knowledge of the support structure of the signal. Specifically, we investigate two conditions that guarantee stable recovery of a weighted k -sparse signal via weighted l 1 minimization without any phase information. We first prove that the weighted null space property (WNSP) is a sufficient and necessary condition for the success of weighted l 1 minimization for weighted k -sparse phase retrievable. Moreover, we show that if a measurement matrix satisfies the strong weighted restricted isometry property (SWRIP), then the original signal can be stably recovered from the phaseless measurements.},

The main question we shall be concerned with is whether or not a higher-order Lipschitz function on the boundary Γ of a Jordan domain Ω ⊂ ℝ m can be decomposed into a sum of the two boundary values of a sectionally inframonogenic function with jump across Γ. To this end, a kind of Cauchy-type integral and singular integral operator, very specific to the inframonogenic setting, are widely used.},

Due to these discontinuities, an expected behavior appears in the solution known as the interior layer behavior at the point of discontinuity. Layers are some small narrow regions of the domain where the steep variations in the solution occur as singular perturbation parameter ε approaches zero. Classical central finite difference schemes and finite element methods with piecewise polynomial basis functions on the uniform mesh are known to be inadequate to solve such problems unless an unacceptably large number of mesh points are used when ε is very small. Thus, the problem is solved numerically first by a first-order accurate, simple upwind scheme on a specially designed piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh. Further, to enhance the order of convergence and to achieve better accuracy, we constructed a Richardson extrapolation scheme (RE scheme) whichis almost second-order accurate. An extensive analysis has been carried out to establish the almost second-order ε -uniform convergence of the proposed RE scheme. Lastly, some numerical examples are considered to verify our theoretical results, and comparisons of numerical results are performed with the numerical results that exist in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, much work has been performed on the development of mathematical models for the simulation of the epidemic and of disease models generally. Most works follow the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental framework, modeling the epidemic with a system of ordinary differential equations. Alternative formulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also been introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful descriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new variation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs). The dynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to incubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly, DDE models allow for a natural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering advantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the need for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed individuals) to incorporate time delays. In the present work, we introduce a DDE epidemic model in both an ordinary and partial differential equation framework. We present a series of mathematical results assessing the stability of the formulation. We then perform several numerical experiments, validating both the mathematical results and establishing model&#39;s ability to reproduce measured data on realistic problems.},

To understand and forecast the transmission dynamics of this disease, fractional-order derivative-based modeling can be beneficial. We propose in this paper a fractional-order mathematical model to examine the COVID-19 disease outbreak. This model outlines the multiple mechanisms of transmission within the dynamics of infection. The basic reproduction number and the equilibrium points are calculated from the model to assess the transmissibility of the COVID-19. Sensitivity analysis is discussed to explain the significance of the epidemic parameters. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed model have been proven using the fixed-point theorem and by helping the Arzela–Ascoli theorem. Using the predictor–corrector algorithm, we approximated the solution of the proposed model. The results obtained are represented by using figures that illustrate the behavior of the predicted model classes. Finally, the study of the stability of the numerical method is carried out using some results and primary lemmas.},

  abstract     = {Lamé introduced a triaxial ellipsoidal system, and via some ingenious arguments, he managed to spectrally decompose the Laplace operator and define ellipsoidal harmonic functions. Since then, many authors modified the Lamé system and proposed some related ellipsoidal coordinate variables. Perhaps the most important of them is the system introduced by Jacobi, in connection with the geodesic curves on an ellipsoid. All other attempts to introduce ellipsoidal coordinates are basically modifications of the Jacobi or the Lamé system. However, an important question in the theory of ellipsoidal harmonics is the way in which this theory reduces to the spheroidal and spherical systems. This is by no means a straightforward procedure, since the relative limiting cases lead to generic underdetermined forms. The basic difficulty is due to the different dimensionality of the singularity regions corresponding to each system. Note that this region has zero dimensions in the case of the sphere, one dimension in the case of the prolate spheroid, and two dimensions in the case of the oblate spheroid and the ellipsoid. The present work provides a systematic way to obtain these reductions and to establish a correspondence between ellipsoidal, spheroidal, and spherical harmonics. We have also demonstrated how our approach applies to the proposed modified Jacobi ellipsoidal system when we connect the Lamé with the Jacobi system through certain non-degenerable relations. The importance of these geometrical degeneracies lies in the fact that the solution of any boundary value problem in ellipsoidal geometry provides immediately the solutions in all special geometries of prolate and oblate spheroids, discs, needles, or spheres.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Cauchy problem for coupled second-order evolution equations in a Hilbert space with indirect memory damping, which arises from the theory of viscoelasticity. Here, the coefficients of the main operators in the system are non-equal (the case of different speeds of propagation). Under much weaker assumptions on memory kernels, we obtain a polynomial decay rate, whereas it is known that exponential stability does not hold. This work essentially generalizes and improves the related ones in the literature. As an application of our abstract results, we also establish for the Timoshenko system the so far best decay rate under such weak assumptions on the memory kernel in the case of different speeds of propagation.},

  abstract     = {The anti-predator decision making may lower down/change the food/energy intake of prey which naturally translate into a decrease in their reproductive output. More importantly, experimental studies also ensure that the predator-induced fear (indirect effect) may alter much behavior of the prey even more strongly than the effect of direct killing via habitat changes, vigilance, foraging, and different physiological changes. Considering this fact, we analyze a delayed predator-prey system incorporating anti-predator defense. The interaction term has been modeled using Beddington-DeAngelis functional response (BDFR). We discuss the local and global stability, permanence, and non-permanence to comprehend the dynamics of the system. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, globally asymptotic stability has been established. We also demonstrate that a certain value of delay may cause Hopf-bifurcation and period-doubling route to chaos. It is shown that under certain parametric conditions, the gestation delay-induced oscillations could be prevented. Using Nyquist criterion, the length of delay has been estimated for which the stability continues to hold. Moreover, we find that spatial diffusion affects the critical value of the bifurcation parameter and demonstrate the existence of spatially homogeneous periodic solutions with the change of time delay. In addition, the level of fear also affects the dynamical behaviors of the delayed system with/without diffusion. These results indicate that the gestation delay induces oscillatory coexistence mode of the interaction between predator and its prey, which reveals the driving factors for the co-existence of predator and prey in the form of periodic oscillations in actual ecosystems.},

In order to guarantee the convergence performance of such systems, an input filter is designed in front of actuators to estimate the controller updated input under the effect of those uncertainties. Specifically, a P-type learning controller is considered firstly, and then a model is developed to describe the transmission of sensor measured output data and controller updated input data under the mixed effect of those uncertainties. On the basis of state augmentation, the two developed data transmission processes are further combined with the controller learning process to build a unified filtering model. According to this filtering model and the projection theory, an optimal filter in linear minimum variance sense is designed at the actuator side to estimate the controller updated input in iteration domain. The convergence performance of the norm of filtering error covariance matrix is proved theoretically, which means driven by this accurately estimated input, the convergence performance of networked systems adopting the P-type learning controller is guaranteed.

Due to the network&#39;s frail defense mechanisms, WSNs are easy targets for worm attacks. A single unsecured node via contact can effectively propagate the worm across the entire network. Mathematical epidemic models are helpful in analyzing worm propagation in WSNs. To understand the attacking and spreading dynamics of worms in WSNs, a fractional-order compartmental epidemic model is investigated with susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and vaccinated nodes. Dynamical aspects such as boundedness, existence, and uniqueness of the solutions are presented with the help of fractional calculus theory. Global stability of the points of equilibrium are established. The projected nonlinear structure is examined numerically via the generalized Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method. This study demonstrates the influence of the fractional operator on WSNs dynamics and the efficiency of the numerical method.},

This paper presents these transformations as spatial-like rotations and projections by means of the use of special algebraic objects named GA rotors . We prove that there is no need to use complex numbers nor matrices to perform the mentioned transformations and to provide geometrical intuition for electrical quantities and their transformations. Furthermore, power properties can be described using GA terminology by means of the proposed geometric power . The manipulation of the geometric power allows a useful current decomposition for a variety of applications such active filtering, frequency estimation, or electrical machinery. We provide in this paper an alternative approach focused on power systems under the paradigm of GA.},

Among other types, there exists one called adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) for functions in analytic Hardy spaces. Through the Hardy space decomposition of the L 2 -space, the AFD algorithm also gives rise to sparse representations of signals of finite energy. To deal with multivariate signals, the general Hilbert space context comes into play. The multivariate counterpart of AFD in general Hilbert spaces with a dictionary has been named preorthogonal AFD (POAFD). In the present study, we generalize AFD and POAFD to random analytic signals through formulating stochastic analytic Hardy spaces and stochastic Hilbert spaces. To analyze random analytic signals, we work on two models, both being called stochastic AFD, or SAFD in brief. The two models are respectively made for (i) those expressible as the sum of a deterministic signal and an error term (SAFDI) and for (ii) those from different sources obeying certain distributive law (SAFDII). In the later part of the paper, we drop off the analyticity assumption and generalize the SAFDI and SAFDII to what we call stochastic Hilbert spaces with a dictionary. The generalized methods are named as stochastic POAFDs, SPOAFDI and SPOAFDII. Like AFDs and POAFDs for deterministic signals, the developed stochastic POAFD algorithms offer powerful tools to approximate and thus to analyze random signals.},

Basing on this mathematical approach, we conclude that, for constant continuous treatment, if there is no flow back to the sensitive compartment, then once resistant cells appear, sensitive cells are eventually eliminated, independently of the mechanism of acquiring the resistance. However, with bi-directional flow, the situation is a little better as the sensitive cells are not completely eliminated, although they are still outcompeted by the resistant ones. Moreover, if the therapy is stopped, resistant cells become dominated by sensitive cells and the situation changes. We discuss these mechanisms for slowly proliferating tumors on the example of gliomas.},

  abstract     = {Substance addiction such as tobacco, alcohol, opioids, drug addiction and so on are increasing day by day. Awareness about the harmful effects of substance addiction on health and strong will power of people to get rid of the addiction have positive impact on controlling substance addiction. The aim of this research is to examine the impact of awareness and strong determination, the two cognitive factors that have greater impact in preventing substance addiction. Addiction adversely affects self-efficacy of younger generation, thought processing, metabolisms in human body, psychosocial effects and cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we have developed a mathematical model regarding substance addiction. It consist of six compartments namely, susceptible class, light substance addict class, risk substance addict class, potential substance addict class, rehabilitation class and quitter class. The substance addiction generation number has been determined, and the model is locally asymptotically stable at substance addictions free equilibrium point (SAFEP) when . It is found that, when , a backward bifurcation can occur and when , the substance addictions persistent equilibrium point (SAPEP) becomes stable. Further analysis gives the global asymptotic stability of SAFEP. An application of this model, smoking model, is explored. Smoking model gives a different comparative study which proves the relevance and the importance of our model. We get a clear idea about smokers&#39; behaviour at different stages of high determination and knowledge and also establish the relationship between and these parameters. Finally, we give some recommendations for preventing addiction which can be implemented in society.},

Rabies is one of the devastating viruses that can almost be impossible to control once an outbreak occurs. There is no effective treatment or cure of rabies once symptoms show. In this work, we propose euthanasia of infected Lycaon pictus dogs as a control strategy to reduce the spread of the virus. We propose a simple deterministic SEI-type rabies model that takes into account the contaminated environment and the euthanasia of infectious dogs to better understand the transmission and progression dynamics of the disease, as well as to seek to predict the effectiveness of this control strategy.

Superiorization iterative procedures are simple yet powerful method that interlaces two algorithmic procedures under the assumption that one of the algorithmic procedure called the basic algorithm is resilient to the disturbances of its iterates caused by the activities of the other algorithm called perturbations.

  abstract     = {Melanoma is a deadly skin disease. Availability of digital skin lesion datasets ease the exploration of ample classification studies. Both theoretical and heuristics improvements are achieved thanks to these new datasets. Being one of many high-level feature-driven classification methods, support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used in the literature as melanoma classifiers. Almost all of these studies are using a limited set of predefined kernels. In this study, we propose a newly developed Clifford kernel for the classification of dermoscopic skin lesions. We develop Clifford-based linear, polynomial, and exponential kernels in the Clifford algebra (CA) C ℓ 5, 0 0-, 2-, and 4-vector subspaces. CAs are noncommutative but associative and distributive over addition. We showed that the newly developed Clifford kernels are embedded into SVM classifiers to successfully identify malignant skin lesions in a binary classification settings. Clifford kernel results are compared with mostly used gaussian and polynomial kernels with real-valued SVM classifiers. Accuracy of all classifiers are assessed with cross-validation using imbalanced and balanced datasets of 112, 162, and 192 lesions. SVM kernels in comparison are parameterized to scan wide range of possibilities. We show that Clifford-based polynomial kernels outperforms in all, balanced and imbalanced, datasets having average accuracy of 83%. The consistence of high accuracies obtained with Clifford polynomial kernel shows that skin lesion features are logically designed and Clifford-based SVM is able to model class separations in the feature space.},

To accomplish the goal, the domain ℝ + has been stretched to ℝ to avoid the additional care of the elements in the basis containing boundary point 0. In addition, such transformation may judiciously be utilized to eliminate (up to quadratic) the singularity of the equation. The equation in the new variable has been subsequently transformed into a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem by approximating the new (unknown) function in an appropriate (truncated) basis comprising interpolating scale functions generated by scale functions in Daubechies family. The (interpolating wavelet-collocation) scheme developed here has been applied to some solvable and quasi-exactly solvable Sturm–Liouville problems in appearing in quantum mechanical modeling in flat and curved spaces. It is observed that the approximation of eigenfunctions in the (compact support) interpolating wavelet basis obtained by using the collocation method can be reliably used to reveal a hidden spectrum of quasi-exactly solvable Sturm–Liouville problems in with high accuracy.},

Multiple studies have been reported in the literature to solve these problems using iterative methods which are time-consuming and prone to errors. For linear problems, basic method was found highly accurate and computationally sound. We derived a modified version of LFVIM to investigate and obtain the nondifferentiable solutions of linear, nonlinear, and nonhomogeneous LFPDEs arising in fractal vehicular traffic flow through illustrative examples.

The objective was to analyze the life cycle and competitiveness of Benidorm&#39;s tourism system and interpret whether the tourism product was sustainable and at what stage in the cycle Benidorm is currently in. To do this, we used Smarta software, which, based on network analysis, enables to interpret the system&#39;s virtuous cycles and analyze causality by observing relationship patterns in the system&#39;s attractors, thus complementing typical processing based on causal maps and the study of social networks. The results obtained by this application (which has been developed by our research team) show six sets of attractors that mark the trends of the tourist system. Finally, the analysis of the significant variables of these attractors has helped us to justify that the tourist system of Benidorm is in the rejuvenation phase.},

  abstract     = {The single-cone bit has become the first choice for slim hole sidetracking and deep well drilling with its unique rock breaking method and high ROP (rate of penetration). The single-cone bits currently used in the oil field all use cemented carbide inserts, with its main failure mode being of early excessive wear of the cutting teeth. In order to improve the adaptability of single-cone bits to hard and highly abrasive formations, a single-cone PDC composite bit is designed. According to the characteristics of the tooth profile, the way of tooth arrangement and the way of contact between the cutting teeth and the rock, the acceleration equation to the cutting teeth of the single-cone PDC composite bit is established. The shaft inclination angle of the cone, the position and height of the PDC teeth, the radius of the PDC teeth, the lateral rotation angle, and the front inclination angle on the acceleration are studied. The acceleration of the single-cone bit is verified by numerical simulation and drilling experiment of rock-breaking. Rock formation properties have an impact on the acceleration of the cutting teeth, with the acceleration of the cutting teeth in hard rock formations being higher than that in soft rock formations. On the premise that the bearing life of the single-cone bit is allowed, the value of the shaft inclination angle β can be approached to 70°. This research lays a theoretical foundation for the dynamic research and wear analysis of single-cone PDC composite bit.},

The trajectory equation of the Fokker–Plank equation can be derived based on an energetic variational approach. A structure-preserving numerical scheme that is mass conservative, energy stable, uniquely solvable, and positivity preserving at a theoretical level has also been designed in the previous work. Moreover, the numerical scheme is shown to satisfy the discrete energetic dissipation law and preserve steady states and has been observed to be second order accurate in space and first-order accurate time in various numerical experiments. In this work, we give the rigorous convergence analysis for the highly nonlinear numerical scheme. A careful higher order asymptotic expansion is needed to handle the highly nonlinear nature of the trajectory equation. In addition, two step error estimates (a rough estimate and a refined estimate) are necessary in the convergence proof. Different from a standard error estimate, the rough estimate is performed to control the nonlinear term. A few numerical results are also presented to verify the optimal convergence order and the preservation of equilibria.},

When the spatial dimension is three, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a global weak solution to the model with singular potentials including the physically relevant logarithmic potential. Then we obtain some regularity properties of the weak solution when t &gt; 0. In particular, with the aid of the viscous term ϵ ∂ t φ , we prove the so-called instantaneous separation property of the phase variable φ such that it stays away from the pure states ±1 as long as t &gt; 0. Next, we study longtime behavior of the system, by proving the existence of the global attractor in a suitable phase space and characterizing the ω -limit set.

We make use of the theory of Lie systems to provide a (nonlinear) superposition rule for the general solution of SISt model. To conclude, we present a quantum version of the same model, giving rise to a parametric family of SISt systems.

The total host population is considered bounded, and Holling type-II saturation incidence rate is involved as the infection term. Using the proposed SEIR epidemic model, the threshold quantity, namely, basic reproduction number R 0 , is obtained that determines the status of the disease, whether it dies out or persists in the whole population. The model&#39;s analysis shows that two equilibria exist, namely, disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). The global stability of the equilibria is determined using a Lyapunov functional approach. The disease status can be verified based on obtained threshold quantity . If , then DFE is globally stable, leading to eradicating the population&#39;s disease. If , a unique EE exists, and that is globally stable under certain conditions in the feasible region. The Caputo type fractional derivative is taken as the fractional operator. The bifurcation and sensitivity analyses are also performed for the proposed model that determines the relative importance of the parameters in disease transmission. The numerical solution of the model is obtained by the generalized Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and verify the analytical results. From the obtained results, it is concluded that the order of the fractional derivative plays a significant role in the dynamic process. Also, from the sensitivity analysis results, it is seen that the parameter δ ( infection rate) is positively correlated to , while the parameter μ (inhibition rate) is negatively correlated to , which means these parameters are more sensitive than others in disease dynamics.},

The cases of the strongly convex and weakly convex payoff function have been extensively studied and are nowadays fully understood. Despite the impressive advances made in the convex optimization context, the nonlinear non-convex optimization problems are still not fully exploited. In this paper, we are concerned with the nonlinear, non-convex optimization problem under system dynamic constraints. We apply our analysis to parameter identification of systems governed by general nonlinear differential equations. The considered inverse problem is presented using optimal control tools. We tackle the optimization through the use of Fletcher-Reeves nonlinear conjugate gradient method satisfying strong Wolfe conditions with inexact line search. We rigorously establish a convergence analysis of the method and report a new linear convergence rate which forms the main contribution of this work. The theoretical result reported in our analysis requires that the second derivative of the payoff functional be continuous and bounded. Numerical evidence on a selection of popular nonlinear models is presented as a direct application of parameter identification to support the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {The scattering characteristics of non-confocal elliptical lined tunnels under SH-wave disturbance are investigated. The problem is essentially a boundary value problem and its theoretical treatment is based on the wave function expansion method, which is an exact treatment of the problem. Multi-elliptic co-ordinate systems are employed and wave function translations between multi-elliptic co-ordinate systems are performed using the extra-domain addition theorem of the Mathieu function. The method can be used to fit and handle scattering problems with a wide range of geometries by varying the minor-and-major axis ratio, lining thickness and relative position of the tunnel. Calculations have been performed on the truncated infinite linear equation established by considering the boundary conditions. Based on the calculation results a parametric study is carried out to analyze the effect of the dimensionless eccentricity distance, the minor-and-major axis ratio and the dimensionless wave number on the dynamic stresses around the tunnel. Two typical application examples of concrete lining in granite and steel lining in granite are presented.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel collocation method is developed based on Gegenbauer wavelets together with the quasi-linearization technique to facilitate the solution of population growth model of fractional order in a closed system. The operational matrices of fractional order integration are obtained via block-pulse functions. The obtained matrices are employed to transform the given time-fractional population growth model into a non-linear system of algebraic equations. Then, the quasi-linearization technique is invoked to convert the underlying equations to a linear system of equations. The performance and accuracy of the proposed method is elucidated by a presenting a comparison with some numerical methods existing in the open literature. The numerical outcomes shows that the present method is more efficient than the existing ones.},

Using the method of integral balance and the Laplace transform technique, an analytical solution is obtained.

The usual nonlinear term in the standard model using the Westervelt equation in pressure formulation is of the form p p t . However, this should be considered as a low-order approximation to a more complex physical model where higher order terms will be required. Here we assume a more general case where the form taken is f ( p ) p t and f is unknown and must be recovered from data measurements. Corresponding to the typical measurement setup, the overposed data consist of time trace observations of the acoustic pressure at a single point or on a one-dimensional set Σ representing the receiving transducer array at a fixed time. Additionally to an analysis of well-posedness of the resulting pde , we show injectivity of the linearized forward map from f to the overposed data and use this as motivation for several iterative schemes to recover f . Numerical simulations will also be shown to illustrate the efficiency of the methods.},

For the analysis, we adopt the notion of energetic evolution, based on global minimisation of the involved energy. Due to the presence of the cohesive zone, as already emerged in literature, compactness issues lead to the introduction of a fictitious variable replacing the physical one which represents the maximal opening of the interface displacement discontinuity reached during the evolution. A new strategy which allows to recover the equivalence between the fictitious and the real variable under general loading–unloading regimes is illustrated. The argument is based on time regularity of energetic evolutions. This regularity is achieved by means of a careful balance between the convexity of the elastic energy of the layers and the natural concavity of the cohesive energy of the interface.},

Although vaccine production and distribution are currently underway, non-pharmacological interventions are still being implemented as an important and fundamental strategy to control the spread of the virus in countries around the world. To realize and forecast the transmission dynamics of this disease, mathematical models can be very effective. Various mathematical modeling methods have been proposed to investigate the transmission patterns of this new infection. In this paper, we utilized the fractional-order dynamics of COVID-19. The goal is to control the prevalence of the disease using non-pharmacological interventions. In this paper, a novel fractional-order backstepping sliding mode control (FOBSMC) is proposed for non-pharmacological decisions. Recently, new variant of this virus have been identified that have a much higher rate of transmission, so finally the effectiveness of the proposed controller in the presence of new variant of COVID-19 is investigated.},

When the thermal effect is acting via the second or third component of the laminated Timoshenko beam (rotation angle displacement or dynamic of the slip), we obtain that both systems, Timoshenko–Fourier and Timoshenko–Cattaneo systems, satisfy the same polynomial stability estimates in the L 2 -norm of the solution and its higher order derivatives with respect to the space variable. The decay rate depends on the regularity of the initial data. In addition, the presence and absence of the regularity-loss type property are determined by some relations between the parameters of systems. However, when the thermal effect is acting via the first component of the system (transversal displacement), a new stability condition is introduced for both Timoshenko–Fourier and Timoshenko–Cattaneo systems. This stability condition is in the form of threshold between polynomial stability and convergence to zero. To prove our results, we use the energy method in Fourier space combined with judicious choices of weight functions to build appropriate Lyapunov functionals.},

Then, the meshfree method based on radial basis functions (RBFs) is used to approximate the obtained equation. In fact, the finite difference method is used to approximate the unknown function in the time direction and generalized Gaussian RBF is applied to estimate the obtained equation in the space direction. The most important advantage of this method is that the noise terms are simulated directly at the collocation points at each time step. By employing this method, the equation decreased to a nonlinear system of algebraic equations which can be solved simply.

  abstract     = {The dynamical behavior of the rational vectorial operator associated with a multidimensional iterative method on polynomial systems gives us interesting information about the stability of the iterative scheme. The stability of fixed points, dynamic planes, bifurcation diagrams, etc. are known tools that provide us this information. In this manuscript, we introduce a new tool, which we call isonormal surface, to complement the information about the stability of the iterative method provided by the dynamical elements mentioned above. These dynamical instruments are used for analyzing the stability of a parametric family of multidimensional iterative schemes in terms of the value of the parameter. Some numerical tests confirm the obtained dynamical results.},

  abstract     = {An epidemiological model is proposed to study the transmission dynamics of the herpes virus type 2, a sexually transmitted infectious disease. This model considers two states, susceptible and infected, divides the population into sexes, assumes only heterosexual contacts and includes different transmission rates depending on whether the transmission is woman–man or man–woman. Reported and prevalence series data are retrieved from several sources. We consider the inherent data survey errors and the sensitivity of the diagnosis tests (data uncertainty). To calibrate the model to the available data and their uncertainty, a novel technique is proposed in two steps: (1) the application of the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find sets of model parameter values close to the data uncertainty and (2) the application of a selection algorithm to get a reduced number of model parameter values whose model outputs capture accurately the data uncertainty. Then, we check its robustness, and we provide a prediction of the evolution of the infected over the next 4 years. From the technical point of view, we conclude that the proposed technique to calibrate probabilistically the model is reliable and robust. Also, it is able to provide confidence intervals for the model parameter values and the predictions. From the medical point of view, the model returns that the transmission woman–man is higher than the man–woman, according to recent literature, and there is a mild increasing trend in the number of infected people over the next years.},

The horizontal top and bottom boundaries are insulated and impermeable. The vertical left sidewall is kept at a constant heat flux and high concentration, whereas the inclined sidewall is held at lower temperature and concentration. The dimensionless nonlinear system is solved by employing the finite difference method along the successive Under Relaxation technique. The findings are compared and validated with the existing literature for the Darcy flow driven through a single buoyancy effect (difference in density is only due to temperature variations) in a porous square enclosure. The numerical results are expressed in the form of streamlines, isotherms and iso-concentrations, and local and average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. It is observed that the buoyancy parameter reduces the dimensionless temperature of the cavity and increases the dimensionless concentration due to the strong impact of buoyancy. Smaller values of the Lewis number enhance heat transfer, whereas higher values reduce it. Moreover, the Rayleigh number and buoyancy parameter enhance both surface heat and concentration rates.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a random network model for sexual contacts in a population developed from real statistical data in order to assess vaccination policies against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The model is constructed by imposing a constraint requiring that individuals of a given sex, in a given age group, would have an average connectivity as that obtained in statistic surveys. In this model, the disease is transmitted stochastically according to a set of probability of infection parameters that depend on the age group. We are, in particular, interested on human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, characterized by a high infectivity and prevalence among the population. By building a network of up to 1000 nodes, we are able to obtain a stationary state under the assumption of constant population. Starting with this model, we will simulate several scenarios for vaccination against HPV by using the recent HPV ninevalent vaccine, which prevents against several oncogenic genotypes of the virus. Three different scenarios are simulated: only girls are vaccinated, only boys are vaccinated, or both sexes are vaccinated (gender neutral vaccination). Important levels of herd immunity are observed if only one sex is vaccinated and the scenario in which only boys are vaccinated is plausible in terms of cost-effectiveness. However, the serious consequences for women infected with oncogenic genotypes speak against this latter scenario. Conclusions about global vaccination programs are finally discussed in terms of our model.},

  abstract     = {The design of district metered areas (DMA) in potable water supply systems is of paramount importance for water utilities to properly manage their systems. Concomitant to their main objective, namely, to deliver quality water to consumers, the benefits include leakage reduction and prompt reaction in cases of natural or malicious contamination events. Given the structure of a water distribution network (WDN), graph theory is the basis for DMA design, and clustering algorithms can be applied to perform the partitioning. However, such sectorization entails a number of network modifications (installing cut-off valves and metering and control devices) involving costs and operation changes, which have to be carefully studied and optimized. Given the complexity of WDNs, optimization is usually performed using metaheuristic algorithms. In turn, optimization may be single or multiple-objective. In this last case, a large number of solutions, frequently integrating the Pareto front, may be produced. The decision maker has eventually to choose one among them, what may be tough task. Multicriteria decision methods may be applied to support this last step of the decision-making process. In this paper, DMA design is addressed by (i) proposing a modified k-means algorithm for partitioning, (ii) using a multiobjective particle swarm optimization to suitably place partitioning devices, (iii) using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to weight the four objective functions considered, and (iv) using technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to rank the Pareto solutions to support the decision. This joint approach is applied in a case of a well-known WDN of the literature, and the results are discussed.},

More precisely, a European option is considered when the dynamic of the underlying asset is governed by a Brownian motion. Following Liu and Young (2005), a term related to the number of invested stocks is embedded into the model. Moreover, the volatility of the asset is augmented by a separate function that models the abnormal increase of the volatility. Under these settings, we deal with the evaluation of European options. Dealing with illiquidity during a financial crisis is an important issue in terms of financial risk management, which has not been tackled with in the literature to the best of our knowledge. It is during these non-normal periods that volatility in the financial markets is very high and tools for reducing the underlying risk are urgently needed for hedging purposes. In this work, the PDE of the option price within this context is derived, which is a generalization of the PDE of Liu and Young (2005). Moreover, the hedging strategy to replicate the price of the option is obtained. Numerical simulations for the underlying asset price are conducted. The illustrations support several stylized facts of the model that seem to reflect what is operational in the real financial markets.},

The boundary value problem of a surface growth for elastic thick-walled vessels is solved. The analytical solution in terms of velocities for parameters of stress-strain state has been obtained. Condition of thickness has allowed us to study strain-stress state of cylinder surfaces using approximation of infinitesimal deformations. The stress-strain state characteristics are numerically computed and graphically analyzed using various mechanical parameters of the surface growth processes. Two cases of boundary value problems, namely, deformation of two- and multilayer cylinder have been considered.

The time derivative is discretized by the backward Euler method, and the Riemann–Liouville (R-L) fractional integral terms are treated by means of the first-order convolution quadrature. Then, the nonlinear term is linearized. A fully discrete scheme is established with the space discretization by the Sinc approximation based on the single exponential (SE) transformation. The spatial exponential convergence of the proposed method is derived. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.},

The qualitative properties of the solution including its regularity depend crucially on these corner points or such types of boundary conditions. In particular, the resulting expansion of the solutions of the underlying problem involves singular vector functions, inlines, depending on a certain parameter ξ μ . We derive the transcendental equations for all 10 possible cases of combinations of the boundary conditions generated by the basic four ones in classical elasticity proposing in the two natural directions of the boundary, that is, tangential and normal direction, respectively, which depends on ξ μ . So a MATLAB program is developed whereby ξ μ can be computed, and figures showing their distributions are presented. The leading singular exponents are computed for these combinations of the boundary conditions, wherein critical angles ω c r i t i c a l are listed such that for interior angles ω &lt; ω c r i t i c a l the H 2 -regularity of solution can be guaranteed. Moreover, the characterization of stress singularities in terms of the inner angle of a corner point is studied, and the regularity results are given.},

The model is studied under the limitations of crowding conditions, environmental, and economic resources. The current value Hamiltonian function is effectively used to determine the necessary first conditions for the optimal values of consumption and number of tourists in the destination. When the necessary conditions are sufficient for optimality, the Arrow sufficient theorem provides the special case. The partial Hamiltonian approach is applied to construct the first integrals of the economic growth model for two cases. These first integrals were utilized to compute the closed-form solution of the model under consideration. As it is well-known, different Ramsey-type models are solved with restrictions on the parameters. The system dynamics were studied mainly by describing the trajectories of the variables and the equilibrium, which is not enough to understand the evolution of any economy. This study is to examine the existence of closed-form solutions for the growth model of tourism. We apply this newly developed technique to analyze the dynamics of the total income for different initial stock ratios. The effects of natural amenities on the control and state variables were also part of this study. It is also shown that crowding aversion saves the stock of natural resources and services. We offer that for the long-term growth of the tourism, the optimal number of the tourist at the destination plays an important role.},

Under the proposed event-triggered mechanism, there is a mismatch between subsystems and their corresponding controllers; a merged switching signal is thus introduced to obtain the closed-loop switched systems. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with the merged switching signal, some sufficient criteria are proposed to guarantee the extended dissipativity of the switched systems under asynchronous switching; thus, H ∞ , passivity, dissipativity, and L 2 − L ∞ performance of such switched system can be addressed in a unified framework. The reliable controller gains are achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical example and comparison results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

We assume that the nonlinear term depends on the unknown function and its first derivative which is basically the semilinear case for the second-order reaction–diffusion system. As for the boundary conditions, we consider the typical Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic boundary settings. In all the cases, the equations admit a trivial steady state which loses stability at a critical parameter. We aim to classify all possible transitions and bifurcations that take place. Our analysis shows that these systems display all three types of transitions: continuous, jump and mixed. Moreover they exhibit transcritical, supercritical bifurcations with bifurcated states such as finitely many equilibria, circle of equilibria, and slowly rotating limit cycle. Many applications found in the literature are basically corollaries of our main results. We apply our results to classify the first transitions of the Chaffee–Infante equation, the Fisher-KPP equation, the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, and the Swift–Hohenberg equation.},

The model includes the primary cell populations involved in CD4 + T cells mediated regression of the tumor, that is, tumor cells, CD4 + T cells, anti-tumor cytokines, CTLA-4 molecules, and normal cells. Our study reveals that host cells together with cytokines are key features in driving tumor dynamics. The malignant tumor can be completely suppressed if the tumor growth rate is small and the host cells are more competitive. No treatments are needed in this scenario as tumor cells are driven to extinction by host cells. We examine various immunotherapies of either T cells, anti-tumor cytokines, anti-CTLA-4, or a combination of these to study their effectiveness. For the tumor with a medium growth rate and a moderate competitive ability to host cells, numerical simulations show that the host cells impel the tumor cells to demise due to battle with the normal cells and the effective jointed treatment strategy.},

The second kind involves four new inequalities, which are composed of only diamond alpha integrals, unifying delta and nabla Bennett-Leindler type inequalities. For the second type, choosing α = 1 or α = 0 not only yields the same results as the ones obtained for delta and nabla cases but also provides novel results for them. Therefore, both kinds of our results expand some of the known delta and nabla Bennett-Leindler type inequalities, offer new types of these inequalities, and bind and unify them into one diamond alpha Bennett-Leindler type inequalities. Moreover, an application of dynamic Bennett-Leindler type inequalities to the oscillation theory of the second-order half linear dynamic equation is developed and presented for the first time ever.},

By introducing one scalar auxiliary variable, the system is transformed into an equivalent form so that the nonlinear terms can be treated semi-explicitly. The scheme is linear and decoupled, and thus, they can be solved efficiently. We further prove that the semidiscretized scheme in time is unconditionally energy stable.

The proposed framework is based on measure theory and uses polar decomposition for simplifying and calculating the integrals to obtain closed form results. We validate our proposed framework by comparison with simulations and published closed form results in the literature for simple cases. We illustrate the versatility and advantage of the proposed framework by deriving closed form results for a case not yet reported in the literature. Finally, we also develop a Mathematica implementation of the proposed framework which allows a user to define any two arbitrary (concave or convex) polygons, with or without holes, which may be disjoint or overlap or coincide and determine the distance distribution numerically.},

It turns out that there always exist two critical curves which may separate competition outcomes into competitive exclusion, bistability, and coexistence. As a further development, under the assumption that the ratio of advection and diffusion rates of one species is greater than or equal to that of the other species, we give a specific classification on the global dynamics, which shows that bistability does not happen, but coexistence and competitive exclusion may occur. These interesting results indicate that advective movements play a key role in determining the dynamical behaviors.},

First, consider the possibility that the real dynamical system is actually limited; the state constraint is absorbed to the ordinary uncertain fractional-order dynamical system. The concept of reliability of uncertain system is presented innovatively, which are ulteriorly formulated through the existing first-hitting time theorem. Second, based on the proposed reliability and under a given sufficient condition, a novel uncertain fractional-order dynamic system with a state constraint is modeled mathematically; corresponding minimum operation ability of the uncertain system is also given. Lastly, the uncertain fractional-order dynamic system with a state constraint is applied to different physical and financial dynamical models. Analytic expressions of reliability indexes are derived to demonstrate the reasonableness of our model. Meanwhile, expected time response and American barrier option prices are calculated by using the predictor–corrector scheme. The sensitivity analysis is also presented for the numerical examples.},

Also, we present determinantal representations for the Peters polynomials and numbers by virtue of a general derivative formula for the ratio of two differentiable functions. Moreover, we give several recursive relations for the Peters polynomials and numbers. As an application, we establish alternative recursive relations for them with the aid of a recursive relation for the Hessenberg determinants. These results cover counterparts for the Boole polynomials and numbers.},

  abstract     = {We study the process of two-phase flow in thin porous media domains of Brinkman type. This is generally described by a model of coupled, mixed-type differential equations of fluids&#39; saturation and pressure. To reduce the model complexity, different approaches that utilize the thin geometry of the domain have been suggested. We focus on a reduced model that is formulated as a single nonlocal evolution equation of saturation. It is derived by applying standard asymptotic analysis to the dimensionless coupled model; however, a rigid mathematical derivation is still lacking. In this paper, we prove that the reduced model is the analytical limit of the coupled two-phase flow model as the geometrical parameter of domain&#39;s width–length ratio tends to zero. Precisely, we prove the convergence of weak solutions for the coupled model to a weak solution for the reduced model as the geometrical parameter approaches zero.},

This paper provides an explanation of the relation between the pre-factor functions P ( z ) and Q ( z ) and the singulants of the expansion of the general second-order singularly perturbed differential equation in higher levels of the asymptotic analysis. Exponential asymptotics typically relies upon the derivation of the singulant function as it is crucial to determine the location of the Stokes lines. By doing the careful analysis, we connect the subsequent order singulants with the previous order singulants and determine the asymptotics of the late coefficients. By this relation, one can predict and investigate the Stokes phenomenon and exponential smoothing of the equations in the form of the model differential equation.},

This analysis has been performed by comparing the models of two systems which are the traditional independent metering (IM), which depends on poppet valve, and the new hydro-mechatronics system MIM, which relies on a stepped rotary flow control valve. In general, IM is a hydraulic control system which guarantees a separation between the meter-in and the meter-out of the hydraulic actuator. A Valvistor valve, a special type of Poppet valves, was developed to be embedded into the IM system. This valve has controllability and stability shortcomings which prevent the system from spreading in the industrial applications. The Valvistor valve performance is highly affected by the fluid disturbances because the fluid is considered as a part of its control elements. A stepped rotary flow control valve has been developed to control hydraulic flow rate. The valve composed of a rotary orifice attached to a stepper motor. Using this valve instead of the traditional poppet type has led to a new configuration, which is termed by MIM. This form improves the hydraulic cylinder velocity performance by rejecting the fluid disturbances effect on the control circuit.},

In order to investigate the isochronous centers for four-dimensional systems, a new algorithm to calculate so-called isochronous constants is given. Moreover, with the calculation of the isochronous constants, the conditions for the existence of an isochronous center are determined in a way which does not need first computing the center manifolds of the four-dimensional system. Finally, as an application, we investigate a class of quadratic polynomial systems for a model of airfoil and prove that the system can have five small limit cycles around the origin on the center manifold. Moreover, we apply our new methodology to find the sufficient and necessary conditions for the origin to be an isochronous center restricted to the center manifold, illustrating the reliability and availability of the new algorithm.},

More precisely, it is proved that if the sequence Ψ is sufficiently close to the frame Φ, then for given approximately dual frame Φ a d of Φ, the approximately dual frame Ψ a d of Ψ can be found which is close to Φ a d , and particularly, we estimate their deviation in terms of the distance of the operators and and their approximation rates, where T X and U X denote the synthesis and analysis operators of the frame X , respectively. It is worth mentioning that some of our perturbation conditions are quite different from those used in the previous literatures on this topic.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive grid method based on the backward Euler formula for a system of semilinear singularly perturbed initial value problems is studied. Based on the a priori error analysis and mesh equidistribution principle, we prove that the convergence rate of our semidiscrete adaptive grid method is first order, which is robust with respect to the perturbation parameters. Then, in order to construct a fully discrete adaptive grid method, a standard residual-type a posterior error estimation is constructed by using the linear polynomial interpolation technique. A partly heuristic argument based on this a posteriori error estimator leads to an optimal monitor function, which is used to design an adaptive grid algorithm. Furthermore, we also extend our presented adaptive grid method to a nonlinear system of singularly perturbed problem arising in the modeling of enzyme kinetics and a system of singularly perturbed delay differential equations, respectively. Finally, numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our presented adaptive grid method.},

In this paper, a pest management model is established with the mate-finding Allee effect induced by releasing sterile pests. In addition, the natural enemies of pests and spraying insecticide are also taken into account to achieve integrated pest management. For the model without delay, although the origin is not well-defined in our model, we pay attention to the dynamics near the origin and find it is always an attractor. This means the extinction of pests is closely related to their initial scale. Based on that, we conduct a detailed qualitative study on other equilibria. Furthermore, the model with a time delay is also observed. The stability of equilibrium points, Hopf bifurcation, and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation are all carried out. Through numerical simulation, the results indicate that adding the mate-finding Allee effect can significantly reduce the demand for pesticides and reduce the environmental damage from pesticides, comparing with the traditional approach (i.e., combining natural enemies and pesticides). We also find that a time delay can switch the stability of the equilibrium points and promote the extinction of pests.},

Then a new method called the Mittag–Leffler function based method is proposed for the first time ever to construct the abundant traveling wave solutions. By this method, three families (six sets) of the traveling wave solutions on Cantor set are obtained. Finally, the performances of the various solutions on Cantor set are presented through the three-dimensional contours. It shows that the proposed method is straightforward, powerful and can provide more forms of the traveling wave solutions for the local fractional equations, which is expected to be helpful for the study of the traveling wave theory for local fractional equations.},

  abstract     = {For nonlinear dispersive systems, the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation can usually be derived as a formal approximation equation describing slow spatial and temporal modulations of the envelope of a spatially and temporally oscillating underlying carrier wave. Here, we justify the NLS approximation for a whole class of quasilinear dispersive systems, which also includes toy models for the waterwave problem. This is the first time that this is done for systems, where a quasilinear quadratic term is allowed to effectively lose more than one derivative. With effective loss, we here mean the loss still present after making a diagonalization of the linear part of the system such that all linear operators in this diagonalization have the same regularity properties.},

The flow model consists of two porous regions of different permeability. Newtonian and micropolar fluids are allowed to flow in the region-I and region-II, respectively. The flow of Newtonian and micropolar fluid in respective porous region is governed by the Brinkman&#39;s equation. An exact solution of the proposed mathematical model is obtained by using well-known and appropriate boundary conditions. The expressions for linear velocity, microrotational velocity, flow rate and stresses are evaluated. The effect of various emerging non-dimensional parameters like viscosity ratio, couple stress parameter, gravitational parameter, Reynolds number, and so on, on linear velocity, microrotational velocity, flow rate and stresses is presented graphically. The results are validated with the help of the previous established results.},

A conformable integro-differential sliding motion is enforced in finite-time, by means of a second-order sliding mode controller, where the stability at the sliding phase is studied in the Lyapunov framework. Representative simulation examples are provided to show the suitability of the proposed methodology, and an experimental scenario is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under real-world conditions.},

Based on the eigenvalue analysis, the principle of exchange of stabilities conditions is obtained. By using the dynamical transition theory, three different types of dynamical transition for the five-dimensional Lorenz system are derived. More precisely, when the control parameter r = 1 , the system has a continuous transition and bifurcates to two stable steady states. As r further increases, the system undergoes two successive transitions. That is, under some condition, the transition is continuous and a stable limit cycle is bifurcated; if not, the system undergoes a jump transition and an unstable periodic orbit occurs. Especially, the chaotic orbits occur when r = 36 . 91 . Finally, numerical results are given to illustrate our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, the numerical solution of the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equation is obtained using an improvised quintic B-spline extrapolated collocation technique. This equation helps in the study of wave production in dissipative medium, investigates the hydrodynamic uncertainty in laminar flames, describes the turbulence of diverse physical processes, and so on. In this work, splines are used due to their higher smoothness property and the sparse nature of the matrices corresponding to the B-splines. The improvised B-splines are formed by forcing the quintic B-spline interpolant to satisfy the interpolatory and some special end conditions. These basis functions are used in the collocation method for space integration and a weighted finite difference scheme is used for temporal domain integration. The stability of the technique is analyzed using the von Neumann scheme, and it is found to be unconditionally stable. The proposed method is found to be sixth-order convergent in space and second-order convergent in the time direction. The theoretical order of convergence is matching perfectly with the numerical one. The efficiency of this scheme is demonstrated by applying it to a number of examples. The L 2 , L ∞ , and global relative errors are calculated and compared with the previous work, especially with those where quintic B-splines are used as basis functions. Also, the behavior of some KS equations is discussed for which the exact solution is not available. The aim of the paper is to show that such an improvised technique can be implemented to solve partial differential equations like the KS equation.},

  abstract     = {A Global Random Walk on Spheres (GRWS) algorithm for calculating the solution and its derivatives of drift-diffusion-reaction equations in any desired set of points is suggested. The GRWS algorithm is able to find the solution and derivative fields in any family of points simultaneously, using only one ensemble of random walks which drastically decreases the computer time compared to the standard random walk-based methods. The method in its nature is stochastic and meshless; the cost is of the order | log ⁡ ( ε ) | / ε 2 independent of the space dimension and complexity of the boundary shape, where ε is the desired accuracy. The variance, accuracy, and the cost of the method suggested are given. For illustration, we present simulation results for exciton drift-diffusion-recombination transport in a 3D prism and compare them with the exact solution. Calculations are also given for derivatives of a 2D diffusion problem which show the same accuracy as for the solution itself; the simulations are compared against the exact results.},

  abstract     = {In both theoretical and applied mathematics fields, integral inequalities play a critical role. Due to the behavior of the definition of convexity, both concepts convexity and integral inequality depend on each other. Therefore, the relationship between convexity and integral inequality is strong. By the importance of these concepts, we have introduced the new class of generalized convex function is known as LR- 𝒽 h -convex interval-valued function (LR- 𝒽 h -convex-IVF) by means of pseudo-order relation (≤ p ). This order relation is defined on interval space. Under the new concept, first, both discrete and continuous new versions of Jensen-type inequalities are presented by means of pseudo-order relation. Second, several new Hermite–Hadamard ( HH )- and Hermite–Hadamard–Fejér ( HH -Fejér)-type inequalities are also derived for LR- -convex-IVFs. Moreover, we have shown that our results include a wide class of new and known inequalities for LR- -convex-IVFs and their variant forms as special cases. Useful examples that verify the applicability of the theory developed in this study are presented. It the end, we have proved that the set inclusion “⊆” coincident to pseudo-order relation “≤ p .” The concepts and techniques of this paper may be the starting point for further research in this area and used as a tool to investigate the research of probability and optimization, among others.},

Numerical computations have been performed for the cases of power law and exponential law shock paths, to find out the behavior of flow variables in the flow field immediately behind the shock. Similarity solutions are carried out by taking arbitrary constants in the expressions of infinitesimals of the Lie group of transformations. Also, the study of the present work provides a clear picture of whether and how the variations in the non-ideal parameter of the gas, Alfven–Mach number, adiabatic exponent, ambient magnetic field variation index, and gravitational parameter affect the propagation of shock and the flow behind it.

Firstly, we explore some mathematical properties of the quadratic-phase wavelet transform, including the orthogonality relation, inversion formula, range theorem and some notable inequalities. Secondly, we derive an extension of the Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle and formulate an analogue of the Pitt&#39;s inequality for the quadratic-phase Fourier and wavelet transforms. Finally, we broaden the scope of the proposed work by studying the differentiation properties of the quadratic-phase Fourier transform and then addressing the analytical solutions of certain generalized partial differential equations, such as the generalized Laplace, wave, and the Schrödinger equations by utilizing the quadratic-phase wavelet transform.},

  abstract     = {The generation of quasi-developable from two boundary curves finds extensive application in manufacturing system. In this paper, we present a new method to generate a quasi-developable from two Bézier boundary curves via particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based shape parameters optimization. Owing to the powerful and flexible shape adjustment ability of Q-Bézier curves, we introduce the multiple shape parameters of Q-Bézier model into original boundary curves for developability optimization. We formulate the generation of quasi-developable as a geometric optimization problem in which the objective function is defined as the developability degree of the strip and search within the value range of the shape parameters for the set of optimal shape parameters by PSO to achieve a higher-accuracy developability. Modeling examples demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, easy to implement, which provides users with the overall shape control of the output strip. With the control points keeping unchanged, the fairness of the surface and its approximation to the original surface can be guaranteed naturally, and the number of optimization variables is greatly reduced compared with previous methods.},

In their description, the interface is considered as a thermodynamic system characterized by its intensive and extensive variables. The boundary conditions describing the free interface are expressed in terms of fluxes, thermodynamic forces, and interface transport coefficients. Previous works have focused on the derivation of the generalized boundary conditions for different systems using the BAM method, but the corresponding solutions and dynamics have not been widely studied. We consider a theoretical two dimensional system made of two incompressible fluids separated by a deformable interface for which the boundary conditions are obtained using the BAM method. Ignoring the effects of external forces, the dynamics of the system is investigated using the method of multiple scales. The hierarchy of equations is solved up to the second order and we obtain conditions that must be fulfilled by the transport coefficients modeling the cross-effects of the velocity slips and temperature jumps so that non-trivial asymptotic solutions for the temperature and velocity profiles can be constructed.},

This study defines a nonclassical numerical method to effectively capture the behavior of the nonlinear option pricing model in illiquid markets where the implementation of a dynamic hedging strategy affects the price of the underlying asset. Unlike the conventional numerical approaches, this study describes a numerical scheme based on the Newton iteration technique and the Fréchet derivative for linearization of the model. The linearized time-dependent PDE is then discretized by a sixth-order finite difference scheme in space and a second-order trapezoidal rule in time. The computations revealed that the current approach appears to be somewhat more effective to some extent and at the same time economical for illustrative examples compared to the existing competitors. In addition, this method helps to prevent considering the convergence issues of the Newton approach applied to the nonlinear algebraic system.},

We perform a qualitative analysis based on stability theory, focusing to the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the related transcritical bifurcation taking place at the threshold for the DFE. Finally, we assess the role of epidemiological and information parameters in the model dynamics through numerical simulations. Our simulations suggests that the impact of the parameters that are related to human behavior critically depend on the average information delay. For example, it can induce recurrent epidemics, provided that transfer rate from the carrier to the infectious state is over a threshold. Otherwise, the endemic equilibrium is (at least) locally stable.},

In this direction, the description of immune systems is an attractive topic as a result of its ability to detect and eradicate abnormal cells. Therefore, this manuscript aims to investigate the asymptotic behavior of immunogenic tumor dynamics based on a new fractional model constructed by the concept of general fractional operators. We discuss the stability and equilibrium points corresponding to the new model; then we modify the predictor–corrector method in general sense to implement the model and compare the associated numerical results with some real experimental data. As an achievement, the new model provides a degree of flexibility enabling us to adjust the complex dynamics of biological system under study. Consequently, the new general model and its solution method presented in this paper for the immunogenic tumor dynamics are new and comprise quite different information than the other kinds of classical and fractional equations. In addition to these, we implement a tracking control method in order to decrease the development of tumor-cell population. The satisfaction of control purpose is confirmed by some simulation results since the controlled variables track the tumor-free steady state in the whole realistic cases.},

In addition to this, we formulate the boundary conditions in the framework of the mixed q -integro-derivative conditions simultaneously. For such new fractional q -sequential integro-differential structures, we utilize suitable standard analytical methods attributed to Krasnoselskii on the sum of two operators. In the final stage, we design two simulative examples to check the consistency of findings in the context of the proposed techniques.},

  abstract     = {Intricate functional diversities in marine ecosystems often lead to exhibit a variety of dynamical behaviors, including chaos. To bring order into such chaotic situations, the system develops different mechanisms of self-adaptability. Our present investigation is based on the study of an eco-epidemiological model for virally infected toxic phytoplankton and zooplankton system. Both healthy and infected phytoplankton are assumed to be exposed to grazer zooplankton with a varying degree of exposure. An extension is made by introducing the fact that viral replication process in a lysis event is mediated by some time lag. To achieve more realistic and explicit outcomes of the existing phenomena correlated with our model, we consider the force of infection and replication of free viruses as seasonally forced. We find that time delay accounts for recurrent stability switching event in the system. The chaotic behavior is observed in the seasonally forced delayed system, which indicates the emergence of harmful blooms. The main motive is to gain a clear insight into the field of synchronization and stabilization of the irregular behaviors of the system. Our investigations suggest that increased strength of toxic compounds exuded by phytoplankton species may suppress the prevalence of chaotic disorder and drives the system into a zooplankton-free zone. The intensity of selective grazing of zooplankton changes the state of chaos to order and promotes the disease-free system.},

Moreover, we claim that either it is the global-in-time or it blows up at a finite time. With reference to the case that the source function is global Lipschitzian, we observe that the solution always uniquely exists for a finite time and is continuously dependent.

By using the theories of impulsive equations, small amplitude perturbation techniques, and the comparison technique, we obtain the conditions which guarantee the global asymptotical stability of the tumor-eliminated periodic solution and system permanence, when immunotherapy alone is performed. The numerical results of the influences of the impulsive perturbation on the inherent oscillation show rich dynamics, such as period-doubling bifurcation and chaos. Moreover, the effects of the combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy on antitumor are obtained, including the threshold value of stability conditions of tumor-eradication periodic solution when the mixed combination treatment of immunotherapy and radiotherapy is performed. Some numerical simulations for the effects of the timing of radiotherapy application and the timing of injection T cells on the threshold value are performed.

The main contribution of this work consists of building a bioeconomic model describing the problem of a potential investor who aims to maximize his net profit generated by selling the produced energy from the household waste transformation. We first study the evolution of a waste stock, the energy quantity produced, and the capital dedicated to the transformation process in a giving landfill and recovery center. Then we insert decision variables to this dynamic which are both the investment and the part of waste to be treated. This leads to an optimal control problem which we solve by the deductive method. The resulted solution is then illustrated by some numerical simulations. This investment policy would be to support the decision makers to go towards investment in this activity.},

More precisely, we study under what conditions the steady states of the system are contained in a parallel translate of a coordinate hyperplane. To this end, we focus mainly on ODEs consisting of generalized polynomials and make use of algebraic and geometric tools to relate the local and global structure of the set of steady states. Specifically, we consider the local property termed zero sensitivity at a coordinate x i , which means that the tangent space is contained in a hyperplane of the form x i = c , and provide a criterion to identify it. We consider the global property termed absolute concentration robustness (ACR) , meaning that all steady states are contained in a hyperplane of the form x i = c . We clarify and formalize the relation between the two approaches. In particular, we show that ACR implies zero sensitivity and identify when the two properties do not agree, via an intermediate property we term local ACR . For families of systems arising from modeling biochemical reaction networks, we obtain the first practical and automated criterion to decide upon (local) ACR.},

We consider the coupled system by incorporating the Caputo fractional operator and investigate three distinct cases for different initial values to illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the FNDM. With respect to fractional order, we capture the behaviour of the achieved solution cited in three different cases and exemplified with the aid of 2D and 3D plots for the particular value of the parameters in the model.

First, we prove that event-triggered impulsive control can exclude Zeno behavior. Then, based on the Lyapunov method and the graph theory, some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that quaternion-valued coupled systems reach synchronization. Furthermore, as an application of our theoretical results, exponential synchronization of quaternion-valued Kuramoto oscillators is studied in detail and a synchronization criterion is presented.

To account for these characteristics, we formulate a dengue model in a spatial-heterogeneous and time-periodic environment. Moreover, the free boundary is additionally incorporated into our model to reflect the boundary change of region where dengue virus spreads. Employing the properties of the contagion risk threshold, that is the spatial-temporal basic reproduction ratio, we derive some sufficient conditions regarding the vanishing and spreading of virus. Importantly, the long-time asymptotic behavior of solution is studied in depth when spreading happens. Our findings manifest that as time goes on, dengue virus will behave periodically when spreading. Finally, these phenomena are numerically simulated and epidemiologically explained.},

The model incorporates silent HIV-infected CD4 + T cells and silent HTLV-infected CD4 + T cells. The model includes two routes of HIV transmission, virus to cell (VTC) and cell to cell (CTC). It also incorporates two modes of HTLV-I transmission, horizontal transmission via direct CTC contact and vertical transmission through mitotic division of Tax-expressing HTLV-infected cells. The model takes into account five types of distributed-time delays. We analyze the model by proving the nonnegativity and boundedness of the solutions, calculating all possible equilibria, deriving a set of key threshold parameters, and proving the global stability of all equilibria. The global asymptotic stability of all equilibria is established by utilizing Lyapunov function and LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle.

The unique existence of the stationary solution is shown under the adhesion and the adiabatic boundary conditions. Then, we prove that a solution to the initial boundary value problem with the same boundary and periodic conditions uniquely exists globally in time and converges to the stationary solution as time tends to infinity. Moreover, if the external forces are small or disappeared in an appropriate Sobolev space, then δ can be a general constant. Our proof relies on the two-tier energy method for the reformulated system in Lagrangian coordinates and the background magnetic field which is perpendicular to the flat layer.

A major call for concern was the significant rise from 2% in May 2020 to 4.67% by the end of July 15, 2020. This drastic increase calls for quick intervention in the transmission and control strategy of COVID-19 in Africa. A mathematical model to theoretically investigate the consequence of ignoring asymptomatic cases on COVID-19 spread in Africa is proposed in this study. A qualitative analysis of the model is carried out with and without re-infection, and the reproduction number is obtained under re-infection. The results indicate that increasing case detection to detect asymptomatically infected individuals will be very effective in containing and reducing the burden of COVID-19 in Africa. In addition, the fact that it has not been confirmed whether a recovered individual can be re-infected or not, then enforcing a living condition where recovered individuals are not allowed to mix with the susceptible or exposed individuals will help in containing the spread of COVID-19.},

By applying definition of convex function, and integral Jensen&#39;s inequality for concave function in the identity pertaining the Jensen difference, we derive bounds for the Jensen difference. We present integral version of the bounds in Riemann sense as well. The sharpness of the proposed bounds through examples are discussed, and we conclude that the proposed bounds are better than some existing bounds even with weaker conditions. Also, we present some new variants of the Hermite–Hadamard and Hölder inequalities and some new inequalities for geometric, quasi-arithmetic, and power means. Finally, we give some applications in information theory.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the unsteady free convection magnetohydrodynamical flow of a viscous, incompressible, and electrically conducting fluid between two horizontally directed slipping plates is considered. The external magnetic filed is applied uniformly in the y -direction and the fluid is assumed to be of low conductivity so that the induced magnetic field is negligible. So the relevant variables, that is, the velocity and the temperature, depend only on one coordinate, the y -axis. The governing equations of velocity and temperature fields are obtained from the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. The boundary conditions for the velocity are taken in the most general form as Robins type which contain slipping parameter. Moreover, the upper plate is heated exponentially and the lower plate is adiabatic. Finite difference method (FDM) is used to simulate the numerical solutions of the problem in which the explicit forward difference in time variable t and central difference in space variable y is used. Hartmann number, Prandtl number, decay factor, and slipping parameter influences on the flow and temperature are shown graphically. It is seen that as the Hartmann number increases, the velocity magnitude drops, which is the well-known flattening tendency of the MHD flow. Also, the increase in decay factor causes an increase in both the velocity and temperature magnitudes at increasing time levels, but it does not change further close to the steady-state. Furthermore, the convergence and stability conditions of the considered scheme are obtained in terms of Hartmann number, Prandtl number, and the slip length.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the consensus control problem of multi-agent systems (MAS) with distributed parameter models. Based on the framework of network topologies, a second-order PI-type iterative learning control (ILC) protocol with initial state learning is proposed by using the nearest neighbor knowledge. A discrete system for proposed ILC is established, and the consensus control problem is then converted to a stability problem for such a discrete system. Furthermore, by using generalized Gronwall inequality, a sufficient condition for the convergence of the consensus errors between any two agents is obtained. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by two numerical examples.},
