  abstract     = {The risk–return relation is an important topic in finance. To quantify such relation, the article introduces a new heteroscedastic volatility model, called the generalized-risk-in-mean model (GRM), and considers its entire statistical inference procedure. To adapt potential heavy-tailed phenomena in financial data or an over-parametrization problem in modeling, the self-weighted quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (S-QMLE) is studied and its asymptotics is established, which is non-standard when null volatility coefficients exist. Compared with GARCH-in-mean models (GARCH-M) in the literature, asymptotics of the S-QMLE of our model is much easier to be established under some tractable yet simple conditions. It is very difficult to obtain asymptotics of the QMLE in the GARCH-M, which requires many over-complicated assumptions that are hard to verify in practice. Further, the Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and quasi-likelihood ratio tests are proposed to test for coefficients, and their limiting distributions are derived. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite-sample performance of the entire statistical inference procedure and a real example is analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of the GRM.},

  abstract     = {Clustering time series into similar groups can improve models by combining information across like time series. While there is a well developed body of literature for clustering of time series, these approaches tend to generate clusters independently of model training, which can lead to poor model fit. We propose a novel distributed approach that simultaneously clusters and fits autoregression models for groups of similar individuals. We apply a Wishart mixture model so as to cluster individuals while modelling the corresponding autocovariance matrices at the same time. The fitted Wishart scale matrices map to cluster-level autoregressive coefficients through the Yule–Walker equations, fitting robust parsimonious autoregressive mixture models. This approach is able to discern differences in underlying autocorrelation variation of time series in settings with large heterogeneous datasets. We prove consistency of our cluster membership estimator, asymptotic distributions of coefficients and compare our approach against competing methods through simulation as well as by fitting a COVID-19 forecast model.},

We develop an associated estimation theory for both first- and second-order time series quantities and show that our estimators achieve good properties in isolation of each other by making appropriate assumptions on the series trend.

  abstract     = {This article extends the pioneering Johansen cointegration test to allow for structural breaks in a cointegration system. Instead of using usual dummy variables, we utilize a Fourier function to control for an unknown number of multiple breaks in the cointegration system. The underlying presumption of the procedure is that structural breaks often can be captured by using a small number of low-frequency components from a Fourier approximation. The number of parameters to estimate is reduced significantly, which can lead to a good performance of the tests. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new tests display good size and power properties, except for the cases of sharp breaks. Then, we consider a strategy using a union of rejections. The union test combines our suggested test with a test of the cointegration rank in VAR models in the presence of a possible break in trend at an unknown point. We further consider a procedure that selects a better model using a Schwarz-type criterion among Johansen, trend break-point, and Fourier models. The resulting test shows fairly correct sizes in all cases, including sharp breaks, smooth breaks, and no breaks. The power properties are also reasonable in almost all cases.},

The proposed estimator is designed so as to cope with the leakage effect induced by strong peaks of the marginal spectra by utilizing adaptive windowing. We study the asymptotic bias and covariance structure of the proposed estimator and prove a central limit theorem for its distribution. We also obtain a result of independent importance for the consistency rate of the cross-covariance matrix of the two series. The performance of the estimator in comparison to more traditional ones is demonstrated in a simulation study under a model exhibiting extreme characteristics, such as strong peaks in its marginal spectra.

On the other hand, when the null hypothesis of interest is that the underlying process is an uncorrelated sequence, permutation tests are not necessarily level , nor are they approximately level in large samples. In addition, permutation tests may have large Type 3, or directional, errors, in which a two-sided test rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that the first-order autocorrelation is larger than 0, when in fact it is less than 0. In this article, under weak assumptions on the mixing coefficients and moments of the sequence, we provide a test procedure for which the asymptotic validity of the permutation test holds, while retaining the exact rejection probability in finite samples when the observations are independent and identically distributed. A Monte Carlo simulation study, comparing the permutation test to other tests of autocorrelation, is also performed, along with an empirical example of application to financial data.},

We devise a two-step estimation procedure to estimate the conditional quantile parameters. The first step applies a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation procedure, with the realized volatility as a proxy for the volatility proxy, to estimate the conditional standard deviation parameters. The second step utilizes a quantile regression estimation procedure with the estimated conditional standard deviation in the first step. Asymptotic theory is established for the proposed estimation methods, and a simulation study is conducted to check their finite-sample performance. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to calculate the value at risk of 20 individual assets and compare its performance with existing competitors.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting is one of the fundamental focuses in the literature of econometric time-series. Often practitioners and policymakers want to predict outcomes of an entire time horizon in the future instead of just a single k -step ahead prediction. These series, apart from their own possible nonlinear dependence, are often also influenced by many external predictors. In this article, we construct prediction intervals of time-aggregated forecasts in a high-dimensional regression setting. Our approach is based on quantiles of residuals obtained by the popular LASSO routine. We allow for general heavy-tailed, long-memory, and nonlinear stationary error processes and stochastic predictors. Through a series of systematically arranged consistency results, we provide theoretical guarantees of our proposed quantile-based method in all of these scenarios. After validating our approach using simulations, we also propose a novel bootstrap-based method that can boost the coverage of the theoretical intervals. Finally analyzing the EPEX Spot data, we construct prediction intervals for hourly electricity prices over horizons spanning 17 weeks and contrast them to selected Bayesian and bootstrap interval forecasts.},

This article proposes a combination of the local linear smoothing method and the adaptive group lasso penalty approach to achieve covariate identification and coefficient estimation. The penalty term consists of two parts. The first term penalizes the norm of the coefficient function, which is used to select relevant variables. The second term penalizes the norm of the derivative function, which assesses the constancy of the coefficient functions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed methodology are established.

It is therefore very appealing. The question is: Does the appeal of FA, which so far has only been documented for fixed effects panels, extends to panels with incidental trends? This is an important question, because many persistent variables are trending. The answer turns out to be negative. In particular, while consistent, the asymptotic normality of FA breaks down when there is an exact unit root present, which limits its applicability.},

Two different integer-valued GARCH models based on Poisson distribution have been proposed for these two types of discrete data respectively. Shifted geometric distribution is more flexible than Poisson distribution, whose variance is greater than its mean. In this article, we propose a GJR-GARCH model based on shifted geometric distribution for ℤ -valued time series exhibiting asymmetric volatility. Basic probabilistic properties of the new model are given, and the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate unknown parameters and the asymptotic normality of corresponding estimators is established. A simulation study is presented to illustrate the estimation method. An empirical application to a real data concerning the daily stock returns divided by tick price is considered to show the proposed model&#39;s superiority compared with existing models.},

In this article, we derive the autocovariance function and the spectrum of the cyclical component of a series that consists of a constant, a linear time trend, a unit root process, and a weakly stationary process. We show that the autocovariance function of the cyclical component of such a series depends on (i) the autocovariance of the innovations of the unit root process; (ii) the autocovariance of the weakly stationary process and; (iii) a component of the weights of the HP filter that is important in the middle of a large sample. The result for the spectrum of the cyclical component matches with earlier results in the literature that were obtained by using an approximate approach. Lastly, we derive the cross-covariance function and the cross-spectrum of the cyclical components of two cointegrated series.},

Three different variants of the model are examined depending on how the lagged-values of the mixing variable are integrated into the conditional mean equation. The model includes, in particular, Markov mixture versions of various well-known non-negative time series models such as the autoregressive conditional duration model, the integer-valued GARCH (INGARCH) model, and the Beta observation driven model. For the three variants of the model, conditions are given for the existence of a stationary and ergodic solution. The proposed conditions match those already known for Markov-switching GARCH models.

Several tests have been proposed that are robust to general form of heteroskedastic errors. The most popular use a two-steps approach: first estimate the residuals assuming no changes in the regression coefficients; second, use the residuals to approximate the heteroskedastic asymptotic distribution or take an entire sample average to construct a test for which the variance process is averaged out. An alternative approach was proposed by Perron et al. (Perron et al. (2020). Quantitative Economics 11 : 1019–1057) who provided a test for changes in the coefficients allowing for changes in the variance of the error term. We show that it transforms the variance profile into one that effectively has very little impact on the size of the test. With respect to the power properties, the two-steps procedures can suffer from non-monotonic power problems in dynamic models and in static models with a correction for serial correlation in the error. Most have power equals to size with zero-mean regressors. Even when the two-steps tests have power, it is generally lower than that of the latter test.},

To detect asymmetric effects in the volatility, the Wald, Lagrange multiplier and quasi-likelihood ratio test statistics are put forward, and their limiting distributions are established under both null and local alternative hypotheses. Moreover, a mixed portmanteau test is constructed to check the adequacy of the fitted model. All asymptotic properties of inference tools including QMLE, BICs, asymmetric tests and the mixed portmanteau test, are established without any moment condition on the data process, which makes the new model and its inference tools applicable for heavy-tailed data.

Not surprisingly, the autoregressive spectral estimator is not consistent at the origin under ignored changes in the mean, but turns out to be consistent at non-zero frequencies. We furthermore show how a specific trimming of the fitted long autoregression can be used to restore consistency in the vicinity of the origin.},

  abstract     = {Markov chains with variable length are useful stochastic models for data compression that avoid the curse of dimensionality faced by full Markov chains. In this article we introduce a variable length Markov chain whose transition probabilities depend not only on the state history but also on exogenous covariates through a generalized linear model. The goal of the proposed procedure is to estimate not only the context of the process, that is, the history of the process that is relevant for predicting the next state, but also the coefficients corresponding to the significant exogenous variables. The proposed method is consistent in the sense that the probability that the estimated context and the coefficients are equal to the true data generating mechanism tends to 1 as the sample size increases. Simulations suggest that, when covariates do contribute to the transition probabilities, the proposed procedure can recover both the tree structure and the regression parameters. It outperforms variable length Markov chains when covariates are present while yielding comparable results when covariates are absent. For models with fixed length, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in recovering the true data generating mechanism is close to the methods available in the literature. The proposed methodology is used to predict the gains and losses of the Hang Seng index based on its own history and three large stock market indices.},

The existing literature considers a variety of models depending on whether all regression coefficients are allowed to change (pure structural change) or a subset of the coefficients is held fixed (partial structural change). We first show that the limit distributions of the test statistics in the latter case are not invariant to changes in the coefficients not being tested; in fact, they diverge as the sample size increases. To address this issue, we propose a simple two-step procedure to test for partial parameter stability. The first entails the application of a joint test of stability for all coefficients. Upon a rejection, the second conducts a stability test on the subset of coefficients of interest while allowing the other coefficients to change at the estimated breakpoints. Its limit distribution is standard chi-square. The relevant asymptotic theory is provided along with simulations that illustrate the usefulness of the procedure in finite samples. In an application to US money demand, we show how the proposed approach can be fruitfully employed to estimate the welfare cost of inflation.},

Our model builds on the Gaussian mixture transition distribution (MTD) model for continuous state spaces, extending component means with nonlinear functions that are modeled using Gaussian process (GP) priors. The resulting model flexibly captures nonlinear and heterogeneous lag dependence when several mixture components are active, identifies low-order nonlinear dependence while inferring relevant lags when few components are active, and averages over multiple and competing single-lag models to quantify/propagate uncertainty. Sparsity-inducing priors on the mixture weights aid in selecting a subset of active lags. The hierarchical model specification follows conventions for both GP regression and MTD models, admitting a convenient Gibbs sampling scheme for posterior inference. We demonstrate properties of the proposed model with two simulated and two real time series, emphasizing approximation of lag-dependent transition densities and model selection. In most cases, the model decisively recovers important features. The proposed model provides a simple, yet flexible framework that preserves useful and distinguishing characteristics of the MTD model class.},

Uhlig extended (UE) and beta-Bartlett (BB) processes are especially convenient for analyzing high-dimensional time series because they are conjugate with Wishart likelihoods. In this article, we show that UE and BB are closely related, but not equivalent: their hyperparameters can be matched so that they have the same forward-filtered posteriors and one-step ahead forecasts, but different joint (smoothed) posterior distributions. Under this circumstance, Bayes factors cannot discriminate the models and alternative approaches to model comparison are needed. We illustrate these issues in a retrospective analysis of volatilities of returns of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, we provide a backward sampling algorithm for the BB process, for which retrospective analysis had not been developed.},

We prove that parameter changes are estimated consistently by group lasso and show that the number of estimated breaks is greater than the true number but still sufficiently close to it. Then, we use these results and prove that the adaptive group lasso has oracle properties if weights are obtained from our first step estimation.

  abstract     = {Data consisting of time-indexed distributions of cross-sectional or intraday returns have been extensively studied in finance, and provide one example in which the data atoms consist of serially dependent probability distributions. Motivated by such data, we propose an autoregressive model for density time series by exploiting the tangent space structure on the space of distributions that is induced by the Wasserstein metric. The densities themselves are not assumed to have any specific parametric form, leading to flexible forecasting of future unobserved densities. The main estimation targets in the order- p Wasserstein autoregressive model are Wasserstein autocorrelations and the vector-valued autoregressive parameter. We propose suitable estimators and establish their asymptotic normality, which is verified in a simulation study. The new order- p Wasserstein autoregressive model leads to a prediction algorithm, which includes a data driven order selection procedure. Its performance is compared to existing prediction procedures via application to four financial return data sets, where a variety of metrics are used to quantify forecasting accuracy. For most metrics, the proposed model outperforms existing methods in two of the data sets, while the best empirical performance in the other two data sets is attained by existing methods based on functional transformations of the densities.},

  abstract     = {We propose an autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model with periodic time-varying parameters and multiplicative error form. We name this model periodic autoregressive conditional duration (PACD). First, we study the stability properties and the moment structures of it. Second, we estimate the model parameters, using (profile and two-stage) Gamma quasi-maximum likelihood estimates (QMLEs), the asymptotic properties of which are examined under general regularity conditions. Our estimation method encompasses the exponential QMLE, as a particular case. The proposed methodology is illustrated with simulated data and two empirical applications on forecasting Bitcoin trading volume and realized volatility. We found that the PACD produces better in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts than the standard ACD.},
