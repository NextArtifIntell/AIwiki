  abstract     = {Scene perception and trajectory forecasting are two fundamental challenges that are crucial to a safe and reliable autonomous driving (AD) system. However, most proposed methods aim at addressing one of the two challenges mentioned above with a single model. To tackle this dilemma, this paper proposes spatio-temporal semantics and interaction graph aggregation for multi-agent perception and trajectory forecasting (ST-SIGMA), an efficient end-to-end method to jointly and accurately perceive the AD environment and forecast the trajectories of the surrounding traffic agents within a unified framework. ST-SIGMA adopts a trident encoder–decoder architecture to learn scene semantics and agent interaction information on bird’s-eye view (BEV) maps simultaneously. Specifically, an iterative aggregation network is first employed as the scene semantic encoder (SSE) to learn diverse scene information. To preserve dynamic interactions of traffic agents, ST-SIGMA further exploits a spatio-temporal graph network as the graph interaction encoder. Meanwhile, a simple yet efficient feature fusion method to fuse semantic and interaction features into a unified feature space as the input to a novel hierarchical aggregation decoder for downstream prediction tasks is designed. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes data set have demonstrated that the proposed ST-SIGMA achieves significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of scene perception and trajectory forecasting, respectively. Therefore, the proposed approach outperforms SOTA in terms of model generalisation and robustness and is therefore more feasible for deployment in real-world AD scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Physiological studies have shown that rats in a dark environment rely on the limbs and vestibule for their self-motion information, which can maintain the specific firing patterns of grid cells and hippocampal CA3 place cells. In the development stage of rats, grid cells are considered to come from place cells, and place cells can be encoded by hippocampal theta cells. Based on these, the quadruped robot is used as a platform in this paper. Firstly, the sensing information of the robot&#39;s limbs and inertial measurement unit is obtained to solve its position in the environment. Then the position information is encoded by theta cells and mapped to place cells through a neural network. After obtaining the place cells with single-peak firing fields, Hebb learning is used to adjust the connection weight of the neural network between place cells and grid cells. In order to verify the model, 3-D simulation experiments are designed in this paper. The experiment results show that with the robot exploring in space, the spatial cells firing effects obtained by the model are consistent with the physiological research facts, which lay the foundation for the bionic environmental cognition model.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied successfully in many fields. However, these deep neural models are still considered as “black box” for most tasks. One of the fundamental issues underlying this problem is understanding which features are most influential in image recognition tasks and how CNNs process these features. It is widely believed that CNN models combine low-level features to form complex shapes until the object can be readily classified, however, several recent studies have argued that texture features are more important than other features. In this paper, we assume that the importance of certain features varies depending on specific tasks, that is, specific tasks exhibit feature bias. We designed two classification tasks based on human intuition to train deep neural models to identify the anticipated biases. We designed experiments comprising many tasks to test these biases in the Res Net and Dense Net models. From the results, we conclude that (1) the combined effect of certain features is typically far more influential than any single feature; (2) in different tasks, neural models can perform different biases, that is, we can design a specific task to make a neural model biased towards a specific anticipated feature.},

As an alternative, domain adaptation is proposed to train a deep-learning model for sequence labelling in a target domain by exploiting existing labelled training data in related source domains. To this end, the authors propose a Bi-LSTM model to extract more-related knowledge from multi-source domains and learn specific context from the target domain. Further, the language modelling training is also applied to cross-domain adaptability facilitating. The proposed model is extensively evaluated with the named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging tasks. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the cross-domain adaption. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods used in both cross-domain tasks and crowd annotation tasks.},

  abstract     = {A novel local binary pattern-based reversible data hiding (LBP-RDH) technique has been suggested to maintain a fair symmetry between the perceptual transparency and hiding capacity. During embedding, the image is divided into various 3×3 blocks. Then, using the LBP-based image descriptor, the LBP codes for each block are computed. Next, the obtained LBP codes are XORed with the embedding bits and are concealed in the respective blocks using the proposed pixel readjustment process. Further, each cover image (CI) pixel produces two different stego-image pixels. Likewise, during extraction, the CI pixels are restored without the loss of a single bit of information. The outcome of the proposed technique with respect to perceptual transparency measures, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index, is found to be superior to that of some of the recent and state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, the proposed technique has shown excellent resilience to various stego-attacks, such as pixel difference histogram as well as regular and singular analysis. Besides, the out-off boundary pixel problem, which endures in most of the contemporary data hiding techniques, has been successfully addressed.},

Specifically, we first extract a few keywords representing elements from the given image based on multi-label image classification. Then, these keywords are expanded to related ones with the planning-based model. Finally, we employ Dual-CharRNN to generate Chinese classical poetry in different contexts. A comprehensive evaluation of human judgements demonstrates that our model achieves promising performance and is effective in enhancing poetry&#39;s semantic consistency, readability, and aesthetics.

In this paper, a novel adaptive composite controller is designed to solve the LFC problem for the interconnected power system with electric vehicles and wind turbine. EVs are used as regulation resources to effectively compensate the power mismatch. First, the sliding mode controller is developed to reduce the random influences caused by the wind turbine generation system. Second, an auxiliary controller with reinforcement learning is proposed to produce adaptive control signals, which will be attached to the primary proportion-integration-differentiation control signal in a real-time manner. Finally, by considering random wind power, load disturbances and output constraints, the proposed scheme is verified on a two-area power system under four different cases. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive composite frequency control scheme has a competitive performance with regard to dynamic performance.},

Using computer vision technology to detect fractures can reduce the workload and misdiagnosis of fractures and also improve the fracture detection speed. However, there are still some problems in sternum fracture detection, such as the low detection rate of small and occult fractures. In this work, the authors have constructed a dataset with 1227 labelled X-ray images for sternum fracture detection. The authors designed a fully automatic fracture detection model based on a deep convolution neural network (CNN). The authors used cascade R-CNN, attention mechanism, and atrous convolution to optimise the detection of small fractures in a large X-ray image with big local variations. The authors compared the detection results of YOLOv5 model, cascade R-CNN and other state-of-the-art models. The authors found that the convolution neural network based on cascade and attention mechanism models has a better detection effect and arrives at an mAP of 0.71, which is much better than using the YOLOv5 model (mAP = 0.44) and cascade R-CNN (mAP = 0.55).},

The detection and control of such diseases based on patient demographic data are considered to be a major problem. The key issue in the solution to these problems is the development of methods and algorithms to forecast wellness and categorise patients according to their healthy and unhealthy states. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of machine learning approaches in the field of diagnosing COVID-19 has been conducted, and for the detection of chronic diseases in patients, to identify symptoms of COVID-19 virus infection in advance, and control the situation a healthcare system has been proposed. The constructed system provides real-time monitoring of chronic diseases and COVID-19 virus infection in patients. The proposed system consists of five layers: IoT sensor layer, Data transmission layer, Fog layer, Cloud layer, the Application layer. The system architecture in the Fog layer uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms to diagnose patients&#39; diseases, to generate and send diagnostic and emergency alerts to users. The classification module of the system&#39;s Fog layer categorises the patient&#39;s health status into healthy and unhealthy classes. In this module, to classify medical data the Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression algorithms are used. The COVID-19 dataset is used to test the effectiveness of the methods. The best results from the comparative analysis of the methods are obtained from the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms, which are recognised data points with high accuracy and on the accuracy metric reached 1.0, 0.99, 1.0 values, respectively. The classification of the other two SVM and Logistic Regression algorithms provided the worst results, and the accuracy score of both classifiers obtained a 0.89 value.},

  abstract     = {Many early Japanese books record a large amount of information, including historical politics, economics, culture, and so on, which are all valuable legacies. These books are waiting to be reorganized at the moment. However, a large amount of the books are described by Kuzushiji, a type of handwriting cursive script that is no longer in use today and only readable by a few experts. Therefore, researchers are trying to detect and recognise the characters from these books through modern techniques. Unfortunately, the characteristics of the Kuzushiji, such as Connect-Separate-characters and Many-variation, hinder the modern technique assisted re-organisation. Connect-Separate-characters refer to the case of some characters connecting each other or one character being separated into unconnected parts, which makes character detection hard. Many-variation is one of the typical characteristics of Kuzushiji, defined as the case that the same character has several variations even if they are written by the same person in the same book at the same time, which increases the difficulty of character recognition. In this sense, this paper aims to construct an early Japanese book reorganisation system by combining image processing and deep learning techniques. The experimentation has been done by testing two early Japanese books. In terms of character detection, the final Recall , Precision and F - value reaches 79.8%, 80.3%, and 80.0%, respectively. The deep learning based character recognition accuracy of Top 3 reaches 69.52%, and the highest recognition rate reaches 82.57%, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {Lower limb exoskeleton robots offer an effective treatment for patients with lower extremity dysfunction. In order to improve the rehabilitation training effect based on the human motion mechanism, this paper proposes a humanoid sliding mode neural network controller based on the human gait. A humanoid model is constructed based on the human mechanism, and the parameterised gait trajectory is used as target to design the humanoid control system for robots. Considering the imprecision of the robot dynamics model, the neural network is adopted to compensate for the uncertain part of the model and improve the model accuracy. Moreover, the sliding mode control in the system improves the response speed, tracking performance, and stability of the control system. The Lyapunov stability analysis proves the stability of the control system theoretically. Meanwhile, an evaluation method using the similarity function is improved based on joint angle, velocity, and acceleration to evaluate the comfort of humans in rehabilitation training more reasonably. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulations are carried out based on experimental data. The results show that the control system could accurately track the target trajectory, of which the robot is highly similar to the human.},

  abstract     = {The closed-loop wireless power transfer (WPT) system can realize constant voltage output in the presence of perturbation. However, the parameter design of the controller is a difficult problem. The traditional trial-and-error method is time-consuming and difficult to find optimal parameters. A parameter optimization strategy of control systems for uncertain WPT systems using the modified genetic algorithm (MGA) is proposed. Firstly, because the system has different characteristics at different periods, the simulation process is divided into three stages. The first one is the start-up stage, in which we mainly consider the overshoot and the rate of the voltage rise. The second one is the tracking stage, in which the tracking time and switching loss are mainly considered. The third one is the stabilisation stage, in which the steady-state error and switching loss are mainly considered. Secondly, three cost functions are designed according to the characteristics of the three stages, and then the optimal controller parameters of each stage are obtained by using MGA. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation. The optimization results show that compared with the previous parameter optimization method, the optimal controller parameters obtained by the proposed method make the WPT system achieve better performance.},

In this study, the one-dimensional ternary model which has been proved to be an effective statistical method in feature selection is introduced and shapelet transformation is proposed to calculate the parameter of one-dimensional ternary model that is usually selected by trial and error. Then XGBoost is used to recognise the faults from the obtained features, and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is introduced to optimise the parameters of XGBoost. Moreover, for improving the performance of intelligent algorithm, an improved strategy where the evolution is guided by the probability that the optimal solution appears in certain solution space is proposed. The experimental results based on the failure vibration signal samples show that the average accuracy of fault signal recognition can reach 97%, which is much higher than the ones corresponding to traditional extraction strategies. And with the help of improved ABC algorithm, the performance of XGBoost classifier could be optimised; the accuracy could be improved from 97.02% to 98.60% compared with the traditional classification strategy.},

Secondly, the inverse of the hysteresis model is obtained to produce a compensator for non-linear characteristics such as hysteresis and saturation. Thirdly, the parameters of the hysteresis model are obtained from each experiment under constant load and constant temperature, and the model validity is confirmed by comparing experimentally obtained results. Finally, the inverse model is applied to a part of feedforward hysteresis compensator. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model as hysteresis compensator, an electrical resistance control using feedback–feedforward control was conducted by numerical simulation.

Although there are some studies on cardinality estimation, the prediction results of existing cardinality estimators are inaccurate and the query efficiency cannot be guaranteed as well. In particular, they are difficult to accurately obtain the complex relationships between multiple tables in complex database systems. When dealing with complex queries, the existing cardinality estimators cannot achieve good results. In this study, a novel cardinality estimator is proposed. It uses the core techniques with the BiLSTM network structure and adds the attention mechanism. First, the columns involved in the query statements in the training set are sampled and compressed into bitmaps. Then, the Word2vec model is used to embed the word vectors about the query statements. Finally, the BiLSTM network and attention mechanism are employed to deal with word vectors. The proposed model takes into consideration not only the correlation between tables but also the processing of complex predicates. Extensive experiments and the evaluation of BiLSTM-Attention Cardinality Estimator (BACE) on the IMDB datasets are conducted. The results show that the deep learning model can significantly improve the quality of cardinality estimation, which is a vital role in query optimisation for complex databases.},

The knee X-ray images are first pre-processed with frequency-domain filtering and histogram normalisation, making the trabecular bone texture more obvious and benefiting the subsequent classification task. Then, a two-step classification strategy is proposed by extracting the joint centre based on the VGG network and classifying osteoarthritis grades based on the ResNet-50 network. In addition, a rebalance operation is proposed to deal with the dataset unbalance problem, and a quick search technique is proposed to improve the iterative search efficiency for the joint centre.

This augmentation is achieved based on individual columns, where separate algorithms are designed for continuous and discrete columns. Humans also use features of an object for interpretation. When humans make a judgement, they notice prominent features and characterise the perceived object. However, conventional Machine Learning classifiers are designed and trained on the basis of samples. Taking the features as the basis for classification, Feature Importance Classifier (FIC) has been attempted in this work. FIC treats every feature independent of each other, and ranks the features based on its dependence with the classified label. It has been found that the FIC has the highest accuracy and has improved the accuracy by 5.54% on average, when it&#39;s compared to other classifiers.

Then, the decomposed DP-RTF features from a series of temporal context frames are utilized to train a DNN model, which maps the DP-RTF features contaminated by noise and reverberation to the clean ones, and meanwhile provides a time-frequency (TF) weight to indicate the reliability of the mapping. The DP-RTF enhancement network can help to enhance the DP-RTF against noise and reverberation. Finally, the DOA of a sound source can be estimated by integrating the weighted matching between the enhanced DP-RTF features and the DP-RTF templates. Experimental results on simulated data show the superiority of the proposed DP-RTF enhancement network for estimating the DOA of the sound source in the environments with various levels of noise and reverberation.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are widely used in safety-critical missions, spanning across monitoring, surveillance, and search and rescue missions. In most cases, the human operator controls the ROV under stressful conditions and in harsh environments. The physical and mental states of the operator are vital as they may cause involuntary movements, issuing unintentional commands due to fatigue or stress. Consequently, a joint monitoring mechanism that will assess the operator&#39;s commands can be beneficial in preventing potentially catastrophic events, such as accidents. To this end, in this study, we propose a data collection framework for creating a fused dataset, consisting of data obtained from both the human operator and the ROV, and we integrate stress induction to stimulate stress and fatigue that may affect operators during missions. We optimise the dataset, which includes the operator&#39;s physiological signals and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data from the ROV, using data fusion approaches and feature extraction. We evaluate the dataset through the statistical analysis, illustrating a statistical difference between data characterising normal and involuntary commands. Finally, we evaluate the optimised and original datasets over a variety of classifiers, demonstrating an accuracy of 94% and 95%, respectively.},

Recently, many methods have been proposed to obtain the temporal locations of abnormal events under various determined thresholds. However, the specific categories of abnormal events are mostly neglect, which are important to help in monitoring agents to make decisions. In this study, a Temporal Attention Network (TANet) is proposed to capture both the specific categories and temporal locations of abnormal events in a weakly supervised manner. The TANet learns the anomaly score and specific category for each video segment with only video-level abnormal event labels. An event recognition module is exploited to predict the event scores for each video segment while a temporal attention module is proposed to learn a temporal attention value. Finally, to learn anomaly scores and specific categories, three constraints are considered: event category constraint, event separation constraint and temporal smoothness constraint. Experiments on the University of Central Florida Crime dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The convenience of availing quality services at affordable costs anytime and anywhere makes mobile technology very popular among users. Due to this popularity, there has been a huge rise in mobile data volume, applications, types of services, and number of customers. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the worldwide lockdown has added fuel to this increase as most of our professional and commercial activities are being done online from home. This massive increase in demand for multi-class services has posed numerous challenges to wireless network frameworks. The services offered through wireless networks are required to support this huge volume of data and multiple types of traffic, such as real-time live streaming of videos, audios, text, images etc., at a very high bit rate with a negligible delay in transmission and permissible vehicular speed of the customers. Next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs, i.e. 5G networks and beyond) are being developed to accommodate the service qualities mentioned above and many more. However, achieving all the desired service qualities to be incorporated into the design of the 5G network infrastructure imposes large challenges for designers and engineers. It requires the analysis of a huge volume of network data (structured and unstructured) received or collected from heterogeneous devices, applications, services, and customers and the effective and dynamic management of network parameters based on this analysis in real time. In the ever-increasing network heterogeneity and complexity, machine learning (ML) techniques may become an efficient tool for effectively managing these issues. In recent days, the progress of artificial intelligence and ML techniques has grown interest in their application in the networking domain. This study discusses current wireless network research, brief discussions on ML methods that can be effectively applied to the wireless networking domain, some tools available to support and customise efficient mobile system design, and some unresolved issues for future research directions.},

Faced with this problem, this paper presents a medical data publishing method based on sensitivity determination. To protect the sensitivity, the sensitivity of disease information is determined by semantics. To seek the trade-off between information utility and privacy security, the new method focusses on the protection of sensitive values with high sensitivity and assigns the highly sensitive disease information to groups as evenly as possible. The experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, of which the records include various attributes of patients. To measure sensitivity protection, the authors define a metric, which can evaluate the degree of sensitivity disclosure. Besides, additional information loss and discernability metrics are used to measure the availability of released tables. The experimental results indicate that the new method can provide better privacy than the traditional one while the information utility is guaranteed. Besides value protection, the proposed method can provide sensitivity protection and available releasing for medical data.},

Considering that when faced with large-scale sentiment analysis tasks, the high accuracy rate often requires long experimental time. In view of the weakness, a method that can greatly improve experimental efficiency with only small fluctuations in model accuracy is proposed, and singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to find the sparse feature of the image, which are sparse vectors with strong discriminativeness and effectively reduce redundant information; The authors propose the Fast Dictionary Learning algorithm (FDL), which can combine neural network with sparse representation. This method is based on K-Singular Value Decomposition, and through iteration, it can effectively reduce the calculation time and greatly improve the training efficiency in the case of small fluctuation of accuracy. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the FER2013 dataset. By adding singular value decomposition, the accuracy of the test suite increased by 0.53%, and the total experiment time was shortened by 8.2%; Fast Dictionary Learning shortened the total experiment time by 36.3%.},

Trust prediction with trust path search is widely used to help users find the trusted friends and obtain valid information. However, the shortcomings of accuracy and time still exist in some famous algorithms. Therefore, the dynamic bidirectional heuristic search (DBHS) algorithm is proposed in this paper to find the reliable trust path by studying the heuristic search. First, the trust value and path length are comprehensively considered to find the most trusted user. Specially, it constrains the traversal depth based on the ‘small world’ theory and obtains the acceptable path set by using the relaxation coefficient λ to relax the depth of the shortest path. By this way, some longer path with the higher trust can be considered to improve the precision of algorithm. Then, an adjustment factor is designed based on the meet in the middle (MM) algorithm to assign search weights to two directions based on the size of the search tree expanded, so as to improve the problem of no priori when fixed parameters are used. Besides, the complexity of unidirectional trust path search can also be reduced by searching from two directions, which can reduce the depth and improve the efficiency of search. Finally, the predictive trust degree is outputted by the trust propagation function. Two public datasets are used to generate experimental results, which show that DBHS can quickly search and form reliable trust relationship, and it partly improves other algorithms.},

In the consensus mechanism, a verifiable random function is used to screen the publishers of the unit; an SM2 threshold signature is used to sign the unit information to improve the non-repudiation of the traceability information uploaders to the unit information under the supervision of the witness. The improved consistency algorithm cancels the process of finding a stable main chain and makes relatively many nodes to participate in the consensus process.

The correct distinction of PD pulse and interference pulse has become a challenging task. Because of the noise and the low signal-to-noise ratio, the stable signals become non-stationary. The selection of a wavelet basis, the selection rule of threshold λ and the design of the threshold function are the key factors affecting the final denoising effect. Therefore, an enhanced ant colony optimisition wavelet (ACOW) algorithm was applied to find the global optimal threshold through the continuous derivative threshold function and the ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm. At the same time the efficiency of adaptive search calculation, was also significantly improved. The method of the ACOW algorithm was compared with the soft wavelet method, gradient-based wavelet method and the genetic optimisation wavelet (GOW) method. Using these four methods to denoise four typical signals, different mean square errors (MSE), magnitude errors (ME) and time costs were obtained. Interestingly, the results show that the ACOW method can achieve the minimum MSE and has less time cost. It generates significantly smaller waveform distortion than the other three threshold estimation methods. In addition, the high efficiency and good quality of the output signals are beneficial to the diagnosis of local discharge signals in intelligent substations.},

  abstract     = {Due to current technology enhancement, molecular databases have exponentially grown requesting faster efficient methods that can handle these amounts of huge data. Therefore, Multi-processing CPUs technology can be used including physical and logical processors (Hyper Threading) to significantly increase the performance of computations. Accordingly, sequence comparison and pairwise alignment were both found contributing significantly in calculating the resemblance between sequences for constructing optimal alignments. This research used the Hash Table-NGram-Hirschberg (HT-NGH) algorithm to represent this pairwise alignment utilizing hashing capabilities. The authors propose using parallel shared memory architecture via Hyper Threading to improve the performance of molecular dataset protein pairwise alignment.

  abstract     = {Sentence simplification is an essential task in natural language processing and aims to simplify complex sentences while retaining their primary meanings. To date, the main research works on sentence simplification models have been based on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models. However, these Seq2Seq models are incapable of analysing the hierarchical structure of sentences, which is of great significance for sentence simplification. The problem can be addressed with an ON-MULTI-STAGE model constructed based on the improved MULTI-STAGE encoder model. In this model, an ordered neurons network is introduced and can provide sentence-level structural information for the encoder and decoder. A weak attention connection method is then employed to make the decoder use the sentence-level structural details. Experimental results on two open data sets demonstrated that the constructed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models in sentence simplification.},

Microgrids provide further benefits, such as lowering transmission losses and the expenses associated with them. This research compares and contrasts the aims of economic dispatch, emission dispatch, fractional programing based combined economic emission dispatch, and environmental restricted economic dispatch (ECED). A low-voltage microgrid system is investigated for three different scenarios. As a study optimization tool, an innovative, resilient, and strong hybrid swarm-intelligence optimization algorithm is utilised, which is based on combining the properties of the traditional grey-wolf optimiser, sine-cosine algorithm, and crow search algorithm. The employment of a time-of-use energy market pricing approach instead of a fixed pricing plan resulted in a 15% decrease in generation costs throughout the course of the research. When ECED was assessed with a 15%–20% demand side management based restructured load demand model for the microgrid system, the generation costs were reduced even further.},

  abstract     = {With the development of high-performance computing, it is possible to solve large-scale computing problems. However, the irregularity and access characteristics of computing problems bring challenges to the realisation and performance optimisation. Improving the performance of a single core makes it challenging to maintain Moore&#39;s law, and multi-core processors emerge. A chip brings together multiple universal processor cores of equal status and has the same structure supported by an isomorphic multi-core processor. In high-performance computing, the granularity of computing tasks leads to the complexity of scheduling strategies. Satisfying high system performance, load balancing and processor fault tolerance at a minimum cost is the key to task scheduling in the high-performance field, especially in specific multi-core hardware architecture. In this study, global real-time task scheduling is implemented in a high-performance multi-core system. The system adopts the hybrid scheduling among clusters and the intelligent fitting within clusters to implement the global real-time task scheduling strategy. In the cluster scheduling policy, tasks are allowed to preempt the core with low priority, and the priority of tasks that access memory is dynamically improved, higher than that of all the tasks without memory access. An intelligent fitting method is also proposed. When the data read by the task is in the cache and the cache access ability value of the task is within a reasonable threshold, the priority of the task is promoted to the highest priority, preempting the core without the access memory task. The results show that the intelligently fitting global scheduling strategy for multi-core systems has better performance in the nuclear utilisation rate and task schedulability.},

This study proposes a novel architecture that models a hybrid representation to summarise semantic and structural information from both characters and words. This model can capture rich semantic features for the event detection task by incorporating the semantic representation generated from the dependency parser.

  abstract     = {In content-based image retrieval (CBIR), primitive image signatures are critical because they represent the visual characteristics. Image signatures, which are algorithmically descriptive and accurately recognized visual components, are used to appropriately index and retrieve comparable results. To differentiate an image in the category of qualifying contender, feature vectors must have image information&#39;s like colour, objects, shape, spatial viewpoints. Previous methods such as sketch-based image retrieval by salient contour (SBIR) and greedy learning of deep Boltzmann machine (GDBM) used spatial information to distinguish between image categories. This requires interest points and also feature analysis emerged image detection problems. Thus, a proposed model to overcome this issue and predict the repeating pattern as well as series of pixels that conclude similarity has been necessary. In this study, a technique called CBIR-similarity measure via artificial neural network interpolation (CBIR-SMANN) has been presented. By collecting datasets, the images are resized then subject to Gaussian filtering in the pre-processing stage, then by permitting them to the Hessian detector, the interesting points are gathered. Based on Skewness, mean, kurtosis and standard deviation features were extracted then given to ANN for interpolation. Interpolated results are stored in a database for retrieval. In the testing stage, the query image was inputted that is subjected to pre-processing, and feature extraction was then fed to the similarity measurement function. Thus, ANN helps to get similar images from the database. CBIR-SMANN have been implemented in the python tool and then evaluated for its performance. Results show that CBIR-SMANN exhibited a high recall value of 78% with a minimum retrieval time of 980 ms. This showed the supremacy of the proposed model was comparatively greater than the previous ones.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we examine the cross-view gait recognition problem. Many existing methods establish global feature representation based on the whole human body shape. However, they ignore some important details of different parts of the human body. In the latest literature, positioning partial regions to learn fine-grained features has been verified to be effective in human identification. But they only consider coarse fine-grained features and ignore the relationship between neighboring regions. Taken the above insights together, we propose a novel model called GaitGP, which learns both important details through fine-grained features and the relationship between neighboring regions through global features. Our GaitGP model mainly consists of the following two aspects. First, we propose a Channel-Attention Feature Extractor (CAFE) to extract the global features, which aggregates the channel-level attention to enhance the spatial information in a novel convolutional component. Second, we present the Global and Partial Feature Combiner (GPFC) to learn different fine-grained features, and combine them with the global features extracted by the CAFE to obtain the relevant information between neighboring regions. Experimental results on the CASIA gait recognition dataset B (CASIA-B), The OU-ISIR gait database, multi-view large population dataset, and The OU-ISIR gait database gait datasets show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art cross-view gait recognition methods.},

Further, the features are extracted for foreground information for disease identification by exploring the ResNet architecture.

However, most existing models have failed to differentiate high-frequency and low-frequency words. Accordingly, the sentiment information of low-frequency words is insufficiently captured, thus resulting in inaccurate sentiment word embedding and degradation of overall performance of sentiment analysis. A Bayesian estimation-based sentiment word embedding (BESWE) model, which aims to precisely extract the sentiment information of low-frequency words, has been proposed. In the model, a Bayesian estimator is constructed based on the co-occurrence probabilities and sentiment probabilities of words, and a novel loss function is defined for sentiment word embedding learning. The experimental results based on the sentiment lexicons and Movie Review dataset show that BESWE outperforms many state-of-the-art methods, for example, C&amp;W, CBOW, GloVe, SE-HyRank and DLJT1, in sentiment analysis tasks, which demonstrate that Bayesian estimation can effectively capture the sentiment information of low-frequency words and integrate the sentiment information into the word embedding through the loss function.

  abstract     = {Predicting the correct values of stock prices in fast fluctuating high-frequency financial data is always a challenging task. A deep learning-based model for live predictions of stock values is aimed to be developed here. The authors&#39; have proposed two models for different applications. The first one is based on Fast Recurrent Neural Networks (Fast RNNs). This model is used for stock price predictions for the first time in this work. The second model is a hybrid deep learning model developed by utilising the best features of FastRNNs, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory models to predict abrupt changes in the stock prices of a company. The 1-min time interval stock data of four companies for a period of one and three days is considered. Along with the lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the proposed models have low computational complexity as well, so that they can also be used for live predictions. The models&#39; performance is measured by the RMSE along with computation time. The model outperforms Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, FBProphet, LSTM, and other proposed hybrid models on both RMSE and computation time for live predictions of stock values.},

It not only has the characteristics of mahjong&#39;s conventional state space, huge hidden information, complicated rules, and large randomness of hand cards but also has special rules such as Change three, Hu must lack at least one suit , and Continue playing after Hu . These rules increase the difficulty of research. These special rules are used as the input of the deep learning DenseNet model. DenseNet is used to extract the Mahjong situation features. The learned features are used as the input of the classification algorithm XGBoost, and then the XGBoost algorithm is used to derive the card strategy. Experiments show that the fusion model of deep learning and XGBoost proposed in this paper has higher accuracy than the single model using only one of them in the case of high-dimensional sparse features. In the case of fewer training rounds, accuracy of the model can still reach 83%. In the games against real people, it plays like human.},

  abstract     = {Shoulder disarticulation amputees account for a small portion of upper-limb amputees, thus little emphasis has been devoted to developing functional prosthesis for this cohort of amputees. In this study, shoulder girdle recognition was investigated with acquired data from electrophysiological (electromyography [EMG]) and low frequency contraction (accelerometer [Acc]) signals from both amputee and non-amputee participants. The contribution of this study is based around the contrast of the classification accuracy (CA) for different sensor configurations using a unique set of signal features. It was seen that the fusion of the EMG-Acc produced an enhancement in the CA in the range of 10%–20%, depending on which windowing parameters were considered. From this, it was seen that the best combination of a windowing scheme and classifier would likely be for the 350 ms and spectral regression discriminant analysis, with a fusion of the EMG-Acc information. The results have thus provided evidence that the two sensors can be combined and used in practice for prosthesis control. Taking a holistic view on the study, the authors conclude by providing a framework on how the shoulder motion recognition could be combined with neuromuscular reprogramming to contribute towards easing the cognitive burden of amputees during the prosthesis control process.},

When it comes to the composite of quotient spaces, the idea of these operators shows greater advantages. Examples are cited to illustrate possible applications of these operators, and their matrix representations are also given to make the calculations easy.

  abstract     = {Data hiding technologies aim to hide the existence of secret information within digital covers such as images by causing unnoticeable degradation to their quality. Reducing the image distortion and increasing the embedding capacity are the main points that the data hiding techniques revolved around. This article proposes two high payload embedding methods with high stego image quality using the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) colour model. The first method is hue-based embedding (HBE) that employs the H plane for hiding one or two bits in non-grey pixels. The second method uses the three HSV components, so it is called three-planes embedding (TPE). In TPE, one bit is hidden in the least significant bit (LSB) of V of the grey pixels, one or two bits in H of the pixels having low saturation or low brightness and one bit in the LSB of S otherwise. The experiments were conducted on 25 images and the results show that HBE hides more data on average than TPE with its quality reaching 60 dB. TPE achieves quality up to 61 dB and capacity reaches 364 Kb. TPE scores the highest capacity among six state-of-the-art techniques in Red-Green-Blue, HSV, Hue-Saturation-Intensity and YCbCr spaces with the highest average peak signal to noise ratio midst five of them. By embedding 60, 90, and 120 Kb, this TPE attains the best average quality amid all the methods.},

  abstract     = {Current studies have shown that the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) is effective for skeleton-based action recognition. However, for the existing ST-GCN-based methods, their temporal kernel size is usually fixed over all layers, which makes them cannot fully exploit the temporal dependency between discontinuous frames and different sequence lengths. Besides, most of these methods use average pooling to obtain global graph feature from vertex features, resulting in losing much fine-grained information for action classification. To address these issues, in this work, the authors propose a novel spatial attentive and temporal dilated graph convolutional network (SATD-GCN). It contains two important components, that is, a spatial attention pooling module (SAP) and a temporal dilated graph convolution module (TDGC). Specifically, the SAP module can select the human body joints which are beneficial for action recognition by a self-attention mechanism and alleviates the influence of data redundancy and noise. The TDGC module can effectively extract the temporal features at different time scales, which is useful to improve the temporal perception field and enhance the robustness of the model to different motion speed and sequence length. Importantly, both the SAP module and the TDGC module can be easily integrated into the ST-GCN-based models, and significantly improve their performance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmark datasets, that is, NTU-RGB + D and Kinetics-Skeleton, demonstrate that the authors’ method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for skeleton-based action recognition.},

  abstract     = {The study of training hyperparameters optimisation problems remains underexplored in skin lesion research. This is the first report of using hierarchical optimisation to improve computational effort in a four-dimensional search space for the problem. The authors explore training parameters selection in optimising the learning process of a model to differentiate pigmented lesions characteristics. In the authors&#39; demonstration, pretrained GoogleNet is fine-tuned with a full training set by varying hyperparameters, namely epoch, mini-batch value, initial learning rate, and gradient threshold. The iterative search of the optimal global-local solution is by using the derivative-based method. The authors used non-parametric one-way ANOVA to test whether the classification accuracies differed for the variation in the training parameters. The authors identified the mini-batch size and initial learning rate as parameters that significantly influence the model&#39;s learning capability. The authors&#39; results showed that a small fraction of combinations (5%) from constrained global search space, in contrarily to 82% at the local level, can converge with early stopping conditions. The mean (standard deviation, SD) validation accuracies increased from 78.4 (4.44)% to 82.9 (1.8)% using the authors&#39; system. The fine-tuned model&#39;s performance measures evaluated on a testing dataset showed classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 85.3%, 75.6%, 64.4%, and 97.2%, respectively. The authors&#39; system achieves an overall better diagnosis performance than four state-of-the-art approaches via an improved search of parameters for a good adaptation of the model to the authors&#39; dataset. The extended experiments also showed its superior performance consistency across different deep networks, where the overall classification accuracy increased by 5% with this technique. This approach reduces the risk of search being trapped in a suboptimal solution, and its use may be expanded to network architecture optimisation for enhanced diagnostic performance.},

  abstract     = {Various time-frequency (T-F) masks are being applied to sound source localization tasks. Moreover, deep learning has dramatically advanced T-F mask estimation. However, existing masks are usually designed for speech separation tasks and are suitable only for single-channel signals. A novel complex-valued T-F mask is proposed that reserves the head-related transfer function (HRTF), customized for binaural sound source localization. In addition, because the convolutional neural network that is exploited to estimate the proposed mask takes binaural spectral information as the input and output, accurate binaural cues can be preserved. Compared with conventional T-F masks that emphasize single speech source–dominated T-F units, HRTF-reserved masks eliminate the speech component while keeping the direct propagation path. Thus, the estimated HRTF is capable of extracting more reliable localization features for the final direction of arrival estimation. Hence, binaural sound source localization guided by the proposed T-F mask is robust under noisy and reverberant acoustic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the new T-F mask is superior to conventional T-F masks and lead to the better performance of sound source localization in adverse environments.},

Applications of deep learning models to the electric load forecasting problem are gaining interest among researchers as well as the industry, but a comprehensive and sound comparison among different—also traditional—architectures is not yet available in the literature. This work aims at filling the gap by reviewing and experimentally evaluating four real world datasets on the most recent trends in electric load forecasting, by contrasting deep learning architectures on short-term forecast (one-day-ahead prediction).
