  abstract     = {Inducing new phases of transition metal dichalcogenides by controlling the d-electron-count has attracted much interest due to their novel structures and physicochemical properties. 1T’’ ReSe 2 is a promising candidate for sodium storage, but the low electronic conductivity and limited active sites hinder its electrochemical capacity. Herein, new-phase 1T’ Re 0.75 V 0.25 Se 2 crystals (P 2/m ) with zig-zag chains are successfully synthesized. The 1T’’-1T’ phase transition results from the electronic reorganization of 5d orbitals via electron extraction after V-atom doping. The electrical conductivity of 1T’ Re 0.75 V 0.25 Se 2 is 2.7 × 10 5 times higher than that of 1T’’ ReSe 2 . Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that 1T’ Re 0.75 V 0.25 Se 2 has a larger interlayer spacing, lower bonding energy, and migration energy barrier for Na + ions than 1T’’ ReSe 2 . As a result, 1T’ Re 0.75 V 0.25 Se 2 electrode shows an excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g −1 at 50 C with no capacity fading over 5000 cycles for sodium storage, which is superior to most reported sodium-ion anode materials. This 1T’ Re 0.75 V 0.25 Se 2 provides a new platform for various applications such as electronics, catalysis, and energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the construction of amorphous/crystalline (A/C) heterophase has become an advanced strategy to modulate electronic and/or ionic behaviors and promote structural stability due to their concerted advantages. However, their different kinetics limit the synergistic effect. Further, their interaction functions and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, a unique engineered defect-rich V 2 O 3 heterophase structure (donated as A/C-V 2 O 3− x @C-HMCS) composed of mesoporous oxygen-deficient amorphous − hollow core (A-V 2 O 3− x /HMC) and lattice-distorted crystalline shell (C-V 2 O 3 /S) encapsulated by carbon is rationally designed via a facile approach. Comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that the lattice distortion enlarges the porous channels for Na + diffusion in the crystalline phase, thereby optimizing its kinetics to be compatible with the oxygen-vacancy-rich amorphous phase. This significantly reduces the high contrast of the kinetic properties between the crystalline and amorphous phases in A/C-V 2 O 3− x @C-HMCS and induces the formation of highly dense A/C interfaces with a strong synergistic effect. As a result, the dense heterointerface effectively optimizes the Na + adsorption energy and lowers the diffusion barrier, thus accelerating the overall kinetics of A/C-V 2 O 3− x @C-HMCS. In contrast, the perfect heterophase (defects-free) A/C-V 2 O 3 @C-HCS demonstrates sparse A/C interfacial sites with limited synergistic effect and sluggish kinetics. As expected, the A/C-V 2 O 3− x @C-HMCS achieves a high rate and ultrastable performance (192 mAh g −1 over 6000 cycles at 10 A g −1 ) when employed for the first time as a cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). This work provides general guidance for realizing dense heterophase cathode design for high-performance SIBs and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Vacancy dynamics of high-density 2D colloidal crystals with a polydispersity in particle size are studied experimentally. Heterogeneity in vacancy dynamics is observed. Inert vacancies that hardly hop to other lattice sites and active vacancies that hop frequently between different lattice sites are found within the same samples. The vacancies show high probabilities of first hopping from one lattice site to another neighboring lattice site, then staying at the new site for some time, and later hopping back to the original site in the next hop. This back-returning hop probability increases monotonically with the increase in packing fraction, up to 83%. This memory effect makes the active vacancies diffuse sluggishly or even get trapped in local regions. Strain-induced vacancy motion on a distorted lattice is also observed. New glassy properties in the disordered crystals are discovered, including the dynamical heterogeneity, the presence of cooperative rearranging regions, memory effect, etc. Similarities between the colloidal disordered crystals and the high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are also discussed. Molecular dynamics simulations further support the experimental observations. These results help to understand the microscopic origin of the sluggish dynamics in materials with ordered structures but in random energy landscapes, such as high-entropy alloys.},

Here heterogenous multiphase conductor with cocontinuous morphology and macroscale phase separation for ultrafast universally autonomous self-healing with full recovery of pristine tensile and electrical properties in less than 120 and 900 s, respectively, is reported. The multiphase conductor is insensitive to flaws under stretching and achieves a synergistic combination of conductivity up to ≈1.5 S cm −1 , stress at break ≈4 MPa, toughness up to &gt;81 MJ m −3 , and elastic recovery exceeding 2000% strain. Such properties are difficult to achieve simultaneously with any other type of material so far.

Here, a mechanochromic liquid crystalline elastomer with force-induced synergetic pigmentary and structural color change, whose mechanosensitivity is enhanced by the stress-concentration induced by the doped nanoparticle, is presented.

Herein, a hollow N-doped carbon confined single-atom Rh (Rh-SACs/HNCR) is developed via a coordination-template method. Both aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping confirm the uniform distribution of Rh single atoms. Owning to the unique hollow structure and effective carbon confinement, excessive conversion from pyridinic/pyrrolic N to graphic N is hindered. As a proof of concept, Rh-SACs/HNCR exhibits superior activity, stability, selectivity, and anti-poisoning capability in formic acid oxidation reaction compared with the counterpart Rh/C, Pd/C, and Pt/C catalysts. This work provides a powerful strategy for synthesizing hollow carbon confined single-atom catalysts apply in various energy-related systems.},

The hydrophobic CGAs show high solvent absorption capacity of 186–519 times its own weight. Moreover, both the compression and combustion methods can be adopted for reusing the CGAs. In particular, it is demonstrated a design of 3D assembled hydrophilic CGA equipped with salt collection system for continuous solar desalination. Due to energy recovery and brine transport management promoted by this design, the 3D assembled CGA system exhibits an extremely high evaporation rate of 4.11 kg m −2 h −1 and excellent salt-resistant property without salt precipitation even in 20 wt% brine for continuous 36 h illumination (1 kW m −2 ), which is the best reported result from the solar desalination devices.

Here, this work reports solvothermally synthesized photoactivatable Pt(IV)-coordinated carbon dots (Pt-CDs) and their bovine serum albumin (BSA) complex (Pt-CDs@BSA) as a novel orange light-triggered anti-tumor therapeutic agent. The homogeneously distributed Pt(IV) in the Pt-CDs (Pt: 17.2 wt%) and their carbon cores with significant visible absorption exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties, which not only efficiently releases cytotoxic Pt(II) species but also promotes hydroxy radical generation from water under orange light. When triggered with a 589 nm laser, Pt-CDs@BSA possesses the ultrastrong cancer cell killing capacities of intracellular Pt(II) species release, hydroxyl radical generation, and acidification, which induce powerful immunogenic cell death. Activation of Pt-CDs@BSA by a single treatment with a 589 nm laser effectively eliminated the primary tumor and inhibited distant tumor growth and lung metastasis. This study thus presents a new concept for building photoactivatable Pt(IV)-enriched nanodrug-based CDs for precision cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Epitranscriptomic remodeling such as N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification plays a critical role in tumor development. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms connecting m 6 A modification and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) progression. Here, CBX1 is identified, a histone methylation regulator, to be significantly upregulated with m 6 A hypomethylation in metastatic NPC tissues. The m 6 A-modified CBX1 mRNA transcript is recognized and destabilized by the m 6 A reader YTHDF3. Furthermore, it is revealed that CBX1 promotes NPC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation through transcriptional repression of MAP7 via H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation. In addition to its oncogenic effect, CBX1 can facilitate immune evasion through IFN- γ -STAT1 signaling-mediated PD-L1 upregulation. Clinically, CBX1 serves as an independent predictor for unfavorable prognosis in NPC patients. The results reveal a crosstalk between epitranscriptomic and epigenetic regulation in NPC progression, and shed light on the functions of CBX1 in tumorigenesis and immunomodulation, which may provide an appealing therapeutic target in NPC.},

In this study, the hierarchical tube is constructed by iron-hexaazatrinaphthalene tricarboxylic acid coordination polymer (Fe-HATNTA), using HATNTA as the self-engaged template to coordinate with Fe 2+ ions. This Fe-HATNTA tube with hierarchical porous structure ensures the sufficient contact between electrolyte and active materials, shortens the diffusion distance, and provides more favorable transport pathways for ions. When employed as the cathode for rechargeable Li-ion batteries, Fe-HATNTA delivers a high specific capacity (244 mAh g −1 at 50 mA g −1 , 91% of theoretical capacity), excellent rate capability (128 mAh g −1 at 9 A g −1 ), and a long-term cycle life (73.9% retention over 3000 cycles at 5 A g −1 ). Moreover, the Li + ions storage and conduction mechanisms are further disclosed by the ex situ and in situ characterizations, kinetic analyses, and theoretical calculations.

  abstract     = {Despite the desirability of organic isomer recognition and separation, current strategies are expensive and complicated. Here, a simple strategy for simultaneously recognizing and separating organic isomers using pillararene-based charge-transfer cocrystals through the cooperative control of pore-inside and pore-outside intermolecular interactions is presented. This strategy is illustrated using 1-bromobutane (1-BBU), which is often produced as an isomeric mixture with 2-bromobutane (2-BBU). According to its structure, perethylated pillar[5]arene (EtP5) and 3,5-dinitrobenzonitrile (DNB) are strategically chosen as a donor and an acceptor. As a result, their cocrystal exhibited stronger pore-inside interactions and much weaker pore-outside interactions with 1-BBU than with 2-BBU. Consequently, nearly 100% 1-BBU selectivity is achieved in two-component mixtures, even in those containing trace 1-BBU (1%), whereas free EtP5 only achieved 89.80% selectivity. The preference for linear bromoalkanes is retained in 1-bromopentane/3-bromopentane and 1-bromohexane/2-bromohexane mixtures, demonstrating the generality of this strategy. Selective adsorption of linear bromoalkanes induced a naked-eye-detectable color change from red to white. Moreover, the cocrystal are used over multiple cycles without losing selectivity.},

Here, an interfacial engineering strategy that is capable of simultaneously regulating nanoscale structure, electronic structure, and interfacial structure of Mo 2 N quantum dots decorated on conductive N-doped graphene via codoping single-atom Al and O (denoted as AlO@Mo 2 N-NrGO) is reported. The conversion of Anderson polyoxometalates anion cluster ([AlMo 6 O 24 H 6 ] 3− , denoted as AlMo6) to Mo 2 N quantum dots not only result in the generation of more exposed active sites but also in situ codoping atomically dispersed Al and O, that can fine-tune the electronic structure of Mo 2 N. It is also identified that the surface reconstruction of Al  OH hydrates in AlO@Mo 2 N quantum dots plays an essential role in enhancing hydrophilicity and lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and hydrogen desorption, resulting in a remarkable alkaline HER performance, even better than the commercial 20% Pt/C. Moreover, the strong interfacial interaction (Mo  N bonds) between AlO@Mo 2 N and N-doped graphene can significantly improve electron transfer efficiency and interfacial stability. As a result, outstanding stability over 300 h at a current density higher than 100 mA cm −2 is achieved, demonstrating great potential for the practical application of this catalyst.},

The water-free DES electrolyte allows a closed-cell configuration for the ZBB owing to the prevention of Br 2 evaporation and H 2 evolution. It is found that the Cl − anion changes the structure of the zinc-halide complex anions and demonstrated that it improves the ion mobility and electrode reaction kinetics. The DES electrolyte with the optimized ZnCl 2 composition shows much higher rate capability and a cycle life 90 times longer than that of a ZnCl 2 -free DES electrolyte.

However, the development of the easy upscalable and template-free synthesis methods to obtain such colloids lack in understanding of molecular interactions that occur in the formation mechanisms of polymer colloids. Herein, a computer simulation-driven experimental synthesis approach based on the supramolecular self-assembly followed by polymerization of tailored pyrazole-modified monomers is developed. Simulations for a series of pyrazole-modified monomers with different numbers of pyrazole groups, different length and polarity of spacers between pyrazole groups and the polymerizable group are first performed. Based on simulations, monomers able to undergo π – π stacking and guide the formation of supramolecular bonds between polymer segments are synthesized and these are used in precipitation polymerization to synthesize anisotropic microgels. This study demonstrates that microgel morphologies can be tuned from spherical, raspberry-like to dumbbell-like by the increase of the pyrazole-modified monomer loading, which is concentrated at periphery of growing microgels. Combining experimental and simulation results, this work provides a quantitative and predictive approach for guiding microgel design that can be further extended to a diversity of colloidal systems and soft materials with superior properties.},

In this study, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from seven centenarians (CEN), six centenarians’ offspring (CO), and nine offspring spouses or neighbors (Control, age-matched to CO) are performed to investigate the shared immune features between CEN and CO. The results indicate that among all 12 T cell clusters, the cytotoxic-phenotype-clusters (CPC) and the naïve-phenotype-clusters (NPC) significantly change between CEN and ontrol. Compared to Control, both CEN and CO are characterized by depleted NPC and increased CPC, which is dominated by CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, CPC from CEN and CO share enhanced signaling pathways and transcriptional factors associated with immune response, and possesse similar T-cell-receptor features, such as high clonal expansion. Interestingly, rather than a significant increase in GZMK + CD8 cells during aging, centenarians show accumulation of GZMB + and CMC1 + CD8 T cells. Collectively, this study unveils an immune remodeling pattern reflected by both quantitative increase and functional reinforcement of cytotoxic T cells which are essential for healthy aging.},

Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive candidate materials for efficient, solution-processed solar cells, potentially realizing the broad-spectrum light utilization and multi-exciton generation effect for the future efficiency breakthrough of solar cells. The emerging quantum junction solar cells (QJSCs), constructed by n- and p-type CQDs only, open novel avenue for all-quantum-dot photovoltaics with a simplified device configuration and convenient processing technology. However, the development of high-efficiency QJSCs still faces the challenge of back carrier diffusion induced by the huge carrier density drop at the interface of CQDs and conductive glass substrate. Herein, an ultra-thin atomic layer deposited tin oxide (SnO x ) layer is employed to buffer this carrier density drop, significantly reducing the interfacial recombination and capacitance caused by the back carrier diffusion. The SnO x -modified QJSC achieves a record-high efficiency of 11.55% and a suppressed hysteresis factor of 0.04 in contrast with reference QJSC with an efficiency of 10.4% and hysteresis factor of 0.48.

  abstract     = {Liquid metal catalysts have recently attracted attention for synthesizing high-quality 2D materials facilitated via the catalysts’ perfectly smooth surface. However, the microscopic catalytic processes occurring at the surface are still largely unclear because liquid metals escape the accessibility of traditional experimental and computational surface science approaches. Hence, numerous controversies are found regarding different applications, with graphene (Gr) growth on liquid copper (Cu) as a prominent prototype. In this work, novel in situ and in silico techniques are employed to achieve an atomic-level characterization of the graphene adsorption height above liquid Cu, reaching quantitative agreement within 0.1 Å between experiment and theory. The results are obtained via in situ synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements over wide-range q-vectors and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on efficient machine-learning (ML) potentials trained to first-principles density functional theory (DFT) data. The computational insight is demonstrated to be robust against inherent DFT errors and reveals the nature of graphene binding to be highly comparable at liquid Cu and solid Cu(111). Transporting the predictive first-principles quality via ML potentials to the scales required for liquid metal catalysis thus provides a powerful approach to reach microscopic understanding, analogous to the established computational approaches for catalysis at solid surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Despite the interest toward the terahertz (THz) rapidly increasing, the high-efficient detection of THz photon is not widely available due to the low photoelectric conversion efficiency at this low-energy photon regime. Excitonic insulator (EI) states in emerging materials with anomalous optical transitions and renormalized valence band dispersions render their nontrivial photoresponse, which offers the prospect of harnessing the novel EI properties for the THz detection. Here, an EI-based photodetector is developed for efficient photoelectric conversion in the THz band. High-quality EI material Ta 2 NiSe 5 is synthesized and the existence of the EI state at room temperature is confirmed. The THz scanning near-field optical microscopy experimentally reveals the strong light–matter interaction in the THz band of EI state in the Ta 2 NiSe 5 . Benefiting from the strong light–matter interaction, the Ta 2 NiSe 5 -based photodetectors exhibit superior THz detection performances with a detection sensitivity of ≈42 pW Hz −1/2 and a response time of ≈1.1 µs at 0.1 THz at room temperature. This study provides a new avenue for realizing novel high-performance THz photodetectors by exploiting the emerging EI materials.},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) provides a fascinating chance to facilitate a sustainable water supply, which obtains considerable attention recently. However, ignoring the energy efficiency of AWH leads to high energy consumption in current prototypes (ca. 10 1 to 10 2 MJ kg −1 ), misfitting with the high-strung and complicated water-energy nexus. In this perspective, a robust evaluation of existing AWHs is conducted and a detailed way to high-efficiency AWH is paved. The results suggest that using cooling-assisted adsorption will weaken the bounds of climate to sorbent selections and have the potential to improve efficiency by more than 50%. For device design, the authors deeply elucidate how to perfect heat/mass transfer to narrow the gap between lab and practices. Reducing heat loss, recovering heat and structured sorbent are the main paths to improve efficiency on the device scale, which is more significant for a large-scale AWH. Besides efficiency, the techno-economic evaluation reveals that developing a cost-effective AWH is also crucial for sustainability, which can be contributed by green synthesis routes and biomass-based sorbents. These analyses provide a uniform platform to guide the next-generation AWH to mitigate the global water crisis.},

  abstract     = {Doping of all-inorganic lead halide perovskites to enhance their photovoltaic performance and stability has been reported to be effective. Up to now most studies have focused on the doping of elements in to the perovskite lattice. However, most of them cannot be doped into the perovskite lattice and the roles of these dopants are still controversial. Herein,the authors introduce CdI 2 as an additive into CsPbI 3− x Br x and use it as active layer to fabricate high-performance inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Cd with a smaller radius than Pb can partially substitute Pb in the perovskite lattice by up to 2 mol%. Meanwhile, the remaining Cd stays on the surface and grain boundaries (GB) of the perovskite film in the form of Cs 2 CdI 4− x Br − x , which is found to reduce non-radiative recombination. These effects result in prolonged charge carrier lifetime, suppressed defect formation, decreased GBs, and an upward shift of energybands in the Cd-containing film. A champion efficiency of 20.8% is achieved for Cd-incorporated PSCs, together with improved device ambient stability. This work highlights the importance of simultaneous lattice engineering, defectcontrol and atomic-level characterization in achieving high-performance inorganic PSCs with well-defined structure-property relationships.},

  abstract     = {There is an ever-increasing demand for next-generation devices that do not require passwords and are impervious to cloning. For traditional hardware security solutions in edge computing devices, inherent limitations are addressed by physical unclonable functions (PUF). However, realizing efficient roots of trust for resource constrained hardware remains extremely challenging, despite excellent demonstrations with conventional silicon circuits and archetypal oxide memristor-based crossbars. An attractive, down-scalable approach to design efficient cryptographic hardware is to harness memristive materials with a large-degree-of-randomness in materials state variations, but this strategy is still not well understood. Here, the utilization of high-degree-of-randomness amorphous (A) state variations associated with different operating conditions via thermal fluctuation effects is demonstrated, as well as an integrated framework for in memory computing and next generation security primitives, viz., APUF, for achieving secure key generation and device authentication. Near ideal uniformity and uniqueness without additional initial writing overheads in weak memristive A-PUF is achieved. In-memory computing empowers a strong exclusive OR (XOR-) and-repeat A PUF construction to avoid machine learning attacks, while rapid crystallization processes enable large-sized-key reconfigurability. These findings pave the way for achieving a broadly applicable security primitive for enhancing antipiracy of integrated systems and product authentication in supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) saves lives, but iron overload limits survival of chronically transfused patients. Quality control methods, which involve entering pRBC units and removing them from the blood supply, reveal that hemoglobin (38.5–79.9 g) and heme iron (133.42–276.89 mg) vary substantially between pRBCs. Yet, neither hemoglobin nor iron content can be quantified for individual clinically used pRBCs leading to rules of thumb for pRBC transfusions. Keeping their integrity, the authors seek to predict hemoglobin/iron content of any given pRBC unit applying eight machine learning models on 6,058 pRBCs. Based on thirteen features routinely collected during blood donation, production and quality control testing, the model with best trade-off between performance and complexity in hemoglobin/iron content prediction is identified. Validation of this model in an independent cohort of 2637 pRBCs confirms an adjusted R 2 &gt; 0.9 corresponding to a mean absolute prediction error of ≤1.43 g hemoglobin/4.96 mg iron (associated standard deviation: ≤1.13 g hemoglobin/3.92 mg iron). Such unprecedented precise prediction enables reliable pRBC dosing per pharmaceutically active agent, and monitoring iron uptake in patients and individual iron loss in donors.

This conformal interface modulation demonstrates that not only can effectively stabilize FACs-based perovskite films by inhibiting the lateral and vertical iodide diffusions in devices or modules, ensuring an excellent operation and environmental stability, but also provides an excellent charge transporting channel through the well-designed 1D crystal structure. Consequently, efficient device performance with power conversion efficiency up to 24.3% is readily achieved. And the large-area perovskite solar modules with high efficiency (19.6% for the active areas of 18 cm 2 ) and long-term stability (about 500 h in AM 1.5G illumination or about 1000 h under double-85 conditions) are also successfully verified.},

Perovskite/electrode contacts are crucial for constructing high-performance charge-transporting-layer-free perovskite devices, such as solar cells, field-effect transistors, artificial synapses, memories, etc. Many studies have evidenced that the perovskite layer can directly contact the electrodes, showing abundant physicochemical, electronic, and photoelectric properties in charge-transporting-layer-free perovskite devices. Meanwhile, for perovskite/metal contacts, some critical interfacial physical and chemical processes are reported, including band bending, interface dipoles, metal halogenation, and perovskite decomposition induced by metal electrodes. Thus, a systematic summary of the role of metal halide perovskite/electrode contacts on device performance is essential. This review summarizes and discusses charge carrier dynamics, electronic band engineering, electrode corrosion, electrochemical metallization and dissolution, perovskite decomposition, and interface engineering in perovskite/electrode contacts-based electronic devices for a comprehensive understanding of the contacts. The physicochemical, electronic, and morphological properties of various perovskite/electrode contacts, as well as relevant engineering techniques, are presented. Finally, the current challenges are analyzed, and appropriate recommendations are put forward. It can be expected that further research will lead to significant breakthroughs in their application and promote reforms and innovations in future solid-state physics and materials science.},

Herein, a novel paradigm based on the combination of electronic structure engineering and surface morphology tuning of earth-abundant 3D-hierarchical binder-free electrocatalysts is demonstrated, via a scalable single-step thermal transformation of nickel substrates under sulfur environment. A temporal-evolution of the resulting 3D-nanostructured substrates is performed for the intentional enhancement of non-abundant highly-catalytic Ni 3+ and p S n 2− species on the catalyst surface, concomitantly accompanied with densification of the hierarchical catalyst morphology. Remarkably, the finely engineered NiS x catalyst synthesized via thermal-evolution for 24 h (NiS x -24 h) exhibits an exceptionally low cell voltage of 1.59 V (lower than Pt/C-IrO 2 catalytic couple) for neutral water splitting, which represents the lowest value ever reported. The enhanced performance of NiS x -24 h is a multi-synergized consequence of the simultaneous enrichment of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction catalyzing species, accompanied by an optimum electrocatalytic surface area and intrinsic high conductivity. Overall, this innovative work opens a route to engineering the active material&#39;s electronic structure/morphology, demonstrating novel Ni 3+ / p S n 2− -enriched NiS x catalysts which surpass state-of-the-art materials for neutral water splitting.},

The irregular pores are formed via keyhole collapse, pore coalescence, and then pore entrapment by the solidification front. The mixing of the fast-moving vapor plume and molten pool induces a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability at the melt track surface, forming humps.

Low stability at high temperatures, swelling in organic contaminants, and poor selectivity are the fundamental issues associated with polymeric membranes restricting their scalable viability. Polymer-metal-carbides and nitrides (MXenes) hybrid membranes possess remarkable physicochemical attributes, including strong mechanical endurance, high mechanical flexibility, superior adsorptive behavior, and selective permeability, due to multi-interactions between polymers and MXene&#39;s surface functionalities.

Furthermore, the review highlights the associated bottlenecks of MXene–Polymer hybrid-membranes and its possible alternate solutions to meet industrial requirements.

  abstract     = {When a thermoelectric (TE) material is deposited with a secondary TE material, the total Seebeck coefficient of the stacked layer is generally represented by a parallel conductor model. Accordingly, when TE material layers of the same thickness are stacked vertically, the total Seebeck coefficient in the transverse direction may change in a single layer. Here, an abnormal Seebeck effect in a stacked two-dimensional (2D) PtSe 2 /PtSe 2 homostructure film, i.e., an extra in-plane Seebeck voltage is produced by wet-transfer stacking at the interface between the PtSe 2 layers under a transverse temperature gradient is reported. This abnormal Seebeck effect is referred to as the interfacial Seebeck effect in stacked PtSe 2 /PtSe 2 homostructures. This effect is attributed to the carrier-interface interaction, and has independent characteristics in relation to carrier concentration. It is confirmed that the in-plane Seebeck coefficient increases as the number of stacked PtSe 2 layers increase and observed a high Seebeck coefficient exceeding ≈188 µV K −1 at 300 K in a four-layer-stacked PtSe 2 /PtSe 2 homostructure.},

  abstract     = {Physics-driven discovery in an autonomous experiment has emerged as a dream application of machine learning in physical sciences. Here, this work develops and experimentally implements a deep kernel learning (DKL) workflow combining the correlative prediction of the target functional response and its uncertainty from the structure, and physics-based selection of acquisition function, which autonomously guides the navigation of the image space. Compared to classical Bayesian optimization (BO) methods, this approach allows to capture the complex spatial features present in the images of realistic materials, and dynamically learn structure–property relationships. In combination with the flexible scalarizer function that allows to ascribe the degree of physical interest to predicted spectra, this enables physical discovery in automated experiment. Here, this approach is illustrated for nanoplasmonic studies of nanoparticles and experimentally implemented in a truly autonomous fashion for bulk- and edge plasmon discovery in MnPS 3 , a lesser-known beam-sensitive layered 2D material. This approach is universal, can be directly used as-is with any specimen, and is expected to be applicable to any probe-based microscopic techniques including other STEM modalities, scanning probe microscopies, chemical, and optical imaging.},

Herein, the use of Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) is proposed as a microscale model capable of curvilinear locomotion with mechanosensing, controlled by magnetically reconfigured 3D microtopography. Static entropic microbarriers prevent C. elegans from randomly swimming with the omega turns and provide linear translational locomotion with velocity of ≈0.14 BL s −1 . This velocity varies from ≈0.09 (for circumventing movement) to ≈0.46 (for climbing) BL s −1 , depending on magnetic bending and twisting actuation coupled with assembly of microbarriers. Furthermore, different types of neuronal mutants prevent C. elegans from implementing certain locomotion modes, indicating the potential for investigating the correlation between neurons and mechanosensing functions. This strategy promotes a platform for the contactless manipulation of miniaturized biobots and initiates interdisciplinary research for investigating sensory neurons and human diseases.},

  abstract     = {Chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for the clinical treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancers. However, the combination of ion radiation with free chemotherapeutics yields unsatisfactory therapeutic output and severe side effects due to the nonspecific biodistribution of the anticancer drugs. Herein, a self-cooperative prodrug nanovesicle is reported for highly tumor-specific chemoradiotherapy. The nanovesicles integrating a prodrug of oxaliplatin (OXA) can passively accumulate at the tumor site and penetrate deep into the tumor mass via matrix metalloproteinase 2-mediated cleavage of the polyethylene glycol corona. The OXA prodrug can be restored inside the tumor cells with endogenous glutathione to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) of the tumor cells and sensitize the tumor to ion radiation. The nanovesicles can be further loaded with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib to abolish chemoradiotherapy-induced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation on the surface of the tumor cells, thereby prompting chemoradiotherapy-induced immunotherapy by blocking the interferon gamma-Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription axis. The prodrug nanoplatform reported herein might present a novel strategy to cooperatively enhance chemoradiotherapy of head and cancer and overcome PD-L1-dependent immune evasion.},

However, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear and the device efficiency lags largely behind. Here, a facile strategy of precisely tailoring the phase purity of 2D perovskites on top of 3D WBG perovskite and realizing high device efficiency is reported. The transient absorption spectra, cross-sectional confocal photoluminescence mapping, and cross-sectional Kelvin probe force microscopy are combined to demonstrate optimal defect passivation effect and surface electric-field of pure n = 1 2D perovskites formed atop 3D WBG perovskites via low-temperature annealing. As a result, the inverted champion device with 1.77-eV perovskite absorber achieves a high V OC of 1.284 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.72%, delivering the smallest V OC deficit of 0.486 V among WBG PSCs with a bandgap higher than 1.75 eV. This enables one to achieve a four-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE exceeding 25% by combining with a 1.25-eV low-bandgap PSC.},

This artificially increases the dwelling time of the infected red blood cells within inner organs such as the brain, which can lead to cerebral malaria. Cerebral malaria is the deadliest complication patients infected with P. falciparum can experience and still remains a major public health concern despite effective antimalarial therapies. Here, the current understanding of the effect of P. falciparum cytoadherence and their secreted proteins on structural features of the human blood-brain barrier and their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria are highlighted. Advanced 2D and 3D in vitro models are further assessed to study this devastating interaction between parasite and host. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to neuronal and cognitive deficits in cerebral malaria will be pivotal in devising new strategies to treat and prevent blood-brain barrier dysfunction and subsequent neurological damage in patients with cerebral malaria.},

  abstract     = {Topological phases of matter are conventionally characterized by the bulk-boundary correspondence in Hermitian systems. The topological invariant of the bulk in d dimensions corresponds to the number of ( d − 1)-dimensional boundary states. By extension, higher-order topological insulators reveal a bulk-edge-corner correspondence, such that n th order topological phases feature ( d − n )-dimensional boundary states. The advent of non-Hermitian topological systems sheds new light on the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) with an extensive number of boundary modes under open boundary conditions. Still, the higher-order NHSE remains largely unexplored, particularly in the experiment. An unsupervised approach—physics-graph-informed machine learning (PGIML)—to enhance the data mining ability of machine learning with limited domain knowledge is introduced. Through PGIML, the second-order NHSE in a 2D non-Hermitian topoelectrical circuit is experimentally demonstrated. The admittance spectra of the circuit exhibit an extensive number of corner skin modes and extreme sensitivity of the spectral flow to the boundary conditions. The violation of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence in the second-order NHSE implies that modification of the topological band theory is inevitable in higher dimensional non-Hermitian systems.},

  abstract     = {Mechanisms keeping leukocytes distant of local inflammatory processes in a resting state despite systemic release of inflammatory triggers are a pivotal requirement for avoidance of overwhelming inflammation but are ill defined. Dimers of the alarmin S100A8/S100A9 activate Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) but extracellular calcium concentrations induce S100A8/S100A9-tetramers preventing TLR4-binding and limiting their inflammatory activity. So far, only antimicrobial functions of released S100A8/S100A9-tetramers (calprotectin) are described. It is demonstrated that extracellular S100A8/S100A9 tetramers significantly dampen monocyte dynamics as adhesion, migration, and traction force generation in vitro and immigration of monocytes in a cutaneous granuloma model and inflammatory activity in a model of irritant contact dermatitis in vivo. Interestingly, these effects are not mediated by the well-known binding of S100A8/S100A9-dimers to TLR-4 but specifically mediated by S100A8/S100A9-tetramer interaction with CD69. Thus, the quaternary structure of these S100-proteins determines distinct and even antagonistic effects mediated by different receptors. As S100A8/S100A9 are released primarily as dimers and subsequently associate to tetramers in the high extracellular calcium milieu, the same molecules promote inflammation locally (S100-dimer/TLR4) but simultaneously protect the wider environment from overwhelming inflammation (S100-tetramer/CD69).},

In situ X-ray CT in probing the mechanism and kinetics of localized corrosion is demonstrated by immersing two LPBF specimens with different porosities in an aggressive ferric chloride solution for the evaluation of corrosion. X-ray CT images are acquired from the specimens after every 8 hours of immersion over an extended period of time (216 hours). Corrosion pit growth is then quantitatively analyzed with a data-constrained modeling method. The pitting growth mechanism of LPBF stainless steel is found to be different from that of conventional stainless steels. More specifically, the mechanism of corrosion pit initiation is closely correlated with the original lack of fusion porosity (LOF) distribution on the surface of the specimens and preferential pit propagation through the LOF pores inside the specimens. Pit growth kinetics are derived from pit volume changes determined through 3D data analysis. The pit growth kinetics in LPBF specimens are found to vary in the initial pit formation, competitive pit propagation, and the dominant pit growth stages.},

  abstract     = {Interface engineering in electrode materials is an attractive strategy for enhancing charge storage, enabling fast kinetics, and improving cycling stability for energy storage systems. Nevertheless, the performance improvement is usually ambiguously ascribed to the “synergetic effect”, the fundamental understanding toward the effect of the interface at molecular level in composite materials remains elusive. In this work, a well-defined nanoscale MoS 2 /TiO 2 interface is rationally designed by immobilizing TiO 2 nanocrystals on MoS 2 nanosheets. The role of heterostructure interface between TiO 2 and MoS 2 by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (sXRD), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations is investigated. It is found that the existence of a hetero-interfacial electric field can promote charge transfer kinetics. Based on operando sXRD, it is revealed that the heterostructure follows a solid-solution reaction mechanism with small volume changes during cycling. As such, the electrode demonstrates ultrafast Na + ions storage of 300 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 and excellent reversible capacity of 540 mAh g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 . This work provides significant insights into understanding of heterostructure interface at molecular level, which suggests new strategies for creating unconventional nanocomposite electrode materials for energy storage systems.},

Here, a condensation (hygroscopic growth)-assisted bioaerosol collection and plasmonic photothermal sensing (CAPS) system for on-site quantitative risk analysis of SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols is presented. The CAPS system provided rapid thermoplasmonic biosensing results after an aerosol-to-hydrosol sampling process in COVID-19-related environments including a hospital and a nursing home. The detection limit reached 0.25 copies/µL in the complex aerosol background without further purification. More importantly, the CAPS system enabled direct measurement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus exposures with high spatiotemporal resolution. Measurement and feedback of the results to healthcare workers and patients via a QR-code are completed within two hours. Based on a dose-response µ model, it is used the plasmonic biosensing signal to calculate probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and estimate maximum exposure durations to an acceptable risk threshold in different environmental settings.},

  abstract     = {Polymer dielectrics are essential for advanced electrical and electronic power systems due to their ultrafast charge–discharge rate. However, a long-standing challenge is to maintain their dielectric performance at high temperatures. Here, a layered barium titanate/polyamideimide nanocomposite reinforced with rationally designed interfaces is reported for high-temperature high-energy-density dielectrics. Nanocoatings composed of 2D montmorillonite nanosheets with anisotropic conductivities are interposed at two kinds of macroscopic interfaces: 1) the interfaces between adjacent layers in the nanocomposites (inside) and 2) the interfaces between the surface of the nanocomposite and the electrode (outside). By revealing the charge transport behavior with Kelvin probe force microscope, surface potential decay, and finite element simulation, it is demonstrated that the outside nanocoatings are observed to diminish charge injection from the electrode, while the inside nanocoatings can suppress the kinetic energy of hot carriers by redirecting their transport. In this interface-reinforced nanocomposite, an ultrahigh energy density of 2.48 J cm −3 , as well as a remarkable charge–discharge efficiency &gt;80%, is achieved at 200 °C, six times higher than that of the nanocomposite without interfacial nanocoatings. This research unveils a novel approach for the structural design of polymer nanocomposites based on engineered interfaces to achieve high-efficient and high-temperature capacitive energy storage.},

Herein, a bioinspired hierarchical fast transport network (HFTN) in a 3D printed reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (3DP GC) electrode demonstrating superior electrochemical performance is constructed. Theoretical calculations reveal that the HFTN of the 3DP GC electrode increases the ion transport rate by more than 50 times and 36 times compared with those of the bulk GC electrode and traditional 3DP GC (T-3DP GC) electrode, respectively. Compared with carbon paper, carbon cloth, bulk GC electrode, and T-3DP GC electrode, the HFTN in 3DP GC electrode endows obvious advantages: i) efficient utilization of surface area for uniform catalysts dispersion during electrochemical deposition; ii) efficient utilization of catalysts enables the high mass activity of catalysts and low overpotential of electrode in electrocatalytic reaction. The cell of 3DP GC/Ni-NiO||3DP GC/NiS 2 demonstrates a low voltage of only 1.42 V to reach 10 mA cm −2 and good stability up to 20 h for water splitting in alkaline conditions, which is superior to commercialized Pt/C||RuO 2 .

Fundamental limitations remain, however, that impede the pace of understanding the networks, especially the extraction of understandable semantic space. In this work, the framework of semantic explainable artificial intelligence (S-XAI) is introduced, which utilizes a sample compression method based on the distinctive row-centered principal component analysis (PCA) that is different from the conventional column-centered PCA to obtain common traits of samples from the convolutional neural network (CNN), and extracts understandable semantic spaces on the basis of discovered semantically sensitive neurons and visualization techniques. Statistical interpretation of the semantic space is also provided, and the concept of semantic probability is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that S-XAI is effective in providing a semantic interpretation for the CNN, and offers broad usage, including trustworthiness assessment and semantic sample searching.},

By labeling individual proteins of living cells with single RuMOFs, the distribution of membrane tyrosine-protein-kinase-like7 (PTK7) proteins at low-expressing cells is imaged via ECL. More importantly, the efficient capture of ECL photons generated inside the MOFs results in a stable ECL emission up to 1 h, allowing the in operando visualization of protein movements at the cellular membrane. As compared with the fluorescence observation, near-zero ECL background surrounding the target protein with the ECL emitter gives a better contrast for the dynamic imaging of discrete protein movement. This achievement of single molecule ECL dynamic imaging using RuMOFs will provide a more effective nanoemitter to observe the distribution and motion of individual proteins at living cells.},

  abstract     = {Hepatic ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injury remains a common issue lacking effective strategy and validated pharmacological targets. Here, using an unbiased metabolomics screen, this study finds that following murine hepatic IR, liver 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) and quinolinic acid (QA) decline while kynurenine and kynurenic acid (KYNA) increase. Kynurenine aminotransferases 2, functioning at the key branching point of the kynurenine pathway (KP), is markedly upregulated in hepatocytes during ischemia, shifting the kynurenine metabolic route from 3-HAA and QA to KYNA synthesis. Defects in QA synthesis impair de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis, rendering the hepatocytes relying on the salvage pathway for maintenance of NAD and cellular antioxidant defense. Blocking the salvage pathway following IR by the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitor FK866 exacerbates liver oxidative damage and enhanced IR susceptibility, which can be rescued by the lipid peroxidation inhibitor Liproxstatin-1. Notably, nicotinamide mononucleotide administration once following IR effectively boosts NAD and attenuated IR-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death in the murine model. Collectively, the findings reveal that metabolic rewiring of the KP partitions it away from NAD synthesis in hepatic IR pathophysiology, and provide proof of concept that NAD augmentation is a promising therapeutic measure for IR-induced liver injury.},

Herein, the Ti 3 C 2 T x /ZIS heterostructure with nanometer-thick Ti 3 C 2 T x -MXene and ZnIn 2 S 4 (ZIS) films is fabricated by successive interfacial assembly of liquid exfoliated 2D MXene and ZnIn 2 S 4 nanoflakes. Benefiting from the superior light-harvesting capability and low dark current of ZnIn 2 S 4 , the limited absorbance, large scattering coefficient, and high dark current disadvantages of MXene are ameliorated. Meanwhile, the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers in ZnIn 2 S 4 are improved due to the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti 3 C 2 T x nanoflakes. As a result, the as-prepared Ti 3 C 2 T x /ZIS heterostructure photodetector has excellent optoelectronic characteristics in terms of a high responsivity of 1.04 mA W −1 , a large specific detectivity up to 1 × 10 11 Jones, a huge on/off ratio at around 10 5 , and an ultralow dark current at ≈10 −12 A.

The mixture of halides triggers the deep eutectic phenomena by intermolecular interactions, leading to diverse morphologies and viscous statuses in terms of composition. Chemical- and micro-structure analyses via the cryogenic technique reveal that the LiCl and LiF nanoparticles are dispersed in an amorphous halide matrix, which endow freely mobile ions for fast ion transport. The optimized DESE thus achieves low activation energy and high ionic conductivity of 16 mS cm −1 at room temperature, one of the highest values among various electrolytes so far. By integrating with the active materials to form a composite cathode, the viscous DESE yields a super-dense composite pellet which possesses intensively enhanced ionic conductivity in contrast to those formed by the sulfide-based electrolyte additives, demonstrating an attractive application prospect.},

  abstract     = {Neonatal jaundice is a very common disease in newborns and can lead to brain damage or death in severe cases. Phototherapy with light-emitting diode (LED) arrays is widely used as the easiest and fastest way to relieve jaundice in newborns, but it has distinct disadvantages such as loss of water in the patient, damage to the retina, and separation from parents. In this paper, a novel light source-based phototherapy for neonatal jaundice is proposed using a textile-based wearable organic light-emitting diode (OLED) platform that can move flexibly and conform to the curvature of the human body. The soft and flexible textile-based blue OLED platform is designed to have a peak wavelength of 470 nm, suitable for jaundice treatment, and shows performance (&gt;20 µW cm −2 nm − 1 ) suitable for intensive jaundice treatment even at low voltage (&lt;4.0 V). The textile-based OLEDs fabricated in this study exhibit an operating reliability of over 100 h and low-temperature operation (&lt;35 °C). The results of an in vitro jaundice treatment test using a large-area blue OLED confirm that the bilirubin level decreases to 12 mg dL −1 with 3 h of OLED irradiation.},

  abstract     = {The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has a detrimental impact on their electrochemical performance. To effectively mitigate the shuttle effect, in this study, the coral-like CuS is introduced to modify the carbon nanotube (CNTs), which is coated on commercial separator and served as the S cathode interlayer (PE@CuS/CNTs). The CuS/CNTs interlayer possesses efficient physical impediment and chemisorption to polysulfide anions. When achieving maximum adsorption to polysulfide anions, a “polysulfide-phobic” surface would be formed as a shield to restrain the polysulfide anions in the cathode region. Simultaneously, the CuS/CNTs interlayer can improve the lithium ion diffusion and guarantee desirable electrochemical reaction kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs with PE@CuS/CNTs show an initial discharge capacity of 1242.4 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g −1 ) and retain a long-term cycling stability (568.5 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles, 2 C), corresponding to an ultra-low capacity fading rate of only 0.05% per cycle. Also, the LSBs with PE@CuS/CNTs exhibit high resistance to self-discharge and favorable performance under high S loading (4.5 mg cm −2 ) and lean electrolyte (9.4 mL Electrolyte g S −1 ).},

However, in–depth development of SF hydrogel is restricted by their limited mechanical strength, increased risk of infection, and inability to accelerate tissue healing. Therefore, a structure–function pluralistic modification strategy using composite system of metal organic framework (MOF) as bridge expanding SF&#39;s biomedical application is proposed. After developing the photocuring and bonding SF hydrogel, a MOF drug–loading system is utilized to enhance hydrogel&#39;s structural strength while endowing its antibacterial and angiogenic properties, yielding a multifunctional SF hydrogel. The synergy between the MOF and SF proteins at the secondary structure level gives this hydrogel reliable mechanical strength, making it suitable for conventional wound treatment, whether for closing incisions quickly or acting as adhesive dressings (five times the bonding strength of ordinary fibrin glue). Additionally, with the antibacterial and angiogenic functions getting from MOF system, this modified SF hydrogel can even treat ischemic trauma with cartilage exposure. This multiple modification should contribute to the improvement of advanced wound care, by promoting SF application in the production of tissue engineering materials.},

  abstract     = {Oxaliplatin is commonly used in chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal cancer (CRC) after surgical resection. However, acquired chemoresistance seriously affects the curative effect in CRC patients, and the mechanism is still unclear. Here, a circular RNA, circATG4B is identified, which plays an important role in oxaliplatin resistance in CRC. circATG4B expression is found to be increased in exosomes secreted by oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells. In addition, the results suggest that circATG4B induces oxaliplatin resistance by promoting autophagy. Further in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the effect of circATG4B is attributed to its potential to encode a novel protein, circATG4B-222aa. Next, circATG4B-222aa is found to function as a decoy to competitively interact with TMED10 and prevent TMED10 from binding to ATG4B, which leads to increased autophagy followed by induction of chemoresistance. Therefore, this study reveals that exosomal circATG4B participates in the decreased chemosensitivity of CRC cells, providing a new rationale for a potential therapeutic target for oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.},

Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), a gaseous signal molecule, can quickly permeate cells and tissues, growing concerned for its cardioprotective effects. However, short resident time and strong side effects greatly restrict its application. Herein, a complex scaffold (AAB) is first developed to slowly release H 2 S for myocardial protection by integrating alginate modified with 2-aminopyridine-5-thiocarboxamide (H 2 S donor) into albumin electrospun fibers. Next, a band-aid like patch is constructed based on AAB (center) and nanocomposite scaffold which comprises albumin scaffold and black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs). With near-infrared laser (808 nm), thermal energy generated by BPNSs can locally change the molecular structure of fibrous scaffold, thereby attaching patch to the myocardium. In this study, it is also demonstrated that AAB can enhance regenerative M2 macrophage and attenuate inflammatory polarization of macrophages via reduction in intracellular ROS. Eventually, this engineered cardiac patch can relieve inflammation and promote angiogenesis after MI, and thereby recover heart function, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for MI treatment.},

However, the highly dynamic nature of FAPbI 3 QDs, which mainly originates from the proton exchange between oleic acid and oleylamine (OAm) surface ligands, is a key hurdle that impedes the fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells. To tackle such an issue, here, protonated-OAm in situ to strengthen the ligand binding at the surface of FAPbI 3 QDs, which can effectively suppress the defect formation during QD synthesis and purification processes is selectively introduced. In addition, by forming a halide-rich surface environment, the ligand density in a broader range for FAPbI 3 QDs without compromising their structural integrity, which significantly improves their optoelectronic properties can be modulated. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI 3 QD solar cells (QDSCs) is enhanced from 7.4% to 13.8%, a record for FAPbI 3 QDSCs. Furthermore, the suppressed proton exchange and reduced surface defects in FAPbI 3 QDs also enhance the stability of QDSCs, which retain 80% of the initial efficiency upon exposure to ambient air for 3000 hours.},

Here, for the first time, a TENG shell is advanced for ocean energy harvesting to 0.5 m and an excellent frictional areal density of 1.03 cm −1 and economies of scale are obtained. The unique structure of the multi-arch shape is adopted to untie the difficulty of fully getting the extensive friction layer contact. An inside steel plate is vertically placed in the center of every TENG block, which can activate the TENG to achieve complete contact even at a tilt angle of 7 degrees. The proposed half-meter TENG (HM-TENG) has a broad response band from 0.1 to 2 Hz, a total transferred charge quantity up to 67.2 µC, and one single TENG can deliver an open-circuit voltage of 368 V. Coupled with the self-stabilizing and susceptible features the ellipsoid shell brings, the HM-TENG can readily accommodate itself to the all-weather, all-sea wave energy harvesting. Muchmore, the HM-TENG is also applied to RF signal transmitters. This work takes the first step toward near-meter-scale enclosures and provides a new direction for large-scale wave energy harvesting.},

Despite the accumulated knowledge from epidemiological, in vitro, and in animal studies, the understanding of dissemination of vector-borne pathogens, such as Borrelia burgdorferi ( Bb ), remains incomplete with several important knowledge gaps, especially related to invasion and intravasation into circulation. To elucidate the mechanistic details of these processes a tissue-engineered human dermal microvessel model is developed. Fluorescently labeled Bb are injected into the extracellular matrix (ECM) to mimic tick inoculation. High resolution, confocal imaging is performed to visualize the sub-acute phase of infection. From analysis of migration paths no evidence to support adhesin-mediated interactions between Bb and ECM components is found, suggesting that collagen fibers serve as inert obstacles to migration. Intravasation occurs at cell–cell junctions and is relatively fast, consistent with Bb swimming in ECM. In addition, it is found that Bb alone can induce endothelium activation, resulting in increased immune cell adhesion but no changes in global or local permeability. Together these results provide new insight into the minimum requirements for Bb dissemination and highlight how tissue-engineered models are complementary to animal models in visualizing dynamic processes associated with vector-borne pathogens.},

The flexibility of nanoformulations in size, topology, softness, and multifunctionality allows precise regulation of nano-immunological activities for enhanced therapeutic effect. To grasp the modulation of immune response, research efforts are needed to understand the interactions of immune cells at lymph organs and tumor tissues, where the nanoformulations guide the immunostimulators to function on tissue specific subsets of immune cells.

Here an ultrafast and highly sensitive broadband phototransistor is demonstrated by integrating high-quality pentacene single crystal with monolayer graphene. Encouragingly, the −3 dB bandwidth can reach up to 26 kHz, which is a record-speed for such sensitized organic phototransistors.

  abstract     = {Recent studies have found that green hydrogen production and biomass utilization technologies can be combined to efficiently produce both hydrogen and value-added chemicals using biomass as an electron and proton source. However, the majority of them have been limited to proof-of-concept demonstrations based on batch systems. Here the authors report the design of modular flow systems for the continuous depolymerization and valorization of lignin and low-voltage hydrogen production. A redox-active phosphomolybdic acid is used as a catalyst to depolymerize lignin with the production of aromatic compounds and extraction of electrons for hydrogen production. Individual processes for lignin depolymerization, byproduct separation, and hydrogen production with catalyst reactivation are modularized and integrated to perform the entire process in the serial flow. Consequently, this work enabled a one-flow process from biomass conversion to hydrogen gas generation under a cyclic loop. In addition, the unique advantages of the fluidic system (i.e., effective mass and heat transfer) substantially improved the yield and efficiency, leading to hydrogen production at a higher current density (20.5 mA cm −2 ) at a lower voltage (1.5 V) without oxygen evolution. This sustainable eco-chemical platform envisages scalable co-production of valuable chemicals and green hydrogen for industrial purposes in an energy-saving and safe manner.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are being developed rapidly and exhibit greatly potential commercialization. Herein, it is found that the device performance can be improved by manipulating the migration of iodine ions via reverse-biasing, for example, at −0.4 V for 3 min in dark. Characterizations suggest that reverse bias can increase the charge recombination resistance, improve carrier transport, and enhance built-in electric field. Iodine ions including iodine interstitials in perovskites are confirmed to migrate and accumulate at the SnO 2 /perovskite interface under reverse-basing, which fill iodine vacancies at the interface and interact with SnO 2 . First-principles calculations suggest that the SnO 2 /perovskite interface with less iodine vacancies has a stronger interaction and higher charge transfer, leading to larger built-in electric field and improved charge transport. Iodine ions that may pass through the SnO 2 /perovskite interface are also confirmed to be able to interact with Sn 4+ and passivate oxygen vacancies on the surface of SnO 2 . Consequently, an efficiency of 23.48% with the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 1.16 V is achieved for PSCs with reverse-biasing, as compared with the initial efficiency of 22.13% with a V oc of 1.10 V. These results are of great significance to reveal the physics mechanism of PSCs under electric field.},

  abstract     = {Burning rate of solid propellants can be effectively improved by adding catalysts and using smaller size ammonium perchlorate (AP). Although few reports, the exploration of changing the size of AP primary particles by catalysts is of great significance for improving combustion performance. Here, taking Co-bipy as an example, the potential advantages of such materials as AP decomposition catalysts are reported. Due to the existence of NO 3 − combined with oxygen rich environment provided by AP, the structural self-transformation from micronrods to nanoparticles can be quickly realized during the heating process. More importantly, when Co-bipy decomposes, it can play the role of “scalpel” and in situ cut AP particles. Results show that high-temperature decomposition of Co-bipy/AP occurs at 305.8 °C, which is 137.5 °C lower than that of pure AP. Catalytic mechanism is discussed by in situ IR and TG-IR, CoO can effectively increase the content of reactive oxygen species and weaken the N–H bond, realizing the rapid oxidation of NH 3 . Eventually, the behavior of Co-bipy cutting AP particles is tested. This interesting catalyst structure self-transformation behavior can not only realize the influence on AP, but also perform a positive function in the combustion process of solid propellants, such as opening the adhesive AP interface.},

  abstract     = {Multi-functional metasurfaces have attracted great attention due to the significant possibilities to realize highly integrated and ultra-compact meta-devices. Merging nano-printing and holographic information multiplexing is one of the effective ways to achieve multi-functionality, and such a merger can increase the information encoding capacity. However, the current approaches rely on stacking layers and interleaving, where multiple resonators effectively combine different functionalities on the cost of efficiency, design complexity, and challenging fabrication. To address such challenges, a single meta-nanoresonator-based tri-functional metasurface is proposed by combining the geometric phase-based spin-decoupling and Malus&#39;s law intensity modulation. The proposed strategy effectively improves information capacity owing to the orientation degeneracy of spin-decoupling rather than layer stacking or super-cell designs. To validate the proposed strategy, a metasurface demonstrating two helicity-dependent holographic outputs is presented in far-field, whereas a continuous nano-printing image is in near-field. It is also employed on CMOS-compatible and cost-effective hydrogen amorphous silicon providing transparent responses for the whole visible band. As a result, the proposed metasurface has high transmission efficiency in the visible regime and verifies the design strategy without adding extra complexities to conventional nano-pillar geometry. Therefore, the proposed metasurface opens new avenues in multi-functional meta-devices design and has promising applications in anti-counterfeiting, optical storage and displays.​},

Here the new strategy to independently improve constituent factors in ZT is reported, giving exceptionally high ZT ave and PF ave in n-type PbSe. The nonstoichiometric, alloyed composition and resulting defect structures in new Pb 1+ x Se 0.8 Te 0.2 ( x = 0–0.125) system is key to this achievement. First, incorporating excess Pb unusually increases carrier mobility ( µ H ) and concentration ( n H ) simultaneously in contrast to the general physics rule, thereby raising electrical conductivity ( σ ). Second, modifying charge scattering mechanism by the authors’ synthesis process boosts a magnitude of Seebeck coefficient ( S ) above theoretical expectations. Detouring the innate inverse proportionality between n H and µ H ; and σ and S enables independent control over them and change the typical trend of PF to temperature, giving remarkably high PF ave ≈20 µW cm −1 K −2 from 300 to 823 K. The dual incorporation of Te and excess Pb generates unusual antisite Pb at the anionic site and displaced Pb from the ideal position, consequently suppressing lattice thermal conductivity. The best composition exhibits a ZT ave of ≈1.2 from 400 to 823 K, one of the highest reported for all n-type PbQ (Q = chalcogens) materials.},

Unfortunately, antidepressant drugs benefit only a small minority of patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new interventions. Accumulating evidence supports a causal relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression. To advance microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics of depression, a comprehensive overview of microbial alterations in depression is presented to identify effector microbial biomarkers. This procedure generated 215 bacterial taxa from humans and 312 from animal models. Compared to controls, depression shows significant differences in β -diversity, but no changes in microbial richness and diversity. Additionally, species-specific microbial changes are identified like increased Eggerthella in humans and decreased Acetatifactor in rodent models. Moreover, a disrupted microbiome balance and functional changes, characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Desulfovibrio and Escherichia/Shigella ) and depletion of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium ) are consistently shared across species. Confounding effects of geographical region, depression type, and intestinal segments are also investigated. Ultimately, a total of 178 species and subspecies probiotics are identified to alleviate the depressive phenotypes. Current findings provide a foundation for developing microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics and advancing microbiota-oriented precision medicine for depression.},

  abstract     = {The terrible morbidity and mortality of malignant tumors urgently require innovative therapeutics, especially for apoptosis-resistant tumors. Pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death (PCD), is featured with pore formation in plasma membrane, cell swelling with giant bubbles, and leakage of cytoplasmic pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can remodel the tumor immune microenvironment by stimulating a “cold” tumor microenvironment to be an immunogenic “hot” tumor microenvironment, and consequently augment the therapeutic efficiency of malignant tumors. Benefiting from current advances in nanotechnology, nanomedicine is extensively applied to potentiate, enable, and augment pyroptosis for enhancing cancer-therapeutic efficacy and specificity. This review provides a concentrated summary and discussion of the most recent progress achieved in this emerging field, highlighting the nanomedicine-enabled/augmented specific pyroptosis strategy for favoring the construction of next-generation nanomedicines to efficiently induce PCD. It is highly expected that the further clinical translation of nanomedicine can be accelerated by inducing pyroptotic cell death based on bioactive nanomedicines.},

  abstract     = {Outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have posed serious threats to humans and animals, which urgently calls for effective broad-spectrum antivirals. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays an essential role in viral RNA synthesis and is an ideal pan-coronaviral therapeutic target. Herein, based on cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical approaches, gossypol (GOS) is identified from 881 natural products to directly block SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, thus inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in both cellular and mouse infection models. GOS also acts as a potent inhibitor against the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) and exerts same inhibitory effects toward mutated RdRps of VOCs as the RdRp of the original SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, that the RdRp inhibitor GOS has broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity against alphacoronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus), betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), gammacoronaviruses (avian infectious bronchitis virus), and deltacoronaviruses (porcine deltacoronavirus) is showed. The findings demonstrate that GOS may serve as a promising lead compound for combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other coronavirus outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {Several immune cell-expressed miRNAs (miRs) are associated with altered prognostic outcome in cancer patients, suggesting that they may be potential targets for development of cancer therapies. Here, translucent zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) is utilized to demonstrate that genetic knockout or knockdown of one such miR, microRNA-223 (miR223), globally or specifically in leukocytes, does indeed lead to reduced cancer progression. As a first step toward potential translation to a clinical therapy, a novel strategy is described for reprogramming neutrophils and macrophages utilizing miniature artificial protocells (PCs) to deliver anti-miRs against the anti-inflammatory miR223. Using genetic and live imaging approaches, it is shown that phagocytic uptake of anti-miR223-loaded PCs by leukocytes in zebrafish (and by human macrophages in vitro) effectively prolongs their pro-inflammatory state by blocking the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which, in turn, drives altered immune cell-cancer cell interactions and ultimately leads to a reduced cancer burden by driving reduced proliferation and increased cell death of tumor cells. This PC cargo delivery strategy for reprogramming leukocytes toward beneficial phenotypes has implications also for treating other systemic or local immune-mediated pathologies.},

  abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause lethal pulmonary damage in humans. It contains spike proteins on its envelope that bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) expressed on airway cells, enabling entry of the virus, and causing infection. The soluble form of hACE2 binds SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, prevents viral entry into target cells, and ameliorates lung injury; however, its short half-life limits therapeutic utilities. Here, synthetic mRNA is engineered to encode a soluble form of hACE2 (hsACE2) to prevent viral infection. A novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is used for packaging and delivering mRNA to cells to produce hsACE2 proteins. Intravenously administered LNP delivers mRNA to hepatocytes, leading to the production of circulatory hsACE2 initiated within 2 h and sustained over several days. Inhaled LNP results in lung transfection and secretion of mucosal hsACE2 to lung epithelia, the primary site of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, mRNA-generated hsACE2 binds to the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein. Finally, hsACE2 effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its pseudoviruses from infecting host cells. The proof of principle study shows that mRNA-based nanotherapeutics can be potentially deployed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and open new treatment opportunities for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).},

  abstract     = {The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) genome encodes a cluster of 22 viral microRNAs, called miR-BamHI-A rightward transcripts (miR-BARTs), which are shown to promote the development of cancer. Here, this study reports that EBV-miR-BART18-3p is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and is closely associated with the pathological and advanced clinical stages of CRC. Ectopic expression of EBV-miR-BART18-3p leads to increased migration and invasion capacities of CRC cells in vitro and causes tumor metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, EBV-miR-BART18-3p activates the hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha/lactate dehydrogenase A axis by targeting Sirtuin, which promotes lactate accumulation and acetyl-CoA production in CRC cells under hypoxic condition. Increased acetyl-CoA utilization subsequently leads to histone acetylation of fatty acid synthase and fatty acid synthase-dependent fat synthesis, which in turn drives de novo lipogenesis. The oncogenic role of EBV-miR-BART18-3p is confirmed in the patient-derived tumor xenograft mouse model. Altogether, the findings define a novel mechanism of EBV-miR-BART18-3p in CRC development through the lipogenesis pathway and provide a potential clinical intervention target for CRC.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of existing tissue-engineering cartilage (TEC) is known to be hampered by weak integration of biocompatibility, biodegradation, mechanical strength, and microenvironment supplies. The strategy of hydrogel-based TEC holds considerable promise in circumventing these problems. Herein, a non-toxic, biodegradable, and mechanically optimized double-network (DN) hydrogel consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and kartogenin (KGN)-conjugated chitosan (CHI) is constructed using a simple soaking strategy. This PEG-CHI-KGN DN hydrogel possesses favorable architectures, suitable mechanics, remarkable cellular affinity, and sustained KGN release, which can facilitate the cartilage-specific genes expression and extracellular matrix secretion of peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PB-MSCs). Notably, after tracing the transplanted cells by detecting the rabbit sex-determining region Y-linked gene sequence, the allogeneic PB-MSCs are found to survive for even 3 months in the regenerated cartilage. Here, the long-term release of KGN is able to efficiently and persistently activate multiple genes and signaling pathways to promote the chondrogenesis, chondrocyte differentiation, and survival of PB-MSCs. Thus, the regenerated tissues exhibit well-matched histomorphology and biomechanical performance such as native cartilage. Consequently, it is believed this innovative work can expand the choice for developing the next generation of orthopedic implants in the loadbearing region of a living body.},

  abstract     = {Directional water self-transport plays a crucial role in diverse applications such as biosensing and water harvesting. Despite extensive progress, current strategies for directional water self-transport are restricted to a short self-driving distance, single function, and complicated fabrication methods. Here, a lubricant-infused heterogeneous superwettability surface (LIHSS) for directional water self-transport is proposed on polyimide (PI) film through femtosecond laser direct writing and lubricant infusion. By tuning the parameters of the femtosecond laser, the wettability of PI film can be transformed into superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic. After trapping water droplets on the superhydrophilic surface and depositing excess lubricant, the asymmetrical wetting ridge drives water droplets by an attractive capillary force on the LIHSS. Notably, the maximum droplet self-driving distance can approach ≈3 mm, which is nearly twice as long as the previously reported strategies for direction water self-transport. Significantly, it is demonstrated that this strategy makes it possible to achieve water self-transport, anti-gravity pumping, and chemical microreaction on a tilted LIHSS. This work provides an efficient method to fabricate a promising platform for realizing directional water self-transport.},

  abstract     = {Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a low equilibrium potential offers a promising route to replace the oxygen evolution reaction for energy-saving hydrogen generation. However, the overpotential of the UOR is still high due to the complicated 6e − transfer process and adsorption/desorption of intermediate products. Herein, utilizing a cation exchange strategy, Ni-doped CuO nanoarrays grown on 3D Cu foam are synthesized. Notably, Ni-CuO NAs/CF requires a low potential of 1.366 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode to drive a current density of 100 mA cm −2 , outperforming various benchmark electrocatalysts and maintaining robust stability in alkaline media. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that Ni as the driving force center can effectively enhance the urea adsorption and stabilize CO*/NH* intermediates toward the UOR. These findings suggest a new direction for constructing nanostructures and modulating electronic structures, ultimately developing promising Cu-based electrode catalysts.},

Herein, combining the surface activation with the heterostructure construction strategy, the CoP/Fe-Co 9 S 8 heterostructures as the pre-catalyst for highly efficient oxygen evolution are successfully synthesized. The catalyst only needs 156 mV to reach 10 mA cm −2 and keeps stable for more than 150 h. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations verify that the introduction of Fe can promote the formation of highly active Co(IV)–O sites and lead to a self-termination of surface reconstruction, which eventually creates a highly active and stable oxygen evolution catalytic surface. Besides, the catalyst also demonstrates high hydrogen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential of 62 mV@10 mA cm −2 . Benefiting from its bifunctionality and self-supporting property, the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer equipped with these catalysts achieves high overall water splitting efficiency of 1.68 V@1 A cm −2 .},

A variety of light-fueled soft robotic functionalities including controllable and programmable shape-change, gripping, and locomotion is elicited.

In mechanical metamaterials, structural-phase transitions can be achieved through instability or buckling of certain structural elements.

Here, this limitation is addressed by designing a novel 3D mechanical metamaterial that is capable of undergoing a phase transition from positive to negative Poisson&#39;s ratio under compression, without significant degradation of Young&#39;s modulus (i.e. the phase transition is elastically-stable). The metamaterial is fabricated by two-photon lithography at the micro-scale and its mechanical behavior is assessed experimentally. For another choice of structural parameters, it is then shown that the auxetic behavior of the considered 3D metamaterial class can be maintained over a wide range of applied compressive strain.},

With the rapid growth of EM wave manipulation technique, programmable metasurface (PM) has emerged as a new type of wireless transmitter by directly modulating digital information without complex microwave components, thus providing an alternative to simplify the conventional wireless communication system. However, the challenges of improving information security and spectrum utilization still exist. Here, a dual-band metasurface-assisted wireless communication scheme is introduced to provide additional physical channels for the enhancement of information security. The information is divided into several parts and transmitted through different physical channels to accomplish information encryption, greatly reducing the possibility of eavesdropping. As the proof of concept, a dual-channel and high-security wireless communication system based on a 1-bit PM is established to simultaneously transmit two different parts of a picture to two receivers. Experiments show that the transmitted picture can be successfully retrieved only if the received signals of different receivers are synthetized as predefined. The proposed scheme provides a new route of employing PM in information encryption and spectrum utilization of wireless communication.},

However, multifunctional aerogel-based flexible/wearable electronics for human physiological/motion monitoring, and energy harvest/supply for mobile electronics, have been seldom reported yet. In this study, a kind of hybrid aerogel (GO/CNT HA) based on graphene oxide (GO) and carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CMWCNTs) is prepared which can not only used as piezoresistive sensors for human motion and physiological signal detections, but also as high performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) coupled with both solid–solid and gas–solid contact electrifications (CE). The repeatedly loading–unloading tests with 20 000 cycles exhibit its high and ultrastable piezoresistive sensor performances. Moreover, when the obtained aerogel is used as the electrode of a TENG, high electric output performance is produced due to the synergistic effect of solid–solid, and gas–solid interface CEs (3D electrification: solid–solid interface CE between the two solid electrification layers; gas–solid interface CE between the inner surface of GO/CNT HA and the air filled in the aerogel pores).

Here, inspired by the thorn-hiding and deflating–inflating characteristics of globefish, intelligent balloon catheters decorated with invisible microneedles are presented for endovascular drug delivery to inhibit postintervention restenosis (PIRS). These microneedle balloon catheters (MNBCs) fabricated by dipping and rolling-assisted template replication contain three coating layers of sandwiched drug-carrying microneedles and black phosphorus (BP)-carrying gelatin. During the emplacement, the microneedles of MNBCs are hidden under the outermost gelatin protective layer, allowing smooth movements inside the blood vessel. After reaching the destination, the embedded BP converts near infrared (NIR) into heat, increases local temperature, and melts the gelatin layer, enabling the exposure and vascular penetration of the microneedles. Besides, as the innermost gelatin also melts, the microneedles can detach from the balloon catheter and be left inside the blood vessel for continuous drug release. Based on advantages of responsiveness, penetration capacity, and biosafety, it is demonstrated that the MNBCs behave satisfactorily in delivering rapamycin to inhibit abdominal aorta restenosis in rats. All these features indicate that these MNBCs are promising medical devices for clinical applications.},

In this study, in vivo electrochemistry is combined with physiological and ethological analyses to explore oxygen metabolic consumption in an area of the mouse brain that includes parts of the primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. The oxygen levels at different locations of this boundary section are spatially resolved by measuring the electrical current in vivo using ingeniously designed anti-biofouling carbon fiber microelectrodes. The characteristics of the current signals are further interpreted by simultaneously recording the physiological responses of the mice. Additionally, ethological tests are performed to validate the correlation between oxygen levels and mouse behavior. It is found that high-dose caffeine injection can evoke spatial variability in oxygen metabolic consumption between the four neighboring brain regions. It is proposed that the oxygen metabolic consumption in different brain regions is not independent of each other but is subject to spatial regulation control following the rules of “rank of brain region” and “relative distance.” Furthermore, as revealed by in vivo wireless electrochemistry and ethological analysis, mice are at risk of neuronal damage from long-term intake of high-dose caffeine.},

Based on this feature, a physical-level wireless communication encryption scheme is presented and experimentally demonstrated by introducing a meta-key, which can be encrypted and sent by the programmable PoM information metasurface. To be specific, the key is encoded and concealed into different linear polarization channels, and then modulated and transmitted by the information metasurface at the transmitting end. At the receiving end, the modulated signal can be received and decoded by using a pair of polarization discrimination antennas. A wireless transceiver system is established to verify the feasibility of the scheme.

MOF@HOF eventually obtains core–shell hybrids, i.e., NH 2 -UiO-66@DAT-HOF. This newly synthesized core–shell nanostructure exhibits excellent stability and superb photocatalytic performance. For example, in terms of tetracycline degradation, the optimal composite presents an apparent reaction rate constant of 60.7 and 7.6 times higher than its parent materials NH 2 -UiO-66 and DAT-HOF. Such a pronounced enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency of the hybrid material is attributed to the broader visible-light utilization range compared to its individual parent material as well as the efficient separation of charge carriers supported by the S-scheme heterojunction. In addition, it is particularly notable that the photocatalytic efficiency of the yielded core–shell nanostructure can remain high after several-cycle applications. This work provides a universal scheme for synthesizing the MOF@HOF core–shell hybrids.},

Here, a multiplexed assay is developed on an optimized nanoparticle-based laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry platform for the sensitive and selective detection of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs). Integrative SMFs based multi-modal platforms are constructed for the early detection of LUAD and the classification of pulmonary nodule. The dual modal model, metabolic fingerprints with protein tumor marker neural network (MP-NN), integrating SMFs with protein tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) via deep learning, shows superior performance compared with the single modal model Met-NN ( p &lt; 0.001). Based on MP-NN, the tri modal model MPI-RF integrating SMFs, tumor marker CEA, and image features via random forest demonstrates significantly higher performance than the clinical models (Mayo Clinic and Veterans Affairs) and the image artificial intelligence in pulmonary nodule classification ( p &lt; 0.001). The developed platforms would be promising tools for LUAD screening and pulmonary nodule management, paving the conceptual and practical foundation for the clinical application of omics tools.},

Here, a class of transparent nanocellulose paper microsupercapacitors (TNP-MSCs) as a beyond-synthetic-material strategy is demonstrated. Onto semi-interpenetrating polymer network-structured, thiol-modified transparent nanocellulose paper, a thin layer of silver nanowire and a conducting polymer (chosen as a pseudocapacitive electrode material) are consecutively introduced through microscale-patterned masks (which are fabricated by electrohydrodynamic jet printing) to produce a transparent conductive electrode (TNP-TCE) with planar interdigitated structure. This TNP-TCE, in combination with solid-state gel electrolytes, enables on-demand (in-series/in-parallel) cell configurations in a single body of TNP-MSC. Driven by this structural uniqueness and scalable microfabrication, the TNP-MSC exhibits improvements in optical transparency ( T = 85%), areal capacitance (0.24 mF cm −2 ), controllable voltage (7.2 V per cell), and mechanical flexibility (origami airplane), which exceed those of previously reported transparent MSCs based on synthetic chemicals.},

Likewise, the ability to engineer compartment permeability is crucial for in vitro systems to gain sustainability, robustness, and complexity. However, rendering in vitro compartments such a capability is challenging. Here, a facile strategy is presented to build permeability-configurable compartments, and marked advantages of such compartmentalization are shown in reconstituting sustained synthetic biology systems in vitro. Through microfluidics, the strategy produces micrometer-sized layered microgels whose shell layer serves as a sieving structure for biomolecules and particles. In this configuration, the transport of DNAs, proteins, and bacteriophages across the compartments can be controlled an guided by a physical model. Through permeability engineering, a compartmentalized cell-free protein synthesis system sustains multicycle protein production; ≈100 000 compartments are repeatedly used in a five-cycle synthesis, featuring a yield of 2.2 mg mL −1 . Further, the engineered bacteria-enclosing compartments possess near-perfect phage resistance and enhanced environmental fitness. In a complex river silt environment, compartmentalized whole-cell biosensors show maintained activity throughout the 32 h pollutant monitoring. It is anticipated that permeability-engineered compartmentalization should pave the way for practical synthetic biology applications such as green bioproduction, environmental sensing, and bacteria-based therapeutics.},

Due to large areas of crystal interfaces, they are highly susceptible to grain growth and creep deformation, even at ambient temperatures. Here, ultrahigh strength nanotwinned copper microstructures have been stabilized against high temperature exposure while largely retaining electrical conductivity. By incorporating less than 1 vol% insoluble tungsten nanoparticles by a novel hybrid deposition method, both the ease of formation and the high temperature stability of nanotwins are dramatically enhanced up to at least 400 °C. By avoiding grain coarsening, improved high temperature creep properties arise as the coherent twin boundaries are poor diffusion paths, while some size-based nanotwin strengthening is retained.

Incorporating second electron-withdrawing (A 2 ) units into PM6 backbone by ternary D–A 1 –D–A 2 random copolymerization strategy is an effective approach to further improve its photovoltaic performance. Here, the authors synthesize the PM6-based terpolymers by introducing thiazolothiazole as the A 2 units connecting with thiophene π-bridges attaching alkyl substituent towards the A 2 unit (PMT-CT) or towards D-unit (PMT-FT), and study the effect of the alkyl substituent position on the photovoltaic performance of them. Two terpolymers PMT-FT-10 and PMT-CT-10 are obtained by incorporating 10% A 2 units in the terpolymers. The film of PMT-CT-10 shows slightly up-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels while better co-planar structure than that of PMT-FT-10. Meanwhile, the PMT-CT-10:Y6 blend film exhibits better molecular packing properties, more proper phase separation and more balanced hole and electron mobilities, which are beneficial to more efficient exciton dissociation, efficient charge transport and weaker bimolecular recombination. Consequently, the PMT-CT-10 based PSCs obtain the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.21%. The results indicate that side chain position on the thiophene π-bridges influence the device performance of the terpolymer donors, and PMT-CT-10 is a high efficiency polymer donor for the PSCs.},

Prediabetic hyperglycemia due to dysfunctional interactions between different human tissues, including pancreas and liver, constitutes the largest risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. However, this early stage of metabolic disease has received relatively little attention. Microphysiological tissue models that emulate tissue crosstalk offer emerging opportunities to study metabolic interactions. Here, a novel modular multitissue organ-on-a-chip device is presented that allows for integrated and reciprocal communication between different 3D primary human tissue cultures. Precisely controlled heterologous perfusion of each tissue chamber is achieved through a microfluidic single “synthetic heart” pneumatic actuation unit connected to multiple tissue chambers via specific configuration of microchannel resistances. On-chip coculture experiments of organotypic primary human liver spheroids and intact primary human islets demonstrate insulin secretion and hepatic insulin response dynamics at physiological timescales upon glucose challenge. Integration of transcriptomic analyses with promoter motif activity data of 503 transcription factors reveals tissue-specific interacting molecular networks that underlie β -cell stress in prediabetic hyperglycemia. Interestingly, liver and islet cultures show surprising counter-regulation of transcriptional programs, emphasizing the power of microphysiological coculture to elucidate the systems biology of metabolic crosstalk.},

  abstract     = {3D printing enables the customized design of implant structures for accurately regulating host responses. However, polysaccharides, as a major biomaterial category with versatile immune activities, are typically “non-printable” due to the collapse of their filaments extruded during printing. This challenge renders their potential as immunomodulatory scaffolds underexploited. Here, inspired by the quench hardening in metal processing, a nonsolvent quenching (NSQ) strategy is innovatively designed for the 3D printing of polysaccharides. Through rapid solvent exchanging, NSQ instantly induces surface hardening to strengthen the polysaccharide filaments upon extrusion, requiring neither chemical modification nor physical blending that alters the material properties. Tested with five polysaccharides with varying physicochemical properties, NSQ prints predesigned structures at organ-relevant scales and a long shelf-life over 3 months. Glucomannan scaffolds, fabricated via NSQ with different grid spacings (1.5 and 2.5 cm), induce distinct host responses upon murine subcutaneous implantation—from specific carbohydrate receptor activation to differential immunocytes accumulation and tissue matrix remodeling—as mechanistically validated in wild-type and Tlr2 −/− knockout mice. Overall, NSQ as a facile and generic strategy is demonstrated to fabricate polysaccharide scaffolds with improved shape fidelity, thereby potentially unmasking their accurate immunomodulatory activities for future biomaterials design.},

However, the locations of natural gas production sites are typically far from industrial areas. Therefore, transportation is needed, which could considerably increase the sale price of natural gas. Thus, the development of distributed, clean, affordable processes for the efficient conversion of CH 4 has increasingly attracted people&#39;s attention. Among them are plasma technology with the advantages of mild operating conditions, low space need, and quick generation of energetic and chemically active species, which allows the reaction to occur far from the thermodynamic equilibrium and at a reasonable cost. Significant progress in plasma-assisted reforming of methane (PARM) is achieved and reviewed in this paper from the perspectives of reactor development, thermal and nonthermal PARM routes, and catalysis. The factors affecting the conversion of reactants and the selectivity of products are studied. The findings from the past works and the insight into the existing challenges in this work should benefit the further development of reactors, high-performance catalysts, and PARM routes.},

To enable such therapeutic control, a mammalian gene switch is designed to be responsive to the natural sweetener xylose and its functionality is assessed in mouse studies. The gene switch consists of the bacterial transcription regulator XylR fused to a mammalian transactivator, which binds to an optimized promoter in the presence of xylose, thereby allowing dose-dependent transgene expression. The sensitivity of SWEET (sweetener-inducible expression of transgene) is improved by coexpressing a xylose transporter. Mice implanted with encapsulated SWEET-engineered cells show increased blood levels of cargo protein when taking xylose-sweetened water or coffee, or highly concentrated apple extract, while they do not respond to intake of a usual amount of carrots, which contain xylose. In a proof-of-concept therapeutic application study, type-1 diabetic mice engineered with insulin-expressing SWEET show lowered glycemia and increased insulin levels when administered this fairly diabetic-compliant sweetener, compared to untreated mice. A SWEET-based therapy appears to have the potential to integrate seamlessly into patients’ life-style and food habits in the move toward personalized medicine.},

Mechanistically, SRSF5 with its RRM2 domain directly bounds M mRNA at conserved sites (M mRNA position 163, 709, and 712), and interacts with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to promote M mRNA splicing and M2 production. Mutations introduced to the three binding sites, without changing amino acid code, significantly attenuates virus replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Likewise, SRSF5 conditional knockout in the lung protects mice against lethal IAV challenge. Furthermore, anidulafungin, an approved antifungal drug, is identified as an inhibitor of SRSF5 that effectively blocks IAV replication in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, SRSF5 as an activator of M mRNA splicing promotes IAV replication and is a host-derived antiviral target.},

  abstract     = {The transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channel is a nonselective cation channel that has been implicated in multiple sensory processes in the nervous system. Here, it is shown that TRPV2 in myeloid cells facilitates virus penetration by promoting the tension and mobility of cell membrane through the Ca 2+ -LRMDA axis. Knockout of TRPV2 in myeloid cells or inhibition of TRPV2 channel activity suppresses viral infection and protects mice from herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. Reconstitution of TRPV2 but not the Ca 2+ -impermeable mutant TRPV2 E572Q into LyZ2 -Cre; Trpv2 fl/fl bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) restores viral infection. Mechanistically, knockout of TRPV2 in myeloid cells inhibits the tension and mobility of cell membrane and the penetration of viruses, which is restored by reconstitution of TRPV2 but not TRPV2 E572Q . In addition, knockout of TRPV2 leads to downregulation of Lrmda in BMDCs and BMDMs, and knockdown of Lrmda significantly downregulates the mobility and tension of cell membrane and inhibits viral infections in Trpv2 fl/fl but not LyZ2 -Cre; Trpv2 fl/fl BMDCs. Consistently, complement of LRMDA into LyZ2 -Cre; Trpv2 fl/fl BMDCs partially restores the tension and mobility of cell membrane and promotes viral penetration and infection. These findings characterize a previously unknown function of myeloid TRPV2 in facilitating viral infection though the Ca2 + -LRMDA axis.},

  abstract     = {Although plasma is a promising technology in various fields, its clinical application is restricted by several limitations. A cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) patch is fabricated to help overcome hurdles, especially when treating skin diseases. This patch has surface dielectric barrier discharge, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) on a flexible polymer film surface on which the embedded electrode induces a locally strong electric field. The effect of the CAP patch on psoriasis is also evaluated. The distinct characteristics of psoriasis between the lesion and non-lesion area allow the CAP patch to be suitable for only lesion area for its treatment. The CAP patch induces the opening of calcium channels in keratinocytes, thereby restoring abnormal keratinocyte differentiation and the collapse of the tight junction; thus, alleviating psoriatic symptoms. In addition, the favorable effect is due to the induction of ROS/RNS by the CAP patch, not the electric field generated during plasma generation. The findings indicate that the proposed portable CAP patch can help treat inflammatory skin disorders, especially psoriasis. As this can be used easily as a combination therapy with existing drugs, it may help reduce side effects caused by existing drugs.},

While many neutralizing antibodies have been identified, and several approved, to treat COVID-19, systemic delivery, large doses, and high costs have the potential to limit their widespread use, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To use these antibodies more efficiently, an inhalable formulation is developed that allows for the expression of mRNA-encoded, membrane-anchored neutralizing antibodies in the lung to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infections. First, the ability of mRNA-encoded, membrane-anchored, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to prevent infections in vitro is demonstrated. Next, it is demonstrated that nebulizer-based delivery of these mRNA-expressed neutralizing antibodies potently abrogates disease in the hamster model. Overall, these results support the use of nebulizer-based mRNA expression of neutralizing antibodies as a new paradigm for mitigating respiratory virus infections.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, with high prevalence and low 5-year survival. Most of the CRC patients show excessive activation of the Wnt/ β -catenin pathway which is a vital target for CRC treatment. Based on multiple CRC cell lines with different nuclear expression of β -catenin, NU2058 is identified from a small molecule library consisting of 280 bioactive compounds and found to selectively inhibit the proliferation of CRC cells with nuclear β -catenin activation in vitro and in vivo. The translational significance of NU2058 alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs oxaliplatin and irinotecan (SN38) in CRC is demonstrated in orthotopic tumor model and patient-derived xenograft models. By integrating limited proteolysis-small molecule mapping (LiP-SMap) and mass spectrometry (MS), Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3) is identified as the direct target of NU2058. The results show that RanBP3 is a tumor suppressor in CRC and is associated with patient survival. Mechanistically, NU2058 increases the interaction of RanBP3 and β -catenin to promote nuclear export of β -catenin, which further inhibits transcription of c-Myc and cyclin D1 to induce cell senescence. Collectively, NU2058 may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for CRC patients with selective disruption of pathologic Wnt/ β -catenin signaling.},

Here, this work reports a general-purpose ultrasound neuromodulation system for chronic, closed-loop preclinical studies in freely behaving rodents. This work uses microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to design and fabricate a small and lightweight transducer capable of artifact-free stimulation and simultaneous neural recording. Using the general-purpose system, it can be observed that state-dependent ultrasound neuromodulation of the prefrontal cortex increases rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and protects spatial working memory to REM sleep deprivation.

  abstract     = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a major public health concern and is characterized by sustained hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and destruction of insulin-producing β cells. One pathological hallmark of T2D is the toxic accumulation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates. Monomeric hIAPP is a hormone normally co-secreted with insulin. However, increased levels of hIAPP in prediabetic and diabetic patients can lead to the formation of hIAPP protofibrils, which are toxic to β cells. Current therapies fail to address hIAPP aggregation and current screening modalities do not detect it. Using a stabilizing capping protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be developed against a previously nonisolatable form of hIAPP protofibrils, which are protofibril specific and do not engage monomeric hIAPP. Shown here are two candidate mAbs that can detect hIAPP protofibrils in serum and hIAPP deposits in pancreatic islets in a mouse model of rapidly progressing T2D. Treatment of diabetic mice with the mAbs delays disease progression and dramatically increases overall survival. These results demonstrate the potential for using novel hIAPP protofibril-specific mAbs as a diagnostic screening tool for early detection of T2D, as well as therapeutically to preserve β cell function and target one of the underlying pathological mechanisms of T2D.},

Three categories can be identified: i) Magnetic hydrogelation, DC magnetic fields are used during solidification/gelation for aligning particles; ii) additive manufacturing of magnetic materials, 3D printing technologies are used to develop spatially-encoded magnetic properties, and more recently; iii) magnetic additive manufacturing, magnetic responses are applied during the printing process to develop increasingly complex structural arrangement that may recapitulate anisotropic tissue structure and function. The magnetic responsiveness of conventionally and additively manufactured magnetic hydrogels are described along with recent advances in soft magnetic robotics, and the categorization is related to final architecture and emergent properties.

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most lethal cancer worldwide. Glutamine is an essential, extracellular nutrient which supports HCC growth. Dietary glutamine deficiency may be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC. HCC cells overcome metabolic challenges by rewiring their metabolic pathways for rapid adaptations. The efficiency of dietary glutamine deficiency as HCC treatment is examined and the adaptation machinery under glutamine depletion in HCC cells is unraveled. Using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout library screening, this study identifies that pyruvate dehydrogenase α (PDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase β (PDHB), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) in pyruvate metabolism are crucial to the adaptation of glutamine depletion in HCC cells. Knockout of either PDHA, PDHB or PC induced metabolic reprogramming of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, disrupts mitochondrial function, leading to the suppression of HCC cell proliferation under glutamine depletion. Surprisingly, dietary glutamine restriction improves therapeutic responses of HCC to PDH or PC inhibitor in mouse HCC models. Stable isotope carbon tracing confirms that PDH or PC inhibitors further disrupt the metabolic rewiring of the TCA cycle induced by dietary glutamine depletion in HCC. In summary, the results demonstrate that pyruvate metabolism acts as novel targetable metabolic vulnerabilities for HCC treatment in combination with a glutamine-deficient diet.},

The optimized ML model allows for 93% prediction accuracy and 0.97 Pearson&#39;s r . The predicted synthesis scores are validated to be correlated with the experimental high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) crude purities (correlation coefficient R 2 = 0.95). Furthermore, a general applicability of ML is demonstrated through designing synthetically accessible antisense PNA sequences from 102 315 predicted candidates targeting exon 44 of the human dystrophin gene, SARS-CoV-2, HIV, as well as selected genes associated with cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and various cancers.

Endothelial cells and neurons in the NV chip show sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) downregulation under hyperglycemic conditions, suggesting SIRT1 as a key regulator of hyperglycemia-induced AD. The recovery of glucose levels rescue SIRT1 expression, suggesting that this type of intervention may rescue the progression of hyperglycemia-mediated AD.

EVs contribute to different aspects of cancer progression, such as cancer growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, immune evasion, and drug resistance. EVs induce the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, antiangiogenesis therapy, and immunotherapy by transferring specific cargos that affect drug efflux and regulate signaling pathways associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, autophagy, metabolism, and cancer stemness. In addition, EVs modulate the reciprocal interaction between cancer cells and noncancer cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop therapy resistance. EVs are detectable in many biofluids of cancer patients, and thus are regarded as novel biomarkers for monitoring therapy response and predicting prognosis. Moreover, EVs are suggested as promising targets and engineered as nanovehicles to deliver drugs for overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. In this review, the biological roles of EVs and their mechanisms of action in cancer drug resistance are summarized.

  abstract     = {Optogenetic genome engineering is a powerful technology for high-resolution spatiotemporal genetic manipulation, especially for in vivo studies. It is difficult to generate stable transgenic animals carrying a tightly regulated optogenetic system, as its long-term expression induces high background activity. Here, the generation of an enhanced photoactivatable Cre recombinase (ePA-Cre) transgenic mouse strain with stringent light responsiveness and high recombination efficiency is reported. Through serial optimization, ePA-Cre is developed to generate a transgenic mouse line that exhibits 175-fold induction upon illumination. Efficient light-dependent recombination is detected in embryos and various adult tissues of ePA-Cre mice crossed with the Ai14 tdTomato reporter. Importantly, no significant background Cre activity is detected in the tested tissues except the skin. Moreover, efficient light-inducible cell ablation is achieved in ePA-Cre mice crossed with Rosa26-LSL-DTA mice. In conclusion, ePA-Cre mice offer a tightly inducible, highly efficient, and spatiotemporal-specific genome engineering tool for multiple applications.},

  abstract     = {3D bioprinting holds great promise for tissue engineering, with extrusion bioprinting in suspended hydrogels becoming the leading bioprinting technique in recent years. In this method, living cells are incorporated within bioinks, extruded layer by layer into a granular support material followed by gelation of the bioink through diverse cross-linking mechanisms. This approach offers high fidelity and precise fabrication of complex structures mimicking living tissue properties. However, the transition of cell mass mixed with the bioink into functional native-like tissue requires post-printing cultivation in vitro. An often-overlooked drawback of 3D bioprinting is the nonuniform shrinkage and deformation of printed constructs during the post-printing tissue maturation period, leading to highly variable engineered constructs with unpredictable size and shape. This limitation poses a challenge for the technology to meet applicative requirements. A novel technology of “print-and-grow,” involving 3D bioprinting and subsequent cultivation in κ -Carrageenan-based microgels (CarGrow) for days is presented. CarGrow enhances the long-term structural stability of the printed objects by providing mechanical support. Moreover, this technology provides a possibility for live imaging to monitor tissue maturation. The “print-and-grow” method demonstrates accurate bioprinting with high tissue viability and functionality while preserving the construct&#39;s shape and size.},

  abstract     = {Developing fast-charging, high-temperature, and sustainable batteries is critical for the large-scale deployment of energy storage devices in electric vehicles, grid-scale electrical energy storage, and high temperature regions. Here, a transition metal-free all-organic rechargeable potassium battery (RPB) based on abundant and sustainable organic electrode materials (OEMs) and potassium resources for fast-charging and high-temperature applications is demonstrated. N-doped graphene and a 2.8 m potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF 6 ) in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) electrolyte are employed to mitigate the dissolution of OEMs, enhance the electrode conductivity, accommodate large volume change, and form stable solid electrolyte interphase in the all-organic RPB. At room temperature, the RPB delivers a high specific capacity of 188.1 mAh g −1 at 50 mA g −1 and superior cycle life of 6000 and 50000 cycles at 1 and 5 A g −1 , respectively, demonstrating an ultra-stable and fast-charging all-organic battery. The impressive performance at room temperature is extended to high temperatures, where the high-mass-loading (6.5 mg cm −2 ) all-organic RPB exhibits high-rate capability up to 2 A g −1 and a long lifetime of 500 cycles at 70–100 °C, demonstrating a superb fast-charging and high-temperature battery.

The two essential parts, sorbent material and system structure, dominate the water sorption–desorption performance and the total water productivity for SAWH system together. Attributed to the superiorities in aspects of sorption–desorption performance, scalability, and compatibility in practical SAWH devices, hygroscopic porous polymers (HPPs) as next-generation sorbents are recently going through a vast surge. However, as HPPs’ sorption mechanism, performance, and applied potential lack comprehensive and accurate guidelines, SAWH&#39;s subsequent development is restricted. To address the aforementioned problems, this review introduces HPPs’ recent development related to mechanism, performance, and application. Furthermore, corresponding optimized strategies for both HPP-based sorbent bed and coupling structural design are proposed. Finally, original research routes are directed to develop next-generation HPP-based SAWH systems. The presented guidelines and insights can influence and inspire the future development of SAWH technology, further achieving SAWH&#39;s practical applications.},

  abstract     = {To improve bone metastases treatment efficacy, current strategies are focused on the integration of chemotherapy with phototheranostic. However, the success of phototheranostic approaches is hampered by the limited tissue penetration depth of near-infrared-I (NIR-I) light (700–900 nm). In this study, a NIR-II (1000–1700 nm) excitation phototheranostic (BTZ/Fe 2+ @BTF/ALD) is presented for NIR-II fluorescence imaging and NIR-II photoacoustic imaging-guided NIR-II photothermal therapy (PTT), chemotherapy, and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) of breast cancer bone metastases. This phototheranostic is developed by integrating a dopamine-modified NIR-II absorbing donor–acceptor–donor small molecule (BBT-FT-DA), the boronate anticancer drug bortezomib (BTZ), and Fe 2+ ions, as CDT catalysts, into an amphiphilic PEGylated phospholipid modified with the bone-targeting ligand alendronate. In acidic and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) over expression tumor microenvironment, the boronate–catechol linkage is cleaved and BTZ and Fe 2+ ions are released to initiate the Fenton reaction, that is, chemotherapy and CDT, respectively, are initialized. It is confirmed using the murine 4T1 bone metastasis model that BTZ/Fe 2+ @BTF/ALD significantly suppresses the progression of tumor cells in the bone tissue via a synergistic NIR-II PTT/chemotherapy/CDT effect. Overall, this work provides fresh insights to guide the development of NIR-II phototheranostics for breast cancer bone metastases.},

ChNCs can interact with MWCNT in noncovalent ways, including π – π and hydrophobic interactions.

The charged superamphiphobic surface is overlapped with a conductor to induce free charge, creating the invisible charge wall at the overlapping boundary. The charge wall can trap droplets and polarize them into Janus charged state. It is found that the trapping degree and the charge distribution in the Janus charged droplet depend on the original surface charge on the superamphiphobic surface. The invisible charge wall can also be established at diverse boundary curvatures, allowing to design pathways for droplet manipulations. Furthermore, the enrichment of protein and nanomaterial in the manipulated Janus charged droplet is demonstrated.

It is demonstrated that nanoprotrusions of gold electrodes are essential for the fine templating of antibodies and spike proteins during molecular imprinting, and differentiation of IgG and IgM in whole blood. In the clinical setting, NFluidEX achieves 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity by testing 44 COVID-positive and 25 COVID-negative saliva and blood samples on par with the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( p &lt; 0.001, 95% confidence) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.},

Here, with the synergy of turbo stirring, a strategy for emulsion separation is demonstrated based on the bio-inspired cone array barrel. Under the centrifugal force, oil droplets in emulsion are thrown onto the cones arrayed on inner wall due to the Coriolis effect, captured by microstructures on cone surface and then penetrate out through the superhydrophobic pores, while only the remediated water remains. The separation technique maintains a high efficiency of above 99.5% for over 30 times of use, as well as for emulsions with variable ingredients. This structure-dynamics synergistic separation strategy evolves the future technologies on water purification in industrial and daily processes.},

  abstract     = {Many challenges in the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia have been recognized with most effort focused on delineating false positives resulting from unidentified sources of nitrogen. However, the influence of oxidizing anolytes on the crossover and oxidization of ammonium during the electrolysis reaction remains unexplored. Here it is reported that the use of analytes containing halide ions (Cl − and Br − ) can rapidly convert the ammonium into N 2 , which further intensifies the crossover of ammonium. Moreover, the extent of migration and oxidation of ammonium is found to be closely associated with external factors, such as applied potentials and the concentration of Cl − . These findings demonstrate the profound impact of oxidizing anolytes on the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia. Based on these results, many prior reported ammonia yield rates are calibrated. This work emphasizes the significance of avoiding selection of anolytes that can oxidize ammonium, which is believed to promote further progress in electrochemical nitrogen fixation.},

  abstract     = {Designing dense thick sulfur cathodes to gain high-volumetric/areal-capacity lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) in lean electrolytes is extremely desired. Nevertheless, the severe Li 2 S clogging and unclear mechanism seriously hinder its development. Herein, an integrated strategy is developed to manipulate Li 2 S redox kinetics of CoP/MXene catalyst via electron-donor Cu doping. Meanwhile a dense S/Cu 0.1 Co 0.9 P/MXene cathode (density = 1.95 g cm −3 ) is constructed, which presents a large volumetric capacity of 1664 Ah L −1 (routine electrolyte) and a high areal capacity of ≈8.3 mAh cm −2 (lean electrolyte of 5.0 µL mg s −1 ) at 0.1 C. Systematical thermodynamics, kinetics, and theoretical simulation confirm that electron-donor Cu doping induces the charge accumulation of Co atoms to form more chemical bonding with polysulfides, whereas weakens Co  S bonding energy and generates abundant lattice vacancies and active sites to facilitate the diffusion and catalysis of polysulfides/Li 2 S on electrocatalyst surface, thereby decreasing the diffusion energy barrier and activation energy of Li 2 S nucleation and dissolution, boosting Li 2 S redox kinetics, and inhibiting shuttling in the dense thick sulfur cathode. This work deeply understands the atomic-level manipulation mechanism of Li 2 S redox kinetics and provides dependable principles for designing high-volumetric-energy-density, lean-electrolyte LSBs through integrating bidirectional electro-catalysts with manipulated Li 2 S redox and dense-sulfur engineering.},

The external electric field and hydrogel are two independent methods enabling low-energy water evaporation. However, the complicated external equipment for generating an electric field and the restricted activation area of hydrogels significantly limit their practical application in steam generation. Thus, a piezoelectric fiber membrane is embedded into a highly hydratable light-absorbing poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel for synergistic water activation. The integrated evaporator is capable of continuously converting the wave energy reserved in the ocean into electrical energy, activating the water in the hydrogel. It is found that the activation effect leads to an improvement of over 23% compared to a non-piezoelectric hydrogel evaporator. This work provides an evaporation prototype based on the synergistic water activation of wave-triggered electricity and highly hydratable hydrogel.},

  abstract     = {Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) are expected to power the Internet of Things ecosystem, which is attracting ever-increasing attention as part of the rapidly developing distributed communications and electronics technology. The power conversion efficiency of IPVs strongly depends on the match between typical indoor light spectra and the band gap of the light absorbing layer. Therefore, band-gap tunable materials, such as metal-halide perovskites, are specifically promising candidates for approaching the indoor illumination efficiency limit of ∼56%. However, perovskite materials with ideal band gap for indoor application generally contain high bromine (Br) contents, causing inferior open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). By fabricating a series of wide-bandgap perovskites (Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 PbI 3− x Br x , 0.6 ≤ x ≤ 1.6) with varying Br contents and related band gaps, it is found that, the high Br vacancy (V Br ) defect density is a significant reason that leading to large V OC deficits apart from the well-accepted halide segregation. The introduction of I-rich alkali metal small-molecule compounds is demonstrated to suppress the V Br and increase the V OC of perovskite IPVs up to 1.05 V under 1000 lux light-emitting diode illumination, one of the highest V OC values reported so far. More importantly, the modules are sent for independent certification and have gained a record efficiency of 36.36%.},

The presented high onset potential of 0.9 V RHE attracts much attention and shows that the Cu 3 BiS 3 thin films are quite good as an efficient solar water splitting photoelectrode. However, the CdS buffer does not fit the Cu 3 BiS 3 thin film: the conduction band offset between CdS and Cu 3 BiS 3 reaches 0.7 eV, and such a high conduction band offset (CBO) significantly increases the interfacial recombination ratio and is the main reason for the relatively low photocurrent of the Cu 3 BiS 3 /CdS photoelectrode. In this study, the In x Cd 1− x S buffer layer is found to be significantly lowered the CBO of CBS/buffer and that the In incorporation ratio of the buffer influences the CBO value of the CBS/buffer. The Pt-TiO 2 /In 0.6 Cd 0.4 S/Cu 3 BiS 3 photocathode exhibits an appreciable photocurrent density of ≈12.20 mA cm −2 at 0 V RHE with onset potential of more than 0.9 V RHE , and the ABPE of the Cu 3 BiS 3 -based photocathode reaches the highest value of 3.13%.

Herein, the nitrogen evolution on hierarchical and atomistic Ni–N–C electrocatalyst, mainly pertaining to the essential subtraction, reservation and coordination of nitrogen atoms, is manipulated to attain favorable Li–S pouch cell performances. Such rational evolution behavior realizes the “nitrogen balance” in simultaneously regulating the Ni–N coordination environment, Ni single atom loading, abundant vacancy defects, active nitrogen and electron conductivity, and maximizing the electrocatalytic activity elevation of Ni–N–C system. With such merit, the cathode harvests favorable performances in a soft-packaged pouch cell prototype even under high sulfur mass loading and lean electrolyte usage.

The intermolecular forces governing the assembly of vdW heterostructures are investigated by first-principles models, yet translating the outcome of these models to macroscopic observables in layered crystals is missing. Establishing this connection is, therefore, crucial for ultimately designing advanced materials of choice-tailoring the composition to functional device properties. Herein, components from both vdW and non-vdW forces are integrated to build a comprehensive framework that can quantitatively describe the dynamics of these forces in action. Specifically, it is shown that the optical band gap of layered crystals possesses a peculiar ionic character that works as a quantitative indicator of non-vdW forces. Using these two components, it is then described why only a narrow range of exfoliation energies for this class of materials is observed. These findings unlock the microscopic origin of universal binding energy in layered crystals and provide a general protocol to identify and synthesize new crystals to regulate vdW coupling in the next generation of heterostructures.},

Here, polymeric nanoparticles that deliver chemotherapeutics and scavenge proinflammatory factors simultaneously to inhibit chemotherapy-induced breast cancer metastasis are developed. The cationic nanoparticles can adsorb cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) based on charge–charge interaction, which downregulates the expression of Toll-like receptors and then reduces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Through in vitro structural optimization, cationic polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers modified with drug-binding dodecyl groups and diethylethanolamine surface groups (PAMAM-G3-C12 5 -DEEA 20 ) exhibit the most desirable combination of nanoparticle size (≈140 nm), drug loading, cytotoxicity, cfNA binding, and anti-inflammatory activity. In the mouse models of breast cancer metastasis, paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles reduce serum levels of cfNAs and inflammatory cytokines compared with paclitaxel treatment alone and inhibit both primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis. Additionally, no significant side effects are detected in the serum or major organs. These results provide a strategy to deliver chemotherapeutics to primary tumors while reducing the prometastatic effects of chemotherapy.},

Transition metal nitrides anode materials have exhibited high-energy density and superior rate capability; however, the intrinsic mechanism is largely unexplored and still unclear. Here, a typical 3D porous Fe 2 N micro-coral anode is prepared and, an intercalation–conversion–heterogeneity hybrid Li-ion storage mechanism that is beyond the conventional intercalation or conversion reaction is revealed through various characterization techniques and thermodynamic analysis. Interestingly, using advanced in situ magnetometry, the ratio (ca. 24.4%) of the part where conversion reaction occurs to the entire Fe 2 N can further be quantified. By rationally constructing a Li-ion capacitor comprising 3D porous Fe 2 N micro-corals anode and commercial AC cathode, the hybrid full device delivers a high energy-density (157 Wh kg −1 ) and high power-density (20 000 W kg −1 ), as well as outstanding cycling stability (93.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).

Here, a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen is performed using an engineered cell line IFNB-P2A-GSDMD-N , and ATP13A1, a putative dislocase located on the endoplasmic reticulum, is identified as an important regulator of RIG-I pathway. ATP13A1 deficiency abolishes RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response due to compromised MAVS stability and crippled signaling potency of residual MAVS. Moreover, it is discovered that MAVS is subject to protease-mediated degradation in the absence of ATP13A1.

Here, a fibril-type textile pseudocapacitor electrode with outstanding capacity, good rate capability, and excellent mechanical stability through controlled interfacial interaction-induced electroplating is reported. First, tetraoctylammonium bromide-stabilized copper sulfide nanoparticles (TOABr-CuS NPs) are uniformly assembled onto cotton textiles. This approach converts insulating textiles to conductive textiles preserving their intrinsically porous structure with an extremely large surface area. For the preparation of textile current collector with bulk metal-like electrical conductivity, Ni is additionally electroplated onto the CuS NP-assembled textiles (i.e., Ni-EPT). Furthermore, a pseudocapacitive NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) layer is subsequently electroplated onto Ni-EPT for the cathode. The formed NiCo-LDH electroplated textiles (i.e., NiCo-EPT) exhibit a high areal capacitance of 12.2 F cm −2 (at 10 mA cm −2 ), good rate performance, and excellent cycling stability. Particularly, the areal capacity of NiCo-EPT can be further increased through their subsequent stacking. The 3-stack NiCo-EPT delivers an unprecedentedly high areal capacitance of 28.8 F cm −2 (at 30 mA cm −2 ), which outperforms those of textile-based pseudocapacitor electrodes reported to date.},

However, the computational expenditure limits the growth of protein trajectory-related studies, thus hindering the possibility of supervised learning. A spatial-temporal pre-training method based on the modified equivariant graph matching networks, dubbed ProtMD which has two specially designed self-supervised learning tasks: atom-level prompt-based denoising generative task and conformation-level snapshot ordering task to seize the flexibility information inside molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories with very fine temporal resolutions is presented. The ProtMD can grant the encoder network the capacity to capture the time-dependent geometric mobility of conformations along MD trajectories. Two downstream tasks are chosen to verify the effectiveness of ProtMD through linear detection and task-specific fine-tuning. A huge improvement from current state-of-the-art methods, with a decrease of 4.3% in root mean square error for the binding affinity problem and an average increase of 13.8% in the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall curve for the ligand efficacy problem is observed.

  abstract     = {Because of its less toxicity and electronic structure analogous to that of lead, tin halide perovskite (THP) is currently one of the most favorable candidates as an active layer for optoelectronic and electric devices such as solar cells, photodiodes, and field-effect transistors (FETs). Promising photovoltaics and FETs performances have been recently demonstrated because of their desirable electrical and optical properties. Nevertheless, THP&#39;s easy oxidation from Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ , easy formation of tin vacancy, uncontrollable film morphology and crystallinity, and interface instability severely impede its widespread application. This review paper aims to provide a basic understanding of THP as a semiconductor by highlighting the physical structure, energy band structure, electrical properties, and doping mechanisms. Additionally, the key chemical instability issues of THPs are discussed, which are identified as the potential bottleneck for further device development. Based on the understanding of the THPs properties, the key recent progress of THP-based solar cells and FETs is briefly discussed. To conclude, current challenges and perspective opportunities are highlighted.},

In this contribution, an aptamer-embedded hierarchical DNA nanocluster (Apt-eNC) is constructed as an intelligent carrier for cancer-targeted drug delivery. Specifically, Apt-eNC is designed to have a built-in reserve pool in the interior cavity from which aptamers may move outward to function as needed. When surface aptamers are degraded, ones in reserve pool can move outward to offer the compensation, thereby magically preserving tumor-targeting performance in vivo. Even if withstanding extensive aptamer depletion, Apt-eNC displays a 115-fold enhanced cell targeting compared with traditional counterparts and at least 60-fold improved tumor accumulation. Moreover, one Apt-eNC accommodates 5670 chemotherapeutic agents. As such, when systemically administrated into HeLa tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mouse model, drug-loaded Apt-eNC significantly inhibits tumor growth without systemic toxicity, holding great promise for high precision therapy.},

Thermally activated polymerization of thioctic acid ( TA ) enabled the bulk construction of poly( TA ), and yielded unique time-dependent self-assembly. Freshly prepared poly( TA ) can spontaneously and continuously transfer into higher-molecular-weight species and low-molecular-weight TA monomers. Poly( TA ) and the newly formed TA further assembled into self-reinforcing materials via microscopic-phase separation. Bottom-up self-assembly patterns on different scales are fully realized by 3D FDM printing of poly( TA ): thermally induced polymerization of TA (microscopic-scale assembly) to poly( TA ) and 3D printing (macroscopic-scale assembly) of poly( TA ) are simultaneously achieved in the 3D-printing process; after 3D printing, the poly( TA ) modes show mechanically enhanced features over time, arising from the microscopic self-assembly of poly( TA ) and TA . This study clearly demonstrates that micro- and macroscopic bottom-up self-assembly can be applied in 3D additive manufacturing.},

During sensing processes, the dynamic gas–solid interface interactions play crucial roles in improving sensors’ performance, and most studies emphasize the gas–MOS chemical reactions. Herein, from a new view angle focusing more on physical gas–solid interactions during gas sensing, basic theory overview and latest progress for the dynamic process of gas molecules including adsorption, desorption, and diffusion, are systematically summarized and elucidated. The unique electronic sensing mechanisms are also discussed from various aspects including molecular interaction models, gas diffusion mechanism, and interfacial reaction behaviors, where structure–activity relationship and diffusion behavior are overviewed in detail. Especially, the surface adsorption–desorption dynamics are discussed and evaluated, and their potential effects on sensing performance are elucidated from the gas–solid interfacial regulation perspective.

Rotational Doppler effect provides an intuitive paradigm to shifting the frequency in a linear system which, however, needs a spiral-phase change upon the wave propagation. Here a rotating passive linear vortex metasurface is numerically and experimentally presented with close-to-unity mode purity (&gt;93%) and high conversion efficiency (&gt;65%) in audible sound frequency as low as 3000 Hz. The topological charge of the transmitted sound is almost immune from the rotational speed and transmissivity, demonstrating the mechanical robustness and stability in adjusting the high-performance frequency conversion in situ. These features enable the researchers to cascade multiple vortex metasurfaces to further enlarge and diversify the extent of sound frequency conversion, which are experimentally verified. This strategy takes a step further toward the freewheeling sound manipulation at acoustic frequency domain, and may have far-researching impacts in various acoustic communications, signal processing, and contactless detection.},

  abstract     = {Actinide materials have various applications that range from nuclear energy to quantum computing. Most current efforts have focused on bulk actinide materials. Tuning functional properties by using strain engineering in epitaxial thin films is largely lacking. Using uranium dioxide (UO 2 ) as a model system, in this work, the authors explore strain engineering in actinide epitaxial thin films and investigate the origin of induced ferromagnetism in an antiferromagnet UO 2 . It is found that UO 2+ x thin films are hypostoichiometric ( x &lt;0) with in-plane tensile strain, while they are hyperstoichiometric ( x &gt;0) with in-plane compressive strain. Different from strain engineering in non-actinide oxide thin films, the epitaxial strain in UO 2 is accommodated by point defects such as vacancies and interstitials due to the low formation energy. Both epitaxial strain and strain relaxation induced point defects such as oxygen/uranium vacancies and oxygen/uranium interstitials can distort magnetic structure and result in magnetic moments. This work reveals the correlation among strain, point defects and ferromagnetism in strain engineered UO 2+ x thin films and the results offer new opportunities to understand the influence of coupled order parameters on the emergent properties of many other actinide thin films.},

  abstract     = {The activity of lithium ions in electrolytes depends on their solvation structures. However, the understanding of changes in Li + activity is still elusive in terms of interactions between lithium ions and solvent molecules. Herein, the chelating effect of lithium ion by forming [Li(15C5)] + gives rise to a decrease in Li + activity, leading to the negative potential shift of Li metal anode. Moreover, weakly solvating lithium ions in ionic liquids, such as [Li(TFSI) 2 ] − (TFSI = bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), increase in Li + activity, resulting in the positive potential shift of LiFePO 4 cathode. This allows the development of innovative high energy density Li metal batteries, such as 3.8 V class Li | LiFePO 4 cells, along with introducing stable biphasic electrolytes. In addition, correlation between Li + activity, cell potential shift, and Li + solvation structure is investigated by comparing solvated Li + ions with carbonate solvents, chelated Li + ions with cyclic and linear ethers, and weakly solvating Li + ions in ionic liquids. These findings elucidate a broader understanding of the complex origin of Li + activity and provide an opportunity to achieve high energy density lithium metal batteries.},

  abstract     = {The lateral eyes of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus , are the largest compound eyes within recent Arthropoda. The cornea of these eyes contains hundreds of inward projecting elongated cuticular cones and concentrate light onto proximal photoreceptor cells. Although this visual system has been extensively studied before, the precise mechanism allowing vision has remained controversial. Correlating high-resolution quantitative refractive index (RI) mapping and structural analysis, it is demonstrated how gradients of RI in the cornea stem from structural and compositional gradients in the cornea. In particular, these RI variations result from the chitin-protein fibers architecture, heterogeneity in protein composition, and bromine doping, as well as spatial variation in water content resulting from matrix cross-linking on the one hand and cuticle porosity on the other hand. Combining the realistic cornea structure and measured RI gradients with full-wave optical modeling and ray tracing, it is revealed that the light collection mechanism switches from refraction-based graded index (GRIN) optics at normal light incidence to combined GRIN and total internal reflection mechanism at high incident angles. The optical properties of the cornea are governed by different mechanisms at different hierarchical levels, demonstrating the remarkable versatility of arthropod cuticle.},

Lipids secreted from obese adipose tissue are accumulated in peripheral tissues such as the liver, pancreas, and muscle, and impair insulin sensitivity causing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Furthermore, the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines and lipids in the liver induces apoptosis and fibrogenesis, and ultimately causes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To modulate obese tissue environments, it is challenged to selectively deliver inducers of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to adipose tissue with the aid of a prohibitin targeting drug delivery system. Prohibitin binding peptide (PBP), an oligopeptide targeting prohibitin rich in adipose tissue, is conjugated on the surface of Hemin- or CoPP-loaded poly(lactide- co -glycolide) nanoparticles (PBP-NPs). PBP-NPs efficiently differentiate lipid storing white adipocytes into energy-generating brown adipocytes in T2DM and NASH models. In addition, PBP-NPs are found to target prohibitin overexpressed fatty liver in the NASH model and inhibit hepatic uptake of circulating lipids. Furthermore, PBP-NPs switch phenotypes of inflammatory macrophages in damaged organs and lower inflammation. Taken together, dual-targeted induction of HO-1 in fatty adipose and liver tissues is proven to be a promising therapeutic strategy to ameliorate obesity, insulin resistance, and steatohepatitis by lowering lipids and cytokines.},

  abstract     = {Photodiodes are fundamental components in modern optoelectronics. Heterojunction photodiodes, simply configured by two different contact materials, have been a hot research topic for many years. Currently reported self-biased heterojunction photodiodes routinely have external quantum efficiency (EQE) significantly below 100% due to optical and electrical losses. Herein, an approach that virtually overcomes this 100% EQE challenge via low-aspect-ratio nanostructures and drift-dominated photocarrier transport in a heterojunction photodiode is proposed. Broadband near-ideal EQE is achieved in nanocrystal indium tin oxide/black silicon ( nc -ITO/ b -Si) Schottky photodiodes. The b -Si comprises nanostalagmites which balance the antireflection effect and surface morphology. The built-in electric field is explored to match the optical generation profile, realizing enhanced photocarrier transport over a broadband of photogeneration. The devices exhibit unprecedented EQE among the reported leading-edge heterojunction photodiodes: average EQE surpasses ≈98% for wavelengths of 570–925 nm, while overall EQE is greater than ≈95% from 500 to 960 nm. Further, only elementary fabrication techniques are explored to achieve these excellent device properties. A heart rate sensor driven by nanowatt faint light is demonstrated, indicating the enormous potential of this near-ideal b -Si photodiode for low power consuming applications.},

  abstract     = {Soft robots are of increasing interest as they can cope with challenges that are poorly addressed by conventional rigid-body robots (e.g., limited flexibility). However, due to their flexible nature, the soft robots can be particularly prone to exploit modular designs for enhancing their reconfigurability, that is, a concept which, to date, has not been explored. Therefore, this paper presents a design of soft building blocks that can be disassembled and reconfigured to build different modular configurations of soft robots such as robotic fingers and continuum robots. First, a numerical model is developed for the constitutive building block allowing to understand their behavior versus design parameters, then a shape optimization algorithm is developed to permit the construction of different types of soft robots based on these soft building blocks. To validate the approach, 2D and 3D case studies of bio-inspired designs are demonstrated: first, soft fingers are introduced as a case study for grasping complex and delicate objects. Second, an elephant trunk is used for grasping a flower. Third, a walking legged robot. These case studies prove that the proposed modular building approach makes it easier to build and reconfigure different types of soft robots with multiple complex shapes.},

  abstract     = {Soft magnetic high-entropy alloy thin films (HEATFs) exhibit remarkable freedom of material-structure design and physical-property tailoring, as well as, high cut-off frequencies and outstanding electrical resistivities, making them potential candidates for high-frequency magnetic devices. In this study, a CoCrFeNi film with excellent soft magnetic properties is developed by forming a novel core–shell structure via native oxidation, with ferromagnetic elements Fe, Co, and Ni as the core and the Cr oxide as the shell layer. The core–shell structure enables a high saturation magnetization, enhances the electrical resistivity, and thus reduces the eddy-current loss. For further optimizing the soft magnetic properties, O is deliberately introduced into the HEATFs, and the O-incorporated HEATFs exhibit an electrical resistivity of 237 µΩ·cm, a saturation magnetization of 535 emu cm −3 , and a coercivity of 23 A m −1 . The factors that determine the ferromagnetism and coercivity of the CoCrFeNi-based HEATFs are examined in detail by evaluating the microstructures, magnetic domains, chemical valency, and 3D microscopic compositional distributions of the prepared films. These results are anticipated to provide insights into the magnetic behaviors of soft magnetic HEATFs, as well as aid in the construction of a promising material-design strategy for these unique materials.},

  abstract     = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden kidney dysfunction caused by aberrant reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism that results in high clinical mortality. The rapid development of ROS scavengers provides new opportunities for AKI treatment. Herein, the use of hydrogen-terminated germanene (H-germanene) nanosheets is reported as an antioxidative defense nanoplatform against AKI in mice. The simulation results show that 2D H-germanene can effectively scavenge ROS through free radical adsorption and subsequent redox reactions. In particular, the H-germanene exhibits high accumulation in injured kidneys, thereby offering a favorable opportunity for treating renal diseases. In the glycerol-induced murine AKI model, H-germanene delivers robust antioxidative protection against ROS attack to maintain normal kidney function indicators without negative influence in vivo. This positive in vivo antioxidative defense in living animals demonstrates that the present H-germanene nanoplatform is a powerful antioxidant against AKI and various anti-inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract     = {Using multistable mechanical metamaterials to develop deployable structures, electrical devices, and mechanical memories raises two unanswered questions. First, can mechanical instability be programmed to design sensors and memory devices? Second, how can mechanical properties be tuned at the post-fabrication stage via external stimuli? Answering these questions requires a thorough understanding of the snapping sequences and variations of the elastic energy in multistable metamaterials. The mechanics of deformation sequences and continuous force/energy–displacement curves are comprehensively unveiled here. A 1D array, that is chain, of bistable cells is studied to explore instability-induced energy release and snapping sequences under one external mechanical stimulus. This method offers an insight into the programmability of multistable chains, which is exploited to fabricate a mechanical sensor/memory with sampling (analog to digital-A/D) and data reconstruction (digital to analog-D/A) functionalities operating based on the correlation between the deformation sequence and the mechanical input. The findings offer a new paradigm for developing programmable high-capacity read–write mechanical memories regardless of thei size scale. Furthermore, exotic mechanical properties can be tuned by harnessing the attained programmability of multistable chains. In this respect, a transversely multistable mechanical metamaterial with tensegrity-like bistable cells is designed to showcase the tunability of chirality.},

  abstract     = {Among extensively studied Li-ion cathode materials, LiCoO 2 (LCO) remains dominant for portable electronic applications. Although its theoretical capacity (274 mAh g −1 ) cannot be achieved in Li cells, high capacity (≤240 mAh g −1 ) can be obtained by raising the charging voltage up to 4.6 V. Unfortunately, charging Li-LCO cells to high potentials induces surface and structural instabilities that result in rapid degradation of cells containing LCO cathodes. Yet, significant stabilization is achieved by surface coatings that promote formation of robust passivation films and prevent parasitic interactions between the electrolyte solutions and the cathodes particles. In the search for effective coatings, the authors propose RbAlF 4 modified LCO particles. The coated LCO cathodes demonstrate enhanced capacity (&gt;220 mAh g −1 ) and impressive retention of &gt;80/77% after 500/300 cycles at 30/45 °C. A plausible mechanism that leads to the superior stability is proposed. Finally the authors demonstrate that the main reason for the degradation of 4.6 V cells is the instability of the anode side rather than the failure of the coated cathodes.},

  abstract     = {Axonal projection conveys neural information. The divergent and diverse projections of individual neurons imply the complexity of information flow. It is necessary to investigate the relationship between the projection and functional information at the single neuron level for understanding the rules of neural circuit assembly, but a gap remains due to a lack of methods to map the function to whole-brain projection. Here an approach is developed to bridge two-photon calcium imaging in vivo with high-resolution whole-brain imaging based on sparse labeling with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6. Reliable whole-brain projections are captured by the high-definition fluorescent micro-optical sectioning tomography (HD-fMOST). A cross-modality cell matching is performed and the functional annotation of whole-brain projection at the single-neuron level (FAWPS) is obtained. Applying it to the layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons in mouse visual cortex, the relationship is investigated between functional preferences and axonal projection features. The functional preference of projection motifs and the correlation between axonal length in MOs and neuronal orientation selectivity, suggest that projection motif-defined neurons form a functionally specific information flow, and the projection strength in specific targets relates to the information clarity. This pipeline provides a new way to understand the principle of neuronal information transmission.},

The uptake and accumulation of nanoplastics by crops contaminate the food chain and pose unexpected risks to human health. However, whether nanoplastics can enter grains and their impact on the grains of crop grown in contaminated soil is still unknown. Here, the translocation of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in crops, including peanut ( Arachis hypogaea L.) and rice ( Oryza sativa L.) is investigated. It is demonstrated PS-NPs translocation from the root and accumulation in the grains at the maturation stage. The treatment with PS-NPs (250 mg kg −1 ) increases the empty-shell numbers of rice grain by 35.45%, thereby decreasing the seed-setting rate of rice by 3.02%, and also decreases the average seed weight of peanuts by 3.45%. Moreover, PS-NPs exerted adverse effects on nutritional quality, such as decreasing the content of mineral elements, amino acids, and unsaturated fatty acids. To the knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of nanoplastics in the grains of crop plants grown in soil containing nanoplastics, and the results highlight the impact of nanoplastics on the yield and nutritional quality of crop grains.},

Their working principle is based on electrically stimulated materials changes that allow access to two (digital), multiple (multilevel), or quasi-continuous (analog) resistive states. However, the stochastic nature of forming and switching the conductive pathway involves complex atomistic defect configurations resulting in considerable variability. This paper reveals that the intricate interplay of 0D and 2D defects can be engineered to achieve reproducible and controlled low-voltage formation of conducting filaments. The author find that the orientation of grain boundaries in polycrystalline HfO x is directly related to the required forming voltage of the conducting filaments, unravelling a neglected origin of variability. Based on the realistic atomic structure of grain boundaries obtained from ultra-high resolution imaging combined with first-principles calculations including local strain, this paper shows how oxygen vacancy segregation energies and the associated electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level govern the formation of conductive pathways in memristive devices. These findings are applicable to non-amorphous valence change filamentary type memristive device. The results demonstrate that a fundamental atomistic understanding of defect chemistry is pivotal to design memristors as key element of future electronics.},

Herein, an indium-based organic framework of InOF-1 can be thermally carbonized under inert argon to form indium particles through the redox reaction between nanosized indium oxide and carbon matrix. In particular, a type of porous hollow carbon nanostraw (HCNS) is in situ obtained by combining the fusion and removal of indium within the decarboxylation process. The as-synthesized HCNS, which possesses more charge active sites, short and quick electron, and ion transport pathways, has become an excellent carrier for electrochemically active species such as iodine with its unique internal cavity and interconnected porous structure on the tube wall. Furthermore, the assembled zinc-iodine batteries (ZIBs) provide a high capacity of 234.1 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 , which ensures that the adsorption and dissolution of iodine species in the electrolyte reach a rapid equilibrium. The rate and cycle performance of the HCNS-based ZIBs are greatly improved, thereby exhibiting an excellent capacity retention rate. It shows a better electrochemical exchange capacity than typical unidirectional carbon nanotubes, making HCNS an ideal cathode material for a new generation of high-performance batteries.},

  abstract     = {Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is the primary regulator of necroptotic cell death. RIPK3 expression is often silenced in various cancer cells, which suggests that it may have tumor suppressor properties. However, the exact mechanism by which RIPK3 negatively regulates cancer development and progression remains unclear. This report indicates that RIPK3 acts as a potent regulator of the homeostatic proliferation of CD4 + CD8 + double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Abnormal proliferation of RIPK3-deficient DP thymocytes occurs independently of the well-known role for RIPK3 in necroptosis (upstream of MLKL activation), and is associated with an incidental thymic mass, likely thymic hyperplasia. In addition, Ripk3 -null mice develop increased thymic tumor formation accompanied by reduced host survival in the context of an N -ethyl- N -nitrosourea (ENU)-induced tumor model. Moreover, RIPK3 deficiency in p53 -null mice promotes thymic lymphoma development via upregulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, which correlates with markedly reduced survival rates. Mechanistically, lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) activates RIPK3, which in turn leads to increases in the phosphatase activity of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), thereby suppressing hyper-activation of ERK in DP thymocytes. Overall, these findings suggest that a RIPK3-PP2A-ERK signaling axis regulates DP thymocyte homeostasis and may provide a potential therapeutic target to improve thymic lymphoma therapies.},

  abstract     = {Advanced exfoliation techniques are crucial for exploring the intrinsic properties and applications of 2D materials. Though the recently discovered Au-enhanced exfoliation technique provides an effective strategy for the preparation of large-scale 2D crystals, the high cost of gold hinders this method from being widely adopted in industrial applications. In addition, direct Au contact could significantly quench photoluminescence (PL) emission in 2D semiconductors. It is therefore crucial to find alternative metals that can replace gold to achieve efficient exfoliation of 2D materials. Here, the authors present a one-step Ag-assisted method that can efficiently exfoliate many large-area 2D monolayers, where the yield ratio is comparable to Au-enhanced exfoliation method. Differing from Au film, however, the surface roughness of as-prepared Ag films on SiO 2 /Si substrate is much higher, which facilitates the generation of surface plasmons resulting from the nanostructures formed on the rough Ag surface. More interestingly, the strong coupling between 2D semiconductor crystals (e.g., MoS 2 , MoSe 2 ) and Ag film leads to a unique PL enhancement that has not been observed in other mechanical exfoliation techniques, which can be mainly attributed to enhanced light-matter interaction as a result of extended propagation of surface plasmonic polariton (SPP). This work provides a lower-cost and universal Ag-assisted exfoliation method, while at the same time offering enhanced SPP-matter interactions.},

  abstract     = {Metallic Li is one of the most promising anodes for high-energy secondary batteries. However, the enormous volume changes and severe dendrite formation during the Li plating/stripping process hinder the practical application of Li metal anodes (LMAs). We have developed a sulfate-assisted strategy to synthesize a self-standing host composed of N,S-doped porous carbon nanobelts embedded with MoS 2 nanosheets (MoS 2 @NSPCB) for use in LMAs. In situ measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the uniformly distributed MoS 2 derivatives within the carbon nanobelts serve as stable lithiophilic sites which effectively homogenize Li nucleation and suppress dendrite formation. In addition, the hierarchical porosity and 3D nanobelt networks ensure fast Li-ion diffusion and accommodate the volume change of Li deposits during the plating/stripping process. As a result, a Li–Li symmetric cell using the MoS 2 @NSPCB host operates steadily over 1500 h with an ultralow voltage hysteresis (≈24.2 mV) at 3 mA cm −2 /3 mAh cm −2 . When paired with a LiFePO 4 cathode, the current collector-free LMA endows the full cell with a high energy density of 460 Wh kg −1 and good cycling performance (with a capacity retention of ≈70% even after 1600 cycles at 10 C).},

Herein, a few-atomic-layered Co-doped BiOBr nanosheet (Co-UTBiOBr) is prepared via one-step hydrothermal method and a free-standing flexible electrode consisting of Co-UTBiOBr and CNTs is designed. Ultrathin nanosheet (3 atomic layers) and CNTs accelerate Zn 2+ and electron transfer respectively. The Co-doping is conducive to the reduced Zn 2+ diffusion barrier, the improved volume expansion after Zn 2+ intercalation, and the enhanced electronic conductivity of BiOBr, verified by experimental and theoretical studies. An insertion-conversion mechanism is proposed according to ex situ characterizations. Benefiting from many advantages, Co-UTBiOBr displays a high capacity of 150 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 and a long-term cyclic life with ≈100% capacity attention over 3000 cycles at 1 A g −1 . Remarkably, excellent electrochemical performances are maintained even at an ultrahigh mass loading of 15 mg cm −2 .

  abstract     = {Cancer photo-immunotherapy (CPIT) as an ideal strategy can rapidly release hostile signals by appropriate dosage of focal laser irradiation to unmask primary tumor immunogenicity and can activate adaptive immunity to control distant metastases. However, many factors, including disordered immunometabolism, poor penetration of photothermal agents and immuno-regulators, inadequate laser penetration into the deep tumor region, restrict the therapeutic outcomes of CPIT. Here, a second near-infrared window (NIR-II) photo-immunometabolic cancer therapy (PICT) by a programmed raspberry-structured nanoadjuvant (PRN MT ) is presented that can potentiates efficient immunogenic cell death (ICD) in deep tumor tissue and alleviates immunometabolic disorder. The PRN MT is architected through self-assembly of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) inhibitor modified small-sized CuS nanoparticles (CuS 5 ) and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsive cationized polymeric matrix. The TME can trigger the splitting and surface cationization of PRN MT into small cationized CuS 5 that feature high transcytosis potential and TME immunometabolic regulation. Upon NIR-II irradiation, CuS 5 induce homogeneous ICD and release immunometabolic regulator in deep tumor tissues, which ameliorates IDO-1 mediated immunometabolic disorder and further suppresses regulatory T cells infiltration. PRN MT mediated PICT effectively delays the primary murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 tumor growth and inhibits the lethal pulmonary metastasis in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade.},

The PM6:PM6TPO:PY-IT based ternary devices exhibit impressive PCE of 17.0% with enhanced light absorption and optimal morphology, and the introduction of PM6TPO significantly reduces the phase separation. The ternary devices also exhibit improved stability, outstanding tolerance of active layer thickness, and high performance of 1 cm 2 unit cells.

  abstract     = {Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can adapt to changes in cellular geometric cues; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Using 2D micropatterned substrates to engineer cell geometry, it is found that in comparison with an elongated geometry, a square-shaped geometry causes the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), hypermethylation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), repression of mtDNA gene transcription, and impairment of mitochondrial function. Using irregularly arranged versus circumferentially aligned vascular grafts to control cell geometry in 3D growth, it is demonstrated that cell geometry, mtDNA methylation, and vessel contractility are closely related. DNMT1 redistribution is found to be dependent on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways. Cell elongation activates cytosolic phospholipase A2, a nuclear mechanosensor that, when inhibited, hinders AKT phosphorylation, DNMT1 nuclear accumulation, and energy production. The findings of this study provide insights into the effects of cell geometry on SMC function and its potential implications in the optimization of vascular grafts.},

Along with this, the demand for high-performance filters for 5G radio frequency (RF) front-ends keeps growing. The most popular 5G filters are constructed by piezoelectric resonators based on AlN semiconductor. However, AlN possesses a piezoelectric constant d 33 lower than 5 pm V −1 and it becomes necessary to develop novel semiconductors with larger piezoelectric constant. In this work, it is shown that strong piezoelectricity exists in ε -Ga 2 O 3 . High-quality phase-pure ε -Ga 2 O 3 thin films with a relatively low residual stress are prepared. A switching spectroscopy piezoelectric force microscope (SS-PFM) measurement is carried out and the piezoelectric constant d 33 of ε -Ga 2 O 3 is determined to be ≈10.8–11.2 pm V −1 , which is twice as large as that of AlN. For the first time, surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators are demonstrated on the ε -Ga 2 O 3 thin films and different vibration modes resonating in the GHz range are observed. The results suggest that ε -Ga 2 O 3 is a great material candidate for application in piezoelectric devices, thanks to its wide bandgap, strong piezoelectric property, small acoustic impedance, and low residual stress.},

  abstract     = {Mucus is a self-healing gel that lubricates the moist epithelium and provides protection against viruses by binding to viruses smaller than the gel&#39;s mesh size and removing them from the mucosal surface by active mucus turnover. As the primary nonaqueous components of mucus (≈0.2%–5%, wt/v), mucins are critical to this function because the dense arrangement of mucin glycans allows multivalence of binding. Following nature&#39;s example, bovine submaxillary mucins (BSMs) are assembled into “mucus-like” gels (5%, wt/v) by dynamic covalent crosslinking reactions. The gels exhibit transient liquefaction under high shear strain and immediate self-healing behavior. This study shows that these material properties are essential to provide lubricity. The gels efficiently reduce human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and genital herpes virus type 2 (HSV-2) infectivity for various types of cells. In contrast, simple mucin solutions, which lack the structural makeup, inhibit HIV-1 significantly less and do not inhibit HSV-2. Mechanistically, the prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection by BSM gels is found to be that the gels trap HIV-1 by binding to the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and suppress cytokine production during viral exposure. Therefore, the authors believe the gels are promising for further development as personal lubricants that can limit viral transmission.},

  abstract     = {Transient liquid assisted growth (TLAG) is an ultrafast non-equilibrium growth process mainly governed by kinetic parameters, which are only accessible through fast in situ characterizations. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and in situ electrical resistivity measurements are used to derive kinetic diagrams of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− x (YBCO) superconducting films prepared via TLAG and to reveal the unique peculiarities of the process. In particular, diagrams for the phase evolution and the YBCO growth rates have been built for the two TLAG routes. It is shown that TLAG transient liquids can be obtained upon the melting of two barium cuprate phases (and not just one), differentiated by their copper oxidation state. This knowledge serves as a guide to determine the processing conditions to reach high performance films at high growth rates. With proper control of these kinetic parameters, films with critical current densities of 2–2.6 MA cm −2 at 77 K and growth rates between 100–2000 nm s −1 are reached. These growth rates are 1.5–3 orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant scientific advances in the past decades, most structures around us are static and ironically outdated from a technological perspective. Static structures have limited efficiency and durability and typically perform only a single task. Adaptive structures, in contrast, adjust to different conditions, tasks, and functions. They not only offer multi-functionality but also enhanced efficiency and durability. Despite their obvious advantages over conventional structures, adaptive structures have only been limitedly used in everyday life applications. This is because adaptive structures often require sophisticated sensing, feedback, and controls, which make them costly, heavy, and complicated. To overcome this problem, here the concept of Mechanical Intelligence (MI) is introduced to promote the development of engineering systems that adapt to circumstances in a passive-automatic way. MI will offer a new paradigm for designing structural components with superior capabilities. As adaptability has been rewarded throughout evolution, nature provides one of the richest sources of inspiration for developing adaptive structures. MI explores nature-inspired mechanisms for automatic adaptability and translates them into a new generation of mechanically intelligent components. MI structures, presenting widely accessible bioinspired solutions for adaptability, will facilitate more inclusive and sustainable industrial development, reflective of Goal 9 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.},

Since the need to periodically charge and replace batteries is an economic and environmental concern, energy harvesting from external stimuli to supply electricity to batteries is increasingly being considered. Especially, in aqueous environments including electrolytes, coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn harvesters have been reported as an emerging approach for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy driven by large and reversible capacitance changes under stretching and releasing. To realize enhanced harvesting performance, experimental and computational approaches to optimize structural homogeneity and electrochemical accessible area in CNT yarns to maximize intrinsic electrochemical capacitance (IEC) and stretch-induced changes are presented here. Enhanced IEC further enables to decrease matching impedance for more energy efficient circuits with harvesters. In an ocean-like environment with a frequency from 0.1 to 1 Hz, the proposed harvester demonstrates the highest volumetric power (1.6–10.45 mW cm −3 ) of all mechanical harvesters reported in the literature to the knowledge of the authors. Additionally, a high electrical peak power of 540 W kg −1 and energy conversion efficiency of 2.15% are obtained from torsional and tensile mechanical energy.},

  abstract     = {Lanthanide ion (Ln 3+ )-doped halide double perovskites (DPs) have evoked tremendous interest due to their unique optical properties. However, Ln 3+ ions in these DPs still suffer from weak emissions due to their parity-forbidden 4f–4f electronic transitions. Herein, the local electronic structure of Ln 3+ -doped Cs 2 NaInCl 6 DPs is unveiled. Benefiting from the localized electrons of [YbCl 6 ] 3− octahedron in Cs 2 NaInCl 6 DPs, an efficient strategy of Cl − -Yb 3+ charge transfer sensitization is proposed to obtain intense near-infrared (NIR) luminescence of Ln 3+ . NIR photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) up to 39.4% of Yb 3+ in Cs 2 NaInCl 6 is achieved, which is more than three orders of magnitude higher than that (0.1%) in the well-established Cs 2 AgInCl 6 via conventional self-trapped excitons sensitization. Density functional theory calculation and Bader charge analysis indicate that the [YbCl 6 ] 3− octahedron is strongly localized in Cs 2 NaInCl 6 :Yb 3+ , which facilitates the Cl − -Yb 3+ charge transfer process. The Cl − -Yb 3+ charge transfer sensitization mechanism in Cs 2 NaInCl 6 :Yb 3+ is further verified by temperature-dependent steady-state and transient PL spectra. Furthermore, efficient NIR emission of Er 3+ with the NIR PLQY of 7.9% via the Cl − -Yb 3+ charge transfer sensitization is realized. These findings provide fundamental insights into the optical manipulation of Ln 3+ -doped halide DPs, thus laying a foundation for the future design of efficient NIR-emitting DPs.},

  abstract     = {Development of artificial biomaterials by mimicking extracellular matrix of bone tissue is a promising strategy for bone regeneration. Hydrogel has emerged as a type of viable substitute, but its inhomogeneous networks and weak mechanics greatly impede clinical applications. Here, a dual crosslinked gelling system is developed with tunable architectures and mechanics to promote osteogenic capacity. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) is designated as a rigid core surrounded by six disulfide-linked PEG shells and two 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy) groups. Thiol-disulfide exchange is employed to fabricate chemical network because of the pH-responsive “on/off” function. While self-complementary UPy motif is capable of optimizing local microstructure to enhance mechanical properties. Taking the merits of biocompatibility and high-mechanics in periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) proliferation, attachment, and osteogenesis, hybrid hydrogel exhibits outstanding osteogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, it is the first time that a key epigenetic regulator of ten-eleven translocation 2 (Tet2) is discovered to significantly elevate the continuously active the WNT/ β -catenin through Tet2/HDAC1/E-cadherin/ β -catenin signaling cascade, thereby promoting PDLSCs osteogenesis. This work represents a general strategy to design the hydrogels with customized networks and biomimetic mechanics, and illustrates underlying osteogenic mechanisms that will extend the design rationales for high-functional biomaterials in tissue engineering.},

It remains a challenge to fabricate SMRAs with complicated morphing modes (more than bending and folding), limiting their applications to simple shape-morphing and locomotion. Herein, a method integrating the ancient kirigami art and an advanced mechanical assembly method is proposed, which realizes 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-3D complicated shape-morphing and precise magnetization programming through cut-guided deformation. The kirigami-inspired SMRAs exhibit good robustness after actuating more than 10000 times. An integrated finite element analysis method is developed to quantitatively predict the shape transformation of SMRAs under magnetic actuation. By leveraging this method, a set of 3D curved responsive morphologies with programmed Gaussian curvature are fabricated (e.g., ellipsoid and saddle structures), specifically 3D multilayer structures and face-like shapes with different expressions, which are difficult to realize using previous approaches. Furthermore, a bionic-scaled soft crawling robot with significant obstacle surmounting ability is fabricated using the kirigami-inspired method. The ability of the method to achieve programmable SMRAs with versatile morphing modes may broaden its applications in soft robotics, color-switchable devices, and clinical treatments.},

However, high-voltage charging often poses a major safety threat including fatal incendiary incidents, limiting further application. Numerous researches are dedicated to the disadvantages of the overcharging process; nonetheless, the urgent demand for addressing failure mechanisms is still unfulfilled. Herein, it is revealed that overcharging induces phase heterogeneity into layered and cobalt oxide phases, and consequent “twin-like deformation” in lithium cobalt oxide. The interplay between the uncommon cobalt(III) oxide and the deformation is investigated by revealing the atomistic formation mechanism. Most importantly, abnormal cracking is discovered in the vicinity of the cobalt oxide where structural instability induces substantial contraction. In addition, surface degradation is widely observed in the crack boundary inside the particle. As unintentional overcharging can occur due to local imbalance in state-of-charge in severe operating conditions such as fast charging, the issues on overcharging should be emphasized to large extent and this study provides fundamental knowledge of overcharge by elucidating the crack development mechanism of layered cathodes, which is expected to broaden the horizon into high voltage operation.},

Diamagnetic levitation is one of the most attractive levitation schemes because it allows stable levitation at room temperature without the need for a continuous power supply. However, dissipation by eddy currents in conventional diamagnetic materials significantly limits the application potential of diamagnetically levitating systems. Here, a route toward high- Q macroscopic levitating resonators by substantially reducing eddy current damping using graphite particle based diamagnetic composites is presented. Resonators that feature quality factors Q above 450 000 and vibration lifetimes beyond one hour are demonstrated, while levitating above permanent magnets in high vacuum at room temperature. The composite resonators have a Q that is &gt;400 times higher than that of diamagnetic graphite plates. By tuning the composite particle size and density, the dissipation reduction mechanism is investigated, and the Q of the levitating resonators is enhanced. Since their estimated acceleration noise is as low as some of the best superconducting levitating accelerometers at cryogenic temperatures, the high Q and large mass of the presented composite resonators positions them as one of the most promising technologies for next generation ultra-sensitive room temperature accelerometers.},

  abstract     = {Organoids have certain cellular composition and physiological features in common with real organs, making them promising models of organ formation, function, and diseases. However, Matrigel, the commonly used animal-derived matrices in which they are developed, has limitations in mechanical adjustability and providing complex physicochemical signals. Here, the incorporation of Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanomaterial into Matrigel regulates the properties of Matrigel and exhibits satisfactory biocompatibility. The Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene Matrigel composites (MXene-Matrigel) regulate the development of Cochlear Organoids (Cochlea-Orgs), particularly in promoting the formation and maturation of organoid hair cells. Additionally, regenerated hair cells in MXene-Matrigel are functional and exhibit better electrophysiological properties compared to hair cells in Matrigel. MXene-Matrigel potentiates the amycin (mTOR) signaling pathway to promote hair cell differentiation, and mTOR signaling inhibition restrains hair cell differentiation. Moreover, MXene-Matrigel facilitates innervation establishment between regenerated hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) growing from the Cochlea modiolus in a co-culture system, as well as promotes synapse formation efficiency. The approach overcomes some limitations of the Matrigel-dependent culture system and greatly accelerates the application of nanomaterials in organoid development and research on therapies for hearing loss.},

The preliminary experimental demonstration proves that is a good ab initio predictor of He shielding potency in nano-heterophase materials, and thus, is used as a key feature for computational screening. In this context, a list of viable compounds expected to be good He-absorbing nano-phases is presented, taking into account , the neutron absorption and activation cross-sections, the elastic moduli, melting temperature, the thermodynamic compatibility, and the equilbrium wetting angle of the nano-phases with the Fe matrix as an example.},

  abstract     = {T-cell engagers (TCEs) represent a breakthrough in hematological malignancy treatment but are vulnerable to antigen escape and lack a vaccination effect. The “immunologically cold” solid tumor presents substantial challenges due to intratumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-masked CD44×PD-L1/CD3 trispecific T-cell nanoengager loaded with the STING agonist c-di-AMP (CDA) (PmTriTNE@CDA) for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is rationally designed. PmTriTNE@CDA shows tumor-specific accumulation and is preferentially unmasked in response to a weakly acidic TME to prevent on-target off-tumor toxicity. The unmasked CD44×PD-L1/CD3 trispecific T-cell nanoengager (TriTNE) targets dual tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to redirect CD8+ T cells for heterogeneous TNBC lysis while achieving PD-L1 blockade. PmTriTNE synergized with CDA to transform the cold tumor into a hot tumor, eradicate the large established TNBC tumor, and induce protective immune memory in a 4T1 orthotopic tumor model without causing obvious toxicity. PmTriTNE@CDA shows potent efficacy in cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. This study serves as a proof-of-concept demonstration of a nanobased TCEs strategy to expand therapeutic combinations that previously could not be achieved due to systemic toxicity with the aim of overcoming TNBC heterogeneity and immunotherapy resistance.},

Herein, a hybrid self-powered porous-structured tactile sensor (SPTS) is proposed by monolithically integrating a porous triboelectrification-induced electroluminescence (TIEL) component and a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator with the high charge generation in the bulk volume. At a low pressure of 10 kPa, TIEL intensity can be significantly improved by three times, which is superior to that in previous reports, with enhanced triboelectricity. Based on the enhancement brought by the porous structure and optimized parameters, the SPTS achieves significant sensing performance in both optical and electrical modes. To demonstrate the potential of practical applications, a programmable optical and electrical dual-mode HMI system is established based on SPTS to remotely control an intelligent vehicle and operate a computer game through identifying finger touch trajectories. This work not only contributes a new economical-effective methodology toward a high-performance tribo-induced self-powered tactile sensor but also facilitates the remote control of HMI with dual-mode functionality, which has broad potential applications in the fields of intelligent robots, augmented reality, flexible wearable electronics, and smart home.},

Among these, chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity are the main causes of death of cancer patients. Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity even creates a new discipline termed “cardio-oncology”. Therefore, relieving toxicities induced by chemotherapy has become a key issue for improving the survival and quality of life in cancer patients. In this work, mesenchymal stem cell exosomes with the “G-C” abundant tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN) are modified to form a decoy exosome (Exo-TDN). Exo-TDN reduces DOX-induced hepatotoxicity as the “G-C” base pairs scavenge DOX. Furthermore, Exo-TDN with cardiomyopathic peptide (Exo-TDN-PCM) is engineered for specific targeting to cardiomyocytes. Injection of Exo-TDN-PCM significantly reduces DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Interestingly, Exo-TDN-PCM can also promote macrophage polarization into the M2 type for tissue repair. In addition, those decoy exosomes do not affect the anticancer effects of DOX. This decoy exosome strategy serves as a promising therapy to reduce chemo-induced toxicity.},

Further a machine learning-based respiration classification algorithm with a set of carefully studied features as inputs is proposed and it is deployed into mobile clients. The body status of users, such as being quiet, active and coughing, can be accurately recognized by the algorithm and displayed on clients. Moreover, multiple devices can be linked to a server network to monitor a group of users and provide each user with the statistical duration of physiological activities, coughing alerts, and body health advice.

When the excitation wavelength matches the ion resonance frequency of lanthanide ions, the polarizability and the resulted scattering cross-section of nanoparticles are dramatically enhanced. It is demonstrated that these purposely engineered nanoparticles can be used for interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy.

Here, the microbiomes of saliva, nasal cavity, oropharyngeal area, and bronchoalveolar lavage samples are profiled and the shaping process of multisource microbes on the lung microbiota is measured. It is found that oral and nasal microbial inputs jointly shape the lung microbiota by occupying different ecological niches. It is also observed that the spread of oral microbes to the lungs is heterogeneous, with more oral microbes entering the lungs being associated with decreased lung function and increased lung proinflammatory cytokines.

However, the present doping methodologies for organic semiconductors (OSCs) are either inefficient or can only apply to some OSCs conditionally, seriously limiting their general applications. Herein, a novel p-doping mechanism is revealed by investigating the interactions between the dopant trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate (TrTPFB) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). It is found that electrophilic attack of the trityl cations on thiophenes results in the formation of tritylated thiophenium ions, which subsequently induce electron transfer from neighboring P3HT chains to realize p-doping. This unique p-doping mechanism enables TrTPFB to p-dope various OSCs including those with high ionization energy (IE ≈ 5.8 eV). Moreover, this doping mechanism endows TrTPFB with strong doping capability, leading to doping efficiency of over 80% in P3HT. The discovery and elucidation of this novel doping mechanism not only points out that strong electrophiles are a class of efficient p-dopants for OSCs, but also provides new opportunities toward highly efficient doping of various OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Genetically arming new chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on T cells is a prevalent method to fulfill CAR-T immunotherapy. However, this approach fails to completely address the poor infiltration, complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM), and insufficient immune cells, which are recognized as the three dominant hurdles to discouraging the trafficking and persistence of CAR-T and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapies against solid tumors. To address the three hurdles, a sonoimmunity-engineered nanoplatform is designed in which a rattle-type-structured carrier enables intraparticle-double-scattering to generate massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the sonodynamic process. Abundant ROS accumulation can directly kill tumor cells, release antigens, and activate systematic immune responses for expanding effector T or CAR-T cells, while alleviating ITM via immunosuppressive macrophage polarization and reduction in pro-tumorigenic cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the co-loaded phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors release nitric oxide (NO) to impel vascular normalization and open the infiltration barrier (IB) for allowing more T cells to enter into the tumor. Systematic experiments demonstrate the feasibility of such intraparticle-double-scattering-decoded sonogenetics in the sonoimmunity-engineered nanoplatforms for expanding effector T or CAR-T cells, thereby promoting their infiltration into tumors and alleviating ITM. These compelling actions lead to excellent CAR-T and ICB immunotherapies against solid tumors with repressed tumor metastasis.},

  abstract     = {The prevalence of background hole doping in tin halide perovskites usually dominates their recombination dynamics. The addition of excess Sn halide source to the precursor solution is the most frequently used approach to reduce the hole doping and reveals photo-carrier dynamics related to defects activity. This study presents an experimental and theoretical investigation on defects under light irradiation in tin halide perovskites by combining measurements of photoluminescence with first principles computational modeling. It finds that tin perovskite thin films prepared with an excess of Sn halide sources exhibit an enhancement of the photoluminescence intensity over time under continuous excitation in inert atmosphere. The authors propose a model in which light irradiation promotes the annihilation of V Sn 2− /Sn i 2+ Frenkel pairs, reducing the deep carrier trapping centers associated with such defect and increasing the radiative recombination. Importantly, these observations can be traced in the open-circuit voltage dynamics of tin-based halide perovskite solar cells, implying the relevance of controlling the Sn photochemistry to stabilize tin perovskite devices.},

However; the current techniques viz. sequential chemical vapor deposition, micromechanical/wet-chemical transfer are mostly limited due to diffused interfaces, and metallic remnants/bubbles at the interface. Inter-layer-coupled 2+ δ -dimensional materials, as a new class of materials can be significantly suitable for out-of-plane carrier transport and hence prompt response in prospective devices. Here, the discovery of the use of exotic electric field ≈10 6 V cm − 1 (at microwave hot-spot) and 2 thermomechanical conditions i.e. pressure ≈1 MPa, T ≈ 200 °C (during solvothermal reaction) to realize 2+ δ -dimensional materials is reported. It is found that P z  P z chemical bonds form between the component layers, e.g., C  B and C  N in G-BN, Mo  N and Mo  B in MoS 2 -BN hybrid systems as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. New vibrational peaks in Raman spectra (B  C ≈1320 cm –1 for the G-BN system and Mo  B ≈365 cm –1 for the MoS 2 -BN system) are recorded. Tunable mid-gap formation, along with diodic behavior (knee voltage ≈0.7 V, breakdown voltage ≈1.8 V) in the reduced graphene oxide-reduced BN oxide (RGO-RBNO) hybrid system is also observed. Band-gap tuning in MoS 2 -BN system is observed. Simulations reveal stacking-dependent interfacial charge/potential drops, hinting at the feasibility of next-generation functional devices/sensors.},

In addition, the applicability of the anion-type biofluid using Myoglobin (Mb) that is well studied in anion-type solvent-free liquid proteins is evaluated. Although anionization resulted in the complete unfolding of Mb, the active α -helix level is partially recovered in the anion-type biofluids, and the effect is accentuated in the cation-type Mb biofluids.

  abstract     = {Although many efforts are undertaken to treat peripheral demyelinating neuropathies based on biochemical interventions, unfortunately, there is no approved treatment yet. Furthermore, previous studies have not shown improvement of the myelin membrane at the biomolecular level. Here, an electroceutical treatment is introduced as a biophysical intervention to treat Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease—the most prevalent peripheral demyelinating neuropathy worldwide—using a mouse model. The specific electrical stimulation (ES) condition (50 mV mm −1 , 20 Hz, 1 h) for optimal myelination is found via an in vitro ES screening system, and its promyelinating effect is validated with ex vivo dorsal root ganglion model. Biomolecular investigation via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry shows that ES ameliorates distribution abnormalities of peripheral myelin protein 22 and cholesterol in the myelin membrane, revealing the restoration of myelin membrane integrity. ES intervention in vivo via flexible implantable electrodes shows not only gradual rehabilitation of mouse behavioral phenotypes (balance and endurance), but also restored myelin thickness, compactness, and membrane integrity. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that an electroceutical approach with the optimal ES condition has the potential to treat CMT disease and restore impaired myelin membrane integrity, shifting the paradigm toward practical interventions for peripheral demyelinating neuropathies.},

  abstract     = {Bone implant-associated infections induced by bacteria frequently result in repair failure and threaten the health of patients. Although black phosphorus (BP) material with superior photothermal conversion ability is booming in the treatment of bone disease, the development of BP-based bone scaffolds with excellent photothermal stability and antibacterial properties simultaneously remains a challenge. In nature, chloroplasts cannot only convert light into chemical energy, but also hold a protective and defensive envelope membrane. Inspired by this, a self-defensive bone scaffold with stable photothermal property is developed for infected bone defect therapy. Similar to thylakoid and stroma lamella in chloroplasts, BP is integrated with chitosan and polycaprolactone fiber networks. The mussel-inspired polydopamine multifunctional “envelope membrane” wrapped above not only strengthens the photothermal stability of BP-based scaffolds, but also realizes the in situ anchoring of silver nanoparticles. Bacteria-triggered infection of femur defects in vivo can be commendably inhibited at the early stage via these chloroplast-inspired implants, which then effectively promotes endogenous repair of the defect area under mild hyperthermia induced by near-infrared irradiation. This chloroplast-inspired strategy shows outstanding performance for infected bone defect therapy and provides a reference for the functionality of other biomedical materials.},

Unfortunately, transparent ceramics are notoriously difficult to shape, especially on the microscale. Therefore, a thermoplastic MAS nanocomposite is developed that can be shaped by polymer injection molding at high speed and precision. The nanocomposite is converted to dense MAS by debinding, pre-sintering, and hot isostatic pressing yielding transparent ceramics with high optical transmission up to 84 % and high mechanical strength. A transparent macroscopic MAS components with wall thicknesses up to 4 mm as well as microstructured components with single micrometer resolution are shown. This work makes transparent MAS ceramics accessible to modern high-throughput polymer processing techniques for fast and cost-efficient manufacturing of macroscopic and microstructured components enabling a plethora of potential applications from optics and photonics, medicine to scratch and break-resistant transparent windows for consumer electronics.},

  abstract     = {The functionality of ferroelastic domain walls in ferroelectric materials is explored in real-time via the in situ implementation of computer vision algorithms in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) experiment. The robust deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is implemented based on a deep residual learning framework ( Res ) and holistically nested edge detection ( Hed ), and ensembled to minimize the out-of-distribution drift effects. The DCNN is implemented for real-time operations on SPM, converting the data stream into the semantically segmented image of domain walls and the corresponding uncertainty. Further the pre-defined experimental workflows perform piezoresponse spectroscopy measurement on thus discovered domain walls, and alternating high- and low-polarization dynamic (out-of-plane) ferroelastic domain walls in a PbTiO 3 (PTO) thin film and high polarization dynamic (out-of-plane) at short ferroelastic walls (compared with long ferroelastic walls) in a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin film is reported. This work establishes the framework for real-time DCNN analysis of data streams in scanning probe and other microscopies and highlights the role of out-of-distribution effects and strategies to ameliorate them in real time analytics.},

However, improving the selectivity and conversion rate remains a major challenge. Strategies mimicking natural photosynthesis provide a prospective way to convert CO 2 with high efficiency. Herein, several typical strategies are described for constructing biomimetic photoelectric functional interfaces; such interfaces include metal cocatalysts/semiconductors, small molecules/semiconductors, molecular catalysts/semiconductors, MOFs/semiconductors, and microorganisms/semiconductors. The biomimetic PEC interface must have enhanced CO 2 adsorption capacity, preferentially activate CO 2 , and have an efficient conversion ability; with these properties, it can activate CO bonds effectively and promote electron transfer and C  C coupling to convert CO 2 to single-carbon or multicarbon products. Interfacial electron transfer and proton coupling on the biomimetic PEC interface are also discussed to clarify the mechanism of CO 2 reduction. Finally, the existing challenges and perspectives for biomimetic photoelectrocatalytic CO 2 reduction are presented.},

  abstract     = {The current approach to achieving superior energy storage density in dielectrics is to increase their breakdown strength, which often incurs heat generation and unexpected insulation failures, greatly deteriorating the stability and lifetime of devices. Here, a strategy is proposed for enhancing recoverable energy storage density ( W r ) while maintaining a high energy storage efficiency ( η) in glassy ferroelectrics by creating super tetragonal (super-T) nanostructures around morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) rather than exploiting the intensely strong electric fields. Accordingly, a giant W r of ≈86 J cm −3 concomitant with a high η of ≈81% is acquired under a moderate electric field (1.7 MV cm −1 ) in thin films having MPB composition, namely, 0.94(Bi, Na)TiO 3 -0.06BaTiO 3 (BNBT), where the local super-T polar clusters (tetragonality ≈1.25) are stabilized by interphase strain. To the knowledge of the authors, the W r of the engineered BNBT thin films represents a new record among all the oxide perovskites under a similar strength of electric field to date. The phase field simulation results ascertain that the improved W r is attributed to the local strain heterogeneity and the large spontaneous polarization primarily is originated from the super-T polar clusters. The findings in this work present a genuine opportunity to develop ultrahigh-energy-density thin-film capacitors for low-electric-field-driven nano/microelectronics.},

In Fe–N–C catalysts, the single Fe atom forms a square-planar configuration with four adjacent N atoms ( D 4h symmetry). Breaking the D 4h symmetry of the FeN 4 active center provides a new route to boost the activity of Fe–N–C catalysts. Herein, for the first time, the deformation of the square-planar coordination of FeN 4 moiety achieved by introducing chalcogen oxygen groups (XO 2 , X = S, Se, Te) as polar functional groups in the Fe–N–C catalyst is reported. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that breaking the D 4h symmetry of FeN 4 results in the rearrangement of Fe 3 d electrons and increases spin moment of Fe centers. The efficient spin state manipulation optimizes the adsorption energetics of ORR intermediates, thereby significantly promoting the intrinsic ORR activity of Fe–N–C catalysts, among which the SeO 2 modified catalyst lies around the peak of the ORR volcano plot. This work provides a new strategy to tune the local coordination and thus the electronic structure of single-atom catalysts.},

Here, four homoleptic Ir complexes as a phosphorescent emitter are systematically designed based on the molecular structure of tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) (Ir(ppy) 3 ) to control the EDO. Trimethylsilane, methyl, 2-methylpropyl, and cyclopentylmethyl group substituted to pyridine ring of the ligand contribute to the improvement of the EDO from 76.5% for Ir(ppy) 3 to 87.5%. A linear relationship between the EDO and the aspect ratio (geometric anisotropy factor) is founded, implying the importance of the effective area for the nonbonding force between host and dopant molecules. Also, it is investigated that the EDO enhancement mainly originates from the vertical alignment of the C3 axis of molecule in the substrate axis rather than the change in the direction of the transition dipole alignment in the molecular axis. The optical simulation reveals that the outcoupling efficiency of phosphorescent OLEDs adopting new dopants reaches 38.4%. The green OLEDs exhibiting 28.3% of EQE, 103.2 cd A –1 of current efficiency, and 98.2 lm W –1 of power efficiency are demonstrated, which is understood to have little electrical loss.},

Construction of tumor-specific H 2 S-activated smart nanoplatform with controllable biodegradation is of great significance for precise and sustainable treatment of colon cancer. Herein, an endogenous H 2 S triggered Co-doped polyoxometalate (POM-Co) cluster with self-adjustable size, controlled biodegradation, and sustainable cyclic depletion of H 2 S/glutathione (GSH) is designed for synergistic enhanced tumor-specific photothermal and chemodynamic therapy. The designed POM-Co nanocluster holds H 2 S responsive “turn-on” photothermal property in colon cancer via self-assembling to form large-sized POM-CoS, enhancing the accumulation at tumor sites. Furthermore, the formed POM-CoS can gradually biodegrade, resulting in release of Co 2+ and Mo 6+ for Co(II)-catalyzed •OH production and Russell mechanism-enabled 1 O 2 generation with GSH consumption, respectively. More importantly, the degraded POM-CoS is reactivated by endogenous H 2 S for recyclable and sustainable consumption of H 2 S and GSH, resulting in tumor-specific photothermal/chemodynamic continuous therapy. Therefore, this study provides an opportunity of designing tumor microenvironment-driven nanoprobes with controllable biodegradation for precise and sustainable anti-tumor therapy.},

  abstract     = {Achieving robust underwater adhesion by bioadhesives remains a challenge due to interfacial water. Herein a coacervate-to-hydrogel strategy to enhance interfacial water repulsion and bulk adhesion of bioadhesives is reported. The polyethyleneimine/thioctic acid (PEI/TA) coacervate is deposited onto underwater substrates, which can effectively repel interfacial water and completely spread into substrate surface irregularities due to its liquid and water-immiscible nature. The physical interactions between coacervate and substrate can further enhance interfacial adhesion. Furthermore, driven by the spontaneous hydrophobic aggregation of TA molecules and strong electrostatic interaction between PEI and TA, the coacervate can turn into a hydrogel in situ within minutes without additional stimuli to develop enhanced matrix cohesion and robust bulk adhesion on diverse underwater substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations further reveal atomistic details of the formation and wet adhesion of the PEI/TA coacervate via multimode physical interactions. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the PEI/TA coacervate-derived hydrogel can effectively repel blood and therefore efficiently deliver the carried growth factors at wound sites, thereby enhancing wound healing in an animal model. The advantages of the PEI/TA coacervate-derived hydrogel including body fluid-immiscibility, strong underwater adhesion, adaptability to fit irregular target sites, and excellent biocompatibility make it a promising bioadhesive for diverse biomedical applications.},

Particularly, the soft ones among them exhibit unique merits of compliance, versatility, and agility.

In most cases, one device only utilizes one energy transmission mode (ETM) in powering its activities to achieve programmed tasks, such as locomotion and object manipulation. But real-world tasks demand multifunctional devices that require more energy in various forms. This work reports a liquid metal-elastomer composite with dual-ETM using one magnetic field for miniature untethered multifunctional robots. The first ETM uses the low-frequency (&lt;100 Hz) field component to induce shape-morphing, while the second ETM employs energy transmitted via radio-frequency (20 kHz–300 GHz) induction to power onboard electronics and generate excess heat, enabling new capabilities. These new functions do not disturb the shape-morphing actuated using the first ETM. The reported material enables the integration of electric and thermal functionalities into soft miniature robots, offering a wealth of inspirations for multifunctional miniature robots that leverage developments in electronics to exhibit usefulness beyond self-locomotion.},

Moreover, the use of rare metal-bearing compounds along with the typically required vacuum-based thin-film processing may greatly increase their production cost.

Both single crystals and thin films of MA 2 CuCl 3 can be facilely prepared by a low-cost solution method, which demonstrate bright warm white-light emission with intrinsically high PLQYs of 90–97%. Prototype electroluminescence devices and down-conversion LEDs are fabricated with MA 2 CuCl 3 thin films and single crystals, respectively, which show bright luminescence with decent efficiencies and operational stability.

  abstract     = {The understanding and applications of electron-conducting π -conjugated polymers with naphtalene diimide (NDI) blocks show remarkable progress in recent years. Such polymers demonstrate a facilitated n-doping due to the strong electron deficiency of the main polymer chain and the presence of the positively charged side groups stabilizing a negative charge of the n-doped backbone. Here, the n-type conducting NDI polymer with enhanced stability of its n-doped states for prospective “in-water” applications is developed. A combined experimental–theoretical approach is used to identify critical features and parameters that control the doping and electron transport process. The facilitated polymer reduction ability and the thermodynamic stability in water are confirmed by electrochemical measurements and doping studies. This material also demonstrates a high conductivity of 10 −2 S cm −1 under ambient conditions and 10 −1 S cm −1 in vacuum. The modeling explains the stabilizing effects  for various dopants. The simulations show a significant doping-induced “collapse” of the positively charged side chains on the core bearing a partial negative charge. This explains a decrease in the lamellar spacing observed in experiments. This study fundamentally enables a novel pathway for achieving both thermodynamic stability of the n-doped states in water and the high electron conductivity of polymers.},

  abstract     = {Carrier multiplication (CM), multiexciton generation by absorbing a single photon, enables disruptive improvements in photovoltaic conversion efficiency. However, energy conservation constrains the threshold energy to at least twice bandgap (2 E g $ E_\text{g}$ ). Here, a below threshold limit CM in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is reported. Surprisingly, CM is observed with excitation energy of only 1.75 E g $E_\text{g}$ due to lattice vibrations. Electron–phonon coupling (EPC) results in significant changes in electronic structures, which favors CM. Indeed, the strongest EPC in monolayer MoS 2 leads to the most efficient CM among the studied TMDCs. For practical applications, chalcogen vacancies can further lower the threshold by introducing defect states within bandgap. In particular, for monolayer WS 2 , CM occurs with excitation energy as low as 1.51 . The results identify TMDCs as attractive candidate materials for efficient optoelectronic devices with the advantages of high photoconductivity and efficient CM.},

However, the underlying mechanisms of how the synthetic retinoid induces cancer-stem-cell-like cell tumor-repopulating cell (TRC) apoptosis are elusive. Here, it is shown that although the retinoid and conventional anticancer drugs cisplatin, all-trans retinoic acid, and tazarotene all inhibit cytoskeletal tension and decondense chromatin prior to inducing TRC apoptosis, half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the retinoid is 20-fold lower than those anticancer drugs. The synthetic retinoid induces retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR γ ) translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to reduced RAR γ binding to Cdc42 promoter and Cdc42 downregulation, which decreases filamentous-actin (F-actin) and inhibits cytoskeletal tension. Elevating F-actin or upregulating histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation decreases retinoid-induced DNA damage and apoptosis of TRCs. The combinatorial treatment with a chromatin decondensation molecule and the retinoid inhibits tumor metastasis in mice more effectively than the synthetic retinoid alone. These findings suggest a strategy of lowering cell tension and decondensing chromatin to enhance DNA damage to abrogate metastasis of cancer-stem-cell-like cells with high efficacy.},

Despite several important properties of PNRs, the production of these structures with narrow widths is still a great challenge. Here, a facile and straightforward approach to synthesize PNRs via an electrochemical process that utilize the anisotropic Na + diffusion barrier in black phosphorus (BP) along the [001] zigzag direction against the [100] armchair direction, is reported. The produced PNRs display widths of good uniformity (10.3 ± 3.8 nm) observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the suppressed B 2g vibrational mode from Raman spectroscopy results. More interestingly, when used in field-effect transistors, synthesized bundles exhibit the n-type behavior, which is dramatically different from bulk BP flakes which are p-type. This work provides insights into a new synthesis approach of PNRs with confined widths, paving the way toward the development of phosphorene and other highly anisotropic nanoribbon materials for high-quality electronic applications.},

In this paper, inspired by the wet adhesion of spider web, slippery surface of Nepenthes, and structural color phenomena of chameleons, a novel structural color medical patch with surface dual-properties of wet bioadhesion and slipperiness for internal tissue repair based on inverse opal scaffold is presented. The adhesive surface made by poly(acrylic acid)–polyethylene glycol– N -hydroxysuccinimide ester and gelatin hydrogel can attain tough adhesion to internal wet tissues by absorbing tissue interfacial water and the covalent cross-linking between the hydrogel and tissue. Besides, the slippery surface made by liquid paraffin infused inverse opal scaffold can avoid adhesion to the adjacent tissues. It is demonstrated that the designed patch can adhere tightly to the defect tissue and improve the tissue repair without adjacent adhesion when applied in a rat model with full-thickness perforation of the stomach wall. In addition, the responsive structural color can supply a color-sensing monitoring to evaluate the adhesive and repair process.

It has been shown that, following tumor vessel destruction therapy, injected cell permeable small molecule drugs bisphosphonate can hijack the hemorrhagic product iron and self-assemble into peroxidase-like nanoparticles within tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Unlike free drugs, the generated intercellular nanoparticles can specifically stress mitochondria, resulting in immune activation of macrophages in vitro and polarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from immunosuppressive to tumoricidal and increasing the recruitment of T cells deep within tumor. The hijacking self-assembly strategy significantly inhibits tumor growth compared with the treatment of vascular-disrupting agents alone.

Lately, bulk-heterojunction-based synaptic transistors with bipolar modulation are proposed to exempt the use of an additional floating gate. However, the actual correlation between the channel&#39;s ambipolarity, memory characteristic, and synaptic behavior for a floating-gate free transistor has not been investigated yet. Herein, by studying five diketopyrrolopyrrole–benzotriazole dual-acceptor random conjugated polymers, a clear correlation among the hole/electron ratio, the memory retention characteristic, and the synaptic behavior for the polymer channel layer in a floating-gate free transistor is described. It reveals that the polymers with balanced ambipolarity possess better charge trapping capabilities and larger memory windows; however, the high ambipolarity results in higher volatility of the memory characteristics, namely poor memory retention capability. In contrast, the polymer with a reduced ambipolarity possesses an enhanced memory retention capability despite showing a reduced memory window. It is further manifested that this enhanced charge retention capability enables the device to present artificial synaptic characteristics. The results highlight the importance of the channel&#39;s ambipolarity of floating-gate free transistors on the resultant volatile memory characteristics and synaptic behaviors.},

Recently developed genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) report both spiking and subthreshold activity of identified neurons. However, maximally capitalizing on the potential of GEVIs will require imaging at millisecond time scales, which remains challenging with standard camera systems. Here, application of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors is reported to image neural activity at kilohertz frame rates. SPADs are electronic devices that when activated by a single photon cause an avalanche of electrons and a large electric current. An array of SPAD sensors is used to image individual neurons expressing the GEVI Voltron-JF525-HTL. It is shown that subthreshold and spiking activity can be resolved with shot noise limited signals at frame rates of up to 10 kHz. SPAD imaging is able to reveal millisecond scale synchronization of neural activity in an ex vivo seizure model. SPAD sensors may have widespread applications for investigation of millisecond timescale neural dynamics.},

Yet, usually, a compromise must be made between conductivity and transparency, limiting the practical application of a TCO to the next level. Furthermore, TCO performance is highly sensitive to composition, so conventional synthesis methods, such as chemical doping, cannot unravel the mysteries of the quantitative structure–performance relationship. Thus, improving the fundamental understanding or creating materials-by-design has limited success. Here, a strategy is proposed to modulate the lattice and electronic and optical properties precisely by applying pressure on a TCO. Strikingly, after compression–decompression treatment on the indium titanium oxides (ITiO), a highly transparent and metastable phase with two orders of magnitude enhancement in conductivity is synthesized from an irreversible phase transition. Moreover, this phase possesses previously unattainable filter efficiency on hazardous blue light up to 600 °C, providing potential for healthcare-related applications with strong thermal stability up to 200 °C. These results demonstrate that pressure engineering is a clean and effective tool for tailoring functional materials that are not achievable by other means, providing an exciting alternative property-tuning dimension in materials science.},

However, the photosensitization efficiencies are still finite by the unilateral improvement of excited-state intersystem crossing (ISC) via heavy-atom-effect, since the upconverted efficiency also plays a decisive role in upconverted photosensitization. Herein, a NIR light initiated one-photon upconversion heavy-atom-free small molecule system is reported. The meso-rotatable anthracene in pentamethine cyanine (Cy5) is demonstrated to enrich the populations in high vibrational–rotational energy levels and subsequently improve the hot-band absorption (HBA) efficiency. Moreover, the spin–orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC) caused by electron donated anthracene can further amplify the triplet yield. Benefiting from the above two aspects, the 1 O 2 generation significantly increases with over 2-fold improved performance compared with heavy-atom-modified method under upconverted light excitation, which obtains efficient in vivo phototheranostic results and provides new opportunities for other applications such as photocatalysis and fine chemical synthesis.},

Recently, many studies related to cultured meat have been conducted, but producing large-sized cultured meat remains a challenge.

A hydrogel scaffold is produced at the centimeter scale using a bioink consisting of photocrosslinkable materials for digital light processing-based (DLP) printing, which has high printing accuracy and can produce geometrically complex structures. The light exposure time for hydrogel photopolymerization by DLP bioprinting is optimized based on photorheometry and cell viability assays. Naturally immortalized bovine embryonic fibroblast cells transformed with MyoD and PPARγ2 instead of primary cells are used as the latter have difficulties in maintaining stemness and are associated with animal ethics issues. The cells are mixed into the hydrogel for printing. Myogenesis and adipogenesis are induced simply by changing the medium after printing. Scaffolds are obtained successfully with living cells and large microchannels. The cooked cultured meat maintains its size and shape upon cutting. The overall dimensions are 3.43 cm × 5.53 cm × 0.96 cm. This study provides proof-of-concept for producing 3D cultured meat using bioinks.},

Cells also inherently contain versatile membrane-less organelles (MLOs) that feature liquid or gel-like bodies. A biophysical process termed liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) elucidates how MLOs form through dynamic biomolecule assembly. LLPS-related molecules often have multivalency, which is essential for low-affinity inter- or intra-molecule interactions to trigger phase separation. Accumulating evidence shows that LLPS concentrates and organizes desired molecules or segregates unneeded molecules in cells. Thus, MLOs have tunable functional specificity in response to environmental stimuli and metabolic processes. Aberrant LLPS is widely associated with several hallmarks of cancer, including sustained proliferative signaling, growth suppressor evasion, cell death resistance, telomere maintenance, DNA damage repair, etc. Insights into the molecular mechanisms of LLPS provide new insights into cancer therapeutics.

  abstract     = {Rho GTPases and Hippo kinases are key regulators of cardiomyoblast differentiation. However, how these signaling axes are coordinated spatiotemporally remains unclear. Here, the central and multifaceted roles of the BCH domain containing protein, BNIP-2, in orchestrating the expression of two key cardiac genes (cardiac troponin T [cTnT] and cardiac myosin light chain [Myl2]) in H9c2 and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are delineated. This study shows that BNIP-2 mRNA and protein expression increase with the onset of cTnT and Myl2 and promote the alignment of H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, BNIP-2 is required for the inactivation of YAP through YAP phosphorylation and its cytosolic retention. Turbo-ID proximity labeling corroborated by super-resolution analyses and biochemical pulldown data reveals a scaffolding role of BNIP-2 for LATS1 to phosphorylate and inactivate YAP in a process that requires BNIP-2 activation of cellular contractility. The findings identify BNIP-2 as a pivotal signaling scaffold that spatiotemporally integrates RhoA/Myosin II and LATS1/YAP mechanotransduction signaling to drive cardiomyoblast differentiation, by switching the genetic programming from YAP-dependent growth to YAP-silenced differentiation. These findings offer insights into the importance of scaffolding proteins in bridging the gap between mechanical and biochemical signals in cell growth and differentiation and the prospects in translational applications.},

  abstract     = {Direct contact of membrane molecules and cytokine interactions orchestrate immune homeostasis. However, overcoming the threshold of distance and velocity barriers, and achieving adhesion mediated immune interaction remain difficult. Here, inspired by the natural chemotaxis of regulatory T cells, multifunctionalized FOXP3 genetic engineered extracellular vesicles, termed Foe-TEVs, are designed, which display with adhesive molecules, regulatory cytokines, and coinhibitory contact molecules involving CTLA-4 and PD-1, by limited exogenous gene transduction. Foe-TEVs effectively adhere to the tubular, endothelial, and glomerular regions of allogeneic injury in the renal allograft, mitigating cell death in situ and chronic fibrosis transition. Remarkably, transcript engineering reverses the tracking velocity of vesicles to a retained phenotype and enhanced arrest coefficient by a factor of 2.16, directly interacting and attenuating excessive allosensitization kinetics in adaptive lymphoid organs. In murine allogeneic transplantation, immune adhesive Foe-TEVs alleviate pathological responses, restore renal function with well ordered ultrastructure and improved glomerular filtration rate, and prolong the survival period of the recipient from 30.16 to 92.81 days, demonstrating that the delivery of extracellular vesicles, genetically engineered for immune adhesive, is a promising strategy for the treatment of graft rejection.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes manifests as chronic inflammation and leads to the development diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Targeting key proteins in inflammatory signaling may provide new therapy for DCM. In this study, the authors explore the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of Schisandrin B (Sch B), a natural compound with anti-inflammatory activity against DCM. It is shown that Sch B prevents high-level glucose (HG)-induced hypertrophic and fibrotic responses in cultured cardiomyocytes. RNA sequencing and inflammatory qPCR microarray show that Sch B mainly affects myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expression in HG-challenged cardiomyocytes. Further studies indicate that Sch B directly binds to and inhibits MyD88 activation, but does not alter MyD88-independent Toll-like receptor signaling in vivo and in vitro. Inhibiting or silencing MyD88 is associated with reduced levels of HG-induced inflammatory cytokines and myocardial injuries in vitro. Treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice with Sch B protects heart function, reduces myocardial injuries, and decreases secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Cardiomyocyte-specific MyD88 knockout also protects mice against cardiac inflammation and injury in type 1 diabetic mice. In conclusion, these studies show that cardiomyocyte MyD88 plays an apathogenetic role in DCM and Sch B specifically targets MyD88 to reduce inflammatory DCM.},

Insufficient regenerative capability and dysregulation of immune microenvironment are the leading causes of functional loss. First, this work identifies persistent oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in the regional tendon tissues postinjury. Therefore, a smart scaffold incorporating the enzyme mimicry nanoparticle-ceria nanozyme (CeNPs) into the nanofiber bundle scaffold (NBS@CeO) with porous, anisotropic, and enhanced mechanical properties is designed to innovatively explore a targeted energy-supporting repair strategy by rescuing mitochondrial function and remodeling the microenvironment favoring endogenous regeneration. The integrated CeNPs scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), stabilize the mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm), and ATP synthesis of tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) under oxidative stress. In a rat Achilles tendon defect model, NBS@CeO reduces oxidative damage and accelerates structural regeneration of collagen fibers, manifesting as recovering mechanical properties and motor function. Furthermore, NBS@CeO mediates the rebalance of endogenous regenerative signaling and dysregulated immune microenvironment by alleviating senescence and apoptosis of TDSCs, downregulating the secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and inducing macrophage M2 polarization. This innovative strategy highlights the role of NBS@CeO in tendon repair and thus provides a potential therapeutic approach for promoting tendon regeneration.},

Although numerous methods are developed to accelerate corneal wound healing, most of them are passive treatments that rarely participate in controlling endogenous cell behaviors or are incompatible with nontransparent bandage. In this work, a wireless-powered electrical bandage contact lens (EBCL) is developed to generate a localized external electric field to accelerate corneal wound healing and vision recovery. The wireless electrical stimulation circuit employed a flower-shaped layout design that can be compactly integrated on bandage contact lens without blocking the vision. The role of the external electric field in promoting corneal wound healing is examined in vitro, where the responses of directional migration and corneal cells alignment to the electric field are observed. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicates that the electrical stimulation can participate in controlling cell division, proliferation, and migration. Furthermore, the wireless EBCL is demonstrated to accelerate the completed recovery of corneal wounds on rabbits’ eyes by electrical stimulation, while the control group exhibits delayed recovery and obvious corneal defects. As a new generation of intelligent device, the wireless and patient-friendly EBCL can provide a promising therapeutic strategy for ocular diseases.},

Cost barriers for this technology could be overcome by using printing technologies. However, the development of thermoelectric (TE) materials that combine printability, high-efficiency, and mechanical flexibility is a serious challenge. Here, flexible (SbBi) 2 (TeSe) 3 -based screen-printed TE films exhibiting record-high figure of merits (ZT) and power factors are reported. A high power factor of 24 µW cm −1 K −2 (ZT max ≈ 1.45) for a p-type film and a power factor of 10.5 µW cm −1 K −2 (ZT max ≈ 0.75) for an n-type film are achieved. The TE inks, comprised of p-Bi 0.5 Sb 1.5 Te 3 (BST)/n-Bi 2 Te 2.7 Se 0.3 (BT) and a Cu-Se-based inorganic binder (IB), are prepared by a one-pot synthesis process. The TE inks are printed on different substrates and sintered using photonic-curing leading to the formation of a highly conducting β -Cu 2− δ Se phase that connects “microsolders,” the grains resulting in high-performance. Folded TEGs (f-TEGs) are fabricated using the materials. A half-millimeter thick f-TEG exhibits an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 203 mV with a maximum power density ( p max ) of 5.1 W m −2 at ∆ T = 68 K. This result signifies that a few millimeters thick f-TEG could power Internet-of-Things (IoTs) devices converting low-grade heat to electricity.},

Further, to amplify the thermal sensitivity of tumor cells, glucose oxidase (GOx) is introduced to suppress the production of heat shock proteins, thereby promoting mild photothermal therapy. Complementarily, AuPtAg nanozymes with catalase-like activity can ameliorate tumor hypoxia, significantly improving the GOx activity. As a result, the combination of AuPtAg-GOx with self-augmented photothermal ability and PD-L1 antibody can further escalate the antitumor efficacy.

Identifying the organ-specific molecular determinants of EVs can develop potential anti-metastatic therapeutic targets. In the current study, large oncosomes (LOs), atypically large cancer-derived EVs, are found to play a crucial role in facilitating bone-tropic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by engineering an osteoclastic pre-metastatic niche and establishing a vicious cycle between the osteoclasts and HCC cells. Transmembrane protein, VAMP-associated protein A (VAPA), is significantly enriched on LOs surface via direct interaction with LOs marker α V-integrin. VAPA-enriched LOs-induced pre-metastatic education transforms the bone into a fertile milieu, which supports the growth of metastatic HCC cells. Mechanically, LOs-delivered VAPA integrates to plasma membrane of osteoclasts and directly interacts with and activates neural Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) via dual mechanisms, consequently resulting in ARP2/3 complex-mediated reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in osteoclasts and osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, treatment with N-WASP inhibitor 187-1-packaged LOs (LOs/187-1) dramatically abolishes the inductive effect of VAPA-enriched LOs on pre-metastatic niche formation and precludes HCC bone metastasis. These findings reveal a plausible mechanism for bone-tropism of HCC and can represent a potential strategy to prevent HCC bone metastasis.},

However, it is largely unknown how the resident cells of the perivascular niche, such as endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, influence GBM tumor cell behavior and disease progression. A 3D in vitro model of the brain perivascular niche developed by encapsulating brain-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes in a gelatin hydrogel is described. It is shown that brain perivascular stromal cells, namely pericytes and astrocytes, contribute to vascular architecture and maturation. Cocultures of patient-derived GBM tumor cells with brain microvascular cells are used to identify a role for pericytes and astrocytes in establishing a perivascular niche environment that modulates GBM cell invasion, proliferation, and therapeutic response. Engineered models provide unique insight regarding the spatial patterning of GBM cell phenotypes in response to a multicellular model of the perivascular niche. Critically, it is shown that engineered perivascular models provide an important resource to evaluate mechanisms by which intercellular interactions modulate GBM tumor cell behavior, drug response, and provide a framework to consider patient-specific disease phenotypes.},

  abstract     = {By exploiting the self-therapeutic properties of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) a molecular axis that promotes the growth of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), one of the deadliest gynecologic malignancies with poorly understood underlying molecular mechanisms, has been identified. The biodistribution and toxicity of GNPs administered by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, both as a single dose or by repeated dosing over two weeks are first assessed; no biochemical or histological toxicity to vital organs is found. Using an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of HGSOC, the authors then show that GNP treatment robustly inhibits tumor growth. Investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the GNP efficacy reveals that GNPs downregulate insulin growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) by disrupting its autoregulation via the IGFBP2/mTOR/PTEN axis. This mechanism is validated by treating a cell line-based human xenograft tumor with GNPs and an mTOR dual-kinase inhibitor (PI-103), either individually or in combination with GNPs; GNP and PI-103 combination therapy inhibit ovarian tumor growth similarly to GNPs alone. This report illustrates how the self-therapeutic properties of GNPs can be exploited as a discovery tool to identify a critical signaling axis responsible for poor prognosis in ovarian cancer and provides an opportunity to interrogate the axis to improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The aqueous electrochemical CO 2 reduction to valuable products is seen as one of the most promising candidates to achieve carbon neutrality yet still suffers from poor selectivity and lower current density. Highly efficient CO 2 reduction significantly relies on well-constructed electrode to realize efficient and stable triple-phase contact of CO 2 , electrolyte, and active sites. Herein, a triple-phase interface engineering approach featuring the combination of hierarchical porous morphology design and surface modification is presented. A hierarchical porous electrode is constructed by depositing bismuth nanosheet array on copper foam followed by trimethoxy (1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecyl) silane modification on the nanosheet surface. This electrode not only achieves highly selective and efficient CO 2 reduction performance with formate selectivity above 90% over wide potentials and a partial current density over −90 mA cm −2 in H-cell but also maintains a superior stability during the long-term operation. It is demonstrated that this remarkable performance is attributed to the construction of efficient and stable triple-phase interface. Theoretical calculations also show that the modified surface optimizes the activation path by lowering thermodynamic barriers of the key intermediates *OCHO for the formation of formate during electrochemical CO 2 reduction.},

Herein, inspired by the unique light trapping effect of wide leaf spiral grass during photosynthesis, a biomimetic structural photothermal energy storage system is developed, to further promote the solar thermal-driven pseudo capacitance improvement. In this system, three-dimensional printed tortional Kelvin cell arrays structure with interesting light trapping property functions as “spiral leaf blades” to improve the efficiency of light absorption, while graphene quantum dots/MXene nanohybrids with wide photothermal response range and strong electrochemical activity serve as “chloroplast” for photothermal conversion and energy storage. As expected, the biomimetic structure-enhanced photothermal supercapacitor achieves an ideal solar thermal-driven pseudo capacitance enhancement (up to 304%), an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 10.47 F cm −2 , remarkable photothermal response (surface temperature change of 50.1 °C), excellent energy density (1.18 mWh cm −2 ) and cycling stability (10000 cycles). This work not only offers a novel enhancement strategy for photothermal applications, but also inspires new structure designs for multifunctional energy storage and conversion devices.},

An electrolyte-gated transistor is here demonstrated to detect X. fastidiosa at a limit-of-quantification (LOQ) of 2 ± 1 bacteria in 0.1 mL (20 colony-forming-unit per mL). The assay is carried out with a millimeter-wide gate functionalized with Xylella -capturing antibodies directly in saps recovered from naturally infected plants. The proposed platform is benchmarked against the quantitave polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) gold standard, whose LOQ turns out to be at least one order of magnitude higher. Furthermore, the assay selectivity is proven against the Paraburkholderia phytofirmans bacterium (negative-control experiment). The proposed label-free, fast (30 min), and precise (false-negatives, false-positives below 1%) electronic assay, lays the ground for an ultra-high performing immunometric point-of-care platform potentially enabling large-scale screening of asymptomatic plants.},

  abstract     = {While metals can be readily processed and reshaped by cold rolling, most bulk inorganic semiconductors are brittle materials that tend to fracture when plastically deformed. Manufacturing thin sheets and foils of inorganic semiconductors is therefore a bottleneck problem, severely restricting their use in flexible electronic applications. It is recently reported that a few single-crystalline 2D van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors, such as InSe, are deformable under compressive stress. Here it is demonstrated that intralayer fracture toughness can be tailored via compositional design to make inorganic semiconductors processable by cold rolling. Systematic ab initio calculations covering a range of van der Waals semiconductors homologous to InSe are reported, leading to material-property maps that forecast trends in both the susceptibility to interlayer slip and the intralayer fracture toughness against cracking. GaSe is predicted, and experimentally confirmed, to be practically amenable to being rolled to large (three quarters) thickness reduction and length extension by a factor of three. The fracture toughness and cleavage energy are predicted to be 0.25 MPa m 0.5 and 15 meV Å −2 , respectively. The findings open a new realm of possibility for alloy selection and design toward processing-friendly group-III chalcogenides for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Long duration energy storage (LDES) is an economically attractive approach to accelerating clean renewable energy deployment. The newly emerged solid oxide iron–air battery (SOIAB) is intrinsically suited for LDES applications due to its excellent low-rate performance (high-capacity with high efficiency) and use of low-cost and sustainable materials. However, rechargeability and durability of SOIAB are critically limited by the slow kinetics in iron/iron-oxide redox couples. Here the use of combined proton-conducting BaZr 0.4 Ce 0.4 Y 0.1 Yb 0.1 O 3 (BZC4YYb) and reduction-promoting catalyst Ir to address the kinetic issues, is reported. It is shown that, benefiting from the facilitated H + diffusion and boosted FeO x -reduction kinetics, the battery operated under 550 °C, 50% Fe-utilization and 0.2 C, exhibits a discharge specific energy density of 601.9 Wh kg –1 -Fe with a round-trip efficiency (RTE) of 82.9% for 250 h of a cycle duration of 2.5 h. Under 500 °C, 50% Fe-utilization and 0.2 C, the same battery exhibits 520 Wh kg –1 -Fe discharge energy density with an RTE of 61.8% for 500 h. This level of energy storage performance promises that SOIAB is a strong candidate for LDES applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of fetal blood oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) can transform the clinical management of high-risk pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction (FGR). Here, a novel MRI method assesses the feasibility of identifying normally grown and FGR fetuses in sheep and is then applied to humans. MRI scans are performed in pregnant ewes at 110 and 140 days (term = 150d) gestation and in pregnant women at 28 +3 ± 2 +5 weeks to measure feto-placental SO 2 . Birth weight is collected and, in sheep, fetal blood SO 2 is measured with a blood gas analyzer (BGA). Fetal arterial SO 2 measured by BGA predicts fetal birth weight in sheep and distinguishes between fetuses that are normally grown, small for gestational age, and FGR. MRI feto-placental SO 2 in late gestation is related to fetal blood SO 2 measured by BGA and body weight. In sheep, MRI feto-placental SO 2 in mid-gestation is related to fetal SO 2 later in gestation. MRI feto-placental SO 2 distinguishes between normally grown and FGR fetuses, as well as distinguishing FGR fetuses with and without normal Doppler in humans. Thus, a multi-compartment placental MRI model detects low placental SO 2 and distinguishes between small hypoxemic fetuses and normally grown fetuses.},

Here, an ionic MOF (Ni-btz) constructed with an azolate ligand is selected, and continuous 3D bimetallic MOF (NiFe-btz) films deriving from high-degree intergrowth of microsized MOFs particles are fabricated. The as-prepared NiFe-btz/NF-OH electrode exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 239 mV at 10 mA cm −2 under alkaline condition. The OER charge transfer process and bimetallic coupling effect in ionic NiFe-btz are probed by density functional theory calculations and confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Raman measurements. The partial density of states of NiFe-btz indicates that the main contribution for electron density around the Fermi level is from Cl ions clarifying the profitable impact of ionic MOF framework. This work systematically demonstrates the relationship of electronic structure and OER activity in ionic, bimetallic MOFs and expands the scope of 3D MOF films for efficient OER.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) suffer from significant nonradiative recombination at perovskite/charge transport layer heterojunction, seriously limiting their power conversion efficiencies. Herein, solution-processed chromium multioxide (CrO x ) is judiciously selected to construct a MAPbI 3 /CrO x /Spiro-OMeTAD hole-selective heterojunction. It is demonstrated that the inserted CrO x not only effectively reduces defect sites via redox shuttle at perovskite contact, but also decreases valence band maximum (VBM)-HOMO offset between perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD. This will diminish thermionic losses for collecting holes and thus promote charge transport across the heterojunction, suppressing both defect-assisted recombination and interface carrier recombination. As a result, a remarkable improvement of 21.21% efficiency with excellent device stability is achieved compared to 18.46% of the control device, which is among the highest efficiencies for polycrystalline MAPbI 3 based n–i–p planar PSCs reported to date. These findings of this work provide new insights into novel charge-selective heterojunctions for further enhancing efficiency and stability of PSCs.},

However, the growth of organic molecules into 2DOMCs remains a challenge because of the difficulties in controlling their self-assembly with a preferential orientation in solution-process crystallization. Herein, fullerene is chosen as a model molecule to develop a supramolecular gel crystallization approach to grow large-area 2DOMCs by controlling the perfect arrangement on the {220} crystal plane with the assistance of a gelated solvent. In this case, the gel networks provide tuneable confined spaces to control the crystallization kinetics toward the growth of dominant crystal faces by their inhibiting motions of solvent or solute molecules to enable the growth of perfect crystals at appropriate nucleation rates. As a result, a large-area fullerene 2DOMC is produced successfully and its corresponding device on a flexible substrate exhibits excellent bendable properties and ultra-high weak light detection ability (2.9 × 10 11 Jones) at a 10 V bias upon irradiation with 450 nm incident light. Moreover, its photoelectric properties remain unchanged after 200 cycles of bending at angles of 45, 90, and 180°. These results can be extended to the growth of other 2DOMCs for potentially fabricating advanced organic (opto)electronics.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanodots (CDs) have emerged as an alternative option for traditional nanocrystals due to their excellent optical properties and low toxicity. Nevertheless, high emission efficiency is a long-lasting pursuit for CDs. Herein, CDs with near-unity emission efficiency are prepared via atomic condensation of doped pyrrolic nitrogen, which can highly localize the excited states thus lead to the formation of bound excitons and the symmetry break of the π –electron conjugation. The short radiative lifetimes (&lt;8 ns) and diffusion lengths (&lt;50 nm) of the CDs imply that excitons can be efficiently localized by radiative recombination centers for a defect-insensitive emission of CDs. By incorporating the CDs into polystyrene, flexible light-converting films with a high solid-state quantum efficiency of 84% and good resistance to water, heating, and UV light are obtained. With the CD–polymer films as light conversion layers, CD-based white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) with a luminous efficiency of 140 lm W −1 and a flat-panel illumination system with lighting sizes of more than 100 cm 2 are achieved, matching state-of-the-art nanocrystal-based LEDs. These results pave the way toward carbon-based luminescent materials for solid-state lighting technology.},

  abstract     = {The large energy loss ( E loss ) is one of the main obstacles to further improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), which is closely related to the charge transfer (CT) state. Herein, ternary donor alloy strategy is used to precisely tune the energy of CT state ( E CT ) and thus the E loss for boosting the efficiency of OSCs. The elevated E CT in the ternary OSCs reduce the energy loss for charge generation (Δ E CT ), and promote the hybridization between localized excitation state and CT state to reduce the nonradiative energy loss (Δ E nonrad ). Together with the optimal morphology, the ternary OSCs afford an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.22% with a significantly improved open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.910 V without sacrificing short-cicuit density ( J sc ) and fill factor (FF) in comparison to the binary ones. This contribution reveals that precisely tuning the E CT via donor alloy strategy is an efficient way to minimize E loss and improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.},

The data indicate that there is no significant damage to the plasmid and cells during the levitating transfection time, and the transgene expression efficiency and cellular uptake in the droplet are significantly higher than those in the conventional tube, with and without shaking. These results suggest the consolidation of the endocytic uptake pathway into macropinocytosis, indicating that ultrasonic levitation induced a change in cell characteristics.

  abstract     = {Carbon dots (CDs) or carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are an emerging class of optical materials that have exceptional applications in optoelectronic devices, catalysis, detection, and bioimaging. Although cell studies of CPDs have produced impressive results, in vivo imaging requires available CPDs to fluoresce in the near-infrared-II (NIR-II) window (1000−1700 nm). Here, a two-step bottom-up strategy is developed to synthesize NIR-CPDs that provide bright emissions in both NIR-I and NIR-II transparent imaging windows. The designed strategy includes a hydrothermal reaction to form a stable carbon core with aldehyde groups, followed by the Knoevenagel reaction to tether the molecular emission centers. This procedure is labor-saving, cost-efficient, and produces a high yield. The NIR-CPDs enable high-performance NIR-II angiography and real-time imaging of the disease degree of colitis noninvasively. This technology may therefore provide a next-generation synthesis strategy for CPDs with rational molecular engineering that can accurately tune the absorption/emission properties of NIR-emissive CPDs.},

However, weak adsorption properties are the main challenge limiting the application of gas-sensitive materials. A highly adsorbent gas-sensitive cellulose nanofibril (CNF)-based triboelectric material with a layered structure is prepared here and it is applied to self-powered gas sensing. The layered structure of the triethoxy-1H,1H,2H,2H-tridecafluoro-n-octylsilane cellulose nanofiber (PFOTES-CNF)-based gas-sensitive material further enhances the adsorption of the material due to electrostatic adsorption in the electrostatic field induced by triboelectricity. It is found that the ammonia-sensitive material obtained by loading Ti 3 C 2 T x in PFOTES-CNF has a fast response/recovery (12/14 s), high sensitivity response ( V air / V gas = 2.1), high selectivity response (37.6%), and low detection limit (10 ppm) for 100 ppm of ammonia gas. In addition, the ammonia-sensitive CNF-based triboelectric material can accurately identify NH 3 concentration changes in the range of 10–120 ppm and transmit the signal wirelessly to the user interface, facilitating real-time online monitoring of NH 3 in the environment. A novel strategy is provided here for designing and preparing high-performance gas-sensitive composites and the analysis of self-powered gas sensing is guided.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease 2019 continues to spread worldwide. Given the urgent need for effective treatments, many clinical trials are ongoing through repurposing approved drugs. However, clinical data regarding the cardiotoxicity of these drugs are limited. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hCMs) represent a powerful tool for assessing drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, by using hCMs, it is demonstrated that four antiviral drugs, namely, apilimod, remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, exhibit cardiotoxicity in terms of inducing cell death, sarcomere disarray, and dysregulation of calcium handling and contraction, at clinically relevant concentrations. Human engineered heart tissue (hEHT) model is used to further evaluate the cardiotoxic effects of these drugs and it is found that they weaken hEHT contractile function. RNA-seq analysis reveals that the expression of genes that regulate cardiomyocyte function, such as sarcomere organization ( TNNT2, MYH6 ) and ion homeostasis ( ATP2A2, HCN4 ), is significantly altered after drug treatments. Using high-throughput screening of approved drugs, it is found that ceftiofur hydrochloride, astaxanthin, and quetiapine fumarate can ameliorate the cardiotoxicity of remdesivir, with astaxanthin being the most prominent one. These results warrant caution and careful monitoring when prescribing these therapies in patients and provide drug candidates to limit remdesivir-induced cardiotoxicity.},

This unique hierarchical structure provides ultrafast, continuous, and smooth electron transport channels; furthermore, it furnishes outstanding mechanical strength to support massive Li deposition at ultrahigh rates. As a result, the Li|VGWs@MCF anode exhibits outstanding cycling stability at ultrahigh currents and capacities (1000 h at 10 mA cm –2 and 10 mAh cm –2 , and 1000 h at 30 mA cm –2 and 60 mAh cm –2 ).

Herein, based on the characteristics of tumor microenvironment (TME), such as the slight acidity, hypoxia, and overexpression of H 2 O 2 , a TME stimuli-responsive and dual-targeted composite nanoplatform (UCTTD-PC4) is strategically explored by coating a tannic acid (TA)/Fe 3+ nanofilm with good biocompatibility onto the upconversion nanoparticles in an ultrafast, green and simple way. The pH-responsive feature of UCTTD-PC4 remains stable during the blood circulation, while rapidly releases Fe 3+ in the slightly acidic tumor cells, which results in catalyzing H 2 O 2 to produce O 2 and overcoming the tumor hypoxia. Notably, the emission spectrum of the UCTTD perfectly matches the absorption spectrum of the photosensitizer (perylene probe (PC4)) to achieve the enhanced therapeutic effect triggered by a single laser. This study provides a new strategy for the rational design and development of the safe and efficient single near-infrared laser-triggered synergistic treatment platform for hypoxic cancer under the guidance of multimodal imaging.},

Here, a set of hemithioindigo (HTI)-based molecular machines capable of specifically killing Gram-positive bacteria within minutes of activation with visible light (455 nm at 65 mW cm −2 ) that are safe for mammalian cells is described. Importantly, repeated exposure of bacteria to HTI does not result in detectable development of resistance. Visible light-activated HTI kill both exponentially growing bacterial cells and antibiotic-tolerant persister cells of various Gram-positive strains, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Visible light-activated HTI also eliminate biofilms of S. aureus and B. subtilis in as little as 1 h after light activation. Quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and protein carbonyls, as well as assays with various ROS scavengers, identifies oxidative damage as the underlying mechanism for the antibacterial activity of HTI. In addition to their direct antibacterial properties, HTI synergize with conventional antibiotics in vitro and in vivo, reducing the bacterial load and mortality associated with MRSA infection in an invertebrate burn wound model.

The design strategy for HEX has integrated the local feature (e.g., composition, spin, and valence states) of structural units in high entropy materials and the holistic degrees of freedom (e.g., stacking, twisting, and intercalating species) in van der Waals materials, and is successfully used for the discovery of high entropy dichalcogenides, phosphorus tri-chalcogenides, halogens, and MXene. The rich combination and random distribution of the multiple metallic constituents on the nearly regular 2D lattice give rise to a flexible platform to study the correlation features behind a range of selected physical properties, e.g., superconductivity, magnetism, and metal–insulator transition.

Electrochemical deionization (EDI) which captures ions by electrical field is a promising technique for water purification. However, the removal capacity and selectivity toward Cu 2+ are unsatisfying, yet the recycling of the captured copper in EDI systems is yet to be explored. Herein, an efficient electrochemical copper pump (ECP) that can deliver Cu 2+ from dilute brackish water into much more concentrated solutions is constructed using carbon nanosheets for the first time, which works based on reversible electrosorption and electrodeposition. The trade-off between the removal capacity and reversibility is mediated by the operation voltage. The ECP exhibits a removal capacity of 702.5 mg g −1 toward Cu 2+ and a high selectivity coefficient of 64 for Cu 2+ /Na + in the presence of multiple cations; both are the highest reported to date. The energy consumption of 1.79 Wh g –1 is among the lowest for EDI of copper. More importantly, the Cu species captured can be released into a 20-fold higher concentrated solution. Such a high performance is attributed to the optimal potential distribution between the two electrodes that allows reversible electrodeposition and efficient electrosorption.},

However, the large volume variation during the continuous lithiation/delithiation processes easily leads to structural damage and serious side reactions. To overcome the resultant rapid specific capacity decay, the nanocrystallization and compound strategies are proposed to construct hierarchically assembled structures with different morphologies and functions, which develop novel energy storage devices at nano/micro scale. The introduction of assembly strategies in the preparation process of silicon-based materials can integrate the advantages of both nanoscale and microstructures, which significantly enhance the comprehensive performance of the prepared silicon-based assemblies. Unfortunately, the summary and understanding of assembly are still lacking. In this review, the understanding of assembly is deepened in terms of driving forces, methods, influencing factors and advantages. The recent research progress of silicon-based assembled anodes and the mechanism of the functional advantages for assembled structures are reviewed from the aspects of spatial confinement, layered construction, fasciculate structure assembly, superparticles, and interconnected assembly strategies.

  abstract     = {Iron is an essential element for various cellular metabolism. Cancer cells also have high requirement of iron in their proliferation, invasion, and metastasis processes. Alendronate (ALN), a kind of FDA-approved bisphosphonates with metal-chelating capability, is initially certified to selectively bind to intracellular Fe 3+ theoretically and experimentally in this study. Hence, CaALN iron nanochelator is rationally designed to kill cancer cells by synergism of Fe-depletion and calcium accumulation. In vitro experiments and RNA sequencing analysis indicate that CaALN nanomedicine inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells by depleting Fe, interfering with DNA replication, and triggering intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Meanwhile, released Ca 2+ and ROS mutually promote and induce damage of cellular macromolecules, which leads to mitochondrial apoptosis of cancer cells. In an intraperitoneal disseminated mouse model with the human ovarian cancer cells SKOV3, CaALN nanoparticles selectively accumulate in tumor tissues and result in significant retardation of tumor growth and ascites formation. The mean survival time of SKOV3-bearing mice in treatment group is prolonged from 33 to 90 d. These results indicate that the alendronate-originated iron chelator can serve as an efficient strategy for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis.},

  abstract     = {Ghrelin contributes to the communication between the brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Both decreased ghrelin levels and functional GI disorders are early events in Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) patients and animal models. However, the reason is not clear. Here it is found that choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV), are lost in PD transgenic mice. In response to the selective damaging of DMV neurons with mu p75-SAP, a rapid reduction both in plasma total and active ghrelin levels is observed. While by contrast, chemogenetic activation of DMV cholinergic neurons can increase the plasma ghrelin levels. Impairment of cholinergic neurons is accompanied by GI disorders, including decreased stool wet weight, stool dry weight, small intestine advancing rate, and gastric emptying rate, while exogenous ghrelin treatment can partially ameliorate GI dysfunction of A53T α -synuclein transgenic mice. Using pseudorabies virus retrograde trace method, the existence of a direct pathway from the stomach fundus to the DMV is shown. Taken together, the findings suggest that the reduction in plasma ghrelin levels in the early stages of PD may be the result of the lesion of cholinergic neurons in the DMV, thus linking neurodegeneration and GI dysfunction in PD.},

  abstract     = {Owing to programmable nonlinear dynamics, magnetic domain wall (DW)-based devices can be configured to function as spintronic neurons, promising to execute sophisticated tasks as a human brain. Developing energy-efficient, CMOS compatible, reliable, and tunable spintronic neurons to emulate brain-inspired processes has been a key research goal for decades. Here, a new type of DW device is reported with biological neuron characteristics driven by the synergistic interaction between spin-orbit torque and built-in field ( H built-in ) in magnetic tunnel junctions, enabling time- and energy-efficient leaky-integrate-and-fire and self-reset neuromorphic implementations. A tilted magnetic anisotropic free layer is proposed and further executed to mitigate the DW retrograde motion by suppressing the Walker breakdown. Complementary experiments and micromagnetic co-simulation results show that the integrating/leaking time of the developed spintronic neuron can be tuned to 12/15 ns with an integrating power consumption of 65 µW, which is 36× and 1.84× time and energy efficient than the state-of-the-art alternatives, respectively. Moreover, the spatial distribution of H built-in can be modulated by adjusting the width and compensation of the reference layer, facilitating tunable activation function generator exploration. Such architecture demonstrates great potential in both fundamental research and new trajectories of technology advancement for spintronic neuron hardware applications.},

  abstract     = {A malformed tumour vascular network provokes the nutrient-deprived tumour microenvironment (TME), which conversely activates endothelial cell (EC) functions and stimulates neovascularization. Emerging evidence suggests that the flexible metabolic adaptability of tumour cells helps to establish a metabolic symbiosis among various cell subpopulations in the fluctuating TME. In this study, the authors propose a novel metabolic link between bladder cancer (BCa) cells and ECs in the nutrient-scarce TME, in which BCa-secreted glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 1 (GFAT1) via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) reprograms glucose metabolism by increasing hexosamine biosynthesis pathway flux in ECs and thus enhances O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) O-GlcNAcylation at serine 101 in ECs promotes its degradation by ubiquitination and impeded importin α 5-mediated nuclear translocation. Intranuclear SerRS attenuates vascular endothelial growth factor transcription by competitively binding to the GC-rich region of the proximal promotor. Additionally, GFAT1 knockout in tumour cells blocks SerRS O-GlcNAcylation in ECs and attenuates angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. However, administration of GFAT1-overexpressing BCa cells-derived sEVs increase the angiogenetic activity in the ECs of GFAT1-knockout mice. In summary, this study suggests that inhibiting sEV-mediated GFAT1 secretion from BCa cells and targeting SerRS O-GlcNAcylation in ECs may serve as novel strategies for BCa antiangiogenetic therapy.},

Thus, the development of an oxygen-controllable treatment is critically important to unify MI prevention and timely treatment. Here, a hydrogel encapsulated upconversion cyanobacterium nanocapsule for both MI prevention and treatment is successfully synthesized. The engineered cyanobacteria can consume oxygen via respiration to generate a hypoxic microenvironment, resulting in the upregulation of heat shock protein70 (HSP70), which can enhance the tolerance of CMs for MI. When necessary, under 980 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, the system releases photosynthetic oxygen through upconversion luminescence (UCL) to inhibit macrophage M1 polarization, and downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ), thereby repairing myocardial injury. To sum up, a photoresponsive upconversion cyanobacterium nanocapsule is developed, which can achieve MI prevention and treatment for only one injection via NIR-defined respiration and photosynthesis.},

Here, inspired by the unique suction-cup structures of abalones, a novel adhesive and photo-responsive microparticle (MP) delivery system is developed to treat periodontitis through microfluidic electrospray technology. Such MPs are generated by quickly ionic cross-linking of sodium alginate together with photo-curing of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate of the distorted microfluidic droplets during their high-speed dropping into calcium chloride solution. Attributing to their unique concave structures, the abalone-inspired MPs exhibit desired underwater adhesion ability and stability under running water. In addition, due to the loading of antibiotics minocycline hydrochloride and near-infrared (NIR)-responsive black phosphorus during their fabrication, the resultant MPs can not only eradicate bacteria directly, but also realize a controllable and effective drug release upon NIR irradiation. Based on these features, it is demonstrated from in vivo periodontitis that the abalone-inspired MPs are firmly adhesive and can controlled-release drugs on the tooth, and thus have outstanding antibacterial efficacy against Porphyromonas gingivalis . These results indicate the particular values of the abalone-inspired MPs for oral-related disease treatment.},

Evidence is provided that the salivaricins exert immunomodulatory effects in inhibiting T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation and interleukin-21 (IL-21) production. Mechanically, salivaricins directly bind to and induce conformational changes of IL-6 and IL-21 receptors, thereby inhibiting the bindings of IL-6 and IL-21 to their receptors and suppressing the downstream signaling pathway.

  abstract     = {Sensory nerves are long being recognized as collecting units of various outer stimuli; recent advances indicate that the sensory nerve also plays pivotal roles in maintaining organ homeostasis. Here, this study shows that sensory nerve orchestrates intervertebral disc (IVD) homeostasis by regulating its extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism. Specifically, genetical sensory denervation of IVD results in loss of IVD water preserve molecule chondroitin sulfate (CS), the reduction of CS bio-synthesis gene chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1) expression, and dysregulated ECM homeostasis of IVD. Particularly, knockdown of sensory neuros calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression induces similar ECM metabolic disorder compared to sensory nerve denervation model, and this effect is abolished in CHSY1 knockout mice. Furthermore, in vitro evidence shows that CGRP regulates nucleus pulposus cell CHSY1 expression and CS synthesis via CGRP receptor component receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling. Therapeutically, local injection of forskolin significantly attenuates IVD degeneration progression in mouse annulus fibrosus puncture model. Overall, these results indicate that sensory nerve maintains IVD ECM homeostasis via CGRP/CHSY1 axis and promotes IVD repair, and this expands the understanding concerning how IVD links to sensory nerve system, thus shedding light on future development of novel therapeutical strategy to IVD degeneration.},

The fiber-type thermistors are composed of acrylate polymer and carbon nanofibers. The fibrous composite materials are coated with a parylene to form a core–sheath structure, which improves the repeatability of temperature characteristics. Approximately 5 µm thick fiber-type thermistors exhibit an increase in the resistance by three orders of magnitude within ≈2 °C and repeatable temperature characteristics for up to 400 cycles. The mesh structure enables the thermistor layer to be ultra-lightweight and transparent; the mesh-type thermistor operates with a fiber density of 16.5 µg cm −2 , whose fiber layer has a transmittance of more than 90% in the 400–800 nm region. By fabricating the mesh thermistor on a 1.4 µm thick substrate, the thermistor operates without degradation when wrapped around a 280 µm radius needle. Furthermore, the gas-permeable property is demonstrated by fabricating the fibrous thermistor on a mesh substrate.

  abstract     = {Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the major treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it may cause hypoxic environment, leading to rapid progression after treatment. Here, using high-throughput sequencing on different models, S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9) is identified as a key oncogene involved in post-TACE progression. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of S100A9 significantly dampens the growth and metastatic ability of HCC. Mechanistically, TACE induces S100A9 via hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A)-mediated pathway. S100A9 acts as a scaffold recruiting ubiquitin specific peptidase 10 and phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5) to form a tripolymer, causing the deubiquitination and stabilization of PGAM5, leading to mitochondrial fission and reactive oxygen species production, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of HCC. Higher S100A9 level in HCC tissue or in serum predicts a worse outcome for HCC patients. Collectively, this study identifies S100A9 as a key driver for post-TACE HCC progression.

  abstract     = {The execution of biological activities inside space-limited cell nuclei requires sophisticated organization. Current studies on the 3D genome focus on chromatin interactions and local structures, e.g., topologically associating domains (TADs). In this study, two global physical properties: DNA density and distance to nuclear periphery (DisTP), are introduced and a 2D matrix, D 2 plot, is constructed for mapping genetic and epigenetic markers. Distinct patterns of functional markers on the D 2 plot, indicating its ability to compartmentalize functional genome regions, are observed. Furthermore, enrichments of transcription-related markers are concatenated into a cross-species transcriptional activation model, where the nucleus is divided into four areas: active, intermediate, repress and histone, and repress and repeat. Based on the trajectories of the genomic regions on D 2 plot, the constantly active and newly activated genes are successfully identified during olfactory sensory neuron maturation. The analysis reveals that the D 2 plot effectively categorizes functional regions and provides a universal and transcription-related measurement for the 3D genome.},

  abstract     = {Amorphization and crystalline grain boundary engineering are adopted separately in improving the catalytic kinetics for water electrolysis. Yet, the synergistic effect and advance in the cooperated form of crystalline/amorphous interfaces (CAI) have rarely been elucidated insightfully. Herein, a trimetallic FeCo(NiS 2 ) 4 catalyst with numerous CAI (FeCo(NiS 2 ) 4 -C/A) is presented, which shows highly efficient catalytic activity toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that CAI plays a significant role in accelerating water electrolysis kinetics, in which Co atoms on the CAI of FeCo(NiS 2 ) 4 -C/A catalyst exhibit the optimal binding energy of 0.002 eV for H atoms in HER while it also has the lowest reaction barrier of 1.40 eV for the key step of OER. H 2 O molecules are inclined to be absorbed on the interfacial Ni atoms based on DFT calculations. As a result, the heterostructural CAI-containing catalyst shows a low overpotential of 82 and 230 mV for HER and OER, respectively. As a bifunctional catalyst, it delivers a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a low cell voltage of 1.51 V, which enables it a noble candidate as metal-based catalysts for water splitting. This work explores the role of CAI in accelerating the HER and OER kinetics for water electrolysis, which sheds light on the development of efficient, stable, and economical water electrolysis systems by facile interface-engineering implantations.},

  abstract     = {In addition to oxidative stress and impaired angiogenesis, the overexpression of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and proinflammatory cytokines, which are promoted by hyperglycemia, causes chronic inflammation in diabetic wounds. Herein, TA-siRNA nanogels are prepared for the first time on the basis of the self-assembling interaction between tannic acid (TA) and short interfering RNA (siRNA). The efficient, biodegradable nanogels are cross-linked with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), human-like collagen (HLC), TA, and borax to prepare adaptive, conductive PHTB (TA-siRNA) hydrogels. In response to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the ROS-responsive borate ester bonds in the hydrogels are oxidized and broken, and TA-siRNA nanogels are released into cells to reduce the expression of the MMP-9. Moreover, the TA and HLC promote collagen expression, reduce inflammation, and ROS level. It is found that electrical stimulation (ES) promotes the in vivo release of TA-siRNA nanogels from PHTB (TA-siRNA) hydrogels and endocytosis of the nanogels. The combination therapy using ES and PHTB (TA-siRNA) hydrogels accelerates the healing of diabetic wounds by reducing the levels of ROS and MMP-9 and promoting the polarization of macrophages, production of collagen, and angiogenesis. This study provides insights on the design of functional gene-delivery and efficient therapeutic strategies to promote the repair of diabetic chronic wounds.},

Vanguard expression is maintained in cancer cells by SP1-dependent transcription according to glucose availability and cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. Vanguard promotes complex formation between HMGB1 and HDAC1, with the resulting deacetylation of HMGB1 serving to maintain its nuclear localization and DSB repair function. However, Vanguard downregulation under glucose limiting conditions promotes HMGB1 translocation from the nucleus, increasing DNA damage, and compromising cancer cell growth and viability. Moreover, Vanguard silencing increases the effectiveness of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors against breast cancer cells with wild-type breast cancer gene-1 status, suggesting Vanguard as a potential therapeutic target.},

Herein, titanium sulfide nanosheets (TiS X NSs) are prepared as cascade bioreactors for sequential gas–sonodynamic cancer therapy. TiS X NSs themselves as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) donors can burst release H 2 S gas. Following H 2 S generation, TiS X NSs are gradually degraded to become S-defective and partly oxidized into TiO X on their surface, which endows TiS X NSs with high sonodynamic properties under ultrasound (US) irradiation. In vitro and in vivo experiments show the excellent therapeutic effects of TiS X NSs. In detail, large amounts of H 2 S gas and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can simultaneously inhibit mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, leading to cancer cell apoptosis. Of note, H 2 S gas also plays important roles in modulating and activating the immune system to effectively inhibit pulmonary metastasis. Finally, the metabolizable TiS X NSs are excreted out of the body without inducing any significant long-term toxicity. Collectively, this work establishes a cascade bioreactor of TiS X NSs with satisfactory H 2 S release ability and excellent ROS generation properties under US irradiation for programmed gas–sonodynamic cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {The outstanding abilities of metamaterials to manipulate physical fields are extensively studied in both wave-based and diffusion-based fields. However, mass diffusion metamaterials, with the ability to manipulate diffusion with practical applications associated with chemical and biochemical engineering, have not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, ion cloaking, concentrating, and selection in liquid solvents are verified by both simulations and experiments, and the concept of a “plug and switch” metamaterial is proposed based on scattering cancellation (SC) to achieve switchable functions by plugging modularized functional units into a functional motherboard. Plugging in any module barely affects the environmental diffusion field, but the module choice impacts different diffusion behaviors in the central region. Cloaking strictly hinds ion diffusion, and concentrating increase diffusion flux, while cytomembrane-like ion selection permits the entrance of some ions but blocks others. In addition, these functions are demonstrated in special applications like the catalytic enhancement by the concentrator and the protein protection by the ion selector. This work not only experimentally demonstrates the effective manipulation of mass diffusion by metamaterials, but also shows that the “plug and switch” design is extensible and reconfigurable. It facilitates novel applications including sustained drug release, catalytic enhancement, bioinspired cytomembranes, etc.},

  abstract     = {Selective inhibition of targeted protein kinases is an effective therapeutic approach for treatment of human malignancies, which interferes phosphorylation of cellular substrates. However, a drug-imposed selection creates pressures for tumor cells to acquire chemoresistance-conferring mutations or activating alternative pathways, which can bypass the inhibitory effects of kinase inhibitors. Thus, identifying downstream phospho-substrates conferring drug resistance is of great importance for developing poly-pharmacological and targeted therapies. To identify functional phosphorylation sites involved in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance during its treatment of colorectal cancer cells, CRISPR-mediated cytosine base editor (CBE) and adenine base editor (ABE) are utilized for functional screens by mutating phosphorylated amino acids with two libraries specifically targeting 7779 and 10 149 phosphorylation sites. Among the top enriched gRNAs-induced gain-of-function mutants, the target genes are involved in cell cycle and post-translational covalent modifications. Moreover, several substrates of RSK2 and PAK4 kinases are discovered as main effectors in responding to 5-FU chemotherapy, and combinational treatment of colorectal cancer cells with 5-FU and RSK2 inhibitor or PAK4 inhibitor can largely inhibit cell growth and enhance cell apoptosis through a RSK2/TP53BP1/ γ -H2AX phosphorylation signaling axis. It is proposed that this screen approach can be used for functional phosphoproteomics in chemotherapy of various human diseases.},

  abstract     = {Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are stimuli-responsive materials capable of undergoing large deformations. The thermomechanical response of LCEs is attributable to the coupling of polymer network properties and disruption of order between liquid crystalline mesogens. Complex deformations have been realized in LCEs by either programming the nematic director via surface-enforced alignment or localized mechanical deformation in materials incorporating dynamic covalent chemistries. Here, the preparation of LCEs via thiol-Michael addition reaction is reported that are amenable to surface-enforced alignment. Afforded by the thiol-Michael addition reaction, dynamic covalent bonds are uniquely incorporated in chemistries subject to surface-enforce alignment. Accordingly, LCEs prepared with complex director profiles are able to be programmed and reprogrammed by (re)activating the dynamic covalent chemistry to realize distinctive shape transformations.},

  abstract     = {Independent of tumor type and non-invasive or minimally-invasive feature, current physical treatments including ultrasound therapy, microwave ablation (MWA), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are widely used as the local treatment methods in clinics for directly killing tumors and activating systematic immune responses. However, the activated immune responses are inadequate and incompetent for tumor recession, and the incomplete thermal ablation even aggravates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM), resulting in the intractable tumor recurrence and metastasis. Intriguingly, nanomedicine provides a powerful platform as they can elevate energy utilization efficiency and augment oncolytic effects for mitigating ITM and potentiating the systematic immune responses. Especially after combining with clinical immunotherapy, the anti-tumor killing effect by activating or enhancing the human anti-tumor immune system is reached, enabling the effective prevention against tumor recurrence and metastasis. This review systematically introduces the cutting-edge progress and direction of nanobiotechnologies and their corresponding nanomaterials. Moreover, the enhanced physical treatment efficiency against tumor progression, relapse, and metastasis via activating or potentiating the autologous immunity or combining with exogenous immunotherapeutic agents is exemplified, and their rationales are analyzed. This review offers general guidance or directions to enhance clinical physical treatment from the perspectives of immunity activation or magnification.},

  abstract     = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)-based photocatalysts have received growing attention for photocatalytic hydrogen (H 2 ) production. One of the big challenges in the field is to find ways to promote energy/electron transfer and exciton dissociation. Addressing this challenge, herein, a series of olefin-linked 2D COFs is fabricated with high crystallinity, porosity, and robustness using a melt polymerization method without adding volatile organic solvents. It is found that regulation of the spatial distances between the acceptor units (triazine and 2, 2&#39;-bipyridine) of COFs to match the charge carrier diffusion length can dramatically promote the exciton dissociation, hence leading to outstanding photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance. The COF with the appropriate acceptor distance achieves exceptional photocatalytic H 2 evolution with an apparent quantum yield of 56.2% at 475 nm, the second highest value among all COF photocatalysts and 70 times higher than the well-studied polymer carbon nitride. Various experimental and computation studies are then conducted to in-depth unveil the mechanism behind the enhanced performance. This study will provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Many healthcare and environmental monitoring devices use electrochemical techniques to detect and quantify analytes. With sensors progressively becoming smaller—particularly in point-of-care (POC) devices and wearable platforms—it creates the opportunity to operate them using less energy than their predecessors. In fact, they may require so little power that can be extracted from the analyzed fluids themselves, for example, blood or sweat in case of physiological sensors and sources like river water in the case of environmental monitoring. Self-powered electrochemical sensors (SPES) can generate a response by utilizing the available chemical species in the analyzed liquid sample. Though SPESs generate relatively low power, capable devices can be engineered by combining suitable reactions, miniaturized cell designs, and effective sensing approaches for deciphering analyte information. This review details various such sensing and engineering approaches adopted in different categories of SPES systems that solely use the power available in liquid sample for their operation. Specifically, the categories discussed in this review cover enzyme-based systems, battery-based systems, and ion-selective electrode-based systems. The review details the benefits and drawbacks with these approaches, as well as prospects of and challenges to accomplishing them.},

However, the relatively high trap-state density and poor charge carrier extraction efficiency pose challenges. Herein, highly efficient and stable PSCs via a two-step sequential method are fabricated using organic—inorganic (OI) complexes as multifunctional interlayers. In addition to reduce the under-coordinated Pb 2+ ions related trap states by forming interactions with the functional groups, the complexes interlayer tends to form dipole moment which can enhance the built-in electric field, thus facilitating charge carrier extraction. Consequently, with rational molecular design, the resulting devices with a vertical dipole moment that parallels with the built-in electric field yield a champion efficiency of 23.55% with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the hydrophobicity of the (OI) complexes contributes to an excellent ambient stability of the resulting device with 91% of initial efficiency maintained after 3000 h storage.},

In this work, helical polariton lasing from topological valleys of an organic anisotropic microcrystalline cavity based on tailored local nontrivial band geometry is demonstrated. This polariton laser emits light of different helicity along different angular directions. The significantly enhanced chiral characteristics are achieved by the nonlinear relaxation process.

However, the power factors of current ductile/plastic inorganic semiconductors are usually low (below 5 µW cm −1 K −2 ) as compared with classic brittle inorganic thermoelectric materials, which greatly limit the electrical output power for flexible thermoelectrics. Here, large plasticity and high power factor in bulk two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) single-crystalline SnSe 2 are reported. SnSe 2 crystals exhibit large plastic strains at room temperature and they can be morphed into various shapes without cracking, which is well captured by the inherent large deformability factor. As a semiconductor, the electrical transport properties of SnSe 2 can be readily tuned in a wide range by doping a tiny amount of halogen elements. A high power factor of 10.8 µW cm −1 K −2 at 375 K along the in-plane direction is achieved in plastic single-crystalline Br-doped SnSe 2 , which is the highest value among the reported flexible inorganic and organic thermoelectric materials. Combining the good plasticity, excellent power factors, as well as low-cost and nontoxic elements, bulk 2D vdW single-crystalline SnSe 2 shows great promise to achieve high power density for flexible thermoelectrics.},

In this work, for the first time, the authors report intrinsically stretchable OECTs with overall performance benchmarkable to conventional rigid devices. In particular, oxygen level in the stretchable substrate is revealed to have a significant impact on the on/off ratio. By employing stretchable substrates with low oxygen permeabilities, the on/off ratio is elevated from ≈10 to a record-high value of ≈10 4 , which is on par with a rigid OECT. The device remained functional after cyclic stretching tests. This work demonstrates that intrinsically stretchable OECTs have the potential to serve as a new building block for emerging soft bioelectronic applications such as electronic skin, soft implantables, and soft neuromorphic computing.},

Although there are some studies on microwave powered artificial muscles based on different structures, the lack of studies on microwave control has limited the development of microwave-driven (MWD) robots. Here, a far-field MWD parallel robot controlled by adjusting energy distribution via changing the polarization direction of microwaves at 2.47 GHz is first reported. The parallel robot is based on three double-layer bending actuators composed of wave-absorbing sheets and bimetallic sheets, and it can implement circular and triangular path at a distance of 0.4 m under 700 W transmitting power. The thermal response rate of the actuator under microwaves is studied, and it is found that the electric-field components can provide a faster thermal response at the optimal length of actuator than magnetic-field components. The work of the parallel robot is demonstrated in an enclosed space composed of microwave-transparent materials. This developed method demonstrates the multi-degree-of-freedom controllability for robots using microwaves and offers potential solutions for some engineering cases, such as pipeline/reactors inspection and medical applications.},

In contrast to the traditional usage of glass-based microfluidics, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) swelling behavior is employed to generate complex emulsions with multiple inner cores. In the presence of block copolymer surfactant, these emulsions undergo gravity-driven dewetting of styrene, to transform into membranous structures with compartments. Further polymerization of styrene skeletal remains resulted in microparticles with interesting geometries and intact membranes. Mechanical and confocal microscopic studies prove the absence of polystyrene within these membranes. Using osmotic pressure, membrane rupture and release of encapsulated gold nanoparticles from such polymerized emulsions leading up to applications in cargo delivery and membrane transport are promoted. Even after membrane rupture, the structured microparticles have shown interesting light-scattering behavior for applications in structural coloring and biosensing. Thereby, proving PDMS-based swelling as a potential methodology for reproducible production of complex emulsions with a potential to be transformed into membranous emulsions or solid microparticles with intricate structures and multiple applications.},

Herein, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and SpaTial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) are used to investigate the immunological microenvironment of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The expression levels of most immune suppressive genes in the tumor and inflammation areas of CSCC are not significantly higher than those in the non-cancer samples, except for LGALS9 and IDO1 . Stronger signals of CD56 + NK cells and immature dendritic cells are found in the hypermetabolic tumor areas, whereas more eosinophils, immature B cells, and Treg cells are found in the hypometabolic tumor areas. Moreover, a cluster of pro-tumorigenic cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myCAFs) are identified. The myCAFs may support the growth and metastasis of tumors by inhibiting lymphocyte infiltration and remodeling of the tumor extracellular matrix. Furthermore, these myCAFs are associated with poorer survival probability in patients with CSCC, predict resistance to immunotherapy, and might be present in a small fraction (&lt; 30%) of patients with advanced cancer. Immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence staining are conducted to validate the spatial distribution and potential function of myCAFs. Collectively, these findings enhance the understanding of the immunological microenvironment of CSCC and shed light on the treatment of advanced CSCC.},

  abstract     = {Individual carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene have unique mechanical and electrical properties; however, the properties of their macroscopic assemblies have not met expectations because of limited physical dimensions, the limited degree of dispersion of the components, and various structural defects. Here, a state-of-the-art assembly for a novel type of hybrid fiber possessing the properties required for a wide variety of multifunctional applications is presented. A simple and effective multidimensional nanostructure of CNT and graphene oxide (GO) assembled by solution processing improves the interfacial utilization of the components. Flexible GOs are effectively intercalated between nanotubes along the shape of CNTs, which reduces voids, enhances orientation, and maximizes the contact between elements. The microstructure is finely controlled by the elements content ratio and dimensions, and an optimal balance improves the mechanical properties. The hybrid fibers simultaneously exhibit exceptional strength (6.05 GPa), modulus (422 GPa), toughness (76.8 J g –1 ), electrical conductivity (8.43 MS m –1 ), and knot strength efficiency (92%). Furthermore, surface and electrochemical properties are significantly improved by tuning the GO content, further expanding the scope of applications. These hybrid fibers are expected to offer a strategy for overcoming the limitations of existing fibers in meeting the requirements for applications in the fiber industry.},

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy, the most promising strategy of cancer treatment, has achieved promising outcomes, but its clinical efficacy in pancreatic cancer is limited mainly due to the complicated tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. As a highly inflammatory form of immunogenic cell death (ICD), pyroptosis provides a great opportunity to alleviate immunosuppression and promote systemic immune responses in solid tumors. Herein, membrane-targeted photosensitizer TBD-3C with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature to trigger pyroptosis-aroused cancer immunotherapy via photodynamic therapy (PDT) is applied. The results reveal that pyroptotic cells induced by TBD-3C could stimulate M1-polarization of macrophages, cause maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), and activation of CD8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Pyroptosis-aroused immunological responses could convert immunosuppressive “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) to immunogenic “hot” TME, which not only inhibits primary pancreatic cancer growth but also attacks the distant tumor. This work establishes a platform with high biocompatibility for light-controlled antitumor immunity and solid tumor immunotherapy aroused by cell pyroptosis.},

  abstract     = {Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a major target to cancer immunotherapy, and anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 antibody-mediated immunotherapy are being increasingly used. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are ineffective in treating large tumors and cause various immune-related adverse events in nontarget organs, including life-threatening cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome these limitations is crucial. The focus of this study is the forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1), which is identified as a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy and is associated with the modulation of PD-L1 expression. Selective small interfering RNA knockdown of FOXM1 or treatment with thiostrepton (TST) significantly reduces PD-L1 expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and inhibits proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR reveals that FOXM1 selectively upregulates PD-L1 expression by binding directly to the PD-L1 promoter. In vivo animal studies have shown that TST treatment significantly downregulates PD-L1 expression in human NSCLC tumors, while greatly reducing tumor size without side effects on normal tissues. Combined treatment with TST and anti-4-1BB antibody in the LLC-1 syngeneic tumor model induces synergistic therapeutic outcomes against immune resistant lung tumors as well as 2.72-folds higher CD3 + T cells in tumor tissues compared to that in the anti-4-1BB antibody treatment group.},

  abstract     = {Excess iron accumulation occurs in organs of patients with certain genetic disorders or after repeated transfusions. No physiological mechanism is available to excrete excess iron and iron overload to promote lipid peroxidation to induce ferroptosis, thus iron chelation becomes critical for preventing ion toxicity in these patients. To date, several iron chelators have been approved for iron chelation therapy, such as deferiprone and deferoxamine, but the current iron chelators suffer from significant limitations. In this context, new agents are continuously sought. Here, a library of new deferric amine compounds ( DFAs ) with adjustable skeleton and flexibility is synthesized by adopting the beneficial properties of conventional chelators. After careful evaluations, compound DFA1 is found to have greater efficacy in binding iron through two molecular oxygens in the phenolic hydroxyl group and the nitrogen atom in the amine with a 2:1 stoichiometry. This compound remarkably ameliorates iron overload in diverse murine models through both oral and intravenous administration, including hemochromatosis, high iron diet-induced, and iron dextran-stimulated iron accumulation. Strikingly, this compound is found to suppress iron-induced ferroptosis by modulating the intracellular signaling that drives lipid peroxidation. This study opens a new approach for the development of iron chelators to treat iron overload.},

Herein, a microfluidic system is constructed to evaluate cellular uptake of HNPs of different elasticity under flow conditions. It is found that soft HNPs are more efficiently taken up by cells than hard HNPs under flow conditions, owing to the greater adhesion between soft HNPs and cells. Furthermore, in vivo imaging reveals that soft HNPs have a more efficient tumor delivery than hard HNPs, and the greater targeting potential of soft HNPs is associated with both prolonged blood circulation and a high extent of cellular adhesion.},

Despite the widespread use, a generalized understanding of how these hydrogel formulations become printable is still missing, mainly due to their variety and diversity. Employing an interpretable machine learning approach allows the authors to explain the process of rendering printability through bulk rheological indices, with no bias toward the composition of formulations and the type of rheology additives. Based on an extensive library of rheological data and printability scores for 180 different formulations, 13 critical rheological measures that describe the printability of hydrogel formulations, are identified. Using advanced statistical methods, it is demonstrated that even though unique criteria to predict printability on a global scale are highly unlikely, the accretive and collaborative nature of rheological measures provides a qualitative and physically interpretable guideline for designing new printable materials.},

  abstract     = {Herein, a multifunctional bilayer wound patch is developed by integrating a debonding-on-demand polymeric tissue adhesive (DDPTA) with an ionic conducting elastomer (ICE). As a skin adhesive layer, the DDPTA is soft and adherent at skin temperature but hard and non-tacky when cooled, so it provides unique temperature-triggered quick adhesion and non-forced detachment from the skin. During use, the dense surface of the DDPTA prevents blood infiltration and reduces unnecessary blood loss with gentle pressing. Moreover, its hydrophobic matrix helps to repel blood and prevents the formation of clots, thus precluding wound tearing during its removal. This unique feature enables the DDPTA to avoid the severe deficiencies of hydrophilic adhesives, providing a reliable solution for a wide range of secondary wound injuries. The DDPTA is versatile in that it can be covered with ICE to configure a DDPTA@ICE patch for initiating non-verbal communication systems by the fingers, leading toward sign language recognition and a remote clinical alarm system. This multifunctional wound patch with debonding-on-demand can promote a new style of tissue sealant for convenient clinical communication.},

However, the chirality effect in neural stem cell differentiation has not been investigated. Here, this study shows that chiral nanoparticles (NPs) with strong chirality can efficiently accelerate the differentiation of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) into neurons under near-infrared (NIR) light illumination. L-type NPs are 1.95 times greater than D-type NPs in promoting NSCs differentiation due to their 1.47-fold endocytosis efficiency. Whole gene expression map analysis reveals that circularly polarized light illumination and chiral NPs irradiation significantly upregulate Map2 , Yap1 , and Taz genes, resulting in mechanical force, cytoskeleton protein action, and accelerated NSCs differentiation. In vivo experiments show that successful differentiation can further alleviate symptoms in Alzheimer&#39;s disease mice. Moreover, the clearance of L-type NPs on amyloid and hyperphosphorylated p-tau protein reachs 68.24% and 66.43%, respectively, under the synergy of NIR irradiation.

To date, functional trachea regeneration with alternant cartilage-fibrous tissue-mimetic structure similar to that of the native trachea relying on the three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology has seen very limited breakthrough. This fact is mostly due to the lack of tissue-specific bioinks suitable for both cartilage and vascularized fibrous tissue regeneration, as well as the need for firm interfacial integration between stiff and soft tissues. Here, a novel strategy is developed for 3D bioprinting of cartilage-vascularized fibrous tissue-integrated trachea ( CVFIT ), utilizing photocrosslinkable tissue-specific bioinks. Both cartilage- and fibrous tissue-specific bioinks created by this study provide suitable printability, favorable biocompatibility, and biomimetic microenvironments for chondrogenesis and vascularized fibrogenesis based on the multicomponent synergistic effect through the hybrid photoinitiated polymerization reaction. As such, the tubular analogs are successfully bioprinted and the ring-to-ring alternant structure is tightly integrated by the enhancement of interfacial bonding through the amidation reaction. The results from both the trachea regeneration and the in situ trachea reconstruction demonstrate the satisfactory tissue-specific regeneration along with realization of mechanical and physiological functions. This study thus illustrates the 3D-bioprinted native tissue-like trachea as a promising alternative for clinical trachea reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {Although metastatic melanoma can be managed with chemotherapy, its heterogeneity and resistance to therapy remain poorly understood. In addition to the spread of melanoma in the bloodstream, melanoma-stroma interaction and the lymphatic system play active roles in said heterogeneity and resistance, leading to its progression and metastasis. Reproducing the complexities of the melanoma microenvironment in vitro will help understanding its progression and enhance the translatability of potential cancer therapeutics. A blood-lymphatic integrated system with heterogeneous melanoma spheroids (BLISH) using the in-bath bioprinting process is developed. The process uniformly prints size-controllable metastatic melanoma spheroids along with biomimetic blood and lymphatic vessels (LVs). The system reproduces hallmark events of metastatic melanoma, such as tumor stroma interaction, melanoma invasion, and intravasation. The application of the system to investigate the anticancer effect of combinational targeted therapy suggests that it can be used to study the pathophysiology of melanoma and improve the accuracy of drug response monitoring in skin cancer.},

  abstract     = {Recent evidence has indicated that overexpression of the epigenetic reader bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) contributes to a poor prognosis of lung cancers, and the suppression of its expression promotes cell apoptosis and leads to tumor shrinkage. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy with the capability to precisely degrade targeted proteins. Herein, a novel style of versatile nano-PROTAC (CREATE ( CR V-LLC m e mbrane/DS-PLG A /dB ET 6)) is developed, which is constructed by using a pH/GSH (glutathione)-responsive polymer (disulfide bond-linked poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid), DS-PLGA) to load BRD4-targeted PROTAC (dBET6), followed by the camouflage with engineered lung cancer cell membranes with dual targeting capability. Notably, CREATE remarkably confers simultaneous targeting ability to lung cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The pH/GSH-responsive design improves the release of dBET6 payload from nanoparticles to induce pronounced apoptosis of both cells, which synergistically inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor-bearing mouse model. Furthermore, the efficient tumor inhibition is due to the direct elimination of lung cancer cells and TAMs, which remodels the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the results elucidate the construction of a versatile nano-PROTAC enables to eliminate both lung cancer cells and TAMs, which opens a new avenue for efficient lung cancer therapy via PROTAC.},

Here, this study reports two metabolism-based molecular subtypes associated with the ketogenic treatment of colon cancer: glycolytic (glycolysis + /ketolysis − ) and ketolytic (glycolysis + /ketolysis + ), which are manifested by distinct profiles of metabolic enzymes and mitochondrial dysfunction, and by different responses to ketone-containing interventions in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the glycolytic subtype is able to be transformed into the ketolytic subtype in p53-mutated tumors upon glucose limitation, rendering resistance to ketogenic therapy associated with upregulation of ketolytic enzymes, such as OXCT1 by mutant p53. The allosteric activator of mutant p53 effectively blocks the rewired molecular expression and the reprogrammed metabolism, leading to the suppression of tumor growth. The findings highlight the utility of metabolic subtyping to guide ketogenic therapy in colon cancer and identify mutant p53 as a synthetic lethality target for ketogenic treatment.},

Herein, losartan, an antihypertension agent, is applied as a tumor stroma modulator and developed into a nanosystem. A series of lipophilic losartan prodrugs are constructed by esterification of the hydroxyl group on losartan to fatty acids. Based on the self-assembly ability and hydrodynamic diameter, the losartan-linoleic acid conjugate is selected for further investigation. To improve the stability in vivo, nanoassemblies are refined with PEGylation to form losartan nanoblocker (Los NB), and administered via intravenous injection for experiments. On murine models of pancreatic cancer, Los NB shows a greater ability to remodel the tumor microenvironment than free losartan, including stromal depletion, vessel perfusion increase, and hypoxia relief. Furthermore, Los NB pretreatment remarkably enhances the accumulation and penetration of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)-loaded nanodrugs (SN38 NPs) in tumor tissues. Expectedly, overall therapeutic efficacy of SN38 NPs is significantly enhanced after Los NB pretreatment. Since losartan is one of the most commonly used antihypertension agents, this study may provide a potential for clinical transformation in stroma-rich PDAC treatment.},

  abstract     = {Despite extensive study, the bandgap characteristics of lead halide perovskites are not well understood. Usually, these materials are considered as direct bandgap semiconductors, while their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is very low in the solid state or single crystal (SC) state. Some researchers have noted a weak indirect bandgap below the direct bandgap transition in these perovskites. Herein, application of pressure to a CsPbBr 3 SC and first-principles calculations reveal that the nature of the bandgap becomes more direct at a relatively low pressure due to decreased dynamic Rashba splitting. This effect results in a dramatic PLQY improvement, improved more than 90 times, which overturns the traditional concept that the PLQY of lead halide perovskite SC cannot exceed 10%. Application of higher pressure transformed the CsPbBr 3 SC into a pure indirect bandgap phase, which can be maintained at near-ambient pressure. It is thus proved that lead halide perovskites can induce a phase transition between direct and indirect bandgaps. In addition, distinct piezochromism is observed for a perovskite SC for the first time. This work provides a novel framework to understand the optoelectronic properties of these important materials.},

Aminated [70]fullerene exhibits notable antineoplastic effects, promoting it a candidate for multi-targeted cancer drugs. It is an urgent need to reveal the structure–activity relationship for antineoplastic aminated fullerenes. Herein, three amphiphilic derivatives of [60]fullerene with clarified molecular structures are synthesized: TAPC-4, TAPC-3, and TCPC-4. TAPC-4 inhibits the proliferation of diverse tumor cells via G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, reverses the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and abrogates the high mobility of tumor cells. TAPC-4 can be excreted from the organism and achieves an in vivo inhibition index of 75.5% in tumor proliferation and 87.5% in metastatic melanoma with a wide safety margin. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the amphiphilic molecular structure and the ending amino groups promote the targeting of TAPC-4 to heat shock protein Hsp90-beta, vimentin, and myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), probably resulting in the alteration of cyclin D1 translation, vimentin expression, and MYH9 location, respectively. This work initially emphasizes the dominant role of the amphiphilic structure and the terminal amino moieties in the antineoplastic effects of aminated fullerenes, providing fundamental support for their anti-tumor drug development.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectrics are being increasingly called upon for electronic devices in extreme environments. Device performance and energy efficiency is highly correlated to clock frequency, operational voltage, and resistive loss. To increase performance it is common to engineer ferroelectric domain structure with highly-correlated electrical and elastic coupling that elicit fast and efficient collective switching. Designing domain structures with advantageous properties is difficult because the mechanisms involved in collective switching are poorly understood and difficult to investigate. Collective switching is a hierarchical process where the nano- and mesoscale responses control the macroscopic properties. Using chemical solution synthesis, epitaxially nearly-relaxed (100) BaTiO 3 films are synthesized. Thermal strain induces a strongly-correlated domain structure with alternating domains of polarization along the [010] and [001] in-plane axes and 90° domain walls along the [011] or [01 ] directions. Simultaneous capacitance–voltage measurements and band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy revealed strong collective switching behavior. Using a deep convolutional autoencoder, hierarchical switching is automatically tracked and the switching pathway is identified. The collective switching velocities are calculated to be ≈500 cm s −1 at 5 V (7 kV cm −1 ), orders-of-magnitude faster than expected. These combinations of properties are promising for high-speed tunable dielectrics and low-voltage ferroelectric memories and logic.},

In this work, a class of core–shell electrocatalysts that utilize nickel nanoparticles in the core and nitrogen-doped porous carbon architecture in the shell (Ni@NC) for the efficient electroreduction of NO to ammonia (NH 3 ) is reported. In Ni@NC, the NC prevents the dissolution of Ni nanoparticles and ensures the long-term stability of the catalyst. The Ni nanoparticles involve in the catalytic reduction of NO to NH 3 during electrolysis. As a result, the Ni@NC achieves a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72.3% at 0.16 V RHE . The full-cell electrolyzer is constructed by coupling Ni@NC as cathode for NORR and RuO 2 as an anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which delivers a stable performance over 20 cycles at 1.5 V.

  abstract     = {Cellular response to protein misfolding underlies multiple diseases. Collagens are the most abundant vertebrate proteins, yet little is known about cellular response to misfolding of their procollagen precursors. Osteoblasts (OBs)—the cells that make bone—produce so much procollagen that it accounts for up to 40% of mRNAs in the cell, which is why bone bears the brunt of mutations causing procollagen misfolding in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The present study of a G610C mouse model of OI by multiple transcriptomic techniques provides first solid clues to how OBs respond to misfolded procollagen accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and how this response affects OB function. Surprisingly, misfolded procollagen escapes the quality control in the ER lumen and indirectly triggers the integrated stress response (ISR) through other cell compartments. In G610C OBs, the ISR is regulated by mitochondrial HSP70 (mt-HSP70) and ATF5 instead of their BIP and ATF4 paralogues, which normally activate and regulate ISR to secretory protein misfolding in the ER. The involvement of mt-HSP70 and ATF5 together with other transcriptomic findings suggest that mitochondria might initiate the ISR upon disruption of ER-mitochondria connections or might respond to the ISR activated by a yet unknown sensor.},

In this work, an inanimate spider is repurposed as a ready-to-use actuator requiring only a single facile fabrication step, initiating the area of “necrobotics” in which biotic materials are used as robotic components. The unique walking mechanism of spiders—relying on hydraulic pressure rather than antagonistic muscle pairs to extend their legs—results in a necrobotic gripper that naturally resides in its closed state and can be opened by applying pressure. The necrobotic gripper is capable of grasping objects with irregular geometries and up to 130% of its own mass. Furthermore, the gripper can serve as a handheld device and innately camouflages in outdoor environments. Necrobotics can be further extended to incorporate biotic materials derived from other creatures with similar hydraulic mechanisms for locomotion and articulation.},

  abstract     = {Cells migrating in vivo encounter microenvironments with varying physical properties. One such physical variable is the fluid viscosity surrounding the cell. Increased viscosity is expected to increase the hydraulic resistance experienced by the cell and decrease cell speed. The authors demonstrate that contrary to this expected result, cells migrate faster in high viscosity media on 2-dimensional substrates. Both actin dynamics and water dynamics driven by ion channel activity are examined. Results show that cells increase in area in high viscosity and actomyosin dynamics remain similar. Inhibiting ion channel fluxes in high viscosity media results in a large reduction in cell speed, suggesting that water flux contributes to the observed speed increase. Moreover, inhibiting actin-dependent vesicular trafficking that transports ion channels to the cell boundary changes ion channel spatial positioning and reduces cell speed in high viscosity media. Cells also display altered Ca 2+ activity in high viscosity media, and when cytoplasmic Ca 2+ is sequestered, cell speed reduction and altered ion channel positioning are observed. Taken together, it is found that the cytoplasmic actin-phase and water-phase are coupled to drive cell migration in high viscosity media, in agreement with physical modeling that also predicts the observed cell speedup in high viscosity environments.},

This evolutionary algorithm is capable of inferring physically interpretable models from cell aging data without requiring domain knowledge. This novel approach is compared against established approaches in case studies, which represent common tasks of lifetime prediction based on cycle and calendar aging data of 104 automotive lithium-ion pouch-cells. On average, predictive accuracy for extrapolations over storage time and energy throughput is increased by 38% and 13%, respectively. For predictions over other stress factors, error reductions of up to 77% are achieved.

  abstract     = {Axon pathfinding is a key step in neural circuits formation. However, the transcriptional mechanisms regulating its progression remain poorly understood. The binary decision of crossing or avoiding the midline taken by some neuronal axons during development represents a robust model to investigate the mechanisms that control the selection of axonal trajectories. Here, to identify novel regulators of axon guidance, this work compares the transcriptome and chromatin occupancy profiles of two neuronal subpopulations, ipsilateral (iRGC) and contralateral retinal ganglion cells (cRGC), with similar functions but divergent axon trajectories. These analyses retrieved a number of genes encoding for proteins not previously implicated in axon pathfinding. In vivo functional experiments confirm the implication of some of these candidates in axonal navigation. Among the candidate genes, γ -synuclein is identified as essential for inducing midline crossing. Footprint and luciferase assays demonstrate that this small-sized protein is regulated by the transcription factor (TF) Pou4f1 in cRGCs. It is also shown that Lhx2/9 are specifically expressed in iRGCs and control a program that partially overlaps with that regulated by Zic2, previously described as essential for iRGC specification. Overall, the analyses identify dozens of new molecules potentially involved in axon guidance and reveal the regulatory logic behind the selection of axonal trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant energy metabolism and cell cycle regulation both critically contribute to malignant cell growth and both processes represent targets for anticancer therapy. It is shown here that depletion of the AAA+-ATPase thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 13 (Trip13) results in mitotic cell death through a combined mechanism linking lipid metabolism to aberrant mitosis. Diminished Trip13 levels in hepatocellular carcinoma cells result in insulin-receptor-/Akt-pathway-dependent accumulation of lipid droplets, which act as functional acentriolar microtubule organizing centers disturbing mitotic spindle polarity. Specifically, the lipid-droplet-coating protein perilipin 2 (Plin2) is required for multipolar spindle formation, induction of DNA damage, and mitotic cell death. Plin2 expression in different tumor cells confers susceptibility to cell death induced by Trip13 depletion as well as treatment with paclitaxel, a spindle-interfering drug commonly used against different cancers. Thus, assessment of Plin2 levels enables the stratification of tumor responsiveness to mitosis-targeting drugs, including clinically approved paclitaxel and Trip13 inhibitors currently under development.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system and remains universally lethal due to lack of effective treatment options and their inefficient delivery to the brain. Here the development of multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) for effective treatment of GBM is reported. The NPs are synthesized using a novel glutathione (GSH)-reactive poly (2,2″-thiodiethylene 3,3″-dithiodipropionate) (PTD) polymer and engineered for brain penetration through neutrophil elastase-triggered shrinkability, iRGD-mediated targeted delivery, and lexiscan-induced autocatalysis. It is found that the resulting lexiscan-loaded, iRGD-conjugated, shrinkable PTD NPs, or LiPTD NPs, efficiently penetrate brain tumors with high specificity after intravenous administration. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that LiPTD NPs are capable of efficient encapsulation and delivery of chemotherapy doxorubicin and sonosensitizer chlorin e6 to achieve combined chemotherapy and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). It is demonstrated that the capability of GSH depletion of LiPTD NPs further augments the tumor cell killing effect triggered by SDT. As a result, treatment with LiPTD NPs effectively inhibits tumor growth and prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice. This study may suggest a potential new approach for effective GBM treatment.},

Shaping TLS-like niches may improve anti-cancer immunity and overcome the current limitations of immune cell-based immunotherapy. Here, it is shown that stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from adipose tissues can enhance dendritic cell (DC)-mediated T cell immunity by inducing ectopic T lymphocyte clusters. SVF cells expanded ex vivo have phenotypes and functions similar to those of fibroblastic reticular cells in a secondary lymphoid organ, and their properties can be modulated using three-dimensional spheroid culture and coculture with DCs spiked with antigen-loaded iron oxide–zinc oxide core-shell nanoparticles. Thereby, the combination of SVF spheroids and mature DCs significantly augments T cell recruitment and retention at the injection site. This strategy elicits enhanced antigen-specific immune response and anti-tumoral immunity in mice, illustrating the potential for a novel immunotherapeutic design using SVF as a structural scaffold for TLS.},

  abstract     = {Metallization has recently garnered significant interest due to its ability to greatly facilitate chemical reactions and dramatically change the properties of materials. Materials displaying metallization under low pressure are highly desired for understanding their potential properties. In this work, the effects of the pressure on the structural and electronic properties of lead-free halide double perovskite (NH 4 ) 2 PtI 6 are investigated systematically. Remarkably, an unprecedented bandgap narrowing down to the Shockley–Queisser limit is observed at a very low pressure of 0.12 GPa, showing great promise in optoelectronic applications. More interestingly, the metallization of (NH 4 ) 2 PtI 6 is initiated at 14.2 GPa, the lowest metallization pressure ever reported in halide perovskites, which is related to the continuous increase in the overlap between the valence and conduction band of I 5p orbital. Its structural evolution upon compression before the metallic transition is also tracked, from cubic Fm- 3 m to tetragonal P 4/ mnc and then to monoclinic C 2/ c phase, which is mainly associated with the rotation and distortions within the [PtI 6 ] 2– octahedra. These findings represent a significant step toward revealing the structure–property relationships of (NH 4 ) 2 PtI 6 , and also prove that high-pressure technique is an efficient tool to design and realize superior optoelectronic materials.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is closely related to a poor prognosis in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), but the mechanisms remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and iron dependency and is associated with the chemoresistance of tumors. Here, it is shown that adipose-derived exosomes reduce ferroptosis susceptibility in CRC, thus promoting chemoresistance to oxaliplatin. It is found that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) expression is increased in the plasma exosomes of CRC patients with a high body fat ratio, serving as an inhibitor of ferroptosis and reducing sensitivity to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the MTTP/proline-rich acidic protein 1 (PRAP1) complex inhibited zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 expression and upregulated glutathione peroxidase 4 and xCT, leading to a decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio and lipid ROS levels. Moreover, experiments are carried out in organoids, and a tumor implantation model is established in obese mice, demonstrating that the inhibition of MTTP increases the sensitivity to chemotherapy. The results reveal a novel intracellular signaling pathway mediated by adipose-derived exosomes and suggest that treatments targeting secreted MTTP might reverse oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.},

  abstract     = {A microdevice that offers glucagon supplements in a safe, non-invasive, and glucose-responsive manner is ideal for avoiding fatal hypoglycemia consequences from insulin overdosage during daily diabetes treatment. However, mold-assisted microfabrication of biomedical materials or devices typically needs high-resolution laser ablation to scale down structural design. In addition, the majority of the polymeric drug delivery materials being used to fabricate devices are dissolvable or deformable in aqueous environments, which restricts washing-based cleaning and purification procedures post shape fixation. This study leverages the design flexibility of 3D printing-assisted mold casting and presents a shrinking microfabrication approach that allows subsequent washing procedures to remove toxic monomer residues during polymerization. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by developing a glucose-responsive transdermal glucagon microneedle patch through matrix volume change-mediated release kinetic control. Shown in the type 1 diabetic mouse model, this transdermal patch can reverse the occurrence of hypoglycemia while lowering the risk of monomer residue-induced irritation during treatment. Freeing from the restrain of molding resolution for microstructure design, this shrinking methodology further provides an insight into post-fabrication purifications of biomedical materials.},

However, the existing materials with persistent ML are completely trap-controlled, and a pre-irradiation is required, which severely hinders the practical applications. In this work, a novel type of ML, self-charging persistent ML, is created by compositing the Sr 3 Al 2 O 5 Cl 2 :Dy 3+ (SAOCD) powders into flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. With no need for any pre-irradiation, the as-fabricated SAOCD/PDMS elastomer could exhibit intense and persistent ML under mechanics stimuli directly, which greatly facilitates its applications in mechanics lighting, displaying, imaging, and visualization. By investigating the matrix effects as well as the thermoluminescence, cathodoluminescence, and triboelectricity properties, the interfacial triboelectrification-induced electron bombardment processes are demonstrated to be responsible for the self-charged energy in  SAOCD under mechanics stimuli. Based on the unique self-charging processes, the SAOCD/PDMS further exhibits mechanics storage and visualized reading activities, which brings novel ideas and approaches to deal with the mechanics-related problems in the fields of mechanical engineering, bioengineering, and artificial intelligence.},

Herein, a LiF-rich SEI and a uniform and dense plating/stripping process of the electrolyte by reducing the electrolyte concentration without changing the solvation structure, thereby avoiding the high cost and poor wetting properties of high-concentration electrolytes are achieved. The ultra-low concentration electrolyte with an unchanged Li + solvation structure can restrain the inhomogeneous diffusion flux of Li + , thereby achieving more uniform lithium deposition and stripping processes while maintaining a LiF-rich SEI. The LiIICu battery with this electrolyte exhibits enhanced cycling stability for 1000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 99% at 1 mA cm –2 and 1 mAh cm –2 . For the LiIILiFePO 4 pouch cell, the capacity retention values at 0.5 and 1 C are 98.6% and 91.4%, respectively.

Here the application of positively charged Pt in an effective Fe-PtNiPO nanoreactor for highly efficient and stable HER is demonstrated. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of internal positively charged Pt and the in situ experiments reveal the quick charge transfer in the nanoreactor. Ni-based materials around Pt are used to tune the electronic structure and promote the water dissociation to form locally enriched H + , while a porous Fe shell can both prevent the loss of active material and allow the efficient material transport. All the beneficial compositions work together to form an effective nanoreactor for HER. As a result, the Fe-PtNiPO nanoreactor shows a low overpotential of 19 mV to achieve 10 mA cm −2 and exhibits a high mass activity of 10.93 A mg Pt −1 (at 100 mV). Most importantly, it only needs an ultra-low overpotential of 193 mV to achieve a high current density of 1000 mA cm −2 with an excellent stability over 300 h, which represents one of the best electrocatalysts for alkaline HER and might be used for large-scale industrial application in the future.},

Herein, castor oil, melevodopa, and iron ions are used as building blocks to construct a novel bio-based supramolecular adhesive (BSA) with outstanding adhesion performances. It is prepared through partial coordination between melevodopa functionalized castor oil and Fe 3+ ions. Noncovalent interactions between adherends and the catechol unit from melevodopa contribute to reinforcing adhesion, and the metal-ligand coordination between catechol and Fe 3+ ions is utilized to strengthen cohesion. By combining strong adhesion and tough cohesion, the prepared BSA achieves an adhesion strength of 14.6 MPa at ambient temperature, a record-high value among reported bio-based adhesives as well as supramolecular adhesives to the best of knowledge. It also outperforms those adhesives at cryogenic temperature, realizing another record-high adhesion strength of 9.5 MPa at −196 °C. In addition, the BSA displays excellent multi-reusability with more than 87% of the original adhesion strength remaining even after reuse for ten times. It is highly anticipated that this line of research will provide a new insight into designing bio-based adhesives with outstanding adhesion performances and excellent multi-reusability.},

The abundant internal voids and robust host structure are capable of achieving high mass loading of Li metal and effectively alleviating the conceivable volume change during cycling, accompanied by the preferential selective plating/stripping of Li inside the graphene-based MRs with the embedded Au nanonuclei. As a result, the obtained PRGO/Au–Li anodes deliver a long-lifespan stable cycling up to 600 h with a high specific capacity of ≈2140 mA h g –1 and voltage hysteresis as low as 20 mV in the absence of dendrites. The assembled full cells exhibit excellent rate capability and cycling stability.

More Li deposits are accommodated within the smaller pores of the Li hosting anode composed of Ni particles with a granular piling structure; this implies the Li movement into the anode is achieved via diffusional Coble creep.

It is demonstrated that well-ordered antiskyrmions form in a square lattice in a confining micrometer-scale square geometry, while the antiskyrmion lattice distorts in triangular, circular, or rotated-square geometry; the distortion depends on the relative configuration between sample edges and the two q -vectors arising from the anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, in good agreement with micromagnetic simulations.

Here, an IgG4 isotype control antibody is labeled with a near-infrared dye and injected into a mouse ear to enable simultaneous visualization of blood and lymphatic vessels, peripheral nerves, and sebaceous glands for up to 3 h using photoacoustic microscopy. For multiple anatomical structure imaging, peripheral nerves and sebaceous glands are imaged inside the injected dye-labeled antibody mass while the lymphatic vessels are visualized outside the mass.

Nevertheless, immunotherapy is almost ineffective against ovarian cancer (OC) due to its cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). Many traditional medications aimed at remodeling TIM are often associated with severe systemic toxicity, require frequent dosing, and show only modest clinical efficacy. In recent years, emerging nanomedicines have demonstrated extraordinary immunotherapeutic effects for OC by reversing the TIM because the physical and biochemical features of nanomedicines can all be harnessed to obtain optimal and expected tissue distribution and cellular uptake. However, nanomedicines are far from being widely explored in the field of OC immunotherapy due to the lack of appreciation for the professional barriers of nanomedicine and pathology, limiting the horizons of biomedical researchers and materials scientists. Herein, a typical cold tumor-OC is adopted as a paradigm to introduce the classification of TIM, the TIM characteristics of OC, and the advantages of nanomedicines for immunotherapy. Subsequently, current nanomedicines are comprehensively summarized through five general strategies to substantially enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by heating the cold OC. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of this expanding field for improved development of clinical applications are also discussed.},

However, the preparation of large defect-free MXene flakes with high yields is challenging. Here, a power-focused delamination (PFD) strategy is demonstrated that can enhance both the delamination efficiency and yield of large Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets through repetitive precipitation and vortex shaking processes. Following this protocol, a colloidal concentration of 20.4 mg mL –1 of the Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene can be achieved after five PFD cycles, and the yield of the basal-plane-defect-free Ti 3 C 2 T x nanosheets reaches 61.2%, which is 6.4-fold higher than that obtained using the sonication–exfoliation method. Both nanometer-thin devices and self-supporting films exhibit excellent electrical conductivities (≈25 000 and 8260 S cm -1 for a 1.8 nm thick monolayer and 11 µm thick film, respectively). Hydrodynamic simulations reveal that the PFD method can efficiently concentrate the shear stress on the surface of the unexfoliated material, leading to the exfoliation of the nanosheets. The PFD-synthesized large MXene nanosheets exhibit superior electrical conductivities and electromagnetic shielding (shielding effectiveness per unit volume: 35 419 dB cm 2 g –1 ). Therefore, the PFD strategy provides an efficient route for the preparation of high-performance single-layer MXene nanosheets with large areas and high yields.},

  abstract     = {Fibrillar collagens promote cell proliferation, migration, and survival in various epithelial cancers and are generally associated with tumor aggressiveness. However, the impact of fibrillar collagens on soft tissue sarcoma behavior remains poorly understood. Unexpectedly, this study finds that fibrillar collagen-related gene expression is associated with favorable patient prognosis in rhabdomyosarcoma. By developing and using collagen matrices with distinct stiffness and in vivo-like microarchitectures, this study uncovers that the activation of DDR1 has pro-apoptotic and of integrin β 1 pro-survival function, specifically in 3D rhabdomyosarcoma cell cultures. It demonstrates that rhabdomyosarcoma cell-intrinsic or extrinsic matrix remodeling promotes cell survival. Mechanistically, the 3D-specific collagen-induced apoptosis results from a dual DDR1-independent and a synergistic DDR1-dependent TRPV4-mediated response to mechanical confinement. Altogether, these results indicate that dense microfibrillar collagen-rich microenvironments are detrimental to rhabdomyosarcoma cells through an apoptotic response orchestrated by the induction of DDR1 signaling and mechanical confinement. This mechanism helps to explain the preference of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to grow in and metastasize to low fibrillar collagen microenvironments such as the lung.},

  abstract     = {Screening high-efficiency 2D conjugated polymers toward visible-light-driven overall water splitting (OWS) is one of the most promising but challenging research directions to realize solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion and storage. “Mystery molecule” heptazine is an intriguing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) building block. By covalently linking with the electron-rich alkynyl and phenyl oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active units, 10 experimentally feasible 2D covalent heptazine-based frameworks (CHFs) are constructed and screened four promising visible-light-driven OWS photocatalysts, which are linked by p-phenyl (CHF-4), p-phenylenediynyl (CHF-7), m-phenylenediynyl (CHF-8), and phenyltriynyl (CHF-9), respectively. Their HER and OER active sites achieve completely spatially separated, where HER active sites focus on heptazine units and OER active sites located on alkynyl or phenyl units. Their lower overpotentials allow them to spontaneously trigger the surface OWS reaction under their own light-induced bias without using any sacrificial agents and cocatalysts. Among them, CHF-7 shows the best photocatalytic performance with an ideal STH energy conversion efficiency estimated at 12.04%, indicating that it is a promising photocatalyst for industrial OWS. This work not only provides an innovative idea for the exploration of novel polymer photocatalysts for OWS but also supplies a direction for the development of heptazine derivatives.},

These hitherto unknown interactions are enabled by the hydrogen bonding induced by the strong Lewis acid Li + , and exist between the electron-deficient hydrogen ( δ + H) present in the solvent molecules and either other solvent molecules or negatively-charged anions. Complementary with the well-established strong but short-ranged Coulombic interactions between cation and solvent molecules, such weaker but longer-ranged hydrogen-bonding casts the formation of an extended liquid structure in electrolytes that is influenced by their components (solvents, additives, salts, and concentration), which in turn dictates the ion transport within bulk electrolytes and across the electrolyte-electrode interfaces. The discovery of this new inter-component force completes the picture of how electrolyte components interact and arrange themselves, sets the foundation to design better electrolytes on the fundamental level, and probes battery performances.},

  abstract     = {Intimal hyperplasia (IH) represents a major challenge following cardiovascular interventions. While mechanisms are poorly understood, the inefficient preventive methods incentivize the search for novel therapies. A vessel-on-a-dish platform is presented, consisting of direct-contact cocultures with human primary endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exposed to both laminar pulsatile and disturbed flow on an orbital shaker. With contractile SMCs sitting below a confluent EC layer, a model that successfully replicates the architecture of a quiescent vessel wall is created. In the novel IH model, ECs are seeded on synthetic SMCs at low density, mimicking reendothelization after vascular injury. Over 3 days of coculture, ECs transition from a network conformation to confluent 2D islands, as promoted by pulsatile flow, resulting in a “defected” EC monolayer. In defected regions, SMCs incorporated plasma fibronectin into fibers, increased proliferation, and formed multilayers, similarly to IH in vivo. These phenomena are inhibited under confluent EC layers, supporting therapeutic approaches that focus on endothelial regeneration rather than inhibiting proliferation, as illustrated in a proof-of-concept experiment with Paclitaxel. Thus, this in vitro system offers a new tool to study EC-SMC communication in IH pathophysiology, while providing an easy-to-use translational disease model platform for low-cost and high-content therapeutic development.},

  abstract     = {High-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) depend heavily on the quality of perovskite films, which is closely related to the lattice distortion, perovskite crystallization, and interfacial defects when being spin-coated and annealed on the substrate surface. Here, a dynamic strategy to modulate the perovskite film formation by using a soft perovskite–substrate interface constructed by employing amphiphilic soft molecules (ASMs) with long alkyl chains and Lewis base groups is proposed. The hydrophobic alkyl chains of ASMs interacted with poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) greatly improve the wettability of PTAA to facilitate the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals, while the Lewis base groups bound to perovskite lattices significantly passivate the defects in situ. More importantly, this soft perovskite–substrate interface with ASMs between PTAA and perovskite film can dynamically match the lattice distortion with reduced interfacial residual strain upon perovskite crystallization and thermal annealing owing to the soft self-adaptive long-chains, leading to high-quality perovskite films. Thus, the inverted PSCs show a power conversion efficiency approaching 20% with good reproducibility and negligible hysteresis. More impressively, the unencapsulated device exhibits state-of-the-art photostability, retaining 84% of its initial efficiency under continuous simulated 1-sun illumination for more than 6200 h at elevated temperature (≈65 °C).},

Measuring localized subcellular temperature gradients is fundamental for a deeper understanding of cell function, such as the genesis of action potentials, and cell metabolism. Notwithstanding several proposed techniques, at the moment detection of temperature fluctuations at the subcellular level still represents an ongoing challenge. Here, for the first time, temperature variations (1 °C) associated with potentiation and inhibition of neuronal firing is detected, by exploiting a nanoscale thermometer based on optically detected magnetic resonance in nanodiamonds. The results demonstrate that nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds provide a tool for assessing various levels of neuronal spiking activity, since they are suitable for monitoring different temperature variations, respectively, associated with the spontaneous firing of hippocampal neurons, the disinhibition of GABAergic transmission and the silencing of the network. Conjugated with the high sensitivity of this technique (in perspective sensitive to &lt; 0.1 °C variations), nanodiamonds pave the way to a systematic study of the generation of localized temperature gradients under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, they prompt further studies explaining in detail the physiological mechanism originating this effect.},

  abstract     = {Chemotherapeutics remain the first choice for advanced gastric cancers (GCs). However, drug resistance and unavoidable severe toxicity lead to chemotherapy failure and poor prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in tumor progression in many cancers, including GC. Here, through RNA screening, an apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1)-binding lncRNA (ABL) that is significantly elevated in cancerous GC tissues and an independent prognostic factor for GC patients is identified. Moreover, ABL overexpression inhibits GC cell apoptosis and promotes GC cell survival and multidrug resistance in GC xenograft and organoid models. Mechanistically, ABL directly binds to the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 via its KH1/2 domain, and then IGF2BP1 further recognizes the METTL3-mediated m6A modification on ABL, which maintains ABL stability. In addition, ABL can bind to the WD1/WD2 domain of APAF1, which competitively prevent cytochrome c from interacting with APAF1, blocking apoptosome assembly and caspase-9/3 activation; these events lead to resistance to cell death in GC cells. Intriguingly, targeting ABL using encapsulated liposomal siRNA can significantly enhance the sensitivity of GC cells to chemotherapy. Collectively, the results suggest that ABL can be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in GC.},

  abstract     = {Androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7), one of the major driving factors, is the most attractive drug target in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently, no available drugs efficiently target AR-V7 in clinical practice. The DNA binding domain (DBD) is indispensable for the transcriptional activity of AR full length and AR splice variants, including AR-V7. Based on the homodimerization structure of the AR DBD, a novel peptide-based proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) drug is designed to induce AR and AR-V7 degradation in a DBD and MDM2-dependent manner, without showing any activity on other hormone receptors. To overcome the short half-life and poor cell penetrability of peptide PROTAC drugs, an ultrasmall gold (Au)-peptide complex platform to deliver the AR DBD PROTAC in vivo is developed. The obtained Au-AR pep-PROTAC effectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in prostate cancer cell lines, particularly in CWR22Rv1 cells with DC 50 values 48.8 and 79.2 nM, respectively. Au-AR pep-PROTAC results in suppression of AR levels and induces tumor regression in both enzalutamide sensitive and resistant prostate cancer animal models. Further optimization of the Au-AR pep-PROTAC can ultimately lead to a new therapy for AR-V7-positive CRPC.},

The optimal composition (Li 5.5 PS 4.5 Cl 0.89 Br 0.61 ) is fine-tuned to enhance its practical viability by incorporating oxygen in a stepwise manner.

Relative to the other compositions, the exposure of Li 5.5 PS 4.23 O 0.27 Cl 0.89 Br 0.61 to a humid atmosphere results in the least amount of H 2 S released and a negligible change in structure.

The aim is to establish a non-invasive diagnostic model of MN using differential gut microbiome analysis, and to explore the relationship between the gut microbiome and MN pathogenesis in vivo. 825 fecal samples from MN patients and healthy participants are collected from multiple medical centers across China. Key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) obtained through 16S rRNA sequencing are used to establish a diagnostic model. A rat model of MN is developed to explore the relationship between the gut microbiome and the pathogenesis of MN. The diversity and richness of the gut microbiome are significantly lower in patients with MN than in healthy individuals. The diagnostic model based on seven OTUs achieves an excellent efficiency of 98.36% in the training group and also achieves high efficiency in cross-regional cohorts. In MN rat model, gut microbiome elimination prevents model establishment, but fecal microbiome transplantation restores the phenotype of protein urine. Gut microbiome analysis can be used as a non-invasive tool for MN diagnosis. The onset of MN depends on the presence of naturally colonized microbiome. Early intervention in the gut microbiome may help reduce urinary protein level in MN.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the immune microenvironment of bones and low selectivity of the drug, patients with bone metastases often respond poorly to immunotherapy. In this study, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)-expressing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are genetically engineered for bone-targeted delivery of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β ) small-molecule inhibitor SB-505124 (SB@HSCs-PD-1). Intriguingly, compared to anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, as “living drugs”, HSCs-PD-1 not only show great targeting ability to the bone marrow, but are also able to reduplicate themselves within the bone marrow niche and continuously express PD-1 molecules. The SB released from HSCs-PD-1 competitively bound to TGF- β receptors on CD4 + T cells and facilitate CD4 + T cell differentiation to helper T (T H )1 and T H 2 cells, thereby reprogramming the local immunosuppressive milieu of the bone marrow. Additionally, HSCs-PD-1 can block programmed death-ligand 1 on tumor and myeloid cells, resulting in reinvigorated anti-tumor immunity of T cells. In conclusion, in the present study, an alternative cell engineering strategy is delineated for immune checkpoint blockade therapy, to target bone metastasis using HSCs as a platform, which shows great promise in the treatment of bone metastases.},

  abstract     = {Frizzled (Fzd) proteins are Wnt receptors and play essential roles in development, homeostasis, and oncogenesis. How Wnt/Fzd signaling is coupled to physiological regulation remains unknown. Cholesterol is reported as a signaling molecule regulating morphogen such as Hedgehog signaling. Despite the elusiveness of the in-depth mechanism, it is well-established that pancreatic cancer specially requires abnormal cholesterol metabolism levels for growth. In this study, it is unexpectedly found that among ten Fzds, Fzd5 has a unique capacity to bind cholesterol specifically through its conserved extracellular linker region. Cholesterol-binding enables Fzd5 palmitoylation, which is indispensable for receptor maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane. In Wnt-addicted pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), cholesterol stimulates tumor growth via Fzd5-mediated Wnt/ β -catenin signaling. A natural oxysterol, 25-hydroxylsterol competes with cholesterol and inhibits Fzd5 maturation and Wnt signaling, thereby alleviating PDAC growth. This cholesterol-receptor interaction and ensuing receptor lipidation uncover a novel mechanism by which Fzd5 acts as a cholesterol sensor and pivotal connection coupling lipid metabolism to morphogen signaling. These findings further suggest that cholesterol-targeting may provide new therapeutic opportunities for treating Wnt-dependent cancers.},

  abstract     = {Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on polymer donor and non-fullerene acceptor achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) more than 19% but their poor absorption below 550 nm restricts the harvesting of high-energy photons. In contrast, wide bandgap all-inorganic perovskites limit the absorption of low-energy photons and cause serious below bandgap loss. Therefore, a 2-terminal (2T) monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell (TSC) incorporating wide bandgap CsPbI 2 Br is demonstrated as front cell absorber and organic PM6:Y6 blend as rear cell absorber, to extend the absorption of OSCs into high-energy photon region. The perovskite sub-cell, featuring a sol–gel prepared ZnO/SnO 2 bilayer electron transporting layer, renders a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). The V OC is further enhanced by employing thermal annealing (TA)-free process in the fabrication of rear sub-cell, demonstrating a record high V OC of 2.116 V. The TA-free Ag/PFN-Br interface in organic sub-cell facilitates charge transport and restrains nonradiative recombination. Consequently, a remarkable PCE of 20.6% is achieved in monolithic 2T-TSCs configuration, which is higher than that of both reported single junction and tandem OSCs, demonstrating that tandem with wide bandgap all-inorganic perovskite is a promising strategy to improve the efficiency of OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Chip-scale, electrically-pumped terahertz (THz) frequency-combs (FCs) rely on nonlinear four-wave-mixing processes, and have a nontrivial phase relationship between the evenly spaced set of emitted modes. Simultaneous monitoring and manipulation of the intermode phase coherence, without any external seeding or active modulation, is a very demanding task for which there has hitherto been no technological solution. Here, a self-mixing intermode-beatnote spectroscopy system is demonstrated, based on THz quantum cascade laser FCs, in which light is back-scattered from the tip of a scanning near-field optical-microscope (SNOM) and the intracavity reinjection monitored. This enables to exploit the sensitivity of FC phase-coherence to optical feedback and, for the first time, manipulate the amplitude, linewidth and frequency of the intermode THz FC beatnote using the feedback itself. Stable phase-locked regimes are used to construct a FC-based hyperspectral, THz s-SNOM nanoscope. This nanoscope provides 160 nm spatial resolution, coherent detection of multiple phase-locked modes, and mapping of the THz optical response of nanoscale materials up to 3.5 THz, with noise-equivalent-power (NEP) ≈400 pW √Hz −1 . This technique can be applied to the entire infrared range, opening up a new approach to hyper-spectral near-field imaging with wide-scale applications in the study of plasmonics and quantum science, inter alia.},

In this review, the resistive switching mechanisms of photonic memristive and memristive-like devices are first elaborated. Then, a systematic investigation of the active materials, which induce a pivotal influence in the overall performance of photonic memristive and memristive-like devices, is highlighted and evaluated in various indicators.

Through density functional theory calculations, it is shown that each of the active centers in the synergistic entity feature a specific potential-determining step in their respective reaction pathway that can be merged to optimize the intermediate steps involving scaling relations on individual active centers. Impressively, the W SAs/WNNC as the air cathode in all-solid-state Zn-air and Al-air batteries demonstrate competitive durability and reversibility, despite the acknowledged low activity of W-based catalyst toward the ORR.},

Using the principles of origami along with computation imaging technique the authors demonstrate a versatile shape-morphing microwave imaging array with reconfigurable field-of-view and scene-adaptive imaging capability. Microwave/millimeter-wave based array imaging systems are expected to be the workhorse for sensory perception of future autonomous intelligent systems. The imaging capability of a planar array-based systems operating in complex scattering conditions have limited field-of-view and lack the ability to adaptively reconfigure resolution. To overcome this, here, deviations from planarity and isometry are allowed, and a shape-morphing computational imaging system is demonstrated. Implemented on a reconfigurable Waterbomb origami surface with 22 active metasurface panels that radiate near-orthogonal modes across 17–27 GHz, capability to image complex 3D objects in full details minimizing the effects of specular reflections in diffraction-limited sparse imaging with scene adaptability, reconfigurable cross-range resolution, and field-of-view is demonstrated. Such electromagnetic origami surfaces, through simultaneous surface shape-morphing ability (potentially with shape-shifting electronic materials) and electromagnetic field programmability, opens up new avenues for intelligent and robust sensing and imaging systems for a wide range of applications.},

  abstract     = {When properly deployed, the immune system can eliminate deadly pathogens, eradicate metastatic cancers, and provide long-lasting protection from diverse diseases. Unfortunately, realizing these remarkable capabilities is inherently risky as disruption to immune homeostasis can elicit dangerous complications or autoimmune disorders. While current research is continuously expanding the arsenal of potent immunotherapeutics, there is a technological gap when it comes to controlling when, where, and how long these drugs act on the body. Here, this study explored the ability of a slow-releasing injectable hydrogel depot to reduce dose-limiting toxicities of immunostimulatory CD40 agonist (CD40a) while maintaining its potent anticancer efficacy. A previously described polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel system is leveraged that exhibits shear-thinning and yield-stress properties that are hypothesized to improve locoregional delivery of CD40a immunotherapy. Using positron emission tomography, it is demonstrated that prolonged hydrogel-based delivery redistributes CD40a exposure to the tumor and the tumor draining lymph node (TdLN), thereby reducing weight loss, hepatotoxicity, and cytokine storm associated with standard treatment. Moreover, CD40a-loaded hydrogels mediate improved local cytokine induction in the TdLN and improve treatment efficacy in the B16F10 melanoma model. PNP hydrogels, therefore, represent a facile, drug-agnostic method to ameliorate immune-related adverse effects and explore locoregional delivery of immunostimulatory drugs.},

Herein, a series of smart internal bio-glues are developed via the integration of o-nitrobenzene modified biopolymers with up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Upon irradiation by near-infrared (NIR) light, the prepared smart bio-glues can undergo a gelation process, which may further induce strong adhesion between tissues under both dry and wet conditions based on multi-interactions. Moreover, those NIR light-responsive bio-glues with deeper tissue penetration ability demonstrate good biocompatibility, excellent hemostatic performance, and the potent ability to accelerate wound healing for both external and internal wounds. This work provides new opportunities for minimally invasive surgery, especially in internal wound healing using smart and robust bio-glues.},

In this work, nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 polycrystalline materials with highly enhanced thermoelectric properties are obtained by alkali metal Na solid solution. Na is chosen as the cation site dopant for n-type polycrystalline Bi 2 Te 3 . Na enters the Bi site, introducing holes in the Bi 2 Te 3 matrix and rendering the electrical conductivity tunable from 300 to 1800 Scm –1 . The solid solution limit of Na in Bi 2 Te 3 exceeds 0.3 wt%. Owing to the effective solid solution, the Fermi level of Bi 2 Te 3 is properly regulated, leading to an improved Seebeck coefficient. In addition, the scattering of both charge carriers and phonons is modulated, which ensured a high-power factor and low lattice thermal conductivity. Benefitting from the synergistic optimization of both electrical and thermal transport properties, a maximum figure of merit ( ZT) of 1.03 is achieved at 303 K when the doping content is 0.25 wt%, which is 70% higher than that of the pristine sample. This work disclosed an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of n-type bismuth telluride-based alloy materials.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia recently has gained increasing attention as a carrier for the efficient and safe usage of hydrogen to further advance the hydrogen economy. However, there is a pressing need to develop new ammonia synthesis techniques to overcome the problem of intense energy consumption associated with the widely used Haber–Bosch process. Chemical looping ammonia synthesis (CLAS) is a promising approach to tackle this problem, but the ideal redox materials to drive these chemical looping processes are yet to be discovered. Here, by mining the well-established MP database, the reaction free energies for CLAS involving 1699 bicationic inorganic redox pairs are screened to comprehensively investigate their potentials as efficient redox materials in four different CLAS schemes. A state-of-the-art machine learning strategy is further deployed to significantly widen the chemical space for discovering the promising redox materials from more than half a million candidates. Most importantly, using the three-step H 2 O-CL as an example, a new metric is introduced to determine bicationic redox pairs that are “cooperatively enhanced” compared to their corresponding monocationic counterparts. It is found that bicationic compounds containing a combination of alkali/alkaline-earth metals and transition metal (TM)/post-TM/metalloid elements are compounds that are particularly promising in this respect.},

However, attaining high transmittance and clarity through a roughened surface remains challenging because of its strong scattering characteristics. Here, a haze-free, antireflective superhydrophobic surface that consists of hierarchically designed nanoparticles is demonstrated. Close-packed, deep-subwavelength-scale colloidal silica nanoparticles and their upper, chain-like fumed silica nanoparticles individually fulfill haze-free broadband antireflection and self-cleaning functions. These double-layered hierarchical surfaces are obtained via a scalable spraying process that permits precise control over the coating morphology to attain the desired optical and wetting properties. They provide a “specular” visible transmittance of &gt;97% when double-side coated and a record-high self-cleaning capability with a near-zero sliding angle. Self-cleaning experiments on photovoltaic devices verify that the developed surfaces can significantly enhance power conversion efficiencies and aid in retaining pristine device performance in a dusty environment.},

More than that, in this work, by employing a trove of first-principles data of TM oxides, the local structures of TM cations are statistically analyzed to extract detailed information about cation site preference, bond length, site structural distortion, and cation magnetization. It is found that cation radius alone poorly describes the local structure of a transition metal oxide, while the statistics of coordination number as well as the TM  O bond length distribution, especially that of the 3d TMs, can provide comprehensive knowledge for understanding the behavior of TM elements. Based on these statistics, the interplay of site distortion due to the Jahn–Teller effect, cation site similarity, and a new set of ionic radii are all obtained to chart the “persona” of transition metal ions in solids.},

However, macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that are present within tumors limit the efficiency of spatiotemporal delivery. To overcome this limitation, glutathion pulse therapy is designed to promote reduction-sensitive Larotaxel (LTX) prodrug NPs to escape the phagocytosis of macrophages and penetrate through the stromal barrier established by CAFs in the murine triple negative breast cancer model. This therapy improves the penetration of NPs in tumor tissues as well as the accumulation of LTX in cancer cells, and remodels the immunosuppressive microenvironment to synergize PD-1 blockade therapy. More importantly, a method is established that can directly observe the biodistribution of NPs between different cells in vivo to accurately quantify the target drugs accumulated in these cells, thereby advancing the spatiotemporal delivery research of NPs at the “cellular level.”},

Metallic surface states, hinge states, or corner states cover the large bulk energy gap (e.g., more than 1 eV in TlGaTe 2 ) at related boundary, which are ready for experimental detection.

  abstract     = {The lack of highly efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) working at high current densities poses a significant challenge for the large-scale implementation of hydrogen production from renewable energy. Herein, amorphous molybdenum tungsten sulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (a-MoWS x /N-RGO) are synthesized by plasma treatment for use as high-performance HER catalysts. By adjusting the plasma treatment duration and chemical composition, an optimal a-MoWS x /N-RGO catalyst is obtained, which exhibits a low overpotential of 348 mV at a current density of 1000 mA cm −2 and almost no decay after 24 h of working at this current density, outperforming commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C) and previously reported heteroatom-doped MoS 2 -based catalysts. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that with a reasonable tungsten doping level, the catalytic active site (2S 2 − ) shows excellent catalytic performance working at high current densities because extra electrons preferentially fill at 2S 2 − . The introduction of tungsten tends to lower the electronic structure energy, resulting in a closer-to-zero positive . Excessive tungsten introduction, however, can lead to structural damage and a worse HER performance under high current densities. The work provides a route towards rationally designing high-performance catalysts for the HER at industrial-level currents using earth-abundant elements.},

These NiO nanosheets are then used as gas sensors to analyze allyl mercaptan (AM) gas, an exhaled biomarker of psychological stress. Additionally, MnO 2 nanosheets are synthesized onto the surfaces of the NiO nanosheets to enhance the gas-sensing performance. The gas-sensing response of the NiO nanosheet sensor is higher than that of the MnO 2 @NiO nanosheet sensor. The response value can reach 56.69, when the NiO nanosheet sensor detects 40 ppm AM gas. Interestingly, a faster response time (115 s) is obtained when the MnO 2 @NiO nanosheet sensor is exposed to 40 ppm of AM gas. Moreover, the selectivity toward AM gas is about 17–37 times greater than those toward confounders. The mechanism of gas sensing and the factors contributing to the enhance gas response of the NiO and MnO 2 @NiO nanosheets are discussed. The products of AM gas oxidized by the gas sensor are identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). AM gas detection is an unprecedented application for semiconductor metal oxides. From a broader perspective, the developed sensors represent a new platform for the identification and monitoring of gases released by humans under psychological stress, which is increasing in modern life.},

Copper halide CsCu 2 I 3 with intrinsic yellow emission emerges as a highly promising candidate for eco-friendly LEDs, but the electroluminescent performance is limited by defect-related nonradiative losses and inefficient charge transport/injection. To solve these issues, a hole-transporting poly(9-vinlycarbazole) (PVK)-incorporated engineering into CsCu 2 I 3 emitter is proposed. PVK with carbazole groups is permeated at the grain boundaries of CsCu 2 I 3 films by interacting with the uncoordinated Cu + , reducing the Cu Cs and Cu I antisite defects to increase the radiative recombination and enhancing the hole mobility to balance the charge transport/injection, resulting in substantially enhanced device performances. Eventually, the yellow LEDs exhibit an 8.5-fold enhancement of external quantum efficiency, and the half-lifetime reaches 14.6 h, representing the most stable yellow LEDs based on perovskite systems reported so far.},

Data generated with these devices enable identification and characterization of individual, spatially distribute human cortical neurons in the absence of any tissue penetration ( n = 229 single units). Putative single-units are effectively clustered, and found to possess features characteristic of pyramidal cells and interneurons, as well as identifiable microcircuit interactions. Human neurons exhibit consistent phase modulation by oscillatory activity and a variety of population coupling responses. The parameters are furthermore established to optimize the yield and quality of single-unit activity from the cortical surface, enhancing the ability to investigate human neural network mechanisms without breaching the tissue interface and increasing the information that can be safely derived from neurophysiological monitoring.},

However, little is known about the mechanism determining the size of LDCVs. Here, it is reported that secretogranin II (SgII), a vesicle matrix protein, contributes to LDCV size regulation through its liquid–liquid phase separation in neuroendocrine cells. First, SgII undergoes pH-dependent polymerization and the polymerized SgII forms phase droplets with Ca 2+ in vitro and in vivo. Further, the Ca 2+ -induced SgII droplets recruit reconstituted bio-lipids, mimicking the LDCVs biogenesis. In addition, SgII knockdown leads to significant decrease of the quantal neurotransmitter release by affecting LDCV size, which is differently rescued by SgII truncations with different degrees of phase separation. In conclusion, it is shown that SgII is a unique intravesicular matrix protein undergoing liquid–liquid phase separation, and present novel insights into how SgII determines LDCV size and the quantal neurotransmitter release.},

In this work, it is demonstrated that the structural stability of layered LiCoO 2 in aqueous electrolyte can be remarkably improved by altering the oxygen stacking from O3 to O2. As compared to the O3-type LiCoO 2 , the O2-type LiCoO 2 exhibits significantly improved cycle performance in neutral aqueous electrolyte. It is found that the structural degradation caused by electrophilic attack of proton can be effectively mitigated in O2-type layered structure. With O2 stacking, CoO 6 octahedra in LiCoO 2 possess stronger Co  O bonds while Co migration from Co layer to Li layer is strongly hampered, resulting in enhanced structural stability against proton attack and prolonged cycle life in aqueous electrolyte. The findings in this work reveal that regulating oxygen stacking sequence is an effective strategy to improve the structural stability of layered materials for ALIBs.},

Although several specific cytokines have been used for hematopoiesis recovery, their effect is limited, and they may increase the risk of tumor recurrence. In this study, osteogenic growth peptide functionalized tetrahedral framework nucleic-acid nanostructures (OGP-tFNAs) are prepared; they combine the positive hematopoiesis stimulating effect of OGP and the drug carrying function of tFNAs. The potential of OGP-tFNAs for hematopoietic stimulation and microenvironment regulation is investigated. It is shown that OGP-tFNAs can protect bone marrow stromal cells from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. OGP-tFNAs pretreatment activates the extracellularly regulated protein kinase signal and downregulates apoptosis-related proteins. OGP-tFNAs also alleviate the chemotherapy-induced inhibition of hematopoiesis-related cytokine expression, which is crucial for hematopoiesis reconstitution. In conclusion, OGP-tFNAs can protect hematopoietic cells and their microenvironment from chemotherapy-induced injuries and myelosuppression, while promoting hematopoiesis regeneration.},

Utilizing the significant variation in activation energy for ion transport in 2D OIHP (from 1.3 eV under dark to 0.4 eV under illumination), the sensor can efficiently perceive and storage optical information in ultraviolet–visible region. Meanwhile, the photo-enhanced field-effect mechanism in the depletion-mode HEMT enables gate-tunable negative and positive photoresponse, where some typical optoelectronic synaptic functions including inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic current as well as paired-pulse facilitation are demonstrated. More importantly, a NVS based on the proposed visual sensor array is constructed for achieving neuromorphic visual preprocessing with an improved color image recognition rate of 100%.},

Nanotheranostics has shown superior application in precise tumor positioning and treatment, bringing potential opportunities for developing novel PTT-based therapies. Here, a nanotheranostic agent is proposed to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) imaging-guided photo-induced triple-therapy for cancer. Thermosensitive liposomes co-loaded with SPIONs/IR780 and Abemaciclib (SIA-TSLs), peptide ACKFRGD, and click group 2-cyano-6-amino-benzothiazole (CABT) are co-modified on the surface of SIA-TSLs to form SIA- α TSLs. ACKFRGD can be hydrolyzed to expose the 1, 2-thiolamino groups in the presence of cathepsin B in tumors, which click cycloaddition with the cyano group on CABT, resulting in the formation of SIA- α TSLs aggregates. The aggregation of SIA- α TSLs in tumors enhances the MRI/NIRFI imaging capability and enables precise PTT. Photo-induced triple-therapy enhances precision cancer therapy. First, PTT ablates specific tumors and induces ICD via localized photothermal. Second, local tumor heating promotes the rupture of SIA- α TSLs, which release Abemaciclib to block the tumor cell cycle and inhibit Tregs proliferation. Third, injecting GM-CSF into tumor tissue leads to recruitment of dendritic cells and initiation of antitumor immunity.

The antifreezing performance and low temperature conductivity are ascribed to hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds between the components and water molecules in the system and can be tuned by changing the monomer ratio and EG contents. The proton hopping migration on the ionic group of the polymer chains and Grotthuss proton transport mechanism are responsible for the high proton conductivity while Grotthuss transport is dominated at the glassy state of the polymer chains.

  abstract     = {Water is one of the most important elements for life on earth. Water&#39;s rapid phase-change ability along with its environmental and biological compatibility also makes it a unique structural material for 3D printing of ice structures reproducibly and accurately. This work introduces the freeform 3D ice printing (3D-ICE) process for high-speed and reproducible fabrication of ice structures with micro-scale resolution. Drop-on-demand deposition of water onto a −35 °C platform rapidly transforms water into ice. The dimension and geometry of the structures are critically controlled by droplet ejection frequency modulation and stage motions. The freeform approach obviates layer-by-layer construction and support structures, even for overhang geometries. Complex and overhang geometries, branched hierarchical structures with smooth transitions, circular cross-sections, smooth surfaces, and micro-scale features (as small as 50 µm) are demonstrated. As a sample application, the ice templates are used as sacrificial geometries to produce resin parts with well-defined internal features. This approach could bring exciting opportunities for microfluidics, biomedical devices, soft electronics, and art.},

However, the main focus thus far has been on the distributed pressure or force sensors. Herein a thermoreceptive e-skin with biological systems like functionality is presented. The soft, distributed, and highly sensitive miniaturized (≈700 µm 2 ) artificial thermoreceptors (ATRs) in the e-skin are developed using an innovative fabrication route that involves dielectrophoretic assembly of oriented vanadium pentoxide nanowires at defined locations and high-resolution electrohydrodynamic printing. Inspired from the skin morphology, the ATRs are embedded in a thermally insulating soft nanosilica/epoxy polymeric layer and yet they exhibit excellent thermal sensitivity (−1.1 ± 0.3% °C −1 ), fast response (≈1s), exceptional stability (negligible hysteresis for &gt;5 h operation), and mechanical durability (up to 10 000 bending and twisting loading cycles). Finally, the developed e-skin is integrated on the fingertip of a robotic hand and a biological system like reflex is demonstrated in response to temperature stimuli via localized learning at the hardware level.},

With the technology holding a great potential in developing next-generation AFM tips, 3DTIPs prove effective in obtaining high-resolution and high-speed AFM images in air and liquid environments, using common AFM modes. In particular, it is shown that the 3DTIPs provide high-resolution imaging due to their extremely low Hamaker constant, high speed scanning rates due to their low quality factor, and high durability due to their soft nature and minimal isotropic tip wear; the three important features for advancing AFM studies. It is also shown that refining the tip end of the 3DTIPs by focused ion beam etching and by carbon nanotube inclusion substantially extends their functionality in high-resolution AFM imaging, reaching angstrom scales. Altogether, the multifunctional capabilities of 3DTIPs can bring next-generation AFM tips to routine and advanced AFM applications, and expand the fields of high speed AFM imaging and biological force measurements.},

Oxygen-rich carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated their high selectivity (≈80%), yet tailoring the composition and structure of carbon nanotubes to further enhance the selectivity and widen working voltage range remains a challenge. Herein, combining formamide condensation coating and mild temperature calcination, a nitrogen and oxygen comodified carbon nanotubes (N,O-CNTs) electrocatalyst is synthesized, which shows excellent selective (&gt;95%) H 2 O 2 selectivity in a wide voltage range (from 0 to 0.65 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode). It is significantly superior to the corresponding selectivity values of CNTs (≈50% in 0–0.65 V vs RHE) and O-CNTs (≈80% in 0.3–0.65 V vs RHE). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the C neighbouring to N is the active site. Introducing O-related species can strengthen the adsorption of intermediates *OOH, while N-doping can weaken the adsorption of in situ generated *O and optimize the *OOH adsorption energy, thus improving the 2-electron pathway. With optimized N,O-CNTs catalysts, a Janus electrode is designed by adjusting the asymmetric wettability to achieve H 2 O 2 productivity of 264.8 mol kg cat –1 h –1 .},

While mining resources of this element have been steadily exploited and are rapidly depleting, water resources constitute an interesting reservoir just out of reach of current technologies. Several techniques are being explored and novel materials engineered. While evaporation is very time-consuming and has large footprints, ion sieves and supramolecular systems can be suitably tailored and even integrated into membrane and electrochemical techniques. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the available solutions to recover lithium from water resources both by passive and electrically enhanced techniques. Accordingly, this work aims to provide in a single document a rational comparison of outstanding strategies to remove lithium from aqueous sources. To this end, practical figures of merit of both main groups of techniques are provided. An absence of a common experimental protocol and the resulting variability of data and experimental methods are identified.

  abstract     = {Peripheral nerve injury-induced spinal microglial proliferation plays a pivotal role in neuropathic pain. So far, key intracellular druggable molecules involved in this process are not identified. The nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT1) is a master regulator of immune cell proliferation. Whether and how NFAT1 modulates spinal microglial proliferation during neuropathic pain remain unknown. Here it is reported that NFAT1 is persistently upregulated in microglia after spinal nerve ligation (SNL), which is regulated by TET2-mediated DNA demethylation. Global or microglia-specific deletion of Nfat1 attenuates SNL-induced pain and decreases excitatory synaptic transmission of lamina II neurons. Furthermore, deletion of Nfat1 decreases microglial proliferation and the expression of multiple microglia-related genes, such as cytokines, transmembrane signaling receptors, and transcription factors. Particularly, SNL increases the binding of NFAT1 with the promoter of Itgam , Tnf , Il-1b , and c-Myc in the spinal cord. Microglia-specific overexpression of c-MYC induces pain hypersensitivity and microglial proliferation. Finally, inhibiting NFAT1 and c-MYC by intrathecal injection of inhibitor or siRNA alleviates SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Collectively, NFAT1 is a hub transcription factor that regulates microglial proliferation via c-MYC and guides the expression of the activated microglia genome. Thus, NFAT1 may be an effective target for treating neuropathic pain.},

These systems are extremely effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in pseudoviral systems and in clinical isolates, perform better than the dimeric or trimeric sACE2, and exhibit greater than 100-fold neutralization efficiency, compared to monomeric sACE2. SunTag or MoonTag fused to a more potent sACE2 (v1) achieves a sub-nanomolar IC 50 , comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies. Pseudoviruses bearing mutations for variants of concern, including delta and omicron, are also neutralized efficiently with multimeric sACE2. Finally, therapeutic treatment of sACE2(v1)-MoonTag provides protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in an in vivo mouse model. Therefore, highly potent multimeric sACE2 may offer a promising treatment approach against SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

The incorporation of such crowding in synthetic cells would be needed to mimic the biochemistry of living cells.

Therefore, a method that generates monodisperse liposomes with minimal oil content and tunable macromolecular crowding using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidics is presented. Lipid stabilized water-in-oil-in-water emulsions that are stable for at least several months and with a high macromolecular crowder concentration that can be controlled with the external osmolality are formed. A crucial feature is that the oil phase can be removed using high flow conditions at any point after production, providing the highly crowded liposomes. Genetically encoded macromolecular crowding sensors show that the high level of macromolecular crowding in the emulsions is fully retained throughout the generation of minimal-oil lipid bilayers. This modular and robust platform will serve the study of biochemistry under physiologically relevant crowding conditions.},

Here, the metagenomes of sputum and fecal samples from 66 patients with COVID-19 at three stages of disease progression are sequenced. Respiratory tract, gut microbiome, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples are analyzed to compare the gut and respiratory tract microbiota of intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU (nICU) patients and determine relationships between respiratory tract microbiome and immune response. In the respiratory tract, significantly fewer Streptococcus , Actinomyces , Atopobium , and Bacteroides are found in ICU than in nICU patients, while Enterococcus and Candida increase. In the gut, significantly fewer Bacteroides are found in ICU patients, while Enterococcus increases. Significant positive correlations exist between relative microbiota abundances in the respiratory tract and gut. Defensin-related pathways in PBMCs are enhanced, and respiratory tract Streptococcus is reduced in patients with COVID-19. A respiratory tract–gut microbiota model identifies respiratory tract Streptococcus and Atopobium as the most prominent biomarkers distinguishing between ICU and nICU patients.

Herein, the transcription factor OVO-like zinc finger 2 (OVOL2) is demonstrated to directly repress the expression of several glycolytic genes, blocking the Warburg effect and breast tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. OVOL2 inhibits glycolysis by recruiting the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). The tumor suppressor p53, a key regulator of cancer metabolism, activates OVOL2 by binding to the oncoprotein mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and inhibiting MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of OVOL2. OVOL2 expression is negatively correlated with glycolytic gene expression and can be a good predictor of prognosis in patients with breast cancer.

  abstract     = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is crucial in the regulation of gastric cancer (GC) progression. This work aims to reveal novel posttranslational modifications and their relevant mechanisms in GC. In 3D matrix culture and animal models, it is found that fibrillin 1 (FBN1) expression is increased in advanced GC and has succinylation modification. The succinylation modification of FBN1 blocks its degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The long-term accumulation and deposition of FBN1 enhance tumor progression by activating TGF- β 1 and intracellular PI3K/Akt pathway. The FBN1 succinylation site monoclonal antibody can effectively intervene the effect of succinylation modification and inhibit GC progression. FBN1 is specifically upregulated in the progression of GC compared with other tumors. In conclusion, FBN1 is widely present in the form of K672-succinylated modifications in GC. Besides, the succinyl group of FBN1 blocks its binding to MMP2, inhibits its degradation by MMP2, and leads to the accumulation of FBN1, which poses a long-term risk to the poor prognosis of GC.},

  abstract     = {The aging of the immune system drives systemic aging and the pathogenesis of age-related diseases. However, a significant knowledge gap remains in understanding immune-driven aging, especially in brain aging, due to the limited current in vitro models of neuroimmune interaction. Here, the authors report the development of a human brain organoid microphysiological analysis platform (MAP) to discover the dynamic process of immune-driven brain aging. The organoid MAP is created by 3D printing that confines organoid growth and facilitates cell and nutrition perfusion, promoting organoid maturation and their committment to forebrain identity. Dynamic rocking flow is incorporated into the platform that allows to perfuse primary monocytes from young (20 to 30-year-old) and aged (&gt;60-year-old) donors and culture human cortical organoids to model neuroimmune interaction. The authors find that the aged monocytes increase infiltration and promote the expression of aging-related markers (e.g., higher expression of p16) within the human cortical organoids, indicating that aged monocytes may drive brain aging. The authors believe that the organoid MAP may provide promising solutions for basic research and translational applications in aging, neural immunological diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.},

  abstract     = {Constructing artificial systems that effectively replace or supplement natural biological machinery within cells is one of the fundamental challenges underpinning bioengineering. At the sub-cellular scale, artificial organelles (AOs) have significant potential as long-acting biomedical implants, mimicking native organelles by conducting intracellularly compartmentalized enzymatic actions. The potency of these AOs can be heightened when judiciously combined with genetic engineering, producing highly tailorable biohybrid cellular systems. Here, the authors present a cost-effective, microliter scale (10 µL) polymersome (PSome) synthesis based on polymerization-induced self-assembly for the in situ encapsulation of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc), as a model luminescent enzyme. These GLuc-loaded PSomes present ideal features of AOs including enhanced enzymatic resistance to thermal, proteolytic, and intracellular stresses. To demonstrate their biomodulation potential, the intracellular luminescence of GLuc-loaded PSomes is coupled to optogenetically engineered cardiomyocytes, allowing modulation of cardiac beating frequency through treatment with coelenterazine (CTZ) as the substrate for GLuc. The long-term intracellular stability of the luminescent AOs allows this cardiostimulatory phenomenon to be reinitiated with fresh CTZ even after 7 days in culture. This synergistic combination of organelle-mimicking synthetic materials with genetic engineering is therefore envisioned as a highly universal strategy for the generation of new biohybrid cellular systems displaying unique triggerable properties.},

Although autophagy is proposed to maintain the stemness phenotype in adult diffuse glioma, the molecular basis of the link between autophagy and stemness is poorly understood, which makes it impossible to effectively screen for the population that will benefit from autophagy-targeted treatment. Here, ATG9B as essential for self-renewal capacity and tumor-propagation potential is identified. Notably, ASCL2 transcriptionally regulates the expression of ATG9B to maintain stemness properties. The ASCL2-ATG9B axis is an independent prognostic biomarker and indicator of autophagic activity. Furthermore, the highly effective blood–brain barrier (BBB)-permeable autophagy inhibitor ROC-325, which can significantly inhibit the progression of ASCL2-ATG9B axis High gliomas as a single agent is investigated. These data demonstrate that a new ASCL2-ATG9B signaling axis is crucial for maintaining the stemness phenotype and tumor progression, revealing a potential autophagy inhibition strategy for adult diffuse gliomas.},

However, the actual efficacy of the present pyroptosis inducers can be weakened by successive biological barriers. Here, a cascaded pH-activated supramolecular nanoprodrug (PDNP) with a stepwise size shrinkage property is developed as a pyroptosis inducer to boost antitumor immune response. PDNPs comprise multiple poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and doxorubicin (DOX) drug–polymer hybrid repeating blocks conjugated by ultra-pH-sensitive benzoic imine (bzi) and hydrazone (hyd) bonds. The PEG units endow its “stealth” property and ensure sufficient tumor accumulation. A sharp switch in particle size and detachment of PEG shielding can be triggered by the acidic extracellular pH to achieve deep intratumor penetration. Following endocytosis, second-stage size switching can be initiated by more acidic endolysosomes, and PDNPs disassociate into ultrasmall cargo to ensure accurate intracellular delivery. The cascaded pH activation of PDNPs can effectively elicit gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis to enhance the immunological response. In combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, PDNPs can amplify tumor suppression and extend the survival of mice, which suggests a powerful immune adjuvant and pave the way for high-efficiency immune checkpoint blockade therapy.},

  abstract     = {With zero excess lithium, anode-free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) can deliver much higher energy density than that of traditional lithium metal batteries. However, AFLMBs are prone to suffer from rapid capacity loss and short life. Monitoring and analyzing the capacity decay of AFLMBs are of great importance for their future applications. It is known that the capacity fade mainly comes from the formation of solid electrolyte interphase species and dead lithium, which leads to irreversible volume expansion. Therefore, monitoring and distinguishing the irreversible volume expansion or reversible volume expansion are the key points to analyze the capacity fade of AFLMBs. Herein, an applicable technique based on optical fiber sensors to characterize and quantize the volume change of AFLMBs is developed. By attaching fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors onto the surface of the multilayered anode-free pouch cells, the strain evolution of the cells is successfully monitored and correlated with their electrochemical properties. It is found that the decline of surface strain fluctuation amplitude caused by the loss of active lithium is the leading indicator of battery failure. The proposed sensing technique has excellent multiplexing capability that can be considered as an elementary unit for capacity fade analysis in next-generation battery management system.},

Herein, a universal spinning-coordinating strategy of constructing continuous metal–nitrogen–carbon (M  N  C, M = Co, Fe, Ni) heterointerface is reported to covalently bond metal nanoparticles with nitrogen-doped porous carbon fibers (denoted as M/M  N@NPCF). Guided by theoretical simulations, the Co/Co  N@NPCF hybrid is synthesized as a proof of concept and used as an efficient sulfur host material. The polarized Co  N  C bridging bonds can induce rapid electron transfer from Co nanoparticles to the NPCF skeleton, promoting the chemical anchoring of LiPSs to improve sulfur utilization. Hence, the as-assembled Li  S battery presents a remarkable capacity of 781 mAh g −1 at 2.0 C and a prominent cycling lifespan with a low decay rate of only 0.032% per cycle. Additionally, a well-designed Co/Co  N@NPCF-S electrode with a high sulfur loading of 7.1 mg cm −2 is further achieved by 3D printing technique, which demonstrates an excellent areal capacity of 6.4 mAh cm −2 at 0.2 C under a lean-electrolyte condition. The acquired insights into strongly coupled continuous heterointerface in this work pave the way for rational designs of host materials in Li  S systems.},

However, the high surface tension of liquid sodium potassium alloy at room temperature makes it inconvenient in practical use. Here, the Na-K as reducing agent treats with hydrazone linkages of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and obtain the carbon-oxygen radical COFs (COR-Tf-DHzDM-COFs). The preparation method solves the problems that the preparation process of the traditional Na-K composite anode is complex and has high cost. The structures of the COR-Tf-DHzDM-COFs are characterized by X-ray diffraction （XRD), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and solid-state NMR measurements. It is the first time that carbon-oxygen radical COFs from bulk COFs are constructed by one-step method and the operation is flexible, convenient, and high rate of quality, which is suitable for big production and widely used. The cycle stability of the composite Na-K anode is improved, which provides a new idea for the design of high-performance liquid metal anode.},

  abstract     = {Materials that coexist magnetic and electric properties on the molecular scale in single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with peculiar quantum behaviors have promise in molecular electronics and spintronics. Nevertheless, such molecular materials are limited in potentials because their magnetic signal cannot be transformed into an electrical signal through magnetoresistance or Hall effects for their high insulativity. The discovery of an entirely new material, ferroelectric SMMs (FE SMMs) is reported. This FE SMM also shows single-molecule magnetic behaviors, toroidal magnetic moments, and room-temperature ferroelectricity. The toroidal moment is formed by a vortex distribution of magnetic dipoles in triangular Dy 3 clusters. The analysis of ac magnetic susceptibility reveals the coexistence of three distinct magnetic relaxation processes at low temperatures. The ferroelectricity is introduced by incorporating polar alcohol molecules in the structure, which is confirmed by the X-ray diffraction and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. Moreover, the dielectric measurements reveal a ferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition around 150 K due to the symmetry change from P c to P na2 1 . The coexistence of toroidal moment and ferroelectricity along with quantum magnetism in the rare-earth single-molecule magnets yields a unique class of multiferroics.},

  abstract     = {Base editing events in eukaryote require a compatible chromatin environment, but there is little research on how chromatin factors contribute to the editing efficiency or window. By engineering BEs (base editors) fused with various pioneer factors, the authors found that SOX2 substantially increased the editing efficiency for GBE and CBE. While SoxN-GBE (SOX2-NH3-GBE) improved the editing efficiency at overall cytosines of the protospacer, SoxM-GBE/CBE (SOX2-Middle-GBE/CBE) enabled the higher base editing at PAM-proximal cytosines. By separating functional domains of SOX2, the SadN-GBE (SOX2 activation domain-NH3-GBE) is constructed for higher editing efficiency and SadM-CBE for broader editing window to date. With the DNase I assay, it is also proved the increased editing efficiency is most likely associated with the induction of chromatin accessibility by SAD. Finally, SadM-CBE is employed to introduce a stop codon in the proto-oncogene MYC , at a locus rarely edited by previous editors with high efficiency. In this work, a new class of pioneer-BEs is constructed by fusion of pioneer factor or its functional domains, which exhibits higher editing efficiency or broader editing window in eukaryote.},

However, the lack of versatile on-DNA arylation methods for phenols that are less nucleophilic and reactive poses a great hurdle for DEL to include diaryl ether, a privileged chemotype in pharmaceuticals and natural products. This work describes the use of “substrate activation” approach to address the arylation of DNA-conjugated phenols. Diaryliodonium salt, a highly electrophilic and reactive arylation reagent, is employed as Ar + sources to ensure highly selective on-DNA arylation of phenols and oximes with both high yields and DNA fidelity. Notably, the new on-DNA arylation reaction can be applied to the late-stage modification of peptides containing tyrosine side-chain and to synthesize DNA-tagged analogues of existing drug molecules such as sorafenib, a known pan-kinase inhibitor. The new on-DNA diaryliodonium salts chemistry affords a greater flexibility in DEL design and synthesis.},

Many applications would profit from reversible and actively controllable shape transformation together with a self-locking capability. Solutions that combine such properties are rare. Here, a novel class of meta-structures that can tackle this challenge is presented thanks to multi-stability. Results demonstrate that the multi-stability of the meta-structure is strictly tied to the use of highly anisotropic materials. The design rules that enable large-shape transformation, programmability, and self-locking are derived, and it is proven that the shapes can be actively controlled and harnessed to realize inchworm-inspired locomotion by strategically actuating the meta-structure. This study provides routes toward novel shape adaptive lightweight structures where a metamaterial-inspired assembly of anisotropic components leads to an unforeseen combination of properties, with potential applications in reconfigurable space structures, building facades, antennas, lenses, and soft robots.},

Here, a luminescent approach to detect hepatic cell fate marker albumin in vitro and living cell labeling with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), which are conjugated with antibody (Ab) and rose bengal hexanoic acid (RBHA) is reported. To guarantee the detection quality and accuracy, an “OFF–ON” strategy is adopted: in the presence of albumin, the luminescence of nanoparticles remains suppressed owing to energy transfer to the quencher. Upon albumin binding to the antibody, the luminescence is recovered under near-infrared light. In various bio-samples, the UC NPs- A b- R BHA (UCAR) nanoprobe can sense albumin with a broad detection range (5–315 ng mL −1 ). When applied to liver ductal organoid culture medium, the UCAR can monitor hepatocyte differentiation in real time by sensing the secreted albumin. Further, UCAR enables live imaging of cellular albumin in cells, organoids, and tissues. In a CCl 4 -induced liver injury model, UCAR detects reduced albumin in liver tissue and serum. Thus, a biocompatible nanoprobe for both quantification and imaging of protein in complex biological environment with superior stability and high sensitivity is provided.},

Hence, this review article introduces varying methods to decouple different input signals for realizing truly multimodal sensors. Early efforts explore different outputs to distinguish the corresponding input signals applied to the sensor in sequence. Next, this study discusses the methods for the suppression of the interference, signal correction, and various decoupling strategies based on different outputs to simultaneously detect multiple inputs. The recent insights into the materials&#39; properties, structure effects, and sensing mechanisms in recognition of different input signals are highlighted. The presence of the various decoupling methods also helps avoid the use of complicated signal processing steps and allows multimodal sensors with high accuracy for applications in bioelectronics, robotics, and human–machine interfaces.

However, patternability of SCTD is a key challenge to effectively switch FETs. Herein, a simple method to selectively pattern degenerately p-type (p + )-doped WSe 2 FETs via electron beam (e-beam) irradiation is reported. The effect of the selective e-beam irradiation is confirmed by the gate-tunable optical responses of seamless lateral p + –p diodes. The OFF state of the devices by inducing trapped charges via selective e-beam irradiation onto a desired channel area in p + -doped WSe 2 , which is in sharp contrast to globally p + -doped WSe 2 FETs, is realized. Selective e-beam irradiation of the PMMA-passivated p + -WSe 2 enables accurate control of the threshold voltage ( V th ) of WSe 2 devices by varying the pattern size and e-beam dose, while preserving the low contact resistance. By utilizing hBN as the gate dielectric, high-performance WSe 2 p-FETs with a saturation current of −280 µA µm −1 and on/off ratio of 10 9 are achieved.

The mechanisms maintaining CSCs quiescence remain largely unknown. Here, it is demonstrated that lower expression of MAN1A1 in glioma stem cell (GSC) resulted in the formation of high-mannose type N- glycan on CD133. Furthermore, the high-mannose type N- glycan of CD133 is necessary for its interaction with DNMT1. Activation of p21 and p27 by the CD133–DNMT1 interaction maintains the slow-cycling state of GSC, and promotes chemotherapy resistance and tumorigenesis of GSCs. Elimination of the CD133–DNMT1 interaction by a cell-penetrating peptide or MAN1A1 overexpression inhibits the tumorigenesis of GSCs and increases the sensitivity of GSCs to temozolomide. Analysis of glioma samples reveals that the levels of high-mannose type N- glycan are correlated with glioma recurrence. Collectively, the high mannose CD133–DNMT1 interaction maintains the slow-cycling state and tumorigenic potential of GSC, providing a potential strategy to eliminate quiescent GSCs.},

This work reports the development of novel programmable anisotropic materials with both magnetic and photothermal stimuli-responsiveness, which are fabricated by anchoring thermosensitive poly( N -isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAm) and magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles on the surface of MoS 2 nanosheets. Further embedding PNIPAm-MoS 2 /Fe 3 O 4 into 3D-printed hydrogel cubes results in stimuli-responsive building blocks, and the magnetic field can precisely control their orientation and near-infrared (NIR) light absorbing property. Particularly, the variation of the orientation of MoS 2 /Fe 3 O 4 block results in obvious changes of their photothermal efficiency and optical property. By exploiting the anisotropy of MoS 2 /Fe 3 O 4 and their NIR light responsiveness, thermally-induced phase transitions in individual 3D printed hydrogel building block can be locally controlled for magnetic field-assisted programming a quick response (QR) code. Alternatively, fluorescent QR code with high contrast and security level can be achieved by photothermal-induced release of fluorescent dyes. These 3D printed magnetically programmed hydrogels hold great potential for application in information storage, intelligent materials, and precise therapy.},

  abstract     = {Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) offer potentially more opportunities in areas of self-powered greenhouses and building-integrated photovoltaic systems. In this work, the effort to use a combination of solution-processable gold nanobipyramids (AuNBPs)-based hole transporting layer and a low/high dielectric constant double layer optical coupling layer (OCL) for improving the performance of ST-OSCs over the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT) is reported. The fabrication and characterization of the ST-OSCs are guided, at design and analyses level, using the theoretical simulation and experimental optimization. The use of a low/high dielectric constant double layer OCL helps enhancing the visible light transparency while reflecting the near-infrared (NIR) photons back into the photoactive layer for light harvesting. NIR absorption enhancement in the ST-OSCs is realized through the AuNBPs-induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The weight ratio of the polymer donor to nonfullerene acceptor in the bulk heterojunction is adjusted to realize the maximum NIR absorption enhancement, enabled by the AuNBPs-induced LSPR, achieving the high-performance ST-OSCs with a high PCE of 13.15% and a high AVT of 25.9%.},

In contrast to previous work exhibiting highly ordered single-network diamond-type photonic crystals, here, it is shown by combining optical microscopy and spectroscopy measurements with 3D focused ion beam (FIB) tomography that the blue scales of P. congestus mirabilis differ from that of an ordered diamond structure. Through the use of FIB tomography on elytral scales filled with platinum (Pt) by electron beam-assisted deposition, it is revealed that the red scales of this weevil possess a periodic diamond structure, while the network morphology of the blue scales exhibit diamond morphology only on the single scattering unit level with disorder on longer length scales. Full wave simulations performed on the reconstructed volumes indicate that this local order is sufficient to open a partial photonic bandgap even at low dielectric constant contrast between chitin and air in the absence of long-range or translational order. The observation of disordered and ordered photonic crystals within a single organism opens up interesting questions on the cellular origin of coloration and studies on bio-inspired replication of angle-independent colors.},

  abstract     = {Daytime radiative cooling (DRC) materials offer a sustainable approach to thermal management by exploiting net positive heat transfer to deep space. While such materials typically have a white or mirror-like appearance to maximize solar reflection, extending the palette of available colors is required to promote their real-world utilization. However, the incorporation of conventional absorption-based colorants inevitably leads to solar heating, which counteracts any radiative cooling effect. In this work, efficient sub-ambient DRC (Day: −4 °C, Night: −11 °C) from a vibrant, structurally colored film prepared from naturally derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), is instead demonstrated. Arising from the underlying photonic nanostructure, the film selectively reflects visible light resulting in intense, fade-resistant coloration, while maintaining a low solar absorption (≈3%). Additionally, a high emission within the mid-infrared atmospheric window (&gt;90%) allows for significant radiative heat loss. By coating such CNC films onto a highly scattering, porous ethylcellulose (EC) base layer, any sunlight that penetrates the CNC layer is backscattered by the EC layer below, achieving broadband solar reflection and vibrant structural color simultaneously. Finally, scalable manufacturing using a commercially relevant roll-to-roll process validates the potential to produce such colored radiative cooling materials at a large scale from a low-cost and sustainable feedstock.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectricity in fluid materials, which allows free rotation of molecules, is an unusual phenomenon raising cutting-edge questions in science. Conventional ferroelectric liquid crystals have been found in phases with low symmetry that permit the presence of spontaneous polarization. Recently, the discovery of ferroelectricity with high symmetry in the nematic phase has attracted considerable attention. However, the physical mechanism and molecular origin of ferroelectricity are poorly understood and a large domain of macroscopically oriented spontaneous polarization is difficult to fabricate in the ferroelectric nematic phase. This study reports new fluid layered ferroelectrics with the C ∞v symmetry in which nearly complete orientation of the spontaneous polarization remains stable under zero electric field without any orientation treatment. These ferroelectrics are obtained by simplifying the molecular structure of a compound with a known ferroelectric nematic phase, although the simplification reduced the dipole moment. The results provide useful insights into the mechanism of ferroelectricity due to dipole–dipole interactions in molecular assemblies. The new ferroelectric materials are promising for a wide range of applications as soft ferroelectrics.},

Liquid metal, in particular eutectic gallium–indium (EGaIn), is promising for creating an artificial muscle since it is intrinsically deformable and capable of generating significant force and shape change through low voltage stimulation. In this work, a muscle-inspired structure for designing liquid metal actuators is presented, where EGaIn droplets are configured with copper pads to linearly contract. By theory and experiments, it is demonstrated that this design enables higher work densities and stress, making it a favorable actuator at smaller length scales. Furthermore, higher frequency (up to 5 Hz) operation is achieved by prestretching an antagonistic pair of actuators, where energy bistability enables fast-switching actuation. Overall, this muscle-inspired architecture shows a unique combination of low voltage operation, higher energy density at smaller scales, structural scalability, and higher frequency actuation.},

Its high water-holding capacity, porosity, mechanical strength, and biocompatibility make it unique. Ordered structures are found in nature and the properties appearing upon aligning polymers fibers inspire everyone to achieve highly aligned BNC (A-BNC) films. This work takes advantage of natural bacteria biosynthesis in a reproducible and straightforward approach. Bacteria confined and statically incubated biosynthesized BNC nanofibers in a single direction without entanglement. The obtained film is highly oriented within the total volume confirmed by polarization-resolved second-harmonic generation signal and Small Angle X-ray Scattering. The biosynthesis approach is improved by reusing the bacterial substrates to obtain A-BNC reproducibly and repeatedly. The suitability of A-BNC as cell carriers is confirmed by adhering to and growing fibroblasts in the substrate. Finally, the thermal conductivity is evaluated by two independent approaches, i.e., using the well-known 3 ω -method and a recently developed contactless thermoreflectance approach, confirming a thermal conductivity of 1.63 W mK −1 in the direction of the aligned fibers versus 0.3 W mK −1 perpendicularly. The fivefold increase in thermal conductivity of BNC in the alignment direction forecasts the potential of BNC-based devices outperforming some other natural polymer and synthetic materials.},

A molecular interfacial model involving the conformations and electrochemical stabilities of the Li + -solvent-anion complex is presented to elucidate the differences in SEI formation between ether-based and carbonate-based electrolytes, then interpreting the reason for the obtained higher rate performances. This innovative concept combines the advantages of different electrolytes into one battery system.

To overcome this challenge, a strategy to continuously express multi-level therapeutic peptide drugs on the surface of immune cells, is established. Here, chimeric T cells stably expressing therapeutic peptides are presented for treatment of severe infectious diseases. Using lentiviral system, T cells are engineered to express multi-level therapeutic peptides with matrix metallopeptidases- (MMP-) and tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme- (TACE-) responsive cleavage sites on the surface. The enzymatic cleavage releases γ-carboxyglutamic acid of protein C (PC-Gla) domain and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP), which activate endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), respectively.

Since then, the β -Zn 4 Sb 3 has manifested its potential as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly TE generator compared with the tellurium-bearing TE materials. Although the β -Zn 4 Sb 3 features an intrinsically low thermal conductivity κ , it suffers from a long-lasting structural instability issue arising from the highly mobile zinc ions. Herein, the dilute Ga dopant gives rise to the aliovalent substitution, lowers the mobile zinc ions, and optimizes the hole carrier concentration n H simultaneously. Meanwhile, the formation of nano-moiré fringes suggests the modulated distribution of point defect that results from soluble Ga in a β -Zn 4 Sb 3 lattice, which elicits an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity κ L = 0.2 W m −1 K −1 in a (Zn 0.992 Ga 0.008 ) 4 Sb 3 alloy. Hence, a fully dense β -Zn 4 Sb 3 incorporated with the dilute Ga doping reveals superior structural stability with a peak zT &gt; 1.4 at 623 K. In this work, the aliovalent dilute doping coupled with phase diagram engineering optimizes the fluxes of moving electrons and charged ions, which stabilizes the single-phase β -Zn 4 Sb 3 while boosting the TE performance at the mid-temperature region.

However, the natural oxidation of MeNPs is an imminent hindrance to their widespread applications despite much research efforts to prevent it. Here, a rational approach for non-oxidized bare MeNPs in air, which requires no additional surface passivation treatment is reported. The direct synthetic route uses the [Gd 2 C] 2+ · 2e − electride as an exceptional electron-donating agent to reduce diverse metal precursors in alcoholic solvents. All synthesized bare Cu, Ag, and Sn nanoparticles are ultra-stable in ambient air, exhibiting no trace of metal oxides even on their outermost atomic layer. This unique resistance to oxidation is ascribed to the accumulation of excess electrons on the surface of bare MeNPs, which originates from the spontaneous transfer of anionic electrons from the electride during the nanoparticle growth process. This approach provides not only a revolutionary scheme to obtain MeNPs with non-passivated and non-oxidized surfaces, but also fundamental knowledge about metal oxidation.},

Despite the significant progress that has undoubtedly been achieved in terms of the design and modification of genetic modulators with desired potency and minimized unwanted immune responses, the efficient and safe in vivo delivery of gene therapies still poses major translational challenges. Various non-viral nanomedicines have been recently explored to circumvent this limitation. In this review, an overview of gene therapies for CNS diseases is provided and describes recent advances in the development of nanomedicines, including their unique characteristics, chemical modifications, bioconjugations, and the specific applications that those nanomedicines are harnessed to deliver gene therapies.},

  abstract     = {Acute lung injury (ALI) is a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality of sepsis. Characterized by uncontrolled inflammation and excessive inflammatory cells infiltration in lung, ALI has been exacerbated by impaired efferocytosis (clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages). Through specific receptor recognition and activation of downstream signaling, efferocytic macrophages promote resolution of inflammation by efficiently engulfing dying cells, avoiding the consequent release of cellular inflammatory contents. Here, inspired by the intrinsic recovery mechanism of efferocytosis, an apoptotic cell membrane (ACM) coated antioxidant nanozyme (AOzyme) is engineered, thus obtaining an inhalable pro-efferocytic nanozyme (AOzyme@ACM). Notably, AOzyme@ACM can efficiently increase apoptotic cell removal by combing enhanced macrophages recognition of “eat me” signals through apoptotic body mimicking and scavenge of intracellular excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), a significant barrier for efferocytosis. AOzyme@ACM can significantly inhibit inflammatory response, promote pro-resolving (M2) phenotype transition of macrophage, and alleviate ALI in endotoxemia mice compared with AOzyme group. By addressing the critical factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis-related ALI through restoring efferocytosis activity, the ACM-based antioxidant nanozyme in this study is envisioned to provide a promising strategy to treat this complex and challenging disease.},

  abstract     = {Power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability are two vital issues for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, there is still a lack of suitable hole transport layers (HTLs) to endow PSCs with both high efficiency and stability. Here, NiO x nanoparticles are promoted as an efficient and 85 °C/85%-stable inorganic HTL for high-performance n-i-p PSCs, with the introduction of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) between perovskite and NiO x as systematic interfacial engineering. The QD intercalation enhances film morphology and assembly regulation of NiO x HTLs . Due to structure–function correlations, hole mobility within NiO x HTL is improved. And the hole extraction from perovskite to NiO x is also facilitated, resulting from reduced trap states and optimized energy level alignments. Hence, the promoted NiO x -based n-i-p PSCs exhibit high PCE (21.59%) and excellent stability (sustaining 85 °C aging in air without encapsulation). Furthermore, encapsulated solar modules with QDs-promoted NiO x HTLs show impressive stability during 85 °C/85% aging test for 1000 hours. With high transparency, QDs-promoted NiO x is also demonstrated to be an advanced HTL for semitransparent PSCs. This work develops promising NiO x inorganic HTL in n-i-p PSCs for manufacturing next-generation photovoltaic devices.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the concept of smart radio environments, currently intensely studied for wireless communication in metasurface-programmable meter-scaled environments (e.g., inside rooms), on the chip scale. Wireless networks-on-chips (WNoCs) are a candidate technology to improve inter-core communication on chips but current proposals are plagued by a dilemma: either the received signal is weak, or it is significantly reverberated such that the on–off-keying modulation speed must be throttled. Here, this vexing problem is overcome by endowing the wireless on-chip environment with in situ programmability which enables the shaping of the channel impulse response (CIR); thereby, a pulse-like CIR shape can be imposed despite strong multipath propagation and without entailing a reduced received signal strength. First, a programmable metasurface suitable for integration in the on-chip environment (“on-chip reconfigurable intelligent surface”) is designed and characterized. Second, its configuration is optimized to equalize selected wireless on-chip channels “over the air.” Third, by conducting a rigorous communication analysis, the feasibility of significantly higher modulation speeds with shaped CIRs is evidenced. The results introduce a programmability paradigm to WNoCs which boosts their competitiveness as complementary on-chip interconnect solution.},

This study reports a newly observed free-standing graphene-water membrane structure, which replaces the conventional solid-state supporting media with liquid film to sustain the graphene integrity and continuity. Experimental observation, theoretical model, and molecular dynamics simulations consistently indicate that the high surface tension of pure water and its large contact angle with graphene are essential factors for forming such a membrane structure. More interestingly, water surface tension ensures the flatness of graphene layers and renders high transfer quality on many types of target substrates. This report enriches the understanding of the interactions on reduced dimensional material while rendering an alternative approach for scalable layered material processing with ensured quality for advanced manufacturing.},

However, the delivery mechanism and the beneficial effect of nanoparticle-retention in many organisms remain largely uncertain. Here, the transport and metabolism of mineral nanoparticles in mammary gland during lactation are explored. It is shown that maternal intravenous administration of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs; diameter: ≈11.0 nm, surface charge: −29.1 mV, surface area: 1.05 m 2 g −1 ) provides elevated iron delivery to mammary gland and increased iron secretion into breast milk, which is inaccessible by classical iron-ion transport approaches such as the transferrin receptor-mediated endocytic pathway. Mammary macrophages and neutrophils are found to play dominant roles in uptake and delivery of IONPs through an unconventional leukocyte-assisted iron secretion pathway. This pathway bypasses the tight iron concentration regulation of liver hepcidin-ferroportin axis and mammary epithelial cells to increase milk iron-ion content derived from IONPs. This work provides keen insight into the metabolic pathway of nanoparticles in mammary gland while offering a new scheme of nutrient delivery for neonate metabolism regulation by using nanosized nutrients.},

In recent years, the use of nanomaterials has proven promising to enhance cancer immunotherapy efficacy and reduce side effects. Among nanomaterials, attention has been recently paid to mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as a potential multiplatform for enhancing cancer immunotherapy by considering their unique properties, such as high porosity, and good biocompatibility, facile surface modification, and self-adjuvanticity.

Small nucleic acid molecules, which can sequence-specifically modulate any gene, offer a unique opportunity to effectively expand drug targets, especially those that are undruggable or difficult to address, such as GPCRs. Here, the authors report  for the first time that small activating RNAs (saRNAs) effectively modulate a GPCR for cancer treatment. Specifically, saRNAs promoting the expression of Mas receptor (MAS1), a GPCR that counteracts the classical angiotensin II pathway in cancer cell proliferation and migration, are identified. These saRNAs, delivered by an amphiphilic dendrimer vector, enhance MAS1 expression, counteracting the angiotensin II/angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 axis, and leading to significant suppression of tumorigenesis and the inhibition of tumor progression of multiple cancers in tumor-xenografted mouse models and patient-derived tumor models. This study provides not only a new strategy for cancer therapy by targeting the renin-angiotensin system, but also a new avenue to modulate GPCR signaling by RNA activation.},

  abstract     = {As one of leading technologies in detecting relativistic particles, Cherenkov radiation plays an essential role in modern high-energy and particle physics. However, the limited photon yield in transparent dielectrics makes efficient Cherenkov radiation only possible with high-energy particles (at least several MeV). This restriction hinders applications of Cherenkov radiation in free-electron light source, bio-imaging, medical therapy, etc. Broadband enhancement of Cherenkov radiation is highly desired for all these applications, but still widely acknowledged as a scientific challenge. To this end, a general approach is reported to enhance the photon yield of Cherenkov radiation using dispersionless plasmons. Broadband dispersionless plasmons can be realized by exploiting either the acoustic nature of terahertz plasmons in a graphene-based heterostructure or the nonlocal property of optical plasmons in a metallodielectric structure. When coupled to moving electrons, such dispersionless plasmons give rise to a radiation enhancement rate more than two orders of magnitude (as compared with conventional Cherenkov radiation) over an ultrabroad frequency band. Moreover, since the phase velocity of dispersionless plasmons can be made as small as the Fermi velocity, giant radiation enhancements can be readily induced by ultralow-energy free electrons (e.g., with a kinetic energy down to 3 eV), without resorting to relativistic particles.},

Xenopus exhibits natural tolerance to Acinetobacter baumanii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, whereas Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce lethal infections. Transcriptional profiling leads to definition of a 20-gene signature that discriminates between tolerant and susceptible states, as well as identification of a more active tolerance response to gram negative compared to gram positive bacteria. Gene pathways associated with active tolerance in Xenopus , including some involved in metal ion binding and hypoxia, are found to be conserved across species, including mammals, and administration of a metal chelator (deferoxamine) or a HIF-1 α agonist (1,4-DPCA) in embryos infected with lethal A. hydrophila increased survival despite high pathogen load.

Here, SH2 domain-containing adapter protein F (SHF) is identified as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and its negative regulation of STAT3 activity is characterized. Mechanically, SHF selectively binds and inhibits acetylated STAT3 dimerization without affecting STAT3 phosphorylation or acetylation. Additionally, by blocking STAT3-DNMT1 (DNA Methyltransferase 1) interaction, SHF relieves methylation of tumor suppressor genes. The SH2 domain is documented to be essential for SHF&#39;s actions on STAT3, and almost entirely replaces the functions of SHF on STAT3 independently. Moreover, the peptide C16 a peptide derived from the STAT3-binding sites of SHF inhibits STAT3 dimerization and STAT3/DNMT1 interaction, and achieves remarkable growth inhibition in GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings strongly identify targeting of the SHF/STAT3 interaction as a promising strategy for developing an optimal STAT3 inhibitor and provide early evidence of the potential clinical efficacy of STAT3 inhibitors such as C16 in GBM.},

While it retains ferrimagnetic ordering with a net magnetic moment of 2 μ B per formula unit at low strain, it undergoes transitions into E-antiferromagnetic and C-antiferromagnetic phases at −5% and +5% strain, respectively. It is shown that spin frustration reduces the critical temperature of the ferrimagnetic ordering from the mean field value of 600–350 K, in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 320 K. It is also shown that the critical temperature can be tuned efficiently through strain and that the spin coherence length surpasses that of Sr 2 FeMoO 6 under tensile strain. An indirect-to-direct bandgap transition is observed at +5% strain. Localization of the valence and conduction states on different transition metal sublattices enables efficient electron–hole separation upon photoexcitation.

Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of the lung tumors reveal that JHU083 increases CD8 + T cell and CD4 + Th1 cell infiltration, while EVax elicits robust Th1 cell-mediated immune responses and protects mice against EGFR L858R mutation-driven lung tumorigenesis. JHU083 treatment decreases immune suppressive cells, including both monocytic- and granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and pro-tumor CD4 + Th17 cells in mouse models. Interestingly, Th1 cells are found to robustly upregulate oxidative metabolism and adopt a highly activated and memory-like phenotype upon glutamine inhibition. These results suggest that JHU083 is highly effective against EGFR-driven lung tumorigenesis and promotes an adaptive T cell-mediated tumor-specific immune response that enhances the efficacy of EVax.},

  abstract     = {Cytoskeleton-mediated force transmission regulates nucleus morphology. How nuclei shaping occurs in fibrous in vivo environments remains poorly understood. Here suspended nanofiber networks of precisely tunable (nm–µm) diameters are used to quantify nucleus plasticity in fibrous environments mimicking the natural extracellular matrix. Contrary to the apical cap over the nucleus in cells on 2-dimensional surfaces, the cytoskeleton of cells on fibers displays a uniform actin network caging the nucleus. The role of contractility-driven caging in sculpting nuclear shapes is investigated as cells spread on aligned single fibers, doublets, and multiple fibers of varying diameters. Cell contractility increases with fiber diameter due to increased focal adhesion clustering and density of actin stress fibers, which correlates with increased mechanosensitive transcription factor Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation to the nucleus. Unexpectedly, large- and small-diameter fiber combinations lead to teardrop-shaped nuclei due to stress fiber anisotropy across the cell. As cells spread on fibers, diameter-dependent nuclear envelope invaginations that run the nucleus&#39;s length are formed at fiber contact sites. The sharpest invaginations enriched with heterochromatin clustering and sites of DNA repair are insufficient to trigger nucleus rupture. Overall, the authors quantitate the previously unknown sculpting and adaptability of nuclei to fibrous environments with pathophysiological implications.},

Recenlty, advanced from well-investigated mechanochromic method, an electromechanical stress approach is used to demonstrate electrically induced mechanical color shifts in soft organic photonic hydrogel beads. To better understand the electrically stretchable color change functionality in such soft organic photonic hydrogel systems, the electromechanical wavelength-tuning mechanism is comprehensively investigated in this study. By employing controllable electroactive dielectric elastomeric actuators, the discoloration wavelength-tuning process of an electrically stretchable photonic organogel is carefully examined. Based on the experimental in-situ response of electrically stretchable nano-spherical polystyrene hydrogel beads, the color change mechanism is meticulously analyzed. Further, changes in the nanostructure of the symmetrically and electrically stretchable organogel are analytically investigated through simulations of its hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice model. Detailed photonic wavelength control factors, such as the refractive index of dielectric materials, lattice diffraction, and bead distance in an organogel lattice, are theoretically studied. Herein, the switcing mechanism of electrically stretchable mechanochromic photonic organogels with photonic stopband-tuning features are suggested for the first time.},

However, developing an advanced membrane that simultaneously possesses high power density, excellent mechanical strength, and convenient large-scale production for practical osmotic energy conversion, remains challenging. Here, the fabrication of ultrathin and ultrastrong Kevlar aramid nanofiber (KANF) membranes with interconnected three-dimensional (3D) nanofluidic channels via a simple blade coating method is reported. The negatively charged 3D nanochannels show typical surface-charge-governed nanofluidic ion transport and exhibit excellent cation selectivity. When applied to osmotic energy conversion, the power density of the KANF membrane-based generator reaches 4.8 W m –2 (seawater/river water) and can be further increased to 13.8 W m –2 at 328 K, which are higher than most of the state-of-the-art membranes. Importantly, a 4-µm-thickness KANF membrane shows ultrahigh tensile strength (565 MPa) and Young&#39;s modulus (25 GPa). This generator also exhibits ultralong stability over 120 days, showing great potential in practical energy conversions.},

By introducing an intuitive tool to simulate arbitrary kinetic models for radiation chemistry, it is demonstrated that these models provide a holistic understanding of reaction mechanisms. This is shown for irradiated HAuCl 4 solutions allowing for quantitative prediction and tailoring of redox processes in liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM). Moreover, it is demonstrated that kinetic modeling of radiation chemistry is applicable to investigations utilizing X-rays such as X-ray diffraction (XRD). This emphasizes that beam-sample interactions must be considered during XRD in liquid media and shows that reaction kinetics do not provide a threshold dose rate for gold nucleation relevant to LP-TEM and XRD. Furthermore, it is unveiled that oxidative etching of gold nanoparticles depends on both, precursor concentration, and dose rate. This dependency is exploited to probe the electron beam-induced shift in Gibbs free energy landscape by analyzing critical radii of gold nanoparticles.},

Commercial noble-metal catalysts are unstable in large-current operation, while most non-noble metal catalysts can only achieve high activity at low current densities &lt;200 mA cm −2 , far lower than industrially-required current densities (&gt;500 mA cm −2 ). Herein, a sulfide-based metallic heterostructure is designed to meet the industrial demand by regulating the electronic structure of phase transition coupling with interfacial defects from Mo and Ni incorporation. The modulation of metallic Mo 2 S 3 and in situ epitaxial growth of bifunctional Ni-based catalyst to construct metallic heterostructure can facilitate the charge transfer for fast Volmer H and Heyrovsky H 2 generation. The Mo 2 S 3 @NiMo 3 S 4 electrolyzer requires an ultralow voltage of 1.672 V at a large current density of 1000 mA cm −2 , with ≈100% retention over 100 h, outperforming the commercial RuO 2 ||Pt/C, owing to the synergistic effect of the phase and interface electronic modulation.

A desirable anesthetic with controllable and sustainable drug-releasing performance for adequate analgesia effect is highly required. In this work, the core/shell-structured two-dimenional (2D) silicene nanosheets coated with mesoporous silica layer (abbreviated as Silicene@MSNs) have been rationally constructed as localized drug-delivery system in sciatic nerve block to achieve on-demand release of loaded ropivacaine (RP) in mesoporous silica layer for local analgesia. Based on the specific photothermal performance of 2D silicene core, this local anesthesia system can be triggered by near-infrared laser to release the loaded RP, resulting in on-demand and long-lasting regional anesthesia. The analgesia effect is assessed by pain behavior tests, which demonstrates that the RP-loaded Silicene@MSNs core/shell nanosystem behaves almost five times longer analgesia effect than free RP. Furthermore, the activation of pain-related neurons in nerve conduction pathways is tested to explore the underlying analgesia mechanism, revealing that the designed nanosystem can improve the pain threshold, reduce the activation of neurons in dorsal root ganglion and excitability in spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons. This designed anesthetic nanomedicine provides a facile but effective methodology for long-lasting regional anesthesia.},

These Janus nanoprecipitates result from local comelting of Bi and Ge during sintering, enabling an amorphous-like lattice thermal conductivity.

  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an emerging technique for treating tumors. Especially, topical administration of photosensitizers (PSs) is more favorable for superficial tumor treatments with low systematic phototoxicity. Yet, ineffective migration of PSs to targeted tumor tissues and rapid consumption of O 2 during PDT greatly limit their effects. Herein, PS-loaded microneedle (MN) patches with O 2 propellant for a deeper and faster transdermal delivery of PS and improved PDT by embedding sodium percarbonate (SPC) into dissolving poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) MNs are presented. It is shown that SPC in the MNs can react with surrounding fluid to generate gaseous oxygen bubbles, forming vigorous fluid flows and thus greatly enhancing PS of chlorin e6 (Ce6) penetration in both hydrogel models and skin tissues. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hypoxic breast cancer cells (4T1 cells) are greatly increased by rapid penetration of PS and relief of hypoxia in vitro, and Ce6-loaded SPC MNs show an excellent cell-killing effect. Moreover, lower tumor growth rate and tumor mass after a 20-d treatment in tumor-bearing mice model verify the improved PDT in gaseous oxygen-droved delivery of PS. This study demonstrates a facile yet effective route of MN delivery of PSs for improved PDT in hypoxic tumor treatment.},

  abstract     = {The kernmantle construction, a kind of braiding structure that is characterized by the kern absorbing most of the stress and the mantle protecting the kern, is widely employed in the field of loading and rescue services, but rarely in flexible electronics. Here, a novel kernmantle electronic braid (E-braid) for high-impact sports monitoring, is proposed. The as-fabricated E-braids not only demonstrate high strength (31 Mpa), customized elasticity, and nice machine washability (&gt;500 washes) but also exhibit excellent electrical stability (&gt;200 000 cycles) during stretching. For demonstration, the E-braids are mounted to different parts of the trampoline for athletes’ locomotor behavior monitoring. Furthermore, the E-braids are proved to act as multifarious intelligent sports gear or wearable equipment such as electronic jump rope and respiration monitoring belt. This study expands the kernmantle structure to soft flexible electronics and then accelerates the development of quantitative analysis in modern sports industry and athletes’ healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial endophthalmitis (BE) is an acute eye infection and potentially irreversible blinding ocular disease. The empirical intravitreous injection of antibiotic is the primary treatment once diagnosed as BE. However, the overuse of antibiotic contributes to the drug resistance of pathogens and the retinal toxicity of antibiotic limits its application in clinic. Herein, a cationic aggregation-induced emission luminogens named with triphenylamine thiophen pyridinium (TTPy) is reported for photodynamic treatment of BE. TTPy can selectively discriminate and kill bacteria efficiently over normal ocular cells. More importantly, TTPy shows excellent antibacterial ability in BE rat models infected by Staphylococcus aureus . Meanwhile, the bacterial killing behavior triggered by TTPy induces innate immune response at an early stage of infection, limiting subsequent robust inflammation and protecting retina from bacterial toxins and inflammation-induced bystander damage. In addition, TTPy performs better antibacterial ability than commercially used Rose Bengal, suggesting its excellent capability of vision salvage in acute BE. This study exhibits an efficient photodynamic antibacterial treatment to BE, which induces an early intraocular immune response and saves useful vision, endowing TTPy a promising potential for clinical application of ocular infections.},

To date, in-memory analog arithmetic operations with emerging nonvolatile devices are usually implemented using discrete components, which limits the scalability and blocks large scale integration. Here, a prototypical implementation of in-memory analog arithmetic operations (summation, subtraction and multiplication) is experimentally demonstrated, based on in-memory electrical current sensing units using spin-orbit torque (SOT) devices. The proposed structures for analog arithmetic operations are smaller than the state-of-the-art complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) counterparts by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, data to be processed and computing results can be locally stored, or the analog computing can be done in the nonvolatile SOT devices, which are exploited to experimentally implement the image edge detection and signal amplitude modulation with a simple structure. Furthermore, an artificial neural network (ANN) with SOT devices based synapses is constructed to realize pattern recognition with high accuracy of ≈95%.},

However, the limitations of current solid electrolytes in oxidation stability and ion transport properties have emerged as fundamental barriers in practical applications. Herein, a novel solid electrolyte is presented by in situ polymerization of salt-concentrated poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) implanted with a three-dimensional porous L 10 GeP 2 S 12 skeleton to mitigate these issues. The poly(PEGDE) endows more oxygen atoms to coordinate with Li + , significantly lowering its highest occupied molecular orbital level. As a consequence, the electro-oxidation resistance of poly(PEGDE) exceeds 4.7 V versus Li + /Li. Simultaneously, the three-dimensonal porous L 10 GeP 2 S 12 skeleton provides a percolated pathway for rapid Li + migration, ensuring a sufficient ionic conductivity of 7.7 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at room temperature. As the bottlenecks are well solved, 4.5 V LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 -based ASLMBs present fantastic cycle performance over 200 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.6% at room temperature.},

An experimental study is presented to determine the CrSBr magnetic exchange Hamiltonian and bulk magnon spectrum. The A -type antiferromagnetic order using single crystal neutron diffraction is confirmed here. The magnon dispersions are also measured using inelastic neutron scattering and rigorously fit the excitation modes to a spin wave model. The magnon spectrum is well described by an intra-plane ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange model with seven nearest in-plane exchanges. This fitted exchange Hamiltonian enables theoretical predictions of CrSBr behavior: as one example, the fitted Hamiltonian is used to predict the presence of chiral magnon edge modes with a spin-orbit enhanced CrSBr heterostructure.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition has become ubiquitous for authentication or security purposes. Meanwhile, there are increasing concerns about the privacy of face images, which are sensitive biometric data and should be protected. Software-based cryptosystems are widely adopted to encrypt face images, but the security level is limited by insufficient digital secret key length or computing power. Hardware-based optical cryptosystems can generate enormously longer secret keys and enable encryption at light speed, but most reported optical methods, such as double random phase encryption, are less compatible with other systems due to system complexity. In this study, a plain yet highly efficient speckle-based optical cryptosystem is proposed and implemented. A scattering ground glass is exploited to generate physical secret keys of 17.2 gigabit length and encrypt face images via seemingly random optical speckles at light speed. Face images can then be decrypted from random speckles by a well-trained decryption neural network, such that face recognition can be realized with up to 98% accuracy. Furthermore, attack analyses are carried out to show the cryptosystem&#39;s security. Due to its high security, fast speed, and low cost, the speckle-based optical cryptosystem is suitable for practical applications and can inspire other high-security cryptosystems.},

  abstract     = {Mesoporous carbon microparticles (MCMPs) with anisotropic shapes and ordered structures are attractive materials that remain challenging to access. In this study, a facile yet versatile route is developed to prepare anisotropic MCMPs by combining neutral interface-guided 3D confined self-assembly (3D-CSA) of block copolymer (BCP) with a self-templated direct carbonization strategy. This route enables pre-engineering BCP into microparticles with oblate shape and hexagonal packing cylindrical mesostructures, followed by selective crosslinking and decorating of their continuous phase with functional species (such as platinum nanoparticles, Pt NPs) via in situ growth. To realize uniform in situ growth, a “guest exchange” strategy is proposed to make room for functional species and a pre-crosslinking strategy is developed to preserve the structural stability of preformed BCP microparticles during infiltration. Finally, Pt NP-loaded MCMPs are derived from the continuous phase of BCP microparticles through selective self-templated direct carbonization without using any external carbon source. This study introduces an effective concept to obtain functional species-loaded and N -doped MCMPs with oblate shape and almost hexagonal structure ( p6mm ), which would find important applications in fuel cells, separation, and heterogeneous catalysis.},

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of seawater environment, efficient anode catalyst, that should be, cost effective, highly active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but negligible for Cl 2 /ClO – formation, and robust toward chlorine corrosion, is urgently demanded for large-scale application. Although catalysis typically appears at surface, while the bulk properties and morphology structure also have a significant impact on the performance, thus requiring a systematic optimization. Herein, a multiscale engineering approach toward the development of cost-effective and robust OER electrocatalyst for operation in seawater is reported. Specifically, the engineering of hollow-sphere structure can facilitate the removal of gas product, while atom-level synergy between Co and Fe can promote Co sites transforming to active phase, and in situ transformation of sulfate ions layer protects catalysts from corrosion. As a result, the as-developed hollow-sphere structured CoFeS x electrocatalyst can stably operate at a high current density of 100 mA cm –2 in the alkaline simulated seawater (pH = 13) for 700 h and in a neutral seawater for 20 h without attenuation.

On one hand, the LCNF provides enough strength (43.7 MPa) at relative low porosity (52.2%) to enable the diffusion limited dendrite suppression, while, on the other hand, the MXene serves as a zinc gating layer, facilitating the zinc ion mobility, restricting the active water/anions from degradation in the electrode/electrolyte interface, and epitaxially guiding zinc deposition along (002) plane. Benefiting from the synergic effect of diffusion limited dendrite suppression and zinc gate, the LM layer enabled a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.9% with a low overpotential of 43.1 mV at 1 mA cm −2 in Zn//Cu asymmetric cells. More importantly, Zn//MnO 2 full cells with the LM layer achieve a high-capacity retention of 90.0% for over 1000 cycles at 1 A g −1 , much higher than the full cell without the protective layer (73.9% over 500 cycles).

Optimizing interfacial defects and absorber layers to a high standard is essential in improving the efficiency of Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 solar cells. In particular, the electron transport layer (ETL) greatly affects the final device performance of the superstrate structure. In this study, a simple and effective hydrazine hydrate (N 2 H 4 ) solution post-treatment is proposed to modify CdS ETL in order to enhance Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 solar cell efficiency. By this process, oxides and residual chlorides, caused by CdCl 2 treated CdS under a high temperature over 400 °C in air, are appropriately removed, rendering smoother and flatter CdS ETL as well as high-quality Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 thin films. Furthermore, the interfacial energy band alignment and recombination loss are both improved, resulting in an as-fabricated FTO/CdS-N 2 H 4 /Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 /spiro-OMeTAD/Au solar cell with a high PCE of 10.30%, placing it in the top tier of Sb-based solar devices.

It is found that the linker units have significant impacts on the backbone planarity, conjugation, and hence optoelectrical properties of polymer acceptors. The vinylene-based PYF-V- o polymer shows a smaller dihedral angle between the end groups and vinylene units and a more rigid polymer backbone, thus affording bathochromic absorption and better electron-transporting capacity. As a result, the PM6:PYF-V- o based all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are able to achieve the highest power conversion efficiency of 16.4% with an unprecedented small voltage loss of 0.49 V. Moreover, the PM6:PYF-V- o blend exhibits good resistance to environmental stressors and the air-processed PM6:PYF-V- o cells can still maintain a high efficiency of 16.1%, which is the best air-processed all-PSC efficiency reported to date.

  abstract     = {Nonvolatile phase-change random access memory (PCRAM) is regarded as one of the promising candidates for emerging mass storage in the era of Big Data. However, relatively high programming energy hurdles the further reduction of power consumption in PCRAM. Utilizing narrow edge-contact of graphene can effectively reduce the active volume of phase change material in each cell, and therefore realize low-power operation. Here, it demonstrates that the power consumption can be reduced to ≈53.7 fJ in a cell with ≈3 nm-wide graphene nanoribbon (GNR) as edge-contact, whose cross-sectional area is only ≈1 nm 2 . It is found that the polarity of the bias pulse determines its cycle endurance in the asymmetric structure. If a positive bias is applied to the graphene electrode, the endurance can be extended at least one order longer than the case with a reversal of polarity. In addition, the introduction of the hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) multilayer leads to a low resistance drift and a high programming speed in a memory cell. The work represents a great technological advance for the low-power PCRAM and can benefit in-memory computing in the future.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) with extremely-high theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg −1 ) are deemed to be the most likely energy storage system to be commercialized. However, the polysulfides shuttling and lithium (Li) metal anode failure in LSBs limit its further commercialization. Herein, a versatile asymmetric separator and a Li-rich lithium–magnesium (Li–Mg) alloy anode are applied in LSBs. The asymmetric separator is consisted of lithiated-sulfonated porous organic polymer (SPOP-Li) and Li 6.75 La 3 Zr 1.75 Nb 0.25 O 12 (LLZNO) layers toward the cathode and anode, respectively. SPOP-Li serves as a polysulfides barrier and Li-ion conductor, while the LLZNO functions as an “ion redistributor”. Combining with a stable Li–Mg alloy anode, the symmetric cell achieves 5300 h of Li stripping/plating and the modified LSBs exhibit a long lifespan with an ultralow fading rate of 0.03% per cycle for over 1000 cycles at 5 C. Impressively, even under a high-sulfur-loading (6.1 mg cm −2 ), an area capacity of 4.34 mAh cm −2 after 100 cycles can still be maintained, demonstrating high potential for practical application.},

  abstract     = {High-rate anode material is the kernel of developing fast-charging lithium ion batteries (LIBs). T–Nb 2 O 5 , well-known for its “room and pillar” structure and bulk pseudocapacitive effect, is expected to enable the fast lithium (de)intercalation. But this property is still limited by the low electronic conductivity or insufficient wiring manner. Herein, a strategy of triple conductive wiring through electron doping, chelation coating, and electrochemical conversion inside the microsized porous spheres consisting of dendrite-like T–Nb 2 O 5 primary particles is proposed to achieve the fast-charging and durable anodes for LIBs. The penetrative implanting of conformal carbon coating (derivative from polydopamine chelate) and NbO domains (induced by excess discharging) reinforces the global supply of electronically conductive wires, apart from those from Co/Mn heteroatom or O vacancy doping. The polydopamine etching on T–Nb 2 O 5 spheres promotes their evolution into fluffy morphology with better electrolyte infiltration. The synergic electron and ion wiring at different scales endow the modified T–Nb 2 O 5 anode with ultralong cycling life (143 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 after 8500 cycles) and high-rate performance (144.1 mAh g −1 at 10.0 A g −1 ). The permeation of multiple electron wires also enables a high mass loading of T–Nb 2 O 5 (4.5 mg cm −2 ) with a high areal capacity of 0.668 mAh cm −2 even after 150 cycles.},

However, their solar cell efficiencies are strongly hampered by anomalously large voltage loss (&gt;0.6 V), whose origin remains controversial so far. Herein, by combining ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the coupled electronic and structural dynamics leading to excited state self-trapping in antimony chalcogenides with atomic level characterizations is reported. The electronic dynamics in Sb 2 Se 3 indicates a ≈20 ps barrierless intrinsic self-trapping, with electron localization and accompanied lattice distortion given by DFT calculations. Furthermore, impulsive vibrational coherences unveil key Sb  Se vibrational modes and their real-time interplay that drive initial excited state relaxation and energy dissipation toward stabilized small polaron through electron–phonon and subsequent phonon–phonon coupling. This study&#39;s findings provide conclusive evidence of carrier self-trapping arising from intrinsic lattice anharmonicity and polaronic effect in antimony chalcogenides and a new understanding on the coupled electronic and structural dynamics for redefining excited state properties in soft semiconductor materials.},

Yttrium-doped barium zirconate BaZr 0.8 Y 0.2 O 3-d (BZY) has attracted a lot of attention as a proton-conducting solid oxide for electrochemical devices due to its high chemical stability and proton conductivity in the desired temperature range. Grain interfaces and topological defects modulate bulk proton conductivity and hydration, especially at low temperatures. Therefore, understanding the nanoscale crystal structure dynamics in situ is crucial to achieving high proton transport, material stability, and extending the operating range of proton-conducting solid oxides. Here, Bragg coherent X-ray diffractive imaging is applied to investigate in situ and in 3D nanoscale dynamics in BZY during hydration over 40 h at 200 °C, in the low-temperature range. An unexpected activity of topological defects and subsequent cracking is found on a nanoscale covered by the macroscale stability. The rearrangements in structure correlate with emergent regions of different lattice constants, suggesting heterogeneous hydration. The results highlight the extent and impact of nanoscale processes in proton-conducting solid oxides, informing future development of low-temperature protonic ceramic electrochemical cells.},

The realization of multisodium storage in the polyanionic electrodes can significantly improve capacity of the materials, but it often causes irreversible capacity loss and crystal phase evolution, especially under high-voltage operation, which remain important challenges for their application. Herein, it is shown that the multisodium storage in the polyanionic cathode can be enhanced and stabilized by increasing the entropy of the polyanionic host structure. The obtained polyanionic Na 3.4 Fe 0.4 Mn 0.4 V 0.4 Cr 0.4 Ti 0.4 (PO 4 ) 3 cathode exhibits multicationic redox property to achieve high capacity with good reversibility under the high voltage of 4.5 V (vs Na/Na + ). Exploring the underlying mechanism through operando characterizations, a stable trigonal phase with reduced volume change during the multisodium storage process is disclosed. Besides, the enhanced performance of the HE material also derives from the synergistic effect of the diverse TM species with suitable molarity.

However, due to the intricacy of C─C coupling and multiple proton–electron transfers, CO 2 -to-ethanol conversion remains a great challenge with low activity and selectivity. Herein, it is reported a P-doped graphene aerogel as a self-supporting electrocatalyst for CO 2 reduction to ethanol. High ethanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48.7% and long stability of 70 h are achieved at −0.8 V RHE . Meanwhile, an outstanding ethanol yield of 14.62 µmol h −1 cm −2 can be obtained, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra indicate the important role of adsorbed *CO intermediates in CO 2 -to-ethanol conversion. Furthermore, the possible active sites and optimal pathway for ethanol formation are revealed by density functional theory calculations. The graphene zigzag edges with P doping enhance the adsorption of *CO intermediate and increase the coverage of *CO on the catalyst surface, which facilitates the *CO dimerization and boosts the EtOH formation. In addition, the hierarchical pore structure of P-doped graphene aerogels exposes abundant active sites and facilitates mass/charge transfer. This work provides inventive insight into designing metal-free catalysts for liquid products from CO 2 electroreduction.},

  abstract     = {Estrogen receptor alpha (ER- α ) action is critical for hormone-dependent breast cancer, and ER- α dysregulation can lead to the emergence of resistance to endocrine therapy. Here, it is found that TRIM4 is downregulated in tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant breast cancer cells, while the loss of TRIM4 is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that TRIM4 increased ER- α expression and the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to TAM. Mechanistically, TRIM4 is found to target SET, and TRIM4-SET interactions are mediated by the RING and B-box domains of TRIM4 and the carboxyl terminus of SET. Moreover, it is determined that TRIM4 catalyzed the K48-linked polyubiquitination of SET (K150 and K172), promoting its proteasomal degradation and disassociation from p53 and PP2A. Once released, p53 and PP2A are able to further promote ESR1 gene transcription and enhance mRNA stability. Moreover, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses confirm that TRIM4 expression is an independent predictor of overall survival and recurrence-free survival outcomes in patients with ER- α positive breast cancer. Taken together, the data highlights a previously undiscovered mechanism and suggest that TRIM4 is a valuable biomarker that can be analyzed to predict response to endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients.},

Moreover, the pseudocapacitive removal mechanism from the synergetic contribution of the Na-FeOOH cathode and Cl-FeOOH anode account for the significant desalination promotion of the Na-FeOOH//Cl-FeOOH cell.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-performance individual marking taggants is of great significance. However, the interaction between taggant and skin is not fully understood, and a standard for marking taggants has yet to be realized. To achieve a highly retentive, anti-interference, and covert individual marking fluorescent taggant, Mn 2+ -doped NaYF 4 :Yb/Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), are surface-functionalized with polyethyleneimine (PEI) to remarkably enhance the interaction between the amino groups and skin, and thus to facilitate the surface adhesion and chemical penetration of the taggant. Electrostatic interaction between PEI 600 -UCNPs and skin as well as remarkable penetration inside the epidermis is responsible for excellent taggant retention capability, even while faced with robust washing, vigorous wiping, and rubbing for more than 100 cycles. Good anti-interference capability and reliable marking performance in real cases are ensured by an intrinsic upconversion characteristic with a distinct red luminescent emission under 980 nm excitation. The present methodology is expected to shed light on the design of high-performance individual marking taggants from the perspective of the underlying interaction between taggant and skin, and to help advance the use of fluorescent taggants for practical application, such as special character tracking.},

  abstract     = {The quest for rejuvenation and prolonged lifespan through transfusion of young blood has been studied for decades with the hope of unlocking the mystery of the key substance(s) that exists in the circulating blood of juvenile organisms. However, a pivotal mediator has yet been identified. Here, atypical findings are presented that are observed in a knockin mouse model carrying a lysine to arginine substitution at residue 74 of Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1/EKLF), the SUMOylation-deficient Klf1 K74R/K74R mouse, that displayed significant improvement in geriatric disorders and lifespan extension. Klf1 K74R/K74R mice exhibit a marked delay in age-related physical performance decline and disease progression as evidenced by physiological and pathological examinations. Furthermore, the KLF1(K74R) knockin affects a subset of lymphoid lineage cells; the abundance of tumor infiltrating effector CD8 + T cells and NKT cells is increased resulting in antitumor immune enhancement in response to tumor cell administration. Significantly, infusion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from Klf1 K74R/K74R mice extends the lifespan of the wild-type mice. The Klf1 K74R/K74R mice appear to be an ideal animal model system for further understanding of the molecular/cellular basis of aging and development of new strategies for antiaging and prevention/treatment of age-related diseases thus extending the healthspan as well as lifespan.},

  abstract     = {Human in vitro models of neural tissue with tunable microenvironment and defined spatial arrangement are needed to facilitate studies of brain development and disease. Towards this end, embedded printing inside granular gels holds great promise as it allows precise patterning of extremely soft tissue constructs. However, granular printing support formulations are restricted to only a handful of materials. Therefore, there has been a need for novel materials that take advantage of versatile biomimicry of bulk hydrogels while providing high-fidelity support for embedded printing akin to granular gels. To address this need, Authors present a modular platform for bioengineering of neuronal networks via direct embedded 3D printing of human stem cells inside Self-Healing Annealable Particle-Extracellular matrix (SHAPE) composites. SHAPE composites consist of soft microgels immersed in viscous extracellular-matrix solution to enable precise and programmable patterning of human stem cells and consequent generation mature subtype-specific neurons that extend projections into the volume of the annealed support. The developed approach further allows multi-ink deposition, live spatial and temporal monitoring of oxygen levels, as well as creation of vascular-like channels. Due to its modularity and versatility, SHAPE biomanufacturing toolbox has potential to be used in applications beyond functional modeling of mechanically sensitive neural constructs.},

Developing compliant devices for this purpose requires the fabrication of photodetectors with ultraviolet (UV)-enhanced broadband photoresponse and high mechanical flexibility, to ensure precise irradiance measurements across the spectral band critical to dermatological health when directly applied onto curved skin surfaces. Here, a fully 3D printed flexible UV-visible photodetector array is reported that incorporates a hybrid organic-inorganic material system and is integrated with a custom-built portable console to continuously monitor broadband irradiance in-situ. The active materials are formulated by doping polymeric photoactive materials with zinc oxide nanoparticles in order to improve the UV photoresponse and trigger a photomultiplication (PM) effect. The ability of a stand-alone skin-interfaced light intensity monitoring system to detect natural irradiance within the wavelength range of 310–650 nm for nearly 24 h is demonstrated.},

Complementing each other, fUS and PAT, respectively, measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and hemoglobin concentrations, allowing synergistic characterization of cerebral hemodynamics. Here, cross-ray ultrasound tomography (CRUST) and its combination with PAT are presented. CRUST employs a virtual point source from a spherically focused ultrasonic transducer (SFUST) to provide widefield excitation at a 4-kHz pulse repetition frequency. A full-ring-shaped ultrasonic transducer array whose imaging plane is orthogonal to the SFUST&#39;s acoustic axis receives scattered ultrasonic waves. Superior to conventional fUS, whose sensitivity to blood flow is angle-dependent and low for perpendicular flow, the crossed transmission and panoramic detection fields of CRUST provide omnidirectional sensitivity to CBF. Using CRUST-PAT, the CBF, oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin concentration changes of the mouse brain during sensory stimulation are measured, with a field of view of ≈7 mm in diameter, spatial resolution of ≈170 µm, and temporal resolution of 200 Hz. The results demonstrate CRUST-PAT as a unique tool for studying cerebral hemodynamics.},

Implementation of green principles whenever possible can spur the growth of benign scientific technologies by considering environmental, economical, and societal sustainability in parallel. These principles seem especially important in the context of the manufacture of materials for sustainable energy and environmental applications. In this review, the production of energy conversion materials is taken as an exemplar, by examining the recent growth in the energy-efficient synthesis of thermoelectric nanomaterials for use in devices for thermal energy harvesting. Specifically, “soft chemistry” techniques such as solution-based, solvothermal, microwave-assisted, and mechanochemical (ball-milling) methods as viable and sustainable alternatives to processes performed at high temperature and/or pressure are focused. How some of these new approaches are also considered to thermoelectric materials fabrication can influence the properties and performance of the nanomaterials so-produced and the prospects of developing such techniques further.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurability of a device that allows tuning of its shape and stiffness is utilized for personal electronics to provide an optimal mechanical interface for an intended purpose. Recent approaches in developing such transformative electronic systems (TES) involved the use of gallium liquid metal, which can change its liquid–solid phase by temperature to facilitate stiffness control of the device. However, the current design cannot withstand excessive heat during outdoor applications, leading to undesired softening of the device when the rigid mode of operation is favored. Here, a gallium-based TES integrated with a flexible and stretchable radiative cooler is presented, which offers zero-power thermal management for reliable rigid mode operation in the hot outdoors. The radiative cooler can both effectively reflect the heat transfer from the sun and emit thermal energy. It, therefore, allows a TES-in-the-air to maintain its temperature below the melting point of gallium (29.8 ℃) under hot weather with strong sun exposure, thus preventing unwanted softening of the device. Comprehensive studies on optical, thermal, and mechanical characteristics of radiative-cooler-integrated TES, along with a proof-of-concept demonstration in the hot outdoors verify the reliability of this design approach, suggesting the possibility of expanding the use of TES in various environments.},

Here, it is demonstrated that the heat generated by the sun can trigger a spin crossover (SCO) in a molecule-base material, resulting in a concomitant color variation (from pink to white) and a phase transition. This leads to a cooling effect with respect to other thermochromic materials. In addition, when the material is cooled, a dampening of the temperature decrease is produced. Therefore, these materials can potentially be implemented for passive temperature control in buildings. Furthermore, SCO materials are remarkably stable upon cycling and highly versatile, which allows for the design of compounds with properties tailored for the desired climatic conditions and comfortable temperature.},

While standard diffuse imaging methods measure optical absorption or fluorescent emission, it is also well-established that the temporal correlation of scattered coherent light diffuses through tissue much like optical intensity. Few works to date, however, have aimed to experimentally measure and process such temporal correlation data to demonstrate deep-tissue video reconstruction of decorrelation dynamics. In this work, a single-photon avalanche diode array camera is utilized to simultaneously monitor the temporal dynamics of speckle fluctuations at the single-photon level from 12 different phantom tissue surface locations delivered via a customized fiber bundle array. Then a deep neural network is applied to convert the acquired single-photon measurements into video of scattering dynamics beneath rapidly decorrelating tissue phantoms. The ability to reconstruct images of transient (0.1–0.4 s) dynamic events occurring up to 8 mm beneath a decorrelating tissue phantom with millimeter-scale resolution is demonstrated, and it is highlighted how the model can flexibly extend to monitor flow speed within buried phantom vessels.},

  abstract     = {Specific localization of photosensitizers (PSs) to a certain organelle could result in targeted attack to cause greater trauma to cancer cells, eventually maximizing photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, currently, efficient and precise transportation of PSs via drug delivery to tumor cells and subcellular organelles is still challenging, due to a so-called step-reduction delivery dilemma (SRDD) which also threatens anticancer drug delivery to exert their efficacy. Herein, a cascade targeting near infrared II (NIR II) fluorescent nanoparticles (NP ER/BO-PDT ) is designed that can target bone tumor first and then target the subcellular organelle of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is found that NP ER/BO-PDT achieves the targeted accumulation of the bone tumor and then ER. NP ER/BO-PDT generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the subcellular organelles of ER under near infrared light irradiation. The continuous ER stress by ROS promotes the release of more damage-associated molecular patterns, induces immunogenic cell death, stimulates the adaptive immune response, and further synergistically inhibits tumor growth, achieving the so-called photodynamic-immunotherapy. Overall, this study exemplifies a safe and efficient nano-drug delivery system for a bone and ER cascade targeting via delivery of PSs to break the SRDD and highlights potential clinical translation.},

It is shown that the phase distribution in the perovskite film is significantly narrowed with controlled, simultaneous evaporation of solvent and antisolvent. Modulation of film formation kinetics of quasi-2D perovskite enables stable deep-blue electroluminescence with a peak emission wavelength of 466 nm and a narrow linewidth of 14 nm. Light emitting diodes using the perovskite film show a maximum luminance of 280 cd m –2 at an external quantum efficiency of 0.1%.

  abstract     = {Electrically assisted water splitting is an endurable strategy for hydrogen production, but the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) extremely restrict the large-scale production of hydrogen. Developing highly efficient and non-precious catalytic materials is essential to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of OER. However, currently used catalyst supports, such as copper foam, suffer from inferior corrosion resistance and structural stability, resulting in the disabled functionality of 3D conductive networks. To this end, a novel 3D freestanding electrode with corrosion-resistant and robust Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy lattice as the catalyst support is designed via a 3D printing technology of selective laser melting. After the coating of core–shell Cu(OH)2@CoNi carbonate hydroxides (CoNiCH) on the designed lattice, a unique micro/nano-sized hierarchical porous structure is formed, which endows the electrocatalyst with a promising electrocatalytic activity (a low overpotential of 355 mV at 30 mA cm −2 and Tafel slope of 125.3 mV dec −1 ). Computational results indicate that the CoNiCH exhibits optimized electron transfer and the catalytic activity of the Ni site is higher than that of the Co site in the CoNiCH. Therefore, the integration of robust catalyst supports and highly active materials opens up an avenue for reliable and high-performance OER electrocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Orbital anisotropy at interfaces in magnetic heterostructures has been key to pioneering spin–orbit-related phenomena. However, modulating the interface&#39;s electronic structure to make it abnormally asymmetric has been challenging because of lack of appropriate methods. Here, the authors report that low-energy proton irradiation achieves a strong level of inversion asymmetry and unusual strain at interfaces in [Co/Pd] superlattices through nondestructive, selective removal of oxygen from Co 3 O 4 /Pd superlattices during irradiation. Structural investigations corroborate that progressive reduction of Co 3 O 4 into Co establishes pseudomorphic growth with sharp interfaces and atypically large tensile stress. The normal component of orbital to spin magnetic moment at the interface is the largest among those observed in layered Co systems, which is associated with giant orbital anisotropy theoretically confirmed, and resulting very large interfacial magnetic anisotropy is observed. All results attribute not only to giant orbital anisotropy but to enhanced interfacial spin–orbit coupling owing to the pseudomorphic nature at the interface. They are strongly supported by the observation of reversal of polarity of temperature-dependent Anomalous Hall signal, a signature of Berry phase. This work suggests that establishing both giant orbital anisotropy and strong spin–orbit coupling at the interface is key to exploring spintronic devices with new functionalities.},

  abstract     = {Silicon (Si)-based negative electrodes have attracted much attention to increase the energy density of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) but suffer from severe volume changes, leading to continuous re-formation of the solid electrolyte interphase and consumption of active lithium. The pre-lithiation approach with the help of positive electrode additives has emerged as a highly appealing strategy to decrease the loss of active lithium in Si-based LIB full-cells and enable their practical implementation. Here, the use of lithium squarate (Li 2 C 4 O 4 ) as low-cost and air-stable pre-lithiation additive for a LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 (NMC622)-based positive electrode is investigated. The effect of additive oxidation on the electrode morphology and cell electrochemical properties is systematically evaluated. An increase in cycle life of NMC622||Si/graphite full-cells is reported, which grows linearly with the initial amount of Li 2 C 4 O 4 , due to the extra Li + ions provided by the additive in the first charge. Post mortem investigations of the cathode electrolyte interphase also reveal significant compositional changes and an increased occurrence of carbonates and oxidized carbon species. This study not only demonstrates the advantages of this pre-lithiation approach but also features potential limitations for its practical application arising from the emerging porosity and gas development during decomposition of the pre-lithiation additive.},

  abstract     = {Stimuli-responsive supercapacitors have attracted broad interest in constructing self-powered smart devices. However, due to the demand for high cyclic stability, supercapacitors usually utilize stable or inert electrode materials, which are difficult to exhibit dynamic or stimuli-responsive behavior. Herein, this issue is addressed by designing a MoS 2 @carbon core-shell structure with ultrathin MoS 2 nanosheets incorporated in the carbon matrix. In the three-electrode system, MoS 2 @carbon delivers a specific capacitance of 1302 F g −1 at a current density of 1.0 A g −1 and shows a 90% capacitance retention after 10 000 charging-discharging cycles. The MoS 2 @carbon-based asymmetric supercapacitor displays an energy density of 75.1 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 900 W kg −1 . Because the photo-generated electrons can efficiently migrate from MoS 2 nanosheets to the carbon matrix, the assembled photo-responsive supercapacitor can answer the stimulation of ultraviolet-visible-near infrared illumination by increasing the capacitance. Particularly, under the stimulation of UV light (365 nm, 0.08 W cm −2 ), the device exhibits a ≈4.50% (≈13.9 F g −1 ) increase in capacitance after each charging-discharging cycle. The study provides a guideline for designing multi-functional supercapacitors that serve as both the energy supplier and the photo-detector.},

  abstract     = {Electrically conductive thin-film materials possessing high transparency are essential components for many optoelectronic devices. The advancement in the transparent conductor applications requires a replacement of indium tin oxide (ITO), one of the key materials in electronics. ITO and other transparent conductive metal oxides have several drawbacks, including poor flexibility, high refractive index and haze, limited chemical stability, and depleted raw material supply. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising alternative for transparent conducting films (TCFs) because of their unique and excellent chemical and physical properties. Here, the latest achievements in the optoelectronic performance of TCFs based on SWCNTs are analyzed. Various approaches to evaluate the performance of transparent electrodes are briefly reviewed. A roadmap for further research and development of the transparent conductors using “rational design,” which breaks the deadlock for obtaining the TCFs with a performance close to the theoretical limit, is also described.},

  abstract     = {The high-frequency and low-voltage operation of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) is a key requirement for the commercial success of flexible electronics. Significant progress has been achieved in this regard by several research groups highlighting the potential of OTFTs to operate at several tens or even above 100 MHz. However, technology maturity, including scalability, integrability, and device reliability, is another crucial point for the semiconductor industry to bring OTFT-based flexible electronics into mass production. These requirements are often not met by high-frequency OTFTs reported in the literature as unconventional processes, such as shadow-mask patterning or alignment with unrealistic tolerances for production, are used. Here, ultra-short channel vertical organic field-effect transistors (VOFETs) with a unity current gain cut-off frequency ( f T ) up to 43.2 MHz (or 4.4 MHz V −1 ) operating below 10 V are shown. Using state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques such as photolithography with reliable fabrication procedures, the integration of such devices down to the size of only 12 × 6 µm2 is shown, which is important for the adaption of this technology in high-density circuits (e.g., display driving). The intrinsic channel transconductance is analyzed and demonstrates that the frequencies up to 430 MHz can be reached if the parasitic electrode overlap is minimized.},

Benefiting from the self-completing and self-limiting characteristics of this interfacial self-assembly, the new kind of supramolecular membrane with optimized composition can be assembled within 3.5 min and exhibits ultrathin, dense, defect-free features, and thus shows an excellent water permeance (21.5 L m –2 h –1 bar –1 ) with a high Na 2 SO 4 rejection above 95%, which outperforms almost all of the non-polyamide membranes and commercially available nanofiltration membranes. This strong-coordination interfacial self-assembly method will open up a new way for the development of functional metal-organic supramolecular films for high-performance membrane separation and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive decline is amongst one of the most commonly reported complaints during normal aging. Despite evidence that age and cognition are linked with similar neural correlates, no previous studies have directly ascertained how these two constructs overlap in the brain in terms of neuroimaging-based prediction. Based on a long lifespan healthy cohort (CamCAN, aged 19–89 years, n = 567), it is shown that both cognitive function (domains spanning executive function, emotion processing, motor function, and memory) and human age can be reliably predicted from unique patterns of functional connectivity, with models generalizable in two external datasets ( n = 533 and n = 453). Results show that cognitive decline and normal aging both manifest decrease within-network connections (especially default mode and ventral attention networks) and increase between-network connections (somatomotor network). Whereas dorsal attention network is an exception, which is highly predictive on cognitive ability but is weakly correlated with aging. Further, the positively weighted connections in predicting fluid intelligence significantly mediate its association with age. Together, these findings offer insights into why normal aging is often associated with cognitive decline in terms of brain network organization, indicating a process of neural dedifferentiation and compensational theory.},

OxPt/SN38 hitchhikes on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, concentrates in tumors via LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis, and selectively releases SN38 and OxPt in acidic, esterase-rich, and reducing tumor microenvironments, leading to 6.0- and 4.9-times higher accumulations in tumors over free drugs. By simultaneously crosslinking DNA and inhibiting topoisomerase I, OxPt/SN38 achieved 92–98% tumor growth inhibition in five colorectal cancer tumor models and prolonged mouse survival by 58–80 days compared to free drug controls in three human colorectal cancer tumor models without causing serious side effects.

It is found that the Dirac mass can be tuned by the geometry of the two sonic crystals. The sign reversal of the Dirac mass reveals a surface topological transition where the surface states exhibit zero refractive index behavior. When the surface states are gapped, 1D hinge states emerge due to the topology of the gapped surface states. The zero refractive index behavior and the emergent topological hinge states are confirmed experimentally. This study reveals a multidimensional Wannier orbital control that leads to extraordinary properties of surface states and unveils an interesting topological mechanism for the control of surface waves.},

The system is tested using five representative physical scenarios.

The adsorption state of surface species is the key factor in modulating the conversion of functional groups, which is correspondingly determined by the uniformity of active sites. However, the non-identical number of metal atoms, geometric shape, and morphology of conventional nanometer-sized metal particles/clusters normally lead to the non-uniform active sites with diverse geometric configurations and local coordination environments, which causes the distinct adsorption states of surface species. Hence, it is highly desired to modulate the homogeneity of the active sites so that the catalytic transformations can be better confined to the desired direction. In this review, the construction strategies and characterization techniques of the uniform active sites that are atomically dispersed on various supports are examined. In particular, their unique behavior in boosting the catalytic performance in various chemical transformations is discussed, including selective hydrogenation, selective oxidation, Suzuki coupling, and other catalytic reactions. In addition, the dynamic evolution of the active sites under reaction conditions and the industrial utilization of the single-atom catalysts are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and frontiers are identified, and the perspectives on this flourishing field is provided.},

Accurately anticipating doxorubicin-resistant patients would therefore permit to spare them this risk while considering alternative treatments without delay. Stratifying patients based on molecular markers in their pretreatment tumors is a promising approach to advance toward this ambitious goal, but single-gene gene markers such as HER2 expression have not shown to be sufficiently predictive. The recent availability of matched doxorubicin-response and diverse molecular profiles across breast cancer patients permits now analysis at a much larger scale. 16 machine learning algorithms and 8 molecular profiles are systematically evaluated on the same cohort of patients. Only 2 of the 128 resulting models are substantially predictive, showing that they can be easily missed by a standard-scale analysis. The best model is classification and regression tree (CART) nonlinearly combining 4 selected miRNA isoforms to predict doxorubicin response (median Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.56 and 0.80, respectively). By contrast, HER2 expression is significantly less predictive (median MCC and AUC of 0.14 and 0.57, respectively). As the predictive accuracy of this CART model increases with larger training sets, its update with future data should result in even better accuracy.},

In this work, new organic terahertz (THz) generators based on a catechol group that acts as a phonon suppressing intermolecular adhesive are developed. The catechol group is widely used in mussel-inspired mechanical adhesive chemistry. Newly designed organic electro-optic crystals consist of catechol-based nonlinear optical 4-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-1-methylpyridinium (DHP) cations and 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonate anions (TFS), which both have multiple interionic interaction capability. Interestingly, compared to benchmark organic crystals for THz generators, DHP-TFS crystals concomitantly achieve top level values of the lowest void volume and the highest crystal density, resulting in an exceptionally small amplitude of solid-state molecular phonons. Simultaneously achieving small molecular phonon amplitude, large optical nonlinearity and good phase matching at infrared optical pump wavelengths, DHP-TFS crystals are capable of generating broadband THz waves of up to 16 THz with high optical-to-THz conversion efficiency; one order of magnitude higher than commercial inorganic THz generators.},

Here, using a red blood cell (RBC) as the carrier vehicle for AAV is demonstrated to improve its tissue-targeted transduction and enable its re-administration. Anchoring AAV to the RBC surface minimally affected its infectability toward endothelial cells. Meanwhile, AAV anchored onto RBCs is predominantly delivered to and shows efficient transduction in the lungs by virtue of the biophysical features of RBCs. RBC-anchored AAVs lead to a four- to five-fold enhancement in target gene expression in the lungsas compared to free AAVs following a single- or dual-dosing regimen. While RBC anchoring does not prevent the induction of adaptive immune responses against AAV, it results in successful transgene expression upon re-administration following prior AAV exposure. The ability to re-administer is partially attributed to the delayed and reduced AAV neutralization by neutralizing antibodies, resulting from the combination of limited exposure of physically confined AAVs and the short time required to reach the lungs. This study&#39;s findings suggest that the RBC-mediated approach is a promising strategy for repetitive, targeted AAV gene therapy.},

  abstract     = {Over the past 15 years, numerous studies have been conducted on the use of nanocarbons as biomaterials towards such applications as drug delivery systems, cancer therapy, and regenerative medicine. However, the clinical use of nanocarbons remains elusive, primarily due to short- and long-term safety concerns. It is essential that the biosafety of each therapeutic modality be demonstrated in logical and well-conducted experiments. Accordingly, the fundamental techniques for assessing nanocarbon biomaterial safety have become more advanced. Optimal controls are being established, nanocarbon dispersal techniques are being refined, the array of biokinetic evaluation methods has increased, and carcinogenicity examinations under strict conditions have been developed. The medical implementation of nanocarbons as a biomaterial is in sight. With a particular focus on carbon nanotubes, these perspectives aim to summarize the contributions to date on nanocarbon applications and biosafety, introduce the recent achievements in evaluation techniques, and clarify the future prospects and systematic introduction of carbon nanomaterials for clinical use through practical yet sophisticated assessment methods.},

Cu–Ag core–shell nanowires are produced through a one-pot synthesis followed by electroless deposition. According to the balance of draining and entraining forces, a fast dip-withdraw process in a volatile solution is developed to tightly wrap Cu–Ag nanonets onto the fibers of thread. The modified threads are not only conductive, but they also retain their original features with enhanced mechanical stability and dry-wash durability. Furthermore, various e-textile devices are fabricated such as a fabric heater, touch screen gloves, a wearable real-time temperature sensor, and warm fabrics against infrared thermal dissipation.

  abstract     = {Shape editability combined with a self-healing capability and long-term cycling durability are highly desirable properties for wearable supercapacitors. Most wearable supercapacitors have rigid architecture and lack the capacity for editability into desirable shapes. Through sandwiching hydrogel electrolytes between two electrodes, a suite of wearable supercapacitors that integrate desirable properties namely: repeated shape editability, excellent self-healing capability, and long-term cycling durability is demonstrated. A strategy is proposed to enhance the long-term cycling durability by utilizing hydrogel electrolytes with unique cross-linking structures. The dynamic crosslinking sites are formed by quadruple H bonds and hydrophobic association, stabilizing the supercapacitors from inorganic ion disruption during charge–discharge processes. The fabricated supercapacitors result in the capacitance retention rates of 99.6% and 95.8% after 5000 and 10 000 charge–discharge cycles, respectively, which are much higher than others reported in the literature. Furthermore, the supercapacitor sheets can be repeatedly processed into various shapes without any capacitance loss. The supercapacitors exhibit a 95% capacitance retention rate after five cutting/self-healing cycles, indicative of their excellent self-healing performance. To demonstrate real-life applicability, the wearable supercapacitors are successfully used to power a light-emitting diode and an electronic watch.},

The Wenzel (W) state, where liquids have intimate contact with the rough surfaces, and the Cassie–Baxter (CB) state, where liquids sit onto air pockets formed between asperities, are only two states among the plethora of wetting behaviors. Furthermore, transitions from the CB to the Wenzel state dictate completely different surface performance, such as anti-contamination, anti-icing, drag reduction etc.; however, little is known about how transition occurs during time between the several wetting modes. In this paper, wetting dynamics can be accurately quantified and tracked using solid–liquid triboelectrification. Theoretical underpinning reveals how surface micro-/nano-geometries regulate stability/infiltration, also demonstrating the generality of the authors’ theoretical approach in understanding wetting transitions.

In this study, a polyethylene glycol acrylate (PEGDA)-alginate double-network nanocomposite hydrogel (GPA) embedded with 125 I-labeled RGDY peptide-modified gold nanorods ( 125 I-GNR-RGDY) is fabricated. The double-network hydrogel is formed by injection of GPA precursor solutions into the cavity of resected cancerous breasts of mice where gelation occurred rapidly. The enhanced temperature-induced PEGDA polymerization driven by near-infrared light irradiation, and then, the second polymer network is crosslinked between alginate and endogenous Ca 2+ around the tumor. The double-network hydrogel possesses a dense polymer network and tightly fixes 125 I-GNR-RGDY, which exhibit superior persistent photothermal and radioactive effects. Hyperthermia induced by photothermal therapy can inhibit self-repair of damaged DNA and promote blood circulation to improve the hypoxic microenvironment, which can synergistically enhance the therapeutic efficacy of brachytherapy and simultaneously eliminate pathogenic bacteria. Notably, this nanocomposite hydrogel facilitates antibacterial activity to prevent potential wound infection and is tracked by single-photon emission computerized tomography imaging owing to isotope labeling of loaded 125 I-GNR-RGDY. The combination of photothermal therapy and brachytherapy has enabled the possibility of proposing a novel postoperative adjuvant strategy for preventing tumor recurrence and wound infection.},

Given the well-established role of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons in encoding motivation and emotional valence, here, neuronal mechanisms mediating sleep/wake regulation are systematically investigated by DA neurotransmission. It is discovered that mDA mediates the strong modulation of sleep/wake states by motivational valence. Surprisingly, this modulation can be uncoupled from the classically employed measures of circadian and homeostatic processes of sleep regulation. These results establish the experimental foundation for an additional new factor of sleep regulation. Furthermore, an electroencephalographic marker during wakefulness at the theta range is identified that can be used to reliably track valence-related modulation of sleep. Taken together, this study identifies mDA signaling as an important neural substrate mediating sleep modulation by motivational valence.},

Cell suspensions in a dedicated sensor are exposed to a temperature gradient, which stimulates synchronized and spontaneous cell-detachment with sharply defined time-patterns, a phenomenon unknown from literature. These patterns depend on metabolic activity (controlled through temperature, nutrients, and drugs) and provide a library of cell-type-specific indicators, allowing to distinguish several yeast strains as well as cancer cells. Under specific conditions, synchronized glycolytic-type oscillations are observed during detachment of mammalian and yeast-cell ensembles, providing additional cell-specific signatures.

It is found that overexpression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a main receptor for bile acids, improves the retention and cardioprotection of adipose tissue-derived MSC (ADSC) administered by intramyocardial injection in mice with myocardial infarction (MI), which shows enhanced antiapoptotic, proangiogenic, and antifibrotic effects. RNA sequencing, LC-MS/MS, and loss-of-function studies reveal that FXR overexpression promotes ADSC paracrine angiogenesis via Angptl4. FXR overexpression improves ADSC survival in vivo but fails in vitro. By performing bile acid-targeted metabolomics using ischemic heart tissue, 19 bile acids are identified. Among them, cholic acid and deoxycholic acid significantly increase Angptl4 secretion from ADSC overexpressing FXR and further improve their proangiogenic capability. Moreover, ADSC overexpressing FXR shows significantly lower apoptosis by upregulating Nqo-1 expression only in the presence of FXR ligands. Retinoid X receptor α is identified as a coactivator of FXR. It is first demonstrated that there is a bile acid pool in the myocardial microenvironment. Targeting the bile acid-FXR axis may be a novel strategy for improving the curative effect of MSC-based therapy for MI.},

However, the current studies on STCM are focused under the synchrony frame, namely, all meta-atoms follow the same variation frequency. Here, an asynchronous STCM is proposed, where the meta-atoms are modulated by different time-coding periods. In the proposed asynchronous STCM, the phase discontinuities on traditional metasurface are replaced with the frequency discontinuities. It is shown that dynamic wavefronts can be automatically realized for both fundamental and high-order harmonics by elaborately arranging the spatial distribution of meta-atoms with various time-coding periods. The physics insight is due to the accumulated rapidly changing phase difference with time, which offers an additional degree of freedom during the wave-matter interactions. As a proof-of-principle example, an asynchronous STCM for automatic spatial scanning and dynamic scattering control is investigated. From the theory, numerical simulations, and experiments, it can be found that the proposed STCM exhibits significant potentials for applications in radars and wireless communications.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures—in which layered materials are purposely selected to assemble with each other—allow unusual properties and different phenomena to be combined and multifunctional electronics to be created, opening a new chapter for the spread of internet-of-things applications. Here, an O 2 -ultrasensitive MoTe 2 material and an O 2 -insensitive SnS 2 material are integrated to form a vdW heterostructure, allowing the realization of charge-polarity control for multioperation-mode transistors through a simple and effective rapid thermal annealing strategy under dry-air and vacuum conditions. The charge-polarity control (i.e., doping and de-doping processes), which arises owing to the interaction between O 2 adsorption/desorption and tellurium defects at the MoTe 2 surface, means that the MoTe 2 /SnS 2 heterostructure transistors can reversibly change between unipolar, ambipolar, and anti-ambipolar transfer characteristics. Based on the dynamic control of the charge-polarity properties, an inverter, output polarity controllable amplifier, p-n diode, and ternary-state logics (NMIN and NMAX gates) are demonstrated, which inspire the development of reversibly multifunctional devices and indicates the potential of 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {Capacity decay of an intercalating Li + -storage material is mainly due to the its particle microcracks from stress-causing volume change. To extend its cycle life, its unit-cell-volume change has to be minimized as much as possible. Here, based on a γ -Li 3 VO 4 model material, the authors explore selective doping as a general strategy to controllably tailor its maximum unit-cell-volume change, then clarify the relationship between its crystal-structure openness and maximum unit-cell-volume change, and finally demonstrate the superiority of “zero-strain” materials within 25–60 °C (especially at 60 °C). With increasing the large-sized Ge 4+ dopant, the unit-cell volume of γ -Li 3+ x Ge x V 1− x O 4 becomes larger and its crystal structure becomes looser, resulting in the decrease of its maximum unit-cell-volume change. In contrast, the doping with small-sized Si 4+ shows a reverse trend. The tailoring reveals that γ -Li 3.09 Ge 0.09 V 0.91 O 4 owns the smallest maximum unit-cell-volume change of 0.016% in the research field of intercalating Li + -storage materials. Consequently, γ -Li 3.09 Ge 0.09 V 0.91 O 4 nanowires exhibit excellent cycling stability at 25/60 °C with 94.8%/111.5% capacity-retention percentages after 1800/1500 cycles at 2 A g −1 . This material further shows large reversible capacities, proper working potentials, and high rate capability at both temperatures, fully demonstrating its great application potential in long-life lithium-ion batteries.},

In this study, the authors investigated the role of RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m6A), an emerging epigenetic mechanism, in improved resilience against chronic restraint stress. A combination of molecular, behavioral, and in vivo recording data demonstrates exercise-mediated restoration of m6A in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex, whose activity is potentiated to exert anxiolytic effects. Furthermore, it is revealed that hepatic biosynthesis of one methyl donor is necessary for exercise to improve brain RNA m6A to counteract environmental stress. This novel liver-brain axis provides an explanation for brain network changes upon exercise training and provides new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders.},

Diverse imaging contrasts enable direct observation of neural activity with functional sensors along with the induced hemodynamic responses. To date, decoupling the complex interplay of neurovascular coupling and dynamical physiological states has remained challenging when employing single-modality functional neuroimaging readings. A hybrid fluorescence optoacoustic tomography platform combined with a custom data processing pipeline based on statistical parametric mapping is devised, attaining the first noninvasive observation of simultaneous calcium and hemodynamic activation patterns using optical contrasts. Correlated changes in the oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and rapid GCaMP6f fluorescence signals are observed in response to peripheral sensory stimulation. While the concurrent epifluorescence serves to corroborate and complement the functional optoacoustic observations, the latter further aids in decoupling the rapid calcium responses from the slowly varying background in the fluorescence recordings mediated by hemodynamic changes. The hybrid imaging platform expands the capabilities of conventional neuroimaging methods to provide more comprehensive functional readings for studying neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling mechanisms and related diseases.},

Microglial activation precedes BBB disruption and cellular infiltrates in the brain of MS patients. However, little is known about the function of microglia in BBB impairment. Here, microglia acts as an important modulator of BBB integrity in inflammatory demyelination. Microglial depletion profoundly ameliorates BBB impairment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Specifically, miR-126a-5p in microglia is positively correlated with BBB integrity in four types of MS plaques. Mechanistically, microglial deletion of miR-126a-5p exacerbates BBB leakage and EAE severity. The protective effect of miR-126a-5p is mimicked and restored by specific inhibition of MMP9 in microglia. Importantly, Auranofin, an FDA-approved drug, is identified to protect BBB integrity and mitigate EAE progression via a microglial miR-126a-5p dependent mechanism. Taken together, microglia can be manipulated to protect BBB integrity and ameliorate inflammatory demyelination. Targeting microglia to regulate BBB permeability merits consideration in therapeutic interventions in MS.},

  abstract     = {Under ER stress conditions, the ER form of transmembrane proteins can reach the plasma membrane via a Golgi-independent unconventional protein secretion (UPS) pathway. However, the targeting mechanisms of membrane proteins for UPS are unknown. Here, this study reports that TMED proteins play a critical role in the ER stress-associated UPS of transmembrane proteins. The gene silencing results reveal that TMED2, TMED3, TMED9 and TMED10 are involved in the UPS of transmembrane proteins, such as CFTR, pendrin and SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Subsequent mechanistic analyses indicate that TMED3 recognizes the ER core-glycosylated protein cargos and that the heteromeric TMED2/3/9/10 complex mediates their UPS. Co-expression of all four TMEDs improves, while each single expression reduces, the UPS and ion transport function of trafficking-deficient ΔF508-CFTR and p.H723R-pendrin, which cause cystic fibrosis and Pendred syndrome, respectively. In contrast, TMED2/3/9/10 silencing reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral release. These results provide evidence for a common role of TMED3 and related TMEDs in the ER stress-associated, Golgi-independent secretion of transmembrane proteins.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic microswimmers that move by a phoretic mechanism in response to a self-induced chemical gradient are often obtained by the design of spherical janus microparticles, which suffer from multi-step fabrication and low yields. Approaches that circumvent laborious multi-step fabrication include the exploitation of the possibility of nonuniform catalytic activity along the surface of irregular particle shapes, local excitation or intrinsic asymmetry. Unfortunately, the effects on the generation of motion remain poorly understood. In this work, single crystalline BiVO 4 microswimmers are presented that rely on a strict inherent asymmetry of charge-carrier distribution under illumination. The origin of the asymmetrical flow pattern is elucidated because of the high spatial resolution of measured flow fields around pinned BiVO 4 colloids. As a result the flow from oxidative to reductive particle sides is confirmed. Distribution of oxidation and reduction reactions suggests a dominant self-electrophoretic motion mechanism with a source quadrupole as the origin of the induced flows. It is shown that the symmetry of the flow fields is broken by self-shadowing of the particles and synthetic surface defects that impact the photocatalytic activity of the microswimmers. The results demonstrate the complexity of symmetry breaking in nonspherical microswimmers and emphasize the role of self-shadowing for photocatalytic microswimmers. The findings are leading the way toward understanding of propulsion mechanisms of phoretic colloids of various shapes.},

  abstract     = {Desmoplasia is characteristic of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which exhibits 5-year survival rates of 3%. Desmoplasia presents physical and biochemical barriers that contribute to treatment resistance, yet depleting the stroma alone is unsuccessful and even detrimental to patient outcomes. This study is the first demonstration of targeted photoactivable multi-inhibitor liposomes (TPMILs) that induce both photodynamic and chemotherapeutic tumor insult, while simultaneously remediating desmoplasia in orthotopic PDAC. TPMILs targeted with cetuximab (anti-EGFR mAb) contain lipidated benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD-PC) photosensitizer and irinotecan. The desmoplastic tumors comprise human PDAC cells and patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts. Upon photoactivation, the TPMILs induce 90% tumor growth inhibition at only 8.1% of the patient equivalent dose of nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI). Without EGFR targeting, PMIL photoactivation is ineffective. TPMIL photoactivation is also sixfold more effective at inhibiting tumor growth than a cocktail of Visudyne-photodynamic therapy (PDT) and nal-IRI, and also doubles survival and extends progression-free survival by greater than fivefold. Second harmonic generation imaging reveals that TPMIL photoactivation reduces collagen density by &gt;90% and increases collagen nonalignment by &gt;10 3 -fold. Collagen nonalignment correlates with a reduction in tumor burden and survival. This single-construct phototoxic, chemotherapeutic, and desmoplasia-remediating regimen offers unprecedented opportunities to substantially extend survival in patients with otherwise dismal prognoses.},

The requirement for the use of nonconventional aluminum alloys such as AlSi10Mg has made the rational micro/nanostructuring of metal AM challenging. Here, the techniques are developed and the fundamental mechanisms governing the micro/nanostructuring of AlSi10Mg, the most common metal AM material, are investigated. A surface structuring technique is rationally devised to form previously unexplored two-tier nanoscale architectures that enable remarkably low adhesion, excellent resilience to condensation flooding, and enhanced liquid–vapor phase transition. Using condensation as a demonstration framework, it is shown that the two-tier nanostructures achieve 6× higher heat transfer coefficient when compared to the best filmwise condensation. The study demonstrates that AM-enabled nanostructuring is optimal for confining droplets while reducing adhesion to facilitate droplet detachment. Extensive benchmarking with past reported data shows that the demonstrated heat transfer enhancement has not been achieved previously under high supersaturation conditions using conventional aluminum, further motivating the need for AM nanostructures. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the synergistic combination of wide AM design freedom and optimal AM nanostructuring method can provide an ultracompact condenser having excellent thermal performance and power density.},

  abstract     = {Potassium-ion batteries (KIB) have similar energy storage mechanism with lithium-ion battery, but the potassium (K) resource is rich, which shows great potential for large-scale energy storage system. Recently, the anode materials of KIB studied mainly include carbon materials, transition metal oxides, and alloy materials. The amorphous hard carbon shows the best comprehensive performance, but its intercalation potential is close to 0 V (versus K + /K), which is easy to cause K dendrite and brings security risks. The oxide materials have high capacity but high intercalation potential, low first cycle efficiency, and unstable cycle. Here, based on the understanding of the K intercalation mechanism of vanadium oxides, a novel zero strain anode material with layered structure of dual-ions (Na + /K + ) is designed (NaK(VO 3 ) 2  V 2 O 5 ). The introduction of Na/K ion contributed to the transmission and further stabilized the structure. It has an excellent rate performance (10 A g −1 , up to 25 000th cycle), and its special K storage mechanism and zero-strain characteristics are revealed for the first time by ex situ scanning electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and other test methods. Considering the excellent performance endowed by these unique inherent properties, NaK(VO 3 ) 2  V 2 O 5 shows great potential for commercial anode materials and may promote the innovation of KIB.},

  abstract     = {A novel “N- π -N” type oligomeric acceptor of 2BTP-2F-T, constructed by two small non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) units linked with a thiophene π bridge is reported. The 2BTP-2F-T not only combines the advantages of small NFA and polymeric acceptors (PYF-T- o ) with similar units but also exhibits superior characteristics of high absorption coefficient and high electron moblity( µ e) ) with less dependence on molecular packing. Using PM6 as the donor, a remarkable efficiency of 18.19% is obtained with an open circuit ( V oc ) of 0.911 V, short current circuit ( J sc ) of 25.50 mA cm −2 , and fill factor (FF) of 78.3%, which is much better than that of the corresponding monomer (16.54%) and PYF-T- o (15.8%) based devices. The much-improved efficiency results from two aspects: 1) an enhanced FF due to the largely improved µ e and well-controlled morphology ; 2) a higher value of ( J sc × V oc ) due to its higher absorption coefficient and efficient charge generation at a similar low energy loss. Furthermore, the PM6/2BTP-2F-T device possesses the longest T 80 lifetime to light-soaking and comparable high thermal stability with PM6/PYF-T- o . The results indicate that the “N- π -N” type oligomeric acceptor has a great application prospect due to its superior high efficiency and improved stability in organic solar cells.},

In particular, CsPbI 2 Br shows the highest potential for developing thermally-stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) among all-inorganic compositions. However, controlling the crystallinity and morphology of all-inorganic compositions is a significant challenge. Here, a simple, thermal gradient- and antisolvent-free method is reported to control the crystallization of CsPbI 2 Br films. Optical in situ characterization is used to investigate the dynamic film formation during spin-coating and annealing to understand and optimize the evolving film properties. This leads to high-quality perovskite films with micrometer-scale grain sizes with a noteworthy performance of 17% (≈16% stabilized), fill factor (FF) of 80.5%, and open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.27 V. Moreover, excellent phase and thermal stability are demonstrated even after extreme thermal stressing at 300 °C.},

Liquid crystals, another excellent candidate for planar optics, are restricted to spin-coupled conjugated phase modulations. Planar optics with spin-decoupled functions is expected to release the multifunctionality of modern optics. Here, a spin-decoupled transflective spatial light modulator is presented with a piecewise-twisted anisotropic monolayer. The phases of reflected and transmitted light can be independently customized by preprogramming the initial orientations of the periodic helix and mirror-symmetric dual-twist configuration, respectively. A transflective orbital angular momentum encoder and decoder is demonstrated, which is simultaneously compatible with different multiplexing techniques. This work releases the multifunctionality of advanced planar optics and may upgrade existing devices in optical informatics.},

In this paper, high transmittance (80.5% on glass) and low work function (2.92 eV) lithium fluoride (LiF x )/MgF x O y electron contact stack by tailoring the composition of MgF x O y hybrid film is reported. This hybrid structure exhibits a high conductivity (2978.4 S cm −1 ) and a low contact resistivity (2.0 mΩ cm 2 ). The element profile of LiF x /MgF x O y contact is measured and the reaction kinetics is analyzed. As a proof-of-concept, this electron selective contact is applied for dopant-free silicon solar cells. An impressive efficiency of 21.3% is achieved on dopant-free monofacial solar cell with molybdenum oxide (MoO x )/zinc-doped indium oxide (IZO) hole contact. An efficiency bifaciality of 71% is obtained for dopant-free bifacial solar cell with full-area LiF x /MgF x O y /ITO (tin-doped indium oxide) transparent electron contact. It is the highest efficiency bifaciality so far for dopant-free bifacial solar cells to the best knowledge. Both cell configurations with LiF x /MgF x O y contacts show excellent environment stability. The cell efficiency maintains more than 95% of its initial value after keeping in air for 1500 h. This work provides a new idea to achieve transparent electron contact, showing a great potential for high-efficiency and low-cost optoelectronic devices.},

Presently, detection methods with the highest sensitivity require in vitro processing, while in vivo compatible fluorescence detections require a much higher concentration of biomarkers or limit of detection (LOD). In this paper, a fundamentally new strategy for ultrasensitive detection based on color-switchable lasing with a cavity-enhanced reduction of LOD is demonstrated, down to 1.4 × 10 −16 mg ml −1 for a quantitative detection, lower than both the fluorescence method and plasmonic enhanced method. For a qualitative or a yes/no type of detection, the LOD is as low as 10 –17 mg ml −1 . The approach in this work is based on a dye-embedded, in vivo compatible, polystyrene-sphere cavity, penetrable by biomarkers. A polystyrene sphere serves the dual roles of a laser cavity and an in vivo bio-reactor, in which dye molecules react with a biomarker, reporting biomarker information through lasing signals. The cavity-enhanced emission and lasing with only a single biomarker molecule per cavity allow improved visual distinguishability via color changes. Furthermore, when combined with a narrow-band filter, the color-switchable lasers act as an “on-off” logic signal and can be integrated into multiplexing detection assay biochips.},

However, the realization of CDs with dominant near-infrared (NIR) absorption/emission peaks in aqueous solution remains a great challenge. Herein, CDs with both main NIR absorption bands at 720 nm and NIR emission bands at 745 nm in an aqueous solution are fabricated for the first time by fusing large conjugated perylene derivatives under solvothermal treatment. With post-surface engineering, the polyethyleneimine modified CDs (PEI-CDs) exhibit enhanced PL quantum yields (PLQY) up to 8.3% and 18.8% in bovine serum albumin aqueous and DMF solutions, which is the highest PLQY of CDs in NIR region under NIR excitation. Density functional theory calculations support the strategy of fusing large conjugated perylene derivatives to achieve NIR emissions from CDs. Compared to the commercial NIR dye Indocyanine green, PEI-CDs exhibit excellent photostability and much lower cost. Furthermore, the obtained PEI-CDs illustrate the advantages of remarkable two-photon NIR angiography and in vivo NIR fluorescence bioimaging. This work demonstrates a promising strategy of fusing large conjugated molecules for preparing CDs with strong NIR absorption/emission to promote their bioimaging applications.},

However, uncontrollable spatial growth of lithium dendrites and the crack of solid electrolyte interphase still hinder its application. Herein, Schottky defects are motivated to tune the 4f-center electronic structures of catalysts to provide active sites to accelerate Li transport kinetics. As experimentally and theoretically confirmed, the electronic density is redistributed and affected by the Schottky defects, offering numerous active catalytic centers with stronger ion diffusion capability to guide the horizontal lithium deposition against dendrite growth. Consequently, the Li electrode with artificial electronic-modulation layer remarkably decreases the barriers of desolvation, nucleation, and diffusion, extends the dendrite-free plating lifespan up to 1200 h, and improves reversible Coulombic efficiency. With a simultaneous catalytic effect on the conversions of sulfur species at the cathodic side, the integrated Li–S full battery exhibits superior rate performance of 653 mA h g −1 at 5 C, high long-life capacity retention of 81.4% at 3 C, and a high energy density of 2264 W h kg −1 based on sulfur in a pouch cell, showing the promising potential toward high-safety and long-cycling lithium metal batteries.},

Here, it is demonstrated how a conventionally unstable electron-selective contact (ESC) is optimized with huge boost in stability as well as improved electron transport. With the introduction of a Ti thin film between a-Si:H( i )/LiF and Al electrode, high-level passivation ( S eff = 4.6 cm s –1 ) from a-Si:H( i ) and preferential band alignment ( ρ C = 7.9 mΩ cm 2 ) from low work function stack of LiF/Ti/Al are both stably retained in the newly constructed n -Si/a-Si:H( i )/LiF/Ti/Al ESC. A detailed interfacial elements analysis reveals that the efficiently blocked inward diffusion of Al from electrode by the Ti protecting layer balances transport and recombination losses in general. This excellent electron-selective properties in combination with large process tolerance that enable remarkable device performance, particularly high efficiencies of 22.12% and 23.61%, respectively, are successfully approached by heterojunction solar cells with dopant-free ESC and dopant-free contacts for both polarities.},

  abstract     = {High-capacity alloying-type anodes suffer poor rate capability due to their great volume expansion, while high-rate intercalation-type anodes are troubled with low theoretical capacity. Herein, a novel mechanism of alloying in the intercalative frameworks is proposed to confer both high-capacity and high-rate performances on anodes. Taking the indium-vanadium oxide (IVO) as a typical system, alloying-typed In is dispersed in the stable intercalative V 2 O 3 to form a solid solution. The alloying-typed In element provides high lithium storage capacity, while the robust, Li-conductive V−O frameworks effectively alleviate the volume expansion and aggregation of In. Benefiting from the above merits, the anode exhibits a high specific capacity of 1364 mA h g −1 at 1 A g −1 and an extraordinary cyclic performance of 814 mA h g −1 at 10 A g −1 after 600 cycles (124.9 mA h g −1 after 10 000 cycles at 50 A g −1 ). The superior electrochemical rate capability of (In,V) 2 O 3 solid solution anode rivals that of the reported alloying anode materials. This strategy can be extended for fabricating other alloying/intercalation hybrid anodes, such as (Sn,V)O 2 and (Sn,Ti)O 2 , which demonstrates the universality of confining alloying motifs in intercalative frameworks for rapid and high-capacity lithium storage.},

  abstract     = {Despite remarkable breakthrough made by virtue of “polymerized small-molecule acceptor (PSMA)” strategy recently, the limited selection pool of high-performance polymer acceptors and long-standing challenge in morphology control impede their further developments. Herein, three PSMAs of PYDT-2F, PYDT-3F, and PYDT-4F are developed by introducing different fluorine atoms on the end groups and/or bithiophene spacers to fine-tune their optoelectronic properties for high-performance PSMAs. The PSMAs exhibit narrow bandgap and energy levels that match well with PM6 donor. The fluorination promotes the crystallization of the polymer chain for enhanced electron mobility, which is further improved by following n -doping with benzyl viologen additive. Moreover, the miscibility is also improved by introducing more fluorine atoms, which promotes the intermixing with PM6 donor. Among them, PYDT-3F exhibits well-balanced high crystallinity and miscibility with PM6 donor; thus, the layer-by-layer processed PM6/PYDT-3F film obtains an optimal nanofibril morphology with submicron length and ≈23 nm width of fibrils, facilitating the charge separation and transport. The resulting PM6/PYDT-3F devices realizes a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.41% and fill factor of 77.01%, higher than the PM6/PYDT-2F (PCE = 16.25%) and PM6/PYDT-4F (PCE = 16.77%) devices.},

This results in voluminous systems with high-power usage and a small working space, which require complex and expensive controllers. This study presents a single-coil magneto-electromagnetic system, comprising a parallel robot and coil, capable of precise 3D locomotion control of magnetic millirobots while requiring only feedback of the vertical position of the millirobot. The coil current creates a 2D magnetic trapping point in the horizontal plane, which depends on the position and orientation of the coil and toward which the millirobot moves, eliminating the need for position feedback at such plane. The vertical position of the millirobot is controlled by varying the coil current while receiving feedback from the vertical position of the millirobot. Feedbackless 2D control and 1-axis feedback 3D automatic control of magnetic millirobots are experimentally demonstrated, achieving higher speeds and similar position errors when compared to control systems with 3D position feedback. Furthermore, selective control of two millirobots is demonstrated by matching the region of maximum vertical magnetic force and the targeted millirobot, achieving selective levitation and control of such millirobots.},

Herein, a highly emissive macrocycle ( 1 ) is reported, which is constructed by the cyclization reaction of triphenylamine with benzyl bromide and exhibits very distinctive photophysical performance both in aqueous solution and the solid state. Structural analysis reveals that the 1 can form self-interpenetrated complex and emit bright yellow fluorescence in the crystal lattice. The distorted yet symmetrical structure can endow 1 with unique two-photon absorption property upon excitation by near-infrared light. Also, 1 can be utilized as an efficient photosensitizer to produce singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) both in inanimate milieu and under cellular environment. More intriguingly, due to the strong association of 1 with negatively charged biomacromolecules, organelle-specific migration is achieved from lysosome to nucleus during the 1 O 2 -induced cell apoptosis process. To be envisaged, this conformationally confined cationic macrocycle with photocontrolled lysosome-to-nucleus translocation may provide a feasible approach for in situ identifying different biospecies and monitoring physiological events at subcellular level.},

Herein, a facile “interfacial locking strategy” has been developed to fabricate metal aerogel-based pressure sensors with excellent sensitivity and prominent stability. The strategy broke the bottleneck of the intrinsically poor mechanical properties of metal aerogels by grafting them on highly elastic melamine sponge with the help of a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer as the interface-reinforcing media. The hierarchically porous conductive structure of the ensemble offered the as-prepared flexible piezoresistive sensor with a sensitivity as high as 12 kPa −1 , a response time as fast as 85 ms, and a prominent durability over 23 000 compression cycles. The excellent comprehensive performance enables the successful application of the flexible piezoresistive sensor as two-dimensional (2D) array device as well as three-dimensional (3D) force-detecting device for real-time monitoring of HMI activities.},

They have traditionally been limited to metallic and dielectric nanostructures that sustain plasmonic and Mie resonances, respectively. More recently, nanostructures of organic J-aggregate excitonic materials have been proposed capable of also supporting nanooptical resonances, although their advance has been hampered from difficulty in nanostructuring. Here, the authors present the realization of organic J-aggregate excitonic nanostructures, using nanocylinder arrays as model system. Extinction spectra show that they can sustain both plasmon-like resonances and dielectric resonances, owing to the material providing negative and large positive permittivity regions at the different sides of its exciton resonance. Furthermore, it is found that the material is highly anisotropic, leading to hyperbolic and elliptic permittivity regions. Nearfield analysis using optical simulation reveals that the nanostructures therefore support hyperbolic localized surface exciton resonances and elliptic Mie resonances, neither of which has been previously demonstrated for this type of material. The anisotropic nanostructures form a new type of optical nanoantennas, which combined with the presented fabrication process opens up for applications such as fully organic excitonic metasurfaces.},

However, it remains unclear whether hysteresis only occurs due to oxygen redox. Here, it is identified that the voltage hysteresis can highly correlate to cationic reduction during discharge in the Li-rich layered oxide, Li 1.2 Ni 0.4 Mn 0.4 O 2 . In this material, the potential region of discharge accompanied by hysteresis is apparently separated from that of discharge unrelated to hysteresis. The quantitative analysis of soft/hard X-ray absorption spectroscopies discloses that hysteresis is associated with an incomplete cationic reduction of Ni during discharge. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique shows that the inevitable energy consumption caused by hysteresis corresponds to an overpotential of 0.3 V. The results unveil that hysteresis can also be affected by cationic redox in Li-rich layered cathodes, implying that oxygen redox cannot be the only reason for the evolution of voltage hysteresis. Therefore, appropriate control of both cationic and anionic redox of Li-rich layered oxides will allow them to reach their maximum energy density and efficiency.},

Vaccines, including immunostimulant-adjuvanted peptide antigens, can improve ICB. The emerging neoantigens generated by cancer somatic mutations elicit cancer-specific immunity for personalized immunotherapy; the novel cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) adjuvants activate stimulator of interferon genes (STING) for antitumor type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. However, CDN/neoantigen vaccine development has been limited by the poor antigen/adjuvant codelivery. Here, pH-responsive CDN/neoantigen codelivering nanovaccines (NVs) for ICB combination tumor immunotherapy are reported. pH-responsive polymers are synthesized to be self-assembled into multivesicular nanoparticles (NPs) at physiological pH and disassembled at acidic conditions. NPs with high CDN/antigen coloading are selected as NVs for CDN/antigen codelivery to antigen presenting cells (APCs) in immunomodulatory lymph nodes (LNs). In the acidic endosome of APCs, pH-responsive NVs facilitate the vaccine release and escape into cytosol, where CDNs activate STING for IFN-I responses and antigens are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for T-cell priming. In mice, NVs elicit potent antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses with immune memory, and reduce multifaceted tumor immunosuppression. In syngeneic murine tumors, NVs show robust ICB combination therapeutic efficacy. Overall, these CDN/neoantigen-codelivering NVs hold the potential for ICB combination tumor immunotherapy.},

In this work, heterostructures consisting of aggregates of fluorescent molecules (DY1) and 2D semiconductor MoS 2 monolayers are fabricated. Photoluminescence spectra of DY1/MoS 2 show quenching of the DY1 emission and enhancement of the MoS 2 emission, indicating a strong electronic interaction between these two materials. Nanoscopic mappings of the light-induced contact potential difference changes rule out the CT process at the interface. Using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, the rapid interfacial ET process from DY1 aggregates to MoS 2 and a fourfold extension of the exciton lifetime in MoS 2 are elucidated. These results suggest that the integration of 2D inorganic semiconductors with fluorescent molecules can provide versatile approaches to engineer the physical characteristics of materials for both fundamental studies and novel optoelectronic device applications.},

Via thermal control, the unit cell angle of a honeycomb structure can be precisely programmed from 68° to 107°. This results in negative, zero, or positive Poisson&#39;s ratio under applied tensile strain. The geometrical reconfiguration with resulting programmable auxeticity is predicted and verified by finite element (FE) simulation. This concept of shape-morphing hydrogel metamaterials via the addition of actuating struts into otherwise passive architectures offers a new strategy for reconfigurable metamaterials and extends applications of hydrogels in general.

  abstract     = {The interface between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) plays a vital role in hole extraction and electron blocking in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and it is particularly susceptible to harmful defects. Surface passivation is an effective strategy for addressing the above concerns. However, because of its strong polarity, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is used as a solvent in all of the surface treatment materials reported thus far, and it frequently damages the surface of perovskite. In this paper, a method is proposed for dissolving the passivation materials, for example, guanidine bromide (GABr), in mixed solvents (1:1) of IPA and toluene (TL), which can efficiently passivate interface and grain boundary defects by minimizing the IPA solubility of the perovskite surface. As a result, all the performance parameters Voc, Jsc, and FF are improved, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 20.1 to 22.7%. Moreover, combining the PSCs with GABr post-treatment in mixed solvents with copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cells, a 4-terminal (4T) perovskite/CIGS tandem device is realized and a PCE of 25.5% is achieved. The mixed solvent passivation strategy demonstrated here, hopefully, will open new avenues for improving PSCs’ efficiency and stability.},

  abstract     = {Seawater contains uranium at a concentration of ≈3.3 ppb, thus representing a rich and sustainable nuclear fuel source. Herein, an adsorption–electrocatalytic platform is developed for uranium extraction from seawater, comprising atomically dispersed indium anchored on hollow nitrogen-doped carbon capsules functionalized with flexible amidoxime moieties (In–N x –C–R, where R denotes amidoxime groups). In–N x –C–R exhibits excellent uranyl capture properties, enabling a uranium removal rate of 6.35 mg g −1 in 24 h, representing one of the best uranium extractants reported to date. Importantly, In–N x –C–R demonstrates exceptional selectivity for uranium extraction relative to vanadium in seawater (8.75 times more selective for the former). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the amidoxime groups serve as uranyl chelating sites, thus allowing selective adsorption over other ions. XAS and in situ Raman results directly indicate that the absorbed uranyl can be electrocatalytically reduced to an unstable U(V) intermediate, then re-oxidizes to U(VI) in the form of insoluble Na 2 O(UO 3 ·H 2 O) x for collection, through reversible single electron transfer processes involving InN x sites. These results provide detailed mechanistic understanding of the uranium extraction process at a molecular level. This work provides a roadmap for the adsorption–electrocatalytic extraction of uranium from seawater, adding to the growing suite of technologies for harvesting valuable metals from the earth&#39;s oceans.},

  abstract     = {Nanozyme-based tumor catalytic therapy has attracted widespread attention in recent years, but its therapeutic outcome is drastically diminished by species of nanozyme, concentration of substrate, pH value, and reaction temperature, etc. Herein, a novel Cu-doped polypyrrole nanozyme (CuP) with trienzyme-like activities, including catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxidase (POD), is first proposed by a straightforward one-step procedure, which can specifically promote O 2 and ·OH elevation but glutathione (GSH) reduction in tumor microenvironment (TME), causing irreversible oxidative stress damage to tumor cells and reversing the redox balance. The PEGylated CuP nanozyme (CuPP) has been demonstrated to efficiently reverse immunosuppressive TME by overcoming tumor hypoxia and re-educating macrophage from pro-tumoral M2 to anti-tumoral M1 phenotype. More importantly, CuPP exhibits hyperthermia-enhanced enzyme-mimic catalytic and immunoregulatory activities, which results in intense immune responses and almost complete tumor inhibition by further combining with α PD-L1. This work opens intriguing perspectives not only in enzyme-catalytic nanomedicine but also in macrophage-based tumor immunotherapy.},

Clinical computed tomography (CT) detection of quantitative 3D microstructural subchondral bone parameters is applied to monitor changes of subchondral bone structure in different stages of human OA and is compared with micro-CT, the gold standard. Determination by clinical CT (287 µm resolution) of key microstructural parameters in tibial plateaus with mild-to-moderate and severe OA reveals strong correlations to micro-CT (35 µm), high inter- and intraobserver reliability, and small relative differences. In vivo, normal, mild-to-moderate, and severe OA are compared with clinical CT (331 µm). All approaches detect characteristic expanded trabecular structure in severe OA and fundamental microstructural correlations with clinical OA stage. Multivariate analyses at various in vivo and ex vivo imaging resolutions always reliably separate mild-to-moderate from severe OA (except mild-to-moderate OA from normal), revealing a striking similarity between 287 µm clinical and 35 µm micro-CT. Thus, accurate structural measurements using clinical CT with a resolution near the trabecular dimensions are possible. Clinical CT offers an opportunity to quantitatively monitor subchondral bone microstructure in clinical and experimental settings as an advanced tool of investigating OA and other diseases affecting bone architecture.},

  abstract     = {Future energy demands for green hydrogen have fueled intensive research on proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). However, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and highly corrosive environment on the anode side narrow the catalysts to be expensive Ir-based materials. It is very challenging to develop cheap and effective OER catalysts. Herein, Co-hexamethylenetetramine metal–organic framework (Co-HMT) as the precursor and a fast-quenching method is employed to synthesize RuO 2 nanorods loaded on antimony-tin oxide (ATO). Physical characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the ATO can increase the electrochemical surface areas of the catalysts, while the tensile strains incorporated by quenching can alter the electronic state of RuO 2 . The optimized catalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for OER, and keeps almost unchanged after 150 h chronopotentiometry. When applied in a real PEMWE assembly, only 1.51 V is needed for the catalyst to reach a current density of 1 A cm −2 .},

CO selectivity of 92.4% is achieved under normal temperature and pressure, and the CO and O 2 evolution rates reach 12.4 and 6.7 µmol h −1 , respectively. The maximum energy conversion efficiencies of 2.3% from mechanical to chemical energy and 31.9% from electrical to chemical energy are reached.

The combination of USML, local heating, and remote read-out enables a feedback and response loop for highly controlled stimulation. It is found that ML is a result of direct energy transfer from the host material to Er 3+ , giving room for adapted spectral characteristics through bandgap modulation. ML saturation at high acoustic power enables independent control of local light emission and ultrasonic heating. Such USML materials may have profound implications for optogenetics, photodynamic therapy and other areas requiring local illumination, heating, and thermometry simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of gene expression via incomplete base pairing to sequence motifs at the three prime untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of mRNAs and play critical roles in the etiology of cancers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3′-UTR miRNA-binding regions may influence the miRNA affinity. However, this biological mechanism in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. Here, a three-stage genome-wide association study of 3′-UTR SNPs ( n =33 117) is performed in 5515 Chinese men. Three genome-wide significant variants are discovered at 8p21.2 (rs1567669, rs4872176, and rs4872177), which are all located in a linkage disequilibrium region of the NKX3-1 gene. Phenome-wide association analysis using the FinnGen data reveals a specific association of rs1567669 with PCa over 2,264 disease endpoints. Expression quantitative trait locus analyses based on both Chinese PCa cohort and the GTEx database show that risk alleles of these SNPs are significantly associated with low expression of NKX3-1 . Based on the MirSNP database, dual-luciferase reporter assays show that risk alleles of these SNPs downregulate the expression of NKX3-1 via increased miRNA binding. These results indicate that the SNPs at the 3′-UTR of NKX3-1 significantly downregulate NKX3-1 expression by influencing the affinity of miRNA and increase the PCa risk.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits resistance to conventional treatments due to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), causing postsurgical relapse and a dismal prognosis. Umbilical cord blood natural killer (UCB-NK) cell-based immunotherapy represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, its therapeutic efficacy is greatly restrained by downregulation of the NK cell activation ligand MHC class I-related chain A/B (MICA/B) and autophagy-mediated degradation of NK cell-derived granzyme B (GZMB) in CSCs. Herein, it is demonstrated that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) epigenetically downregulates let-7e-5p and miR-615-3p to increase MICA/B expression and that 3-methyl adenine (3MA) inhibits autophagy-mediated GZMB degradation, thereby sensitizing breast CSCs to UCB-NK cells. Then, an injectable hydrogel is designed to codeliver SAHA and 3MA to enhance UCB-NK cell infusion efficacy in TNBC. The hydrogel precursors can be smoothly injected into the tumor resection bed and form a stable gel in situ, allowing for a pH-sensitive sustained release of SAHA and 3MA. Moreover, UCB-NK cell infusion in combination with the hydrogel efficiently controls postsurgical relapse of TNBC. In addition, the hydrogel exhibits good hemostasis and wound-healing functions. Therefore, the work provides proof of concept that an injectable epigenetic autophagic modulatory hydrogel augments UCB-NK cell therapy to combat postsurgical relapse of TNBC.},

Lamin A/C is known to hinder cell migration by limiting nuclear deformation and passage through confining channels, but its role in nuclear deformation and passage through fibrous environments is less clear. Cell and nuclear migration through discrete, closely spaced, slender obstacles which mimic the mechanical properties of collagen fibers are studied. Nuclei bypass slender obstacles while preserving their overall morphology by deforming around them with deep local invaginations of little resisting force. The obstacles do not impede the nuclear trajectory and do not cause rupture of the nuclear envelope. Nuclei likewise deform around single collagen fibers in cells migrating in 3D collagen gels. In contrast to its limiting role in nuclear passage through confining channels, lamin A/C facilitates nuclear deformation and passage through fibrous environments; nuclei in lamin-null ( Lmna −/− ) cells lose their overall morphology and become entangled on the obstacles. Analogous to surface tension-mediated deformation of a liquid drop, lamin A/C imparts a surface tension on the nucleus that allows nuclear invaginations with little mechanical resistance, preventing nuclear entanglement and allowing nuclear passage through fibrous environments.},

  abstract     = {Recent multi-omics analyses paved the way for a comprehensive understanding of pathological processes. However, only few studies have explored Alzheimer’s disease (AD) despite the possibility of biological subtypes within these patients. For this study, unsupervised classification of four datasets (genetics, miRNA transcriptomics, proteomics, and blood-based biomarkers) using Multi-Omics Factor Analysis+ (MOFA+), along with systems-biological approaches following various downstream analyses are performed. New subgroups within 170 patients with cerebral amyloid pathology (Aβ+) are revealed and the features of them are identified based on the top-rated targets constructing multi-omics factors of both whole (M-TPAD) and immune-focused models (M-IPAD). The authors explored the characteristics of subtypes and possible key-drivers for AD pathogenesis. Further in-depth studies showed that these subtypes are associated with longitudinal brain changes and autophagy pathways are main contributors. The significance of autophagy or clustering tendency is validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; n = 120 including 30 Aβ- and 90 Aβ+), induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human brain organoids/microglia (n = 12 including 5 Aβ-, 5 Aβ+, and CRISPR-Cas9 apolipoprotein isogenic lines), and human brain transcriptome (n = 78). Collectively, this study provides a strategy for precision medicine therapy and drug development for AD using integrative multi-omics analysis and network modelling.},

  abstract     = {Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are an emerging technology to collect and channel light from a large absorption area into a smaller one. They are a complementary technology for traditional solar photovoltaics (PV), particularly suitable for application in urban or indoor environments where their custom colors and form factors, and performance under diffuse light conditions may be advantageous. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has emerged as a valuable approach to overcome some of the intrinsic limitations of conventional single lumophore LSCs, such as reabsorption or reduced quantum efficiency. This review outlines the potential of FRET to boost LSC performance, using highlights from the literature to illustrate the key criteria that must be considered when designing an FRET-LSC, including both the photophysical requirements of the FRET lumophores and their interaction with the host material. Based on these criteria, a list of design guidelines intended to aid researchers when they approach the design of a new FRET-LSC system is presented. By highlighting the unanswered questions in this field, the authors aim to demonstrate the potential of FRET-LSCs for both conventional solar-harvesting and emerging LSC-inspired technologies and hope to encourage participation from a diverse researcher base to address this exciting challenge.},

  abstract     = {The chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)S 2 has gained renewed interest in recent years due to the potential application in tandem solar cells. In this contribution, a combined theoretical and experimental approach is applied to investigate stable and metastable phases forming in CuInS 2 (CIS) thin films. Ab initio calculations are performed to obtain formation energies, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and Raman spectra of CIS polytypes and related compounds. Multiple CIS structures with zinc-blende and wurtzite-derived lattices are identified and their XRD/Raman patterns are shown to contain overlapping features, which could lead to misidentification. Thin films with compositions from Cu-rich to Cu-poor are synthesized via a two-step approach based on sputtering from binary targets followed by high-temperature sulfurization. It is discovered that several CIS polymorphs are formed when growing the material with this approach. In the Cu-poor material, wurtzite CIS is observed for the first time in sputtered thin films along with chalcopyrite CIS and CuAu-ordered CIS. Once the wurtzite CIS phase has formed, it is difficult to convert into the stable chalcopyrite polymorph. CuIn 5 S 8 and NaInS 2 accommodating In-excess are found alongside the CIS polymorphs. It is argued that the metastable polymorphs are stabilized by off-stoichiometry of the precursors, hence tight composition control is required.},

Based on knock-on effects and strain analysis, the phase transition mechanism on the created atomic vacancies and the introduced substantial in-plane compressive strain in 2D layers are clarified. This in situ high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and in situ electrical characterizations agree well with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results for the atomic structures, electronic properties, and phase transition mechanisms. Grain boundary engineering and electrical contact engineering in 2D are thus developed based on this patterning technique.

  abstract     = {Improved understanding of the etiologies of delirium, a common and severe neuropsychiatric syndrome, would facilitate the disease prevention and treatment. Here, the authors invesitgate the role of circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of delirium. They observe perturbance of circadian rhythms in mouse models of delirium and disrupted clock gene expression in patients with delirium. In turn, physiological and genetic circadian disruptions sensitize mice to delirium with aggravated cognitive impairment. Likewise, global deletion of E4bp4 (E4 promoter-binding protein), a clock gene markedly altered in delirium conditions, results in exacerbated delirium-associated cognitive decline. Cognitive decline in delirium models is attributed to microglial activation and impaired long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals microglia as the regulatory target of E4bp4 . E4bp4 restrains microglial activation via inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Supporting this, mice lacking in microglial E4bp4 are delirious prone, whereas mice with E4bp4 specifically deleted in hippocampal CA1 neurons have a normal phenotype. Mechanistically, E4bp4 inhibits ERK1/2 signaling by trans-repressing Mapk1/3 (genes encoding ERK1/2) via direct binding to a D-box element in the promoter region. These findings define a causal role of clock dysfunction in delirium development and indicate E4bp4 as a regulator of cognition at the crosstalk between circadian clock and delirium.},

Recently, epigenetic changes have emerged as important regulatory factors for colitis-associated cancer. Here, a systematic epigenomic study of histone modifications is performed, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, in an AOM-DSS-induced CRC mouse model. In combination with transcriptomic data, the authors generate a dataset of 105 deep sequencing files and illustrate the dynamic landscape of chromatin states at five time points during inflammation-cancer transition. Functional gene clusters are identified based on dynamic transcriptomic and epigenomic information, and key signaling pathways in the process are illustrated. This study&#39;s results reveal that enhancer state regions play important roles during inflammation-cancer transition. It predicts novel transcription factors based on enhancer information, and experimentally proves OTX2 as a critical tumor suppressive transcription factor. Taken together, this study provides comprehensive epigenomic data and reveals novel molecular mechanisms for colitis-associated cancer.},

Conventionally, nanoionics mainly refers to the study of ion transport in solid-state nanosystems. In this review, to extent this concept is proposed and a new framework to understand the phenomena, mechanism, methodology, and application associated with ion transport at the nanoscale is put forward. Specifically, here nanoionics is summarized into three categories, i.e., biological, artificial, and hybrid, and discussed the characteristics of each system. Compared with nanoelectronics, nanoionics is an emerging research field with many theoretical and practical challenges. With this forward-looking perspective, it is hoped that nanoionics can attract increasing attention and find wide range of applications as nanoelectronics.},

Here a new discotic molecule of 3,6,10,11-tetrakis(pentyloxy)triphenylene-2,7-diyl bis(2,2-dimethylpropanoate) (T5DP-2,7) is introduced, in which the hole transport channels with superior hole mobility (2.6 × 10 –2 cm 2 V –1 s –1 ) is formed by stacking. The composite hole transport material (HTM) is prepared by blending T5DP-2,7 with the cross-linked 4,4′- bis(3-vinyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,1′biphenyl (CBP-V) which shows the deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy level. The increased hole mobility of the target composite HTM from 10 –4 to 10 –3 cm 2 V –1 s –1 as well as the stepwise energy levels facilitates the hole transport, which would be beneficial for more balanced carrier injection. This composite hole transport layer (HTL) has improved the deep-blue-emission performances of Commission International de I&#39;Eclairage of (0.14, 0.04), luminance of 44080 cd m −2 , and external quantum efficiency of 18.59%.

A gelatin methacryloyl (gelMA) bioink is used to create multi-channel cubic tumor analogues with high printing fidelity and mechanical tunability. Human-derived NB spheroids and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are incorporated into the biomanufactured gelMA and cocultured under static versus dynamic conditions, demonstrating high levels of survival and growth. Quantification of NB-EC integration and tumor cell migration suggested an increased aggressive behavior of NB when cultured in bioprinted endothelialized models, when cocultured with HUVECs, and also as a result of dynamic culture. This model also allowed for the assessment of metabolic, cytokine, and gene expression profiles of NB spheroids under varying TME conditions. These results establish a high throughput research enabling platform to study the TME-mediated cellular-molecular mechanisms of tumor growth, aggression, and response to therapy.},

Thus, it is critical to identify limits of control and effective measures against future outbreaks. The effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination strategies are analyzed with a detailed community-specific agent-based model (ABM). The authors demonstrate that the threshold for population immunity is not a unique number, but depends on the vaccination strategy. Prioritizing highly interactive people diminishes the risk for an infection wave, while prioritizing the elderly minimizes fatalities when vaccinations are low. Control over COVID-19 outbreaks requires adaptive combination of NPIs and targeted vaccination, exemplified for Germany for January–September 2021. Bimodality emerges from the heterogeneity and stochasticity of community-specific human–human interactions and infection networks, which can render the effects of limited NPIs uncertain.

  abstract     = {Early embryos undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming to achieve gamete-to-embryo transition, which involves the loading and removal of histone variant H2A.Z on chromatin. However, how does H2A.Z regulate gene expression and histone modifications during preimplantation development remains unrevealed. Here, by using ultra-low-input native chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, the genome-wide distribution of H2A.Z is delineated in mouse oocytes and early embryos. These landscapes indicate that paternal H2A.Z is removed upon fertilization, followed by unbiased accumulation on parental genomes during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Remarkably, H2A.Z exhibits hierarchical accumulation as different peak types at promoters: promoters with double H2A.Z peaks are colocalized with H3K4me3 and indicate transcriptional activation; promoters with a single H2A.Z peak are more likely to occupy bivalent marks (H3K4me3+H3K27me3) and indicate development gene suppression; promoters with no H2A.Z accumulation exhibit persisting gene silencing in early embryos. Moreover, H2A.Z depletion changes the enrichment of histone modifications and RNA polymerase II binding at promoters, resulting in abnormal gene expression and developmental arrest during lineage commitment. Furthermore, similar transcription and accumulation patterns between mouse and porcine embryos indicate that a dual role of H2A.Z in regulating the epigenome required for proper gene expression is conserved during mammalian preimplantation development.},

  abstract     = {The limited efficacy of radiotherapy leads to radio-resistance and high rates of tumor recurrence and metastasis, which is caused by tumor hypoxia, rapid DNA damage repair, and especially the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumor. Lots of immune cell-derived exosomes can regulate antitumor immunity, but their application in enhancing radiotherapy is rarely studied. Herein, as a model of concept, M1 macrophage-derived exosomes (M1Exos) is engineered as effective radiotherapy sensitizers, realizing the trilogy of radiotherapy sensitization: 1) M1Exos is engineered to express catalases on the inside of membrane, which can effectively relieve tumor hypoxia, and enhance DNA damage. 2) The DNA damage repair inhibitor is loaded in M1Exos to effectively inhibit DNA damage repair. 3) M1Exos can polarize M2 macrophages into M1 phenotypes, and the anti-PD-L1 nanobody engineered on the outside of M1Exos can relieve the immunosuppression of T cells, both ultimately leading to the remodeling of the tumor suppressive microenvironment. The trilogy of radiotherapy sensitization achieves excellent antitumor efficacy, exhibiting the good utility of engineering immune cell-derived exosomes as radiotherapy sensitizers, inspiring the future efforts to explore different kinds of immune cell-derived exosomes for enhanced radiotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Optical response of crystalline solids is to a large extent driven by excitations that promote electrons among individual bands. This allows one to apply optical and magneto-optical methods to determine experimentally the energy band gap —a fundamental property crucial to our understanding of any solid—with a great precision. Here it is shown that such conventional methods, applied with great success to many materials in the past, do not work in topological Dirac semimetals with a dispersive nodal line. There, the optically deduced band gap depends on how the magnetic field is oriented with respect to the crystal axes. Such highly unusual behavior is explained in terms of band-gap renormalization driven by Lorentz boosts which results from the Lorentz-covariant form of the Dirac Hamiltonian relevant for the nodal line at low energies.},

This review comprehensively describes the latest developments in ALD of metal oxides (MOs) and chalcogenides with tunable bandgaps, compositions, and nanostructures for the fabrication of high-performance field-effect transistors. By ALD various n-type and p-type MOs, including binary and multinary semiconductors, can be deposited and applied as channel materials, transparent electrodes, or electrode interlayers for improving charge-transport and switching properties of transistors. On the other hand, MO insulators by ALD are applied as dielectrics or protecting/encapsulating layers for enhancing device performance and stability. Metal chalcogenide semiconductors and their heterostructures made by ALD have shown great promise as novel building blocks to fabricate single channel or heterojunction materials in transistors. By correlating the device performance to the structural and chemical properties of the ALD materials, clear structure–property relations can be proposed, which can help to design better-performing transistors. Finally, a brief concluding remark on these ALD materials and devices is presented, with insights into upcoming opportunities and challenges for future electronics and integrated applications.},

  abstract     = {The antagonism between strength and corrosion resistance in graphene-reinforced aluminum matrix composites is an inherent challenge to designing reliable structural components. Heteroatom microstructural modification is highly appreciated to conquer the obstacle. Here, a bottom-up strategy to exploit the heterogeneous phase interface to enable high corrosion durability is proposed. Deformation-driven metallurgy derived from severe plastic deformation is developed to produce Mg-alloyed fluorinated graphene structures with homogeneous dispersion. These structures allow for absorbing corrosion products, forming a dense protective layer against corrosion, and local micro-tuning of the suppression of charge transfer. This results in superior corrosion resistance with an outstanding strength-ductility balance of the composites via ultrafine-grained and precipitation strengthening. The anti-corrosion polarization resistance remains 89% of the initial state after 2-month immersion in chloride-containing environment, while the ultra-tensile strength and elongation of 532 ± 39 MPa and 17.3 ± 1.2% are obtained. The economical strategy of heteroatom modification broadens the horizon for anti-corrosion engineering in aluminum matrix composites, which is critical for the design of carbonaceous nanomaterial-reinforced composites to realize desired performances for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Polymers are widely studied materials with diverse properties and applications determined by molecular structures. It is essential to represent these structures clearly and explore the full space of achievable chemical designs. However, existing approaches cannot offer comprehensive design models for polymers because of their inherent scale and structural complexity. Here, a parametric, context-sensitive grammar designed specifically for polymers (PolyGrammar) is proposed. Using the symbolic hypergraph representation and 14 simple production rules, PolyGrammar can represent and generate all valid polyurethane structures. An algorithm is presented to translate any polyurethane structure from the popular Simplified Molecular-Input Line-entry System (SMILES) string format into the PolyGrammar representation. The representative power of PolyGrammar is tested by translating a dataset of over 600 polyurethane samples collected from the literature. Furthermore, it is shown that PolyGrammar can be easily extended to other copolymers and homopolymers. By offering a complete, explicit representation scheme and an explainable generative model with validity guarantees, PolyGrammar takes an essential step toward a more comprehensive and practical system for polymer discovery and exploration. As the first bridge between formal languages and chemistry, PolyGrammar also serves as a critical blueprint to inform the design of similar grammars for other chemistries, including organic and inorganic molecules.},

  abstract     = {Small molecular NIR-II dyes are highly desirable for various biomedical applications. However, NIR-II probes are still limited due to the complex synthetic processes and inadequate availability of fluorescent core. Herein, the design and synthesis of three small molecular NIR-II dyes are reported. These dyes can be excited at 850–915 nm and emitted at 1280–1290 nm with a large stokes shift (≈375 nm). Experimental and computational results indicate a 2:1 preferable host–guest assembly between the cucurbit[8]uril (CB) and dye molecules. Interestingly, the dyes when self-assembled in presence of CB leads to the formation of nanocubes (≈200 nm) and exhibits marked enhancement in fluorescence emission intensity (Switch-On). However, the addition of red carbon dots (rCDots, ≈10 nm) quenches the fluorescence of these host–guest complexes (Switch-Off) providing flexibility in the user-defined tuning of photoluminescence. The turn-ON complex found to have comparable quantum yield to the commercially available near-infrared fluorophore, IR-26. The aqueous dispersibility, cellular and blood compatibility, and NIR-II bioimaging capability of the inclusion complexes is also explored. Thus, a switchable fluorescence behavior, driven by host–guest complexation and supramolecular self-assembly, is demonstrated here for three new NIR-II dyes.},

Presently, however, it is hindered by poor functional neuronal differentiation. Electrical stimulation is considered one of the most effective ways to promote neuronal differentiation of NSCs. In addition to surgically implanted electrodes, traditional electrical stimulation includes wires connected to the external power supply, and an additional surgery is required to remove the electrodes or wires following stimulation, which may cause secondary injuries and infections. Herein, a novel method is reported for generation of wireless electrical signals on an Au nanostrip array by leveraging the effect of electromagnetic induction under a rotating magnetic field. The intensity of the generated electrical signals depends on the rotation speed and magnetic field strength. The Au nanostrip array-mediated electric stimulation promotes NSC differentiation into mature neurons within 5 days, at the mRNA, protein, and function levels. The rate of differentiation is faster by at least 5 days than that in cells without treatment. The Au nanostrip array-based wireless device also accelerates neuronal differentiation of NSCs in vivo. The novel method to accelerate the neuronal differentiation of NSCs has the advantages of wireless, timely, localized and precise controllability, and noninvasive power supplementation.},

  abstract     = {Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is a promising target for ovarian cancer therapy due to its critical role in tumorigenesis and progression. Currently available SIK2 inhibitors have shown remarkable therapeutic effects on ovarian cancers in preclinical studies. However, direct administration of the SIK2 inhibitors may bring significant off-target effect, limiting their clinical applications. In this work, by rational design of a hydrogelator Nap-Phe-Phe-Glu-Glu-Leu-Tyr-Arg-Thr-Gln-Ser-Ser-Ser-Asn-Leu-OH ( Nap-S ) to coassemble a SIK2 inhibitor HG-9-91-01 ( HG ), a SIK2-responsive supramolecular hydrogel ( Gel Nap-S+HG ) for local administration and SIK2-responsive release of HG is reported to efficiently suppress ovarian cancer metastasis. Under the activation of SIK2 overexpressed in ovarian cancers, Nap-S in the hydrogel is phosphorylated to yield hydrophilic Nap-Phe-Phe-Glu-Glu-Leu-Tyr-Arg-Thr-Gln-Ser(H 2 PO 3 )-Ser-Ser-Asn-Leu ( Nap-Sp ), triggering the disassembly of the hydrogel and a responsive release of the inhibitor. Cell experiments indicate that sustained release of HG from Gel Nap-S+HG induce a prominent therapeutic effect on cancer cells by inhibiting SIK2 and phosphorylation of their downstream signaling molecules. Animal experiments demonstrate that, compared with those tumor model mice treated with free HG , Gel Nap-S+HG -treatment mice show an enhanced inhibition on ovarian tumor growth and metastasis. It is anticipated that the Gel Nap-S+HG can be applied for ovarian cancer therapy in clinic in the near future.},

Here, surgery activated LHb and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are presented. VTA is known to receive projections from LHb and project to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Direct chemogenetic inhibition of LHb or damaging LHb attenuates surgery-induced learning and memory impairment, N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammatory responses and cell injury in the VTA, and activation of rostromedial tegmental nucleus, an intermediate station to connect LHb with VTA. LHb inhibition preserves dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Retrograde inhibition of LHb via its projections to VTA attenuated surgery-induced learning and memory dysfunction is observed. Retrograde activation of LHb induced learning and memory dysfunction is observed. Inhibition of NMDA receptors, dopamine synthesis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the VTA reduced surgery-induced learning and memory impairment, inflammatory responses, and cell injury are observed. These results suggest that surgery activates the LHb-VTA neural circuit, which contributes to POCD and neuropathological changes in the brain. These novel findings represent initial evidence for neural circuit involvement in surgery effects.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors are considered to have great application prospects in spintronic logic devices, memory devices, and photodetectors, due to their unique structures and outstanding physical properties in 2D confinement. Understanding the influence of magnetism on optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D magnetic semiconductors is a significant issue for constructing multifunctional electronic devices and implementing sophisticated functions. Herein, the influence of spin ordering and magnons on the optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D magnetic semiconductor α -MnSe synthesized by space-confined chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is explored systematically. The spin-ordering-induced magnetic phase transition triggers temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra to produce a huge transition at Néel temperature ( T N ≈ 160 K). The magnons- and defects-induced emissions are the primary luminescence path below T N and direct internal 4 a T 1g → 6 A 1g transition-induced emissions are the main luminescence path above T N . Additionally, the magnons and defect structures endow 2D α -MnSe with a broadband luminescence from 550 to 880 nm, and an ultraviolet–near-infrared photoresponse from 365 to 808 nm. Moreover, the device also demonstrates improved photodetection performance at 80 K, possibly influenced by spin ordering and trap states associated with defects. These above findings indicate that 2D magnetic semiconductor α -MnSe provides an excellent platform for magneto-optical and magneto-optoelectronic research.},

  abstract     = {Elastomers with high dielectric permittivity that self-heal after electric breakdown and mechanical damage are important in the emerging field of artificial muscles. Here, a one-step process toward self-healable, silicone-based elastomers with large and tunable permittivity is reported. Anionic ring-opening polymerization of cyanopropyl-substituted cyclic siloxanes yields elastomers with polar side chains. The equilibrated product is composed of networks, linear chains, and cyclic compounds. The ratio between the components varies with temperature and allows realizing materials with largely different properties. The silanolate end groups remain active, which is the key to self-healing. Elastomeric behavior is observed at room temperature, while viscous flow dominates at higher temperatures (typically 80 °C). The elasticity is essential for reversible actuation and the thermoreversible softening allows for self-healing and recycling. The dielectric permittivity can be increased to a maximum value of 18.1 by varying the polar group content. Single-layer actuators show 3.8% lateral actuation at 5.2 V µm –1 and self-repair after a breakdown, while damaged ones can be recycled integrally. Stack actuators reach an actuation strain of 5.4 ± 0.2% at electric fields as low as 3.2 V µm –1 and are therefore promising for applications as artificial muscles in soft robotics.},

However, the toxicity of lead and the further development of device functions are the recognized problems at present. Herein, a flexible optoelectronic synapses system based on high-quality lead-free Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 nanocrystals is demonstrated, in which the carrier confinement caused by the band mismatching between the Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 and the organic semiconductor layer provides the possibility to simulate synaptic behaviors. The synaptic functions including long/short-term memory and learning-forgetting-relearning are demonstrated in this device and visual perception, visual memory, and color recognition functions are successfully implemented. Additionally, the flexible device exhibits excellent robustness and can realize imaging of light distribution under curved hemispheres similar to the human eye. Finally, through the simulation based on an artificial neural network algorithm, the device successfully realizes the high-precision recognition of handwritten digital images and possesses a strong fault tolerant capability even in bending states. These results are expected to drive the practical progress of metal halide for neuromorphic computing.},

The sensor fluorescence changes linearly with the pH value in the range 4 to 7.5 upon swelling/shrinking of the polymer multilayer and enables performing real-time measurements of the pH level with high stability, reproducibility, and accuracy, over 100 h of continuous operation. In vivo studies carried out implanting the sensor in the subcutis on the back of mice confirm real-time monitoring of the local pH level through skin. Full degradation of the pH sensor occurs in one week from implant in the animal model, and its biocompatibility after 2 months is confirmed by histological and fluorescence analyses. The proposed approach can be extended to the detection of other (bio)markers in vivo by engineering the functionality of one (at least) of the polyelectrolytes with suitable receptors, thus paving the way to implantable bioresorbable chemical sensors.},

Herein, a bright and stable blue gallium nitride (GaN) LED is utilized for vertical integration with a green MAPbBr 3 PeLED, successfully achieving a Pe-GaN tandem LED with independently tunable luminance and color. The electronic and photonic co-excitation (EPCE) effect is found to suppress the radiative recombination and current injection of PeLEDs, leading to degraded luminance and current efficiency under direct current modulation. Accordingly, the pulse-width modulation is introduced to the tandem device with a negligible EPCE effect, and the average hybrid current efficiency is significantly improved by 139.5%, finally achieving a record tunable luminance (average tuning range of 16631 cd m −2 at an arbitrary color from blue to green) for perovskite-based multi-color LEDs. The reported excellent independent tunability can be the starting point for perovskite-based multicolor EL devices, enabling the combination with matured semiconductor technologies to facilitate their commercialization in advanced display applications with ultra-high resolution.},

Despite innate, distinct characteristics of the brain from other organs, the underlying delicate crosstalk between brain metastatic NSCLC (BM-NSCLC) cells and brain tumor microenvironment (bTME) associated with tumor evolution remains elusive. Here, a novel 3D microfluidic tri-culture platform is proposed for recapitulating positive feedback from BM-NSCLC and astrocytes and brain-specific endothelial cells, two major players in bTME. Advanced imaging and quantitative functional assessment of the 3D tri-culture model enable real-time live imaging of cell viability and separate analyses of genomic/molecular/secretome from each subset. Susceptibility of multiple patient-derived BM-NSCLCs to representative targeted agents is altered and secretion of serpin E1, interleukin-8, and secreted phosphoprotein 1, which are associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome, is increased in tri-culture. Notably, multiple signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, and cancer metastasis are activated in BM-NSCLC through interaction with two bTME cell types. This novel platform offers a tool to elucidate potential molecular targets and for effective anti-cancer therapy targeting the crosstalk between metastatic cancer cells and adjacent components of bTME.},

  abstract     = {Tumor immunotherapy is only effective in a fraction of patients due to a low response rate and severe side effects, and these challenges of immunotherapy in clinics can be addressed through induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). ICD is elicited from many antitumor therapies to release danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and tumor-associated antigens to facilitate maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The process can reverse the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to improve the sensitivity of immunotherapy. Nanostructure-based drug delivery systems (NDDSs) are explored to induce ICD by incorporating therapeutic molecules for chemotherapy, photosensitizers (PSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal conversion agents for photothermal therapy (PTT), and radiosensitizers for radiotherapy (RT). These NDDSs can release loaded agents at a right dose in the right place at the right time, resulting in greater effectiveness and lower toxicity. Immunotherapeutic agents can also be combined with these NDDSs to achieve the synergic antitumor effect in a multi-modality therapeutic approach. In this review, NDDSs are harnessed to load multiple agents to induce ICD by chemotherapy, PDT, PTT, and RT in combination of immunotherapy to promote the therapeutic effect and reduce side effects associated with cancer treatment.},

Here, a novel ultrasensitive sensor of plasmonic metasurfaces is designed and fabricated for the detection of trace molecules. The sensor features a convex holographic grating, of which the first-order diffraction pattern of a disposable metasurface is recorded by a monochrome camera.The diffraction pattern changes with the molecules attached to the metasurface, realizing label-free and spectrometer-free molecular detection by imaging and analyzing of the diffraction pattern. By integrating the sensor with a microfluidic setup, the quantitative characterization of rabbit anti-human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and human IgG biomolecular interactions is demonstrated with an excellent limit of detection (LOD) of 0.6 p m . Moreover, both the metasurface and holographic grating are obtained through vacuum-free solution-processed fabrications, minimizing the manufacturing cost of the sensor.

However, the catalytic conversion effect on polysulfides is limited because the weak electronic interactions between the composite interfaces cannot fundamentally improve the intrinsic electronic conductivity of MoS 2 . Herein, density functional theory calculations reveal that the MoS 2 and nitrogen-doped carbon composite with an Mo–O–C bond can promote the catalytic conversion of polysulfides with a Gibbs free energy of only 0.19 eV and a low dissociation energy barrier of 0.48 eV, owing to the strong covalent coupling effect on the heterogeneous interface. Guided by theoretical calculations, a robust MoS 2 strongly coupled with a 3D carbon matrix composed of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide and carbonized melamine foam is designed and constructed as a multifunctional coating layer for lithium–sulfur batteries. As a result, excellent electrochemical performance is achieved for Li–S batteries, with a capacity of 615 mAh g –1 at 5 C, an areal capacity of 6.11 mAh cm –2 , and a low self-discharge of only 8.6% by resting for five days at 0.5 C.

  abstract     = {Pre-existing drug resistance and tumorigenicity of cancer cells are highly correlated with therapeutic failure and tumor growth. However, current cancer models are limited in their application to the study of intratumor functional heterogeneity in personalized oncology. Here, an innovative two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) model for patient-derived cancer cells (PDCCs) and air–liquid interface (ALI) organotypic culture is established from colorectal cancer (CRC). The PDCCs recapitulate the genomic landscape of their parental tumors with high efficiency, high proliferation rate, and long-term stability, while corresponding ALI organotypic cultures retain histological architecture of their original tumors. Interestingly, both 2D and 3D models maintain the transcriptomic profile of the corresponding primary tumors and display the same trend in response to 5-Fluoruracil, regardless of their difference in gene expression profiles. Furthermore, single-cell-derived clones() are efficiently established and pre-existing drug-resistant clones and highly tumorigenic clones within individual CRC tumors are identified. It is found that tumorigenic cancer cells do not necessarily possess the stem cells characteristics in gene expression. This study provides valuable platform and resource for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the pre-existing drug resistance and tumorigenicity in cancer cells, as well as for developing therapeutic targets specifically for pre-existing drug-resistant or highly tumorigenic clones.},

Herein, a novel borophene/ecoflex nanocomposite is developed as a promising triboelectric material with tailorability, durability, mechanical stability, and flexibility. The addition of borophene nanosheets enables the borophene/ecoflex nanocomposite to exhibit tunable surface triboelectricity investigated by Kelvin probe force microscopy. The borophene/ecoflex nanocomposite is further fabricated into a fabric-based triboelectric nanogenerator (B-TENG) for mechanical energy harvesting, medical assistive system, and wound healing applications. The durability of B-TENG provides consistent output performance even after severe deformation treatments, such as folding, stretching, twisting, and washing procedures. Moreover, the B-TENG is integrated into a smart keyboard configuration combined with a robotic system to perform an upper-limb medical assistive interface. Furthermore, the B-TENG is also applied as an active gait phase sensing system for instantaneous lower-limb gait phase visualization. Most importantly, the B-TENG can be regarded as a self-powered in vitro electrical stimulation device to conduct continuous wound monitoring and therapy. The as-designed B-TENG not only demonstrates great potential for multifunctional self-powered healthcare sensors, but also for the promising advancements toward wearable medical assistive and therapeutic systems.},

Low-energy synaptic operation requires both low reading current and short operation time to be applicable to large-scale neuromorphic computing systems. In this study, an energy-efficient synaptic device is implemented comprising a Ni/Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 )O 3 (PZT)/0.5 wt.% Nb-doped SrTiO 3 (Nb:STO) heterojunction with a low reading current of 10 nA and short operation time of 20–100 ns. Ultralow femtojoule operation below 9 fJ at a synaptic event, which is comparable to the energy required for synaptic events in the human brain (10 fJ), is achieved by adjusting the Schottky barrier between the top electrode and ferroelectric film. Moreover, progressive domain switching in ferroelectric PZT successfully induces both low nonlinearity/asymmetry and good stability of the weight update. The synaptic device developed here can facilitate the development of large-scale neuromorphic arrays for artificial neural networks with low energy consumption and high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as “competitors” for new separation processes. The production of high-quality gasoline is currently achieved through the total isomerization process that separates pentane and hexane isomers while not reaching the ultimate goal of a research octane number (RON) higher than 92. This work demonstrates how a synergistic action of the zeolite 5A and the MIL-160(Al) MOF leads to a novel adsorptive process for octane upgrading of gasoline through an efficient separation of isomers. This innovative mixed-bed adsorbent strategy encompasses a thermodynamically driven separation of hexane isomers according to the degree of branching by MIL-160(Al) coupled to a steric rejection of linear isomers by the molecular sieve zeolite 5A. Their adsorptive separation ability is further evaluated under real conditions by sorption breakthrough and continuous cyclic experiments with a mixed bed of shaped adsorbents. Remarkably, at the industrially relevant temperature of 423 K, an ideal sorption hierarchy of low RON over high RON alkanes is achieved, i.e., n -hexane ≫ n -pentane ≫ 2-methylpentane &gt; 3-methylpentane ⋙ 2,3-dimethylbutane &gt; isopentane ≈ 2,2-dimethylbutane, together with a productivity of 1.14 mol dm −3 and a high RON of 92, which is a leap-forward compared with existing processes.},

However, studies toward this application are still nascent, particularly in unraveling the interplay between how the perovskite composition impacts the achievable device performance and stability. Here, the role of A- and X-site modification in APbX 3 perovskites is studied to understand their influence on these factors. Through detailed experimental and simulation work, it is found that a perovskite composition consisting of cesium (Cs) and formamidinium (FA) at the A-site delivers the best device performance over a range of band gaps, which are tuned by changes to the X-site anion. Using this optimized perovskite composition, power conversion efficiencies of 15.5% and 4.1% are achieved for ST-PeSCs with average visible transmittance values between 20.7% and 52.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the CsFA-based ST-PeSCs show excellent long-term stability under continuous illumination and heating. The stability of the precursor solutions across each of the studied compositions has also been considered, showing dramatic differences in the structural properties of the perovskites and their device performance for all mixed A-site compositions possessing the archetypal methyl ammonium species, while also confirming the superior stability of the CsFA precursor solutions.},

  abstract     = {Aging is a major risk factor in microvascular dysfunction and disease development, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. As a result, age-mediated changes in the mechanical properties of tissue collagen have gained interest as drivers of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. 3D culture models that mimic age-mediated changes in the microvasculature can facilitate mechanistic understanding. A fibrillar hydrogel capable of changing its stiffness after forming microvascular networks is established. This hydrogel model is used to form vascular networks from induced pluripotent stem cells under soft conditions that mimic young tissue mechanics. Then matrix stiffness is gradually increased, thus exposing the vascular networks to the aging-mimicry process in vitro. It is found that upon dynamic matrix stiffening, EC contractility is increased, resulting in the activation of focal adhesion kinase and subsequent dissociation of β -catenin from VE-Cadherin mediated adherens junctions, leading to the abruption of the vascular networks. Inhibiting cell contractility impedes the dissociation of β -catenin, thereby preventing the deconstruction of adherens junctions, thus partially rescuing the age-mediated vascular phenotype. The findings provide the first direct evidence of matrix&#39;s dynamic mechano-changes in compromising microvasculature with aging and highlight the importance of hydrogel systems to study tissue-level changes with aging in basic and translational studies.},

However, current patient-derived models such as tumor organoids and 2D cultures lack some essential niche cell types (e.g., MDSCs) and fail to model complex tumor-immune interactions. Here, the authors present the novel acoustically assembled patient-derived cell clusters (APCCs) that can preserve original tumor/immune cell compositions, model their interactions in 3D microenvironments, and test the treatment responses of primary tumors in a rapid, scalable, and user-friendly manner. By incorporating a large array of 3D acoustic trappings within the extracellular matrix, hundreds of APCCs can be assembled within a petri dish within 2 min. Moreover, the APCCs can preserve sensitive and short-lived (≈1 to 2-day lifespan in vivo) tumor-induced MDSCs and model their dynamic suppression of T cell tumor toxicity for up to 24 h. Finally, using the APCCs, the authors succesully model the combinational therapeutic effect of a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting MDSCs (cabozantinib) and an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab). The novel APCCs may hold promising potential in predicting treatment response for personalized cancer adjuvant therapy as well as screening novel cancer immunotherapy and combinational therapy.},

  abstract     = {Fast snapping in the carnivorous Venus flytrap ( Dionaea muscipula ) involves trap lobe bending and abrupt curvature inversion (snap-buckling), but how do these traps reopen? Here, the trap reopening mechanics in two different D. muscipula clones, producing normal-sized (N traps, max. ≈3 cm in length) and large traps (L traps, max. ≈4.5 cm in length) are investigated. Time-lapse experiments reveal that both N and L traps can reopen by smooth and continuous outward lobe bending, but only L traps can undergo smooth bending followed by a much faster snap-through of the lobes. Additionally, L traps can reopen asynchronously, with one of the lobes moving before the other. This study challenges the current consensus on trap reopening, which describes it as a slow, smooth process driven by hydraulics and cell growth and/or expansion. Based on the results gained via three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC), morphological and mechanical investigations, the differences in trap reopening are proposed to stem from a combination of size and slenderness of individual traps. This study elucidates trap reopening processes in the (in)famous Dionaea snap traps – unique shape-shifting structures of great interest for plant biomechanics, functional morphology, and applications in biomimetics, i.e., soft robotics.},

  abstract     = {Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered the most promising battery technology in the post-lithium era due to the abundant sodium reserves. In the past two decades, exploring new electrolytes for SIBs has generally relied on the “solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)” theory to optimize the electrolyte components. However, many observed phenomena cannot be fully explained by the SEI theory. Therefore, electrolyte solvation structure and electrode–electrolyte interface behavior have recently received tremendous research interest to explain the improved performance. Considering there is currently no review paper focusing on the solvation structure of electrolytes in SIBs, a systematic survey on SIBs is provided, in which the specific solvation structure design guidelines and their consequent impact on the electrochemical performance are elucidated. The key driving force of solvation structure formation, and the recent advances in adjusting SIB solvation structures are discussed in detail. It is believed that this review can provide new insights into the electrolyte optimization strategies of high-performance SIBs and even other emerging battery systems.},

  abstract     = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are reported to play essential roles in chemoresistance and metastasis. Pathways regulating CSC self-renewal and proliferation, such as Hedgehog, Notch, Wnt/ β -catenin, TGF- β , and Myc, may be potential therapeutic targets. Here, a functional screening from the focused library with 365 compounds is performed by a step-by-step strategy. Among these candidate molecules, phenyl-2-pyrimidinyl ketone 4-allyl-3-amino selenourea (CU27) is chosen for further identification because it proves to be the most effective compound over others on CSC inhibition. Through ingenuity pathway analysis, it is shown CU27 may inhibit CSC through a well-known stemness-related transcription factor c-Myc. Gene set enrichment analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, expression levels of typical c-Myc targets, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance, immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation are conducted. These results together suggest CU27 binds c-Myc bHLH/LZ domains, inhibits c-Myc-Max complex formation, and prevents its occupancy on target gene promoters. In mouse models, CU27 significantly sensitizes sorafenib-resistant tumor to sorafenib, reduces the primary tumor size, and inhibits CSC generation, showing a dramatic anti-metastasis potential. Taken together, CU27 exerts inhibitory effects on CSC and CSC-associated traits in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via c-Myc transcription activity inhibition. CU27 may be a promising therapeutic to treat sorafenib-resistant HCC.},

Herein, a novel MXene-incorporated hollow fibrous (MX-HF) scaffold with dynamically responsive channels is presented for promoting vascularization and skin flap regeneration by using a microfluidic-assisted 3D printing strategy. Benefiting from the photothermal conversion capacity of the MXene nanosheets and temperature-responsive ability of poly(NIPAM) hydrogels in the MX-HF scaffolds, they display a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive shrinkage/swelling behavior, which facilitates the cell penetration into the scaffold channels from the surrounding environment. Moreover, by incorporating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into the hydrogel matrix for controllable delivery, the MX-HF scaffolds can achieve promoted proliferation, migration, and proangiogenic effects of endothelial cells under NIR irradiation. It is further demonstrated in vivo that the NIR-responsive VEGF@MX-HF scaffolds can effectively improve skin flap survival by promoting angiogenesis, decreasing inflammation, and attenuating apoptosis in skin flaps. Thus, it is believed that such responsive MX-HF scaffolds are promising candidates for clinical random skin flap regeneration as well as other diverse tissue engineering applications.},

However, a significant augment of their immunomodulatory capability is an essential need to achieve clinically meaningful treatment outcomes. Light-activatable silencing NK-derived exosomes (LASNEO) are orchestrated by engineering the NEO with hydrophilic small interfering RNA (siRNA) and hydrophobic photosensitizer Ce6. Profiling of genes involved in apoptosis pathway with Western blot and RNA-seq in cells receiving NEO treatment reveals that NEO elicits effective NK cell-like cytotoxicity toward tumor cells. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon laser irradiation not only triggers substantial photodynamic therapy effect but also boosts M1 tumor-associated macrophages polarization and DC maturation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In addition, ROS also accelerates the cellular entry and endosomal escape of siRNA in TME. Finally, siRNAs targeting PLK1 or PD-L1 induce robust gene silencing in cancer cells, and downregulation of PD-L1 restores the immunological surveillance of T cells in TME. Therefore, the proposed LASNEO exhibit excellent antitumor effects by conscripting multiple types of immune cells. Considering that its manufacture is quite simple and controllable, LASNEO show compelling potential for clinical translational application.},

  abstract     = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful sensing technique. However, the employment of SERS sensors in practical applications is hindered by high fabrication costs from processes with limited scalability, poor batch-to-batch reproducibility, substrate stability, and uniformity. Here, highly scalable and reproducible flame aerosol technology is employed to rapidly self-assemble uniform SERS sensing films. Plasmonic Ag nanoparticles are deposited on substrates as nanoaggregates with fine control of their interparticle distance. The interparticle distance is tuned by adding a dielectric spacer during nanoparticle synthesis that separates the individual Ag nanoparticles within each nanoaggregate. The dielectric spacer thickness dictates the plasmonic coupling extinction of the deposited nanoaggregates and finely tunes the Raman hotspots. By systematically studying the optical and morphological properties of the developed SERS surfaces, structure–performance relationships are established and the optimal hot-spots occur for interparticle distance of 1 to 1.5 nm among the individual Ag nanoparticles, as also validated by computational modeling, are identified for the highest signal enhancement of a molecular Raman reporter. Finally, the superior stability and batch-to-batch reproducibility of the developed SERS sensors are demonstrated and their potential with a proof-of-concept practical application in food-safety diagnostics for pesticide detection on fruit surfaces is explored.},

Understanding the fundamental processes behind the cellular self-organization in NE organoids holds the key to the engineering of organoids with higher, more in vivo-like complexity. However, little is known about the cellular regulation driving the NE development, especially in the presence of interfacial cues from the microenvironment. Here a simple 3D culture system that allows generation and manipulation of NE organoids from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), displaying developmental phases of hiPSC differentiation and self-aggregation, first into NE cysts with lumen structure and then toward NE organoids with floor-plate patterning, is established. Longitudinal inhibition reveals distinct and dynamic roles of actomyosin contractility and yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling in governing these phases. By growing NE organoids on culture chips containing anisotropic surfaces or confining microniches, it is further demonstrated that interfacial cues can sensitively exert dimension-dependent influence on luminal cyst and organoid morphology, successful floor-plate patterning, as well as cytoskeletal regulation and YAP activity. This study therefore sheds new light on how organoid and tissue architecture can be steered through intracellular and extracellular means.},

This metadevice is constructed by the coding thermoelectric elements with the properly designed phase arrangement, and the incident microwave energy can be redirected to the nonthreatening directions for specular reflection reduction. The dynamic IR camouflage with low IR reflection is realized by using the thermoelectric cooling and heating effect and high-IR-absorptivity surface. The above three functionalities are demonstrated by experimental measurement. The 10 dB scattering reduction can be realized at the microwave band of 10–16.1 GHz. In the IR region, the designed metadevice can not only dynamically modulate the surface temperature for matching different background temperatures, but also realize the pixel temperature control for adapting to a spatially varying thermal background. In addition, it reflects almost no surrounding thermal signals compared with the traditional low-emissivity IR stealth material.

  abstract     = {Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, e.g., MoS 2 , typically have high intrinsic strength and Young&#39;s modulus, but low fracture toughness. Under high stress, brittle fracture occurs followed by cleavage along a preferential lattice direction, leading to catastrophic failure. Defects have been reported to modulate the fracture behavior, but pertinent atomic mechanism still remains elusive. Here, sulfur (S) and MoS n point defects are selectively created in monolayer MoS 2 using helium- and gallium-ion-beam lithography, both of which reduce the stiffness of the monolayer, but enhance its fracture toughness. By monitoring the atomic structure of the cracks before and after the loading fracture, distinct atomic structures of the cracks and fracture behaviors are found in the two types of defect-containing monolayer MoS 2 . Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, the key role of individual S and MoS n point defects is identified in the fracture process and the origin of the enhanced fracture toughness is elucidated. It is a synergistic effect of defect-induced deflection and bifurcation of cracks that enhance the energy release rate, and the formation of widen crack tip when fusing with point defects that prevents the crack propagation. The findings of this study provide insights into defect engineering and flexible device applications of monolayer MoS 2 .},

  abstract     = {Growing an In x Ga 1− x N/GaN (InGaN/GaN) multi-quantum well (MQW) heterostructure in nanowire (NW) form is expected to overcome limitations inherent in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on the conventional planar heterostructure. The epitaxial strain induced in InGaN/GaN MQW heterostructure can be relaxed through the sidewalls of NW, which is beneficial to LEDs because a much larger misfit strain with higher indium concentration can be accommodated with reduced piezoelectric polarization fields. The strain relaxation, however, renders highly complex strain distribution within the NW heterostructure. Here the authors show that complementary strain mapping using scanning transmission electron microscopy and dark-field inline holography can comprehend the strain distribution within the axial In 0.3 Ga 0.7 N/GaN MQW heterostructure embedded in GaN NW by providing the strain maps which can cover the entire NW and fine details near the sidewalls. With the quantitative evaluation by 3D finite element modelling, it is confirmed that the observed complex strain distribution is induced by the strain relaxation leading to the strain partitioning between InGaN quantum disk, GaN quantum well, and the surrounding epitaxial GaN shell. The authors further show that the strain maps provide the strain tensor components which are crucial for accurate assessment of the strain-induced piezoelectric fields in NW LEDs.},

Hexagonal pyramidal nanostructures consisting of six semipolar { 1 1 ¯ 01 } $\{ {1\bar{1}01} \}$ planes and one (000 1 ¯ $\bar{1}$ ) plane with the apex pointing to the [0001] direction are generated as a sublimation-induced equilibrium crystal structure, which is consistent with the lattice-asymmetry-driven growth behaviors in wurtzite GaN.

The conductive macromolecular poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is subsequently integrated into the one-dimensional (1D) channel arrays of Metal-Salen COF EDA to form heterostructure PEDOT@Metal-Salen COF EDA via the in situ solid-state polymerization method. Among the Metal-Salen COF EDA and PEDOT@Metal-Salen COF EDA complexes, the optimized PEDOT@Mn-Salen COF EDA displays prominent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 150 mV and a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec −1 . The experimental results and density of states data show that the continuous energy band structure modulation in Metal-Salen COF EDA has the ability to make the metal d -orbital interact better with the s -orbital of H, which is conducive to electron transport in the HER process. Moreover, the calculated charge density difference indicates that the heterostructures composed of PEDOT and Metal-Salen COF EDA induce an intramolecular charge transfer and construct highly active interfacial sites.},

It is urgent to develop a platform to assess T cell response for neoantigen screening. Here, immunogenic potential of neoantigen-peptides of tumor tissues and matched organoids ( n = 27 pairs) are analyzed by Score tools with whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class-I algorithms. The comparisons between 9203 predicted neoantigen-peptides from 2449 mutations of tumor tissues and 9991 ones from 2637 mutations of matched organoids demonstrate that organoids preserved majority of genetic features, HLA alleles, and similar neoantigen landscape of original tumors. Higher neoantigen load is observed in tumors with early stage. Multiomics analysis combining WGS, RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, mass spectrometry filters out 93 candidate neoantigen-peptides with strong immunogenic potential for functional validation in five organoids. Immunogenic peptides are defined by inducing increased CD107aCD137IFN- γ expressions and IFN- γ secretion of CD8 cells in flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays. Nine immunogenic peptides shared by at least two individuals are validated, including peptide from TP53 R90S . Organoid killing assay confirms the antitumor activity of validated immunogenic peptide-reactive CD8 cells, which is further enhanced in the presence of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The study characterizes HLA-class-I neoantigen landscape in hepatobiliary tumor, providing practical strategy with tumor organoid model for neoantigen-peptide identification in personalized immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {3D printing has revolutionized the manufacturing of volumetric components and structures in many areas. Several fully volumetric light-based techniques have been recently developed thanks to the advent of photocurable resins, promising to reach unprecedented short print time (down to a few tens of seconds) while keeping a good resolution (around 100 μm). However, these new approaches only work with homogeneous and relatively transparent resins so that the light patterns used for photo-polymerization are not scrambled along their propagation. Herein, a method that takes into account light scattering in the resin prior to computing projection patterns is proposed. Using a tomographic volumetric printer, it is experimentally demonstrated that implementation of this correction is critical when printing objects whose size exceeds the scattering mean free path. To show the broad applicability of the technique, functional objects of high print fidelity are fabricated in hard organic scattering acrylates and soft cell-laden hydrogels (at 4 million cells mL −1 ). This opens up promising perspectives in printing inside turbid materials with particular interesting applications for bioprinting cell-laden constructs.},

Recent studies have shown lncRNAs play pivotal roles in regulating GC chemoresistance. Nanocarriers delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence cancer-related genes has become a novel approach to cancer treatment research. However, finding target genes and developing nanosystems capable of selectively delivering siRNAs for disease treatment remains a challenge. In this study, a novel lncRNA TMEM44-AS1 that is related to 5-FU resistance is identified. TMEM44-AS1 has the ability to bind to and sponge miR-2355-5p, resulting in the upregulated PPP1R13L expression and P53 pathway inhibition. Next, a new nanocarrier called chitosan-gelatin-EGCG (CGE) is developed, which has a higher gene silencing efficiency than lipo2000, to aid in the delivery of a si-TMEM44-AS1 can efficiently silence TMEM44-AS1 expression to synergistically reverse 5-FU resistance in GC, leading to a markedly enhanced 5-FU therapeutic effect in a xenograft mouse model of GC. These findings indicate that TMEM44-AS1 may estimate 5-FU therapy outcome among GC cases, and that systemic si-TMEM44-AS1 delivery combined with 5-FU therapy is significant in the treatment of patients with recurrent GC.},

  abstract     = {AURKA is a potential kinase target in various malignancies. The kinase-independent oncogenic functions partially disclose the inadequate efficacy of the kinase inhibitor in a Phase III clinical trial. Simultaneously targeting the catalytic and noncatalytic functions of AURKA may be a feasible approach. Here, a set of AURKA proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are developed. The CRBN-based dAurA383 preferentially degrades the highly abundant mitotic AURKA, while cIAP-based dAurA450 degrades the lowly abundant interphase AURKA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The proteomic and transcriptomic analyses indicate that dAurA383 triggers the “mitotic cell cycle” and “stem cell” processes, while dAurA450 inhibits the “MYC/E2F targets” and “stem cell” processes. dAurA383 and dAurA450 are combined as a PROTAC cocktail. The cocktail effectively degrades AURKA, relieves the hook effect, and synergistically inhibits AML stem cells. Furthermore, the PROTAC cocktail induces AML regression in a xenograft mouse model and primary patient blasts. These findings establish the PROTAC cocktail as a promising spatial-temporal drug administration strategy to sequentially eliminate the multifaceted functions of oncoproteins, relieve the hook effect, and prevent cancer stem cell-mediated drug resistance.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) play critical roles in the innate immunity against infectious diseases and are required to link pathogen DNA sensing to immune responses. However, the mechanisms by which cGAS-STING-induced cytokines suppress the adaptive immune response against malaria infections remain poorly understood. Here, cGAS-STING signaling is identified to play a detrimental role in regulating anti-malaria immunity. cGAS or STING deficiency in mice markedly prolongs mouse survival during lethal malaria Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis N67C infections by reducing late interleukin (IL)-6 production. Mechanistically, cGAS/STING recruits myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and specifically induces the p38-dependent signaling pathway for late IL-6 production, which, in turn, expands CD11b + Ly6C hi proinflammatory monocytes to inhibit immunity. Moreover, the blockage or ablation of the cGAS-STING-MyD88-p38-IL-6 signaling axis or the depletion of CD11b + Ly6C hi proinflammatory monocytes provides mice a significant survival benefit during N67C and other lethal malaria-strain infections. Taken together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized detrimental role of cGAS-STING-MyD88-p38 axis in infectious diseases through triggering the late IL-6 production and proinflammatory monocyte expansion and provide insight into how targeting the DNA sensing pathway, dysregulated cytokines, and proinflammatory monocytes enhances immunity against infection.},

  abstract     = {Peripheral nerve injury is a challenging orthopedic condition that can be treated by autograft transplantation, a gold standard treatment in the current clinical setting. Nevertheless, limited availability of autografts and potential morbidities in donors hampers its widespread application. Bioactive scaffold-based tissue engineering is a promising strategy to promote nerve regeneration. Additionally, magnesium (Mg) ions enhance nerve regeneration; however, an effectively controlled delivery vehicle is necessary to optimize their in vivo therapeutic effects. Herein, a bisphosphonate-based injectable hydrogel exhibiting sustained Mg 2+ delivery for peripheral nerve regeneration is developed. It is observed that Mg 2+ promoted neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and Sema5b. Moreover, implantation of polycaprolactone (PCL) conduits filled with Mg 2+ -releasing hydrogel in 10 mm nerve defects in rats significantly enhanced axon regeneration and remyelination at 12 weeks post-operation compared to the controls (blank conduits or conduits filled with Mg 2+ -absent hydrogel). Functional recovery analysis reveals enhanced reinnervation in the animals treated with the Mg 2+ -releasing hydrogel compared to that in the control groups. In summary, the Mg 2+ -releasing hydrogel combined with the 3D-engineered PCL conduit promotes peripheral nerve regeneration and functional recovery. Thus, a new strategy to facilitate the repair of challenging peripheral nerve injuries is proposed.},

However, the inevitable dissipation of ultraviolet and near-infrared into waste heat results in inefficient solar utilization. Herein, a dual-band selective solar harvesting (SSH) window is developed to realize full-spectrum utilization. A transparent photovoltaic, converting ultraviolet into electricity, and a transparent solar absorber, converting near-infrared into thermal energy, are integrated and coupled with a ventilation system to extract heat for indoor use. Compared with common transparent photovoltaics, the SSH window increases solar harvesting efficiency up to threefold while maintaining a considerable visible transmittance. Simulations suggest that the SSH window, besides generating electricity, delivers energy savings by over 30% higher than common smart windows. This is the first integration of transparent photovoltaic and transparent solar absorber into a window, which may open up a new avenue for the development of energy-efficient buildings.},

In addition, the more localized valence band (VB) and the regulation of carrier effective mass and band decomposed charge density, as well as the improved conductivity by 1–2 orders of magnitude facilitate the charge transfer and separation.

However, Li–S cells with practically high energy still suffer from a very limited cycle life with reasons which remain unclear. Here, through cell study under practical conditions, it is proved that an internal short circuit (ISC) is a root cause of early cell failure and is ascribed to the crosstalk between the S cathode and Li anode. The cathode topography affects S reactions through influencing the local resistance and electrolyte distribution, particularly under lean electrolyte conditions. The inhomogeneous reactions of S cathodes are easily mirrored by the Li anodes, resulting in exaggerated localized Li plating/stripping, Li filament formation, and eventually cell ISC. Manipulating cathode topography is proven effective to extend the cell cycle life under practical conditions. The findings of this work shed new light on the electrode design for extending cycle life of high-energy Li–S cells, which are also applicable for other rechargeable Li or metal batteries.},

Furthermore, structure–performance relationships are realized under the LNG–ANG condition using a machine learning method. Additional molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of the structural changes during temperature and pressure swings, further narrowing down the materials, and two synthetic targets are identified.

To achieve controllable and gradual switching of multi-level conductance, important for neuromorphic computing, a theoretical design of a superlattice-like (SLL) structure switching layer for the multi-level memristor is proposed and validated, refining the growth of conductive filaments (CFs) and preventing CFs from the abrupt formation and rupture. Ti/(HfO x /AlO y ) SLL /TiN memristors are shown with transmission electron microscopy , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , and ab initio calculation findings corroborate the SLL structure of HfO x /AlO y film. The optimized SLL memristor achieves outstanding conductance modulation performance with linearly synaptic weight update (nonlinear factor α = 1.06), and the convolutional neural network based on the SLL memristive synapse improves the handwritten digit recognition accuracy to 94.95%. Meanwhile, this improved synaptic device has a fast operating speed (30 ns), a long data retention time (≥ 10 4 s at 85 ℃), scalability, and CMOS process compatibility. Finally, its physical nature is explored and the CF evolution process is characterized using nudged elastic band calculations and the conduction mechanism fitting.

  abstract     = {The perivascular niche (PVN) is a glioblastoma tumor microenvironment (TME) that serves as a safe haven for glioma stem cells (GSCs), and acts as a reservoir that inevitably leads to tumor recurrence. Understanding cellular interactions in the PVN that drive GSC treatment resistance and stemness is crucial to develop lasting therapies for glioblastoma. The limitations of in vivo models and in vitro assays have led to critical knowledge gaps regarding the influence of various cell types in the PVN on GSCs behavior. This study developed an organotypic triculture microfluidic model as a means to recapitulate the PVN and study its impact on GSCs. This triculture platform, comprised of endothelial cells (ECs), astrocytes, and GSCs, is used to investigate GSC invasion, proliferation and stemness. Both ECs and astrocytes significantly increased invasiveness of GSCs. This study futher identified 15 ligand-receptor pairs using single-cell RNAseq with putative chemotactic mechanisms of GSCs, where the receptor is up-regulated in GSCs and the diffusible ligand is expressed in either astrocytes or ECs. Notably, the ligand–receptor pair SAA1-FPR1 is demonstrated to be involved in chemotactic invasion of GSCs toward PVN. The novel triculture platform presented herein can be used for therapeutic development and discovery of molecular mechanisms driving GSC biology.},

However, side reactions and Zn dendrite generation during cycling limit their practical application. Herein, ammonium acetate (CH 3 COONH 4 ) is selected as a trifunctional electrolyte additive to enhance the electrochemical performance of AZIBs. Research findings show that NH 4 + (oxygen ligand) and CH 3 COO – (hydrogenligand) with preferential adsorption on the Zn electrode surface can not only hinder Zn anode directly contact with active H 2 O, but also regulate the pH value of the electrolyte, thus suppressing the parasitic reactions. Additionally, the formed SEI is mainly consisted of Zn 5 (CO 3 ) 2 (OH) 6 with a high Zn 2+ transference number, which could achieve a dendrite-free Zn anode by homogenizing Zn deposition. Consequently, the Zn||Zn symmetric batteries with CH 3 COONH 4 -based electrolyte can operate steadily at an ultrahigh current density of 40 mA cm –2 with a cumulative capacity of 6880 mAh cm –2 , especially stable cycling at −10 °C. The assembled Zn||MnO 2 full cell and Zn||activated carbon capacitor also deliver prominent electrochemical reversibility.

However, there is a lack of clear catalytic mechanism to guide the design of efficient catalysts. In this work, the essential role of nanosized catalyst (Ni 3 Fe/rGO) in activating micro-sized Mg with ultra-rapid hydrolysis process is investigated for the first time. Here, an unprecedented content of 0.2 wt% Ni 3 Fe/rGO added Mg can release 812.4 mL g −1 hydrogen in just 60 s at 30 °C. Notably, an impressive performance with a hydrogen yield of 826.4 mL g −1 at 0 °C in only 30 s is achieved by the Mg-2 wt% Ni 3 Fe/rGO, extending the temperature range for practical applications of hydrolysis. Moreover, the four catalysts (Ni 3 Fe/rGO, Ni 3 Fe, Ni/rGO, Fe/rGO) are designed to reveal the influence of composition, particle size, and dispersion on catalytic behavior. Theoretical studies corroborate that the addition of Ni 3 Fe/rGO accelerates the electron transfer and coupling processes and further provides a lower energy barrier diffusion path for hydrogen. Thus, a mechanism concerning the catalyst as migration relay is proposed. This work offers guidelines designing high-performance catalysts especially for activating the hydrolysis of micro-sized light weight metals.},

However, the application of MFs is impeded by their poor electronic/ionic conductivity and severe decomposition of electrolyte. Here, a composite cathode of FeF 2 and polymer-derived carbon (FeF 2 @PDC) with excellent cycling performance is reported. The composite cathode is composed of nanorod-shaped FeF 2 embedded in PDC matrix with excellent mechanical strength and electronic/ionic conductivity. The FeF 2 @PDC enables a reversible capacity of 500 mAh g –1 with a record long cycle lifetime of 1900 cycles. Remarkably, the FeF 2 @PDC can be cycled at a record rate of 60 C with a reversible capacity of 107 mAh g –1 after 500 cycles. Advanced electron microscopy reveals that the in situ formation of stable Fe 3 O 4 layers on the surface of FeF 2 prevents the electrolyte decomposition and leaching of iron (Fe), thus enhancing the cyclability.

  abstract     = {Bile acid-modified nanoparticles provide a convenient strategy to improve oral bioavailability of poorly permeable drugs by exploiting specific interactions with bile acid transporters. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown, especially considering the different absorption sites of free bile acids (ileum) and digested fat molecules from bile acid-emulsified fat droplets (duodenum). Here, glycocholic acid (GCA)-conjugated polystyrene nanoparticles (GCPNs) are synthesized and their transport in Caco-2 cell models is studied. GCA conjugation enhances the uptake by interactions with apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). A new pathway correlated with both ASBT and chylomicron pathways is identified. Meanwhile, the higher uptake of GCPNs does not lead to higher transcytosis to the same degree compared with unmodified nanoparticles (CPNs). The pharmacological and genomics study confirm that GCA conjugation changes the endocytosis mechanisms and downregulates the cellular response to the transport at gene levels, which works as a negative feedback loop and explains the higher cellular retention of GCPNs. These findings offer a solid foundation in the bile acid-based nanomedicine design, with utilizing advantages of the ASBT-mediated uptake, as well as inspiration to take comprehensive consideration of the cellular response with more developed technologies.},

Cytosolic Ca 2+ elevation plays a crucial role in ABA-induced stomatal closure during drought stress; however, to what extent the Ca 2+ movement across the plasma membrane from the apoplast to the cytosol contributes to this process still needs clarification. Here the authors identify (−)-catechin gallate (CG) and (−)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), components of green tea, as inhibitors of voltage-dependent K + channels which regulate K + fluxes in Arabidopsis thaliana guard cells. In Arabidopsis guard cells CG/GCG prevent ABA-induced: i) membrane depolarization; ii) activation of Ca 2+ permeable cation ( I Ca ) channels; and iii) cytosolic Ca 2+ transients. In whole Arabidopsis plants co-treatment with CG/GCG and ABA suppressed ABA-induced stomatal closure and surface temperature increase. Similar to ABA, CG/GCG inhibited stomatal closure is elicited by the elicitor peptide, flg22 but has no impact on dark-induced stomatal closure or light- and fusicoccin-induced stomatal opening, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of CG/GCG is associated with Ca 2+ -related signaling pathways. This study further supports the crucial role of I Ca channels of the plasma membrane in ABA-induced stomatal closure. Moreover, CG and GCG represent a new tool for the study of abiotic or biotic stress-induced signal transduction pathways.},

Here, the electronic transport on directly grown high-quality graphene/Mo 2 C vertical heterostructures with clean and sharp interface is comprehensively investigated. Owing to the strong interface coupling, the graphene layer feels an effective confinement potential well imposed by two-dimensional (2D) Mo 2 C crystal. Employing cross junction device geometry, a series of resonance-like magnetoresistance peaks are observed at low temperatures. The temperature and gate voltage dependences of the observed resonance peaks give evidence for geometric resonance of electron cyclotron orbits with the formed potential well. Moreover, it is found that both the amplitude of resonance peaks and conductance fluctuation exhibit different temperature-dependent behaviors below the superconducting transition temperature of 2D Mo 2 C, indicating the correlation of quantum fluctuations and superconductivity. This study offers a promising route toward integrating graphene with 2D superconducting materials, and establishes a new way to investigate the interplay of massless Dirac fermion and superconductivity based on graphene/2D superconductor vertical heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {van der Waals heterostructures based on graphene and hBN layers with different stacking modes are receiving considerable attention because of their potential application in fundamental physics. However, conventional exfoliation fabrication methods and layer-by-layer transfer techniques have various limitations. The CVD synthesis of high-quality large-area graphene and hBN multilayer heterostructures is essential for the advancement of new physics. Herein, the authors propose an in situ CVD growth strategy for synthesizing wafer-scale AAB-stacked single-crystal graphene/hBN/graphene trilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Single-crystal CuNi(111) alloys are prepared on sapphire, followed by the pre-dissolution of carbon atoms. Single-crystal monolayer hBN is synthesized on a plasma-cleaned CuNi(111) surface. Then, a single-crystal monolayer graphene is epitaxially grown onto the hBN surface to form graphene/hBN bilayer heterostructures. A controlled decrease in the growth temperature allows the carbon atoms to precipitate out of the CuNi(111) alloy to form single-crystal graphene at the interface between hBN and CuNi(111), thereby producing graphene/hBN/graphene trilayer van der Waals heterostructures. The stacking modes between as-grown 2D layers are investigated through Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This study provides an in situ CVD approach to directly synthesize large-scale single-crystal low-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures and facilitates their application in future 2D-material-based integrated circuits.},

However, to date, approved drugs targeting TNF- α are restricted to biological macromolecules, largely due to the difficulties in using small molecules for pharmaceutical intervention of protein–protein interactions. Herein the power of a natural product-enriched DNA-encoded library ( n DEL) is exploited to identify small molecules that interfere with the protein–protein interaction between TNF- α and the cognate receptor. Initially, to select molecules capable of binding to TNF- α , “late-stage” DNA modification method is applied to construct an n DEL library consisted of 400 sterically diverse natural products and pharmaceutically active chemicals. Several natural products, including kaempferol, identified not only show direct interaction with TNF- α , but also lead to the blockage of TNF- α /TNFR1 interaction. Significantly, kaempferol attenuates the TNF- α signaling in cells and reduces the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateinduced ear inflammation in mice. Structure-activity-relationship analyses demonstrate the importance of substitution groups at C-3, C-7, and C-4&#39; of kaempferol. The n DEL hit, kaempferol, represents a novel chemical scaffold capable of specifically recognizing TNF- α and blocking its signal transduction, a promising starting point for the development of a small molecule TNF- α inhibitor for use in the clinical setting.},

To improve this situation, herein a novel biohybrid scaffold is proposed by integrating the advantages of anisotropic fish scales and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for skin flap regeneration. The fish scale scaffold is obtained through its decellularization and decalcification processes, which reserved intact collagen, glycosaminoglycan, and other endogenous growth factors for MSCs and human vascular endothelial cells proliferation. As the scaffold maintains intrinsic anisotropic structures on both surfaces, the proliferative cells can be elongated along the aligned structures on the fish scale, which endow them the capacity to differentiate into multiple directions. Based on these features, it is demonstrated from an in vivo experiment that the MSCs-loading fish scale scaffolds can effectively convert the activated inflammatory macrophages into anti-inflammatory properties, reduce the inflammation around the flap, and improve the survival rate. These results indicate that the MSCs-loading fish scale scaffold is suitable and has the potential for skin flap regeneration and functional recovery.},

However, owing to the multiple electroactive centers of HEOs, the Li + storage mechanism is complex and debated in the literature. In this work, operando quick-scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used to study the lithiation/delithiation mechanism of the Cobalt-free spinel (CrMnFeNiCu) 3 O 4 HEO. A monochromator oscillation frequency of 2 Hz is used and 240 spectra are integrated to achieve a 2 min time resolution. High-photon-flux synchrotron radiation is employed to increase the XAS sensitivity. The results indicate that the Cu 2+ and Ni 2+ cations are reduced to their metallic states during lithiation but their oxidation reactions are less favorable compared to the other elements upon delithiation. The Mn 2+/3+ and Fe 2+/3+ cations undergo two-step conversion reactions to form metallic phases, with MnO and FeO as the intermediate species, respectively. During delithiation, the oxidation of Mn occurs prior to that of Fe. The Cr 3+ cations are reduced to CrO and then Cr 0 during lithiation. A relatively large overpotential is required to activate the Cr reoxidation reaction. The Cr 3+ cations are found after delithiation. These results can guide the material design of HEOs for improving LIB performance.},

  abstract     = {The overall effectiveness of nonlinear optical processes along extended nonlinear media highly depends on the fulfillment of the phase-matching condition for pump and generated fields. This is traditionally accomplished by exploiting the birefringence of nonlinear crystals requiring long interaction lengths (cm-scale). For nonbirefringent media and integrated photonic devices, modal phase matching can compensate the index mismatch. Here, the various interacting waves propagate in transverse modes with appropriate phase velocities, but they suffer from a low refractive index contrast and cm-scale interaction lengths. This work harnesses modal phase matching for third-harmonic generation (THG) in plasmonic waveguides using an organic polymer (poly[3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl]) as the nonlinear medium. One demonstrates experimentally an effective interaction area as small as ≈ 0.11 µm 2 and the phase-matched modal dispersion results in THG efficiency as high as ≈ 10 –3 W -2 within an effective length scale of ≈ 4.3 µm. THG also shows a strong correlation with the polarization of the incident laser beam, corresponding to the excitation of the antisymmetric plasmonic modes, corroborating that plasmonic modal phase matching is achieved. This large reduction in device area of orders of magnitude is interesting for various applications where space is critical (e.g., device integration or on-chip applications).},

Herein, a facile and eco-friendly CF 4 plasma treatment is employed for the surface modification of Li anodes, and an artificial layer consisting of LiF and Li 2 C 2 is fabricated for the first time. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the high adsorption energy of LiF and low Li + diffusion barriers in Li 2 C 2 induce uniform nucleation and planar growth of Li, guaranteeing a stable and dendrite-free Li structure during the repeated plating/stripping process of cycling.

By leveraging the resonant frequency changes of the humidity sensor and output voltage waveforms of the triboelectric sensor, the proposed interaction interface is successfully demonstrated as a game control interface to manipulate a car in virtual reality (VR) space and a password input interface to enter high-security 3D passwords, indicating its great potential in diversified applications in the future Metaverse.},

  abstract     = {Lack of adequate effector T cells infiltrated in tumor is one of the main problems in the failure of immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induced acute inflammation can sensitize tumors and activate T cells, thus assisting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) against tumor growth and metastasis. T cells maturation and activation lag 3 to 7 days behind PDT. However, such timing in the combination therapy of ICI and PDT is commonly ignored in designing numerous multi-functional integrated nanomedicines. Herein, the authors illustrate that intervention timing of ICI after PDT affects the anti-tumor efficacy. A tumor-targeting nanomedicine is prepared by encapsulating indocyanine green into CD44 specifically binding material, a hyaluronic acid conjugated lipid poly(ethylene glycol). The PDT nanomedicine is designed to induce a robust immune response in tumor. The optimal group (Combo-STAR), ICI gave 5 days after PDT, significantly suppresses local tumor growth and eliminates metastasis. What should be highlighted is the time point of administration because if ICI is given too early, T cells are immature, otherwise, T cells are exhausted if ICI is given too late. This work presents theoretical guidance for raising awareness of intervention timing when augmenting ICBT with immune response inducers in clinic.},

  abstract     = {Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Inflammatory signaling pathways promote T-cell activation and are involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS1 ) is a critical negative regulator for several inflammatory cytokines. However, its regulatory role in T-cell activation and GVHD has not been elucidated. Multiomics analysis of the transcriptome and chromatin structure of granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factor (G-CSF)-administered hyporesponsive T cells from healthy donors reveal that G-CSF upregulates SOCS1 by reorganizing the chromatin structure around the SOCS1 locus. Parallel in vitro and in vivo analyses demonstrate that SOCS1 is critical for restraining T cell activation. Loss of Socs1 in T cells exacerbates GVHD pathogenesis and diminishes the protective role of G-CSF in GVHD mouse models. Further analysis shows that SOCS1 inhibits T cell activation not only by inhibiting the colony-stimulating-factor 3 receptor (CSF3R)/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2 ) /signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3 ) pathway, but also by restraining activation of the inflammasome signaling pathway. Moreover, high expression of SOCS1 in T cells from patients correlates with low acute GVHD occurrence after HSCT. Overall, these findings identify that SOCS1 is critical for inhibiting T cell activation and represents a potential target for the attenuation of GVHD.},

However, the electroluminescence performance of green InP QDs is still inferior to their red counterparts, due to the higher density of surface defects and the wider particle size distribution. Here, a quasi-shell-growth strategy for the growth of highly luminescent green InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs is reported, in which the zinc and selenium monomers are added at the initial nucleation of InP stage to adsorb on the surface of InP cores that create a quasi-ZnSe shell rather than a bulk ZnSe shell. The quasi-ZnSe shell reduces the surface defects of InP core by passivating In-terminated vacancies, and suppresses the Ostwald ripening of InP core at high temperatures, leading to a photoluminescence quantum yield of 91% with a narrow emission linewidth of 36 nm for the synthesized InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs. Consequently, the light-emitting diodes based on the green QDs realize a maximum luminance of 15606 cd m −2 , a peak external quantum efficiency of 10.6%, and a long half lifetime of &gt; 5000 h.},

Here, the spin-to-charge conversion (SCC) characteristics of epitaxial Bi 1− x Sb x films is investigated across the topological phase transition by spintronic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. An unexpected, intense spintronic THz emission is observed in the topologically nontrivial semimetal Bi 1− x Sb x films, significantly greater than that of Pt and Bi 2 Se 3 , which indicates the potential of Bi 1− x Sb x for spintronic applications. More importantly, the topological surface state (TSS) is observed to significantly contribute to SCC, despite the coexistence of the bulk state, which is possible via a unique ultrafast SCC process, considering the decay process of the spin-polarized hot electrons. This means that topological material-based spintronic devices should be fabricated in a manner that fully utilizes the TSS, not the bulk state, to maximize their performance. The results not only provide a clue for identifying the source of the giant spin Hall angle of Bi 1− x Sb x , but also expand the application potential of topological materials by indicating that the optically induced spin current provides a unique method for focused-spin injection into the TSS.},

Benefiting from its high-density end-chains and extended π -conjugation thanks to highly-branched 3D architecture, PYTT displays better organic solubility despite much higher molecular weights, larger crystallinity, and tighter π -stacking than the linear counterpart—PYT comprising Y6 and thiophene moieties, while showing identical optical absorption yet threefold higher photoluminescence intensity. In PYTT blend film with PM6 polymer donor, the interpenetrating nano-fibrillar structures are formed with well-intermixed polymeric domain sizes close to the exciton diffusion length, which is greatly conducive to exciton dissociation and charge transport in device. Consequently, PYTT-based all-PSCs exhibit all increased photovoltaic parameters, yielding a decent power conversion efficiency of 15.60%, which is ≈20% enhancement over PYT-based device, along with low nonradiative loss of 0.221 meV.},

  abstract     = {Fibrotic diseases remain a substantial health burden with few therapeutic approaches. A hallmark of fibrosis is the aberrant activation and accumulation of myofibroblasts, which is caused by excessive profibrotic cytokines. Conventional anticytokine therapies fail to undergo clinical trials, as simply blocking a single or several antifibrotic cytokines cannot abrogate the profibrotic microenvironment. Here, biomimetic nanoparticles based on autologous skin fibroblasts are customized as decoys to neutralize multiple fibroblast-targeted cytokines. By fusing the skin fibroblast membrane onto poly(lactic- co -glycolic) acid cores, these nanoparticles, termed fibroblast membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles (FNPs), are shown to effectively scavenge various profibrotic cytokines, including transforming growth factor- β , interleukin (IL)-11, IL-13, and IL-17, thereby modulating the profibrotic microenvironment. FNPs are sequentially prepared into multiple formulations for different administration routines. As a proof-of-concept, in three independent animal models with various organ fibrosis (lung fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and heart fibrosis), FNPs effectively reduce the accumulation of myofibroblasts, and the formation of fibrotic tissue, concomitantly restoring organ function and indicating that FNPs are a potential broad-spectrum therapy for fibrosis management.},

However, the output voltage of DDGs is generally as low as 0.1–1 V, owing to energy loss during carrier transport and inefficient carrier collection, which requires further optimization and a deeper understanding of semiconductor physical properties. Therefore, this study proposes a vertical graphene/silicon DDG to regulate the performance by realizing hot carrier transport and collection. With instant contact and separation of the graphene and silicon, hot carriers are generated by the rebounding process of built-in electric fields in dynamic graphene/silicon diodes, which can be collected within the ultralong hot electron lifetime of graphene. In particular, monolayer graphene/silicon DDG outputs a high voltage of 6.1 V as result of ultrafast carrier transport between the monolayer graphene and silicon. Furthermore, a high current of 235.6 nA is generated due to the carrier multiplication in graphene. A voltage of 17.5 V is achieved under series connection, indicating the potential to supply electronic systems through integration design.

Herein, the fabrication and application of an Fe-FET, which is integrated with a van der Waals ferroelectrics heterostructure (CuInP 2 S 6 / α -In 2 Se 3 ), is reported. Leveraging enhanced polarization originating from the dipole coupling of CIPS and α -In 2 Se 3 , the fabricated Fe-FET exhibits a large memory window of 14.5 V at V GS = ±10 V, reaching a memory window to sweep range of ≈72%. Piezoelectric force microscopy measurements confirm the enhanced polarization-induced wider hysteresis loop of the double-stacked ferroelectrics compared to single ferroelectric layers. The Landau–Khalatnikov theory is extended to analyze the ferroelectric characteristics of a ferroelectric heterostructure, providing detailed explanations of the hysteresis behaviors and enhanced memory window formation. The fabricated Fe-FET shows nonvolatile memory characteristics, with a high on/off current ratio of over 10 6 , long retention time (&gt;10 4 s), and stable cyclic endurance (&gt;10 4 cycles). Furthermore, the applicability of the ferroelectrics heterostructure is investigated for artificial synapses and for hardware neural networks through training and inference simulation.

Due to their low biomass and other obstacles, intratumor microbiota is poorly understood. Mucosal sites and normal adjacent tissues are important sources of intratumor microbiota, while hematogenous spread also leads to the invasion of microbes. Intratumor microbiota affects the progression of tumors through several mechanisms, such as DNA damage, activation of oncogenic pathways, induction of immunosuppression, and metabolization of drugs. Notably, in different types of tumors, the composition and abundance of intratumor microbiota are highly heterogeneous and may play different roles in the progression of tumors. Because of the concern in this field, several techniques such as omics and immunological methods have been used to study intratumor microbiota. Here, recent progress in this field is reviewed, including the potential sources of intratumor microbiota, their functions and related mechanisms, and their heterogeneity.

  abstract     = {Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction can be used to produce value-added hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals by coupling with clean electrical energy. However, highly active, selective, and energy-efficient CO 2 conversion to multicarbon hydrocarbons, such as C 2 H 4 , remains challenging because of the lack of efficient catalysts. Herein, an ultrasonication-assisted electrodeposition strategy to synthesize CuO nanosheets for low-overpotential CO 2 electroreduction to C 2 H 4 is reported. A high C 2 H 4 Faradaic efficiency of 62.5% is achieved over the CuO nanosheets at a small potential of −0.52 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding to a record high half-cell cathodic energy efficiency of 41%. The selectivity toward C 2 H 4 is maintained for over 60 h of continuous operation. The CuO nanosheets are prone to in situ restructuring during CO 2 reduction, forming abundant grain boundaries (GBs). Stable Cu + /Cu 0 interfaces are derived from the low-coordinated Cu atoms in the reconstructed GB regions and act as highly active sites for CO 2 reduction at low overpotentials. In situ Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory computation reveal that the Cu + /Cu 0 interfaces offer high *CO surface coverage and lower the activation energy barrier for *CO dimerization, which, in synergy, facilitates CO 2 reduction to C 2 H 4 at low overpotentials.},

  abstract     = {Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have become promising candidate to replace common liquid electrolyte due to highly improved security. However, the practical use of SPEs is still restricted by their decomposition and breakage at the electrode interfacial layer especially at high voltage. Herein, a new cationic covalent organic framework (COF) is designed and synthesized as a reinforced skeleton to resist the constant oxidative decomposition of solid polycarbonate electrolyte, which can stabilize cathode electrolyte interphase layer to develop long-term cycle solid lithium metal battery. The ultralow HOMO energy (−12.55 eV according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations), reflecting its oxidation resistance at positive potential, would be responsible for the high decomposition voltage of 5.2 V versus Li + /Li of solid polycarbonate electrolyte. Furthermore, the smooth surface of interfacial layer and inhibited decomposition reaction at cathode side is confirmed in solid LiCoO 2 cell, which realizes high initial capacity up to 160.3 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C and greatly improved stability in 4.5 V class solid polymer lithium metal battery with high capacity retention over 200 cycles. This new type of high-voltage resistant solid polymer electrolyte promotes the realization of high-voltage cathode materials and higher energy density lithium metal battery.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the orientation, crystallinity, and domain size of components within organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is key to maximizing their performance. Here a broadly applicable approach for enhancing the morphology of bulk heterojunction OPV devices using metal–organic nanosheets (MONs) as additives is demonstrated. It is shown that addition of porphyrin-based MONs to devices with fully amorphous donor polymers lead to small improvements in performance attributed to increased light absorption due to nanosheets. However, devices based on semi-crystalline polymers show remarkable improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE), more than doubling in some cases compared to reference devices without nanosheets. In particular, this approach led to the development of PffBT4T2OD-MON-PCBM device with a PCE of 12.3%, which to the authors’ knowledge is the highest performing fullerene based OPV device reported in literature to date. Detailed analysis of these devices shows that the presence of the nanosheets results in a higher fraction of face-on oriented polymer crystals in the films. These results therefore demonstrate the potential of this highly tunable class of two-dimensional nanomaterials as additives for enhancing the morphology, and therefore performance, of semi-crystalline organic electronic devices.},

Panobinostat effectively kills DIPG tumor cells, but its systemic toxicity and low blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability limits its application. In this paper, a nano drug delivery system based on functionalized macrophage exosomes with panobinostat and PPM1D-siRNA for targeted therapy of DIPG with PPM1D mutation is prepared. The nano drug delivery system has higher drug delivery efficiency and better therapeutic effect than free drugs. In vivo and in vitro experimental results show that the nano drug delivery system can deliver panobinostat and siRNA across the BBB and achieve a targeted killing effect of DIPG tumor cells, resulting in the prolonged survival of orthotopic DIPG mice.

  abstract     = {Proximity effect, which is the coupling between distinct order parameters across interfaces of heterostructures, has attracted immense interest owing to the customizable multifunctionalities of diverse 3D materials. This facilitates various physical phenomena, such as spin order, charge transfer, spin torque, spin density wave, spin current, skyrmions, and Majorana fermions. These exotic physics play important roles for future spintronic applications. Nevertheless, several fundamental challenges remain for effective applications: unavoidable disorder and lattice mismatch limits in the growth process, short characteristic length of proximity, magnetic fluctuation in ultrathin films, and relatively weak spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Meanwhile, the extensive library of atomically thin, 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, with unique characteristics such as strong SOC, magnetic anisotropy, and ultraclean surfaces, offers many opportunities to tailor versatile and more effective functionalities through proximity effects. Here, this paper focuses on magnetic proximity, i.e., proximitized magnetism and reviews the engineering of magnetism-related functionalities in 2D vdW layered heterostructures for next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. The essential factors of magnetism and interfacial engineering induced by magnetic layers are studied. The current limitations and future challenges associated with magnetic proximity-related physics phenomena in 2D heterostructures are further discussed.},

Herein, a human mesenchymal stem cell-derived miniature joint system (miniJoint) is generated, in which engineered osteochondral complex, synovial-like fibrous tissue, and adipose tissue are integrated into a microfluidics-enabled bioreactor. This novel design facilitates different tissues communicating while still maintaining their respective phenotypes. The miniJoint exhibits physiologically relevant changes when exposed to interleukin-1 β mediated inflammation, which are similar to observations in joint diseases in humans. The potential of the miniJoint in predicting in vivo efficacy of drug treatment is confirmed by testing the “therapeutic effect” of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, naproxen, as well as four other potential disease-modifying OA drugs. The data demonstrate that the miniJoint recapitulates complex tissue interactions, thus providing a robust organ chip model for the study of joint pathology and the development of novel therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes and high myopia as well-known high-risk factors can aggravate cataracts, yet clinical coping strategy remains a bottleneck. Metabolic analysis tends to be powerful for precisely detection and mechanism exploration since most of diseases including cataracts are accompanied by metabolic disorder. Herein, a layered binary co-ionizers assisted aqueous humor metabolic analysis tool is proposed for potentially etiological typing and detection of cataracts, including age-related cataracts (ARC), cataracts with diabetes mellitus (CDM), and cataracts with high myopia (CHM). Startlingly, taking advantage of the optimal machine learning algorithm and all metabolic fingerprints, 100% of accuracy, precision, and recall rates are achieved for arbitrary comparison between groups. Moreover, 11, 9, and 7 key metabolites with explicit identities are confirmed as markers of discriminating CDM from ARC, CHM from ARC, and CDM from CHM, and the corresponding area under the curve values of validation cohorts are 0.985, 1.000, and 1.000. Finally, the critical impact of diabetes/high myopia on cataracts is revealed by excavating the change levels and metabolic pathways of key metabolites. This work updates the insights of prevention and treatment about cataracts at metabolic level and throws out huge surprises and progresses metabolic diagnosis toward a reality.},

  abstract     = {Immunogenic cell death (ICD) arises when cells are under stress, and their membranes are damaged. They release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that stimulate and drive the type and magnitude of the immune response. In the presence of an antigen, DAMPs ride the longevity and efficacy of antigen-specific immunity. Yet, no tool can induce the controlled ICD with predictable results. A peptide-based tool, [II], is designed that aggregates in the cell and causes cell membrane damage, generates ICD and DAMPs release on various cell types, and hence can act as an adjuvant. An influenza vaccine is prepared by combining [II] with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subunit antigens. The results show that [II] induced significantly higher HA-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2a antibodies than HA-only immunized mice, while the peptide itself did not elicit antibodies. This paper demonstrates the first peptide-aggregation induced immunogenic rupture (PAIIR) approach as a vaccine adjuvant.

Here the dimensionality effect on the ground electronic state in high-quality (NdNiO 3 ) m /(SrTiO 3 ) 1 superlattices is systematically studied through transport and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The metal-to-insulator transition temperature decreases with the thickness of the NdNiO 3 slab decreasing from bulk to 7 unit cells, then increases gradually as m further reduces to 1 unit cell. Spectral evidence demonstrates that the stabilization of insulating phase can be attributed to the increase of the charge-transfer energy between O 2p and Ni 3d bands. The prominent multiplet feature on the Ni L 3 edge develops with the decrease of NdNiO 3 slab thickness, suggesting the strengthening of the charge disproportionate state under the dimensional confinement. This work provides convincing evidence that dimensionality is an effective knob to modulate the charge-transfer energy and thus the collective ground state in nickelates.},

Inspired by the ideal regeneration mode in lower vertebrates and the human oral mucosa, realigning dysregulated inflammation to a heightened and acute response provides a promising option for refractory wound therapy. Neutrophils play important roles in inflammation initiation and resolution. Here, a hybrid biomaterial is used to stimulate transiently heightened inflammatory responses by precise tempospatial regulation of neutrophil recruitment and apoptosis. The hybrid biomaterial (Gel@fMLP/SiO 2 -FasL) is constructed by loading of formyl-met-leu-phe (fMLP) and FasL-conjugated silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 -FasL) into a pH-responsive hydrogel matrix. This composition enables burst release of fMLP to rapidly recruit neutrophils for heightened inflammation initiation. After neutrophils act to produce acids, the pH-responsive hydrogel degrades to expose SiO 2 -FasL, which induces activated neutrophils apoptosis via FasL-Fas signaling triggering timely inflammation resolution. Apoptotic neutrophils are subsequently cleared by macrophages, and this efferocytosis activates key signalings to promote macrophage anti-inflammatory phenotypic transformation to drive regeneration. Ultimately, Gel@fMLP/SiO 2 -FasL successfully promotes tissue regeneration by manipulating inflammation in critical-sized calvarial bone defects and diabetic cutaneous wound models. This work provides a new strategy for refractory wound therapy via inducing transiently heightened inflammatory responses.},

  abstract     = {Targeting the G2/M checkpoint mediator WEE1 has been explored as a novel treatment strategy in ovarian cancer, but mechanisms underlying its efficacy and resistance remains to be understood. Here, it is demonstrated that the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and activates the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-required enzyme 1 α (IRE1 α ) branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in TP53 mutant (mt TP53 ) ovarian cancer models. This is facilitated through NF- κ B mediated senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Upon AZD1775 treatment, activated PERK promotes apoptotic signaling via C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), while IRE1 α -induced splicing of XBP1 (XBP1s) maintains cell survival by repressing apoptosis. This leads to an encouraging synergistic antitumor effect of combining AZD1775 and an IRE1 α inhibitor MKC8866 in multiple cell lines and preclinical models of ovarian cancers. Taken together, the data reveal an important dual role of the UPR signaling network in mt TP53 ovarian cancer models in response to AZD1775 and suggest that inhibition of the IRE1 α -XBP1s pathway may enhance the efficacy of AZD1775 in the clinics.},

  abstract     = {Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the leading causes of childhood visual impairment and blindness. However, there are still very few effective pharmacological interventions for ROP. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-mediated disassembly of photoreceptor cilia has recently been implicated as an early event in the pathogenesis of ROP. Herein it is shown that enhanced expression of HDAC6 by intravitreal injection of adenoviruses encoding HDAC6 induces the typical pathological changes associated with ROP in mice, including disruption of the membranous disks of photoreceptor outer segments and a decrease in electroretinographic amplitudes. Hdac6 transgenic mice exhibit similar ROP-related defects in retinal structures and functions and disassembly of photoreceptor cilia, whereas Hdac6 knockout mice are resistant to oxygen change-induced retinal defects. It is further shown that blocking HDAC6-mediated cilium disassembly by intravitreal injection of small-molecule compounds protect mice from ROP-associated retinal defects. The findings indicate that pharmacological targeting of the HDAC6-cilium axis may represent a promising strategy for the prevention of ROP.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic reprogramming is often observed in carcinogenesis, but little is known about the aberrant metabolic genes involved in the tumorigenicity and maintenance of stemness in cancer cells. Sixty-seven oncogenic metabolism-related genes in liver cancer by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening are identified. Among them, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), aldolase fructose-bisphosphate A (ALDOA), fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5), and hexokinase 2 (HK2) are strongly associated with stem cell properties. HK2 further facilitates the maintenance and self-renewal of liver cancer stem cells. Moreover, HK2 enhances the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and epigenetically activates the transcription of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), leading to an increase in fatty acid β -oxidation activity. Blocking HK2 or ACSL4 effectively inhibits liver cancer growth, and GalNac-siHK2 administration specifically targets the growth of orthotopic tumor xenografts. These results suggest a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver cancer.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Serine-arginine rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) plays a critical role in hepatocyte function and its loss in mice promotes chronic liver damage and leads to HCC. Hepatocyte-specific SRSF3 knockout mice (SKO mice) also overexpress insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). In the present study, double deletion of Igf2 and Srsf3 (DKO mice) prevents hepatic fibrosis and inflammation, and completely prevents tumor formation, and is associated with decreased proliferation, apoptosis and DNA damage, and restored DNA repair enzyme expression. This is confirmed in vitro, where IGF2 treatment of HepG2 hepatoma cells decreases DNA repair enzyme expression and causes DNA damage. Tumors from the SKO mice also show mutational signatures consistent with homologous recombination and mismatch repair defects. Analysis of frozen human samples shows that SRSF3 protein is decreased sixfold in HCC compared to normal liver tissue but SRSF3 mRNA is increased. Looking at public TCGA data, HCC patients having high SRSF3 mRNA expression show poor survival, as do patients with alterations in known SRSF3-dependent splicing events. The results indicate that IGF2 overexpression in conjunction with reduced SRSF3 splicing activity could be a major cause of DNA damage and driver of liver cancer.},

Here, the authors introduce Alginate-based tissue engineering (ALTEN), a biomimetic tissue platform that allows ex vivo analysis of explanted tissue biopsies. This method preserves the original characteristics of the source tissue&#39;s cellular milieu, allowing multiple and diverse cell types to be maintained over an extended period of time. As a result, ALTEN enables rapid and faithful characterization of perturbations across specific cell types within a tissue. Importantly, using single-cell genomics, this approach provides integrated cellular responses at the resolution of individual cells. ALTEN is a powerful tool for the analysis of cellular responses upon exposure to cytotoxic agents and immunomodulators. Additionally, ALTEN&#39;s scalability using automated microfluidic devices for tissue encapsulation and subsequent transport, to enable centralized high-throughput analysis of samples gathered by large-scale multicenter studies, is shown.},

  abstract     = {Molecular light-harvesting capabilities and the production of low-temperature heat output are essential for flexible self-heated textiles. An effective strategy to achieve these characteristics is to introduce photoresponsive molecular interactions (photodynamic bonds) to increase the energy storage capacity and optimize the low-temperature photochromic kinetics. In this study, a series of sulfonic-grafted azobenzene-based polymers interacted with different metal ions (PAzo-M, M = Mg, Ca, Ni, Zn, Cu, and Fe) to optimize the energy level and isomerization kinetics of these polymers is designed and prepared. Photoinduced formation and dissociation of M  O dynamic bonds enlarge the energy gap (∆ E ) between trans and cis isomers for high-energy storage and favor a high rate of isomerization for low-temperature heat release. The suitable binding energy and high ∆ E enable PAzo-M to store and release isomerization energy and bond enthalpy even in a low-temperature (−5 °C) environment. PAzo-Mg possesses the highest energy storage density of 408.6 J g −1 (113.5 Wh kg −1 ). A flexible textile coated with PAzo-Mg can provide a high rise in temperature of 7.7–12.5 °C in a low-temperature (−5.0 to 5.0 °C) environment by selectively self-releasing heat indoors and outdoors. The flexible textile provides a new pathway for wearable thermal management devices.},

In this work, an advanced anti-counterfeiting material, with three-state of each mode reversibly converted into multi-mode materials including reflective color, fluorescence, and circularly polarized luminescence signal, is constructed by loading photofluorochromic spiropyran (SP) and zinc ion (Zn 2+ ) into the chiral liquid crystal. Under UV irradiation, the complexes of SP and Zn 2+ will be transformed into merocyanine (MC) and MC-Zn 2+ , while the energy transfer occurs from MC-Zn 2+ to MC. Upon heating, MC is easy to recover to SP, while the MC-Zn 2+ remains unchanged. The MC and MC-Zn 2+ can be transformed into the SP and Zn 2+ under visible light irradiation. The three states of each mode can reversibly convert. Furthermore, the reflective color or fluorescence of each state shows different intensities under left- and right-handed circular polarized filters, enabling easy distinguishing by naked eyes. The advanced anti-counterfeiting method with multi-state of each mode for multi-mode encryption information output will provide a new concept for designing and fabricating multi-mode anti-counterfeiting materials, improving the security level for practical application.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction is a mild and eco-friendly approach for CO 2 mitigation and producing value-added products. For selective electrochemical CO 2 reduction, single-crystalline Au particles (octahedron, truncated-octahedron, and sphere) are synthesized by consecutive growth and chemical etching using a polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (polyDDA) surfactant, and are surface-functionalized. Monodisperse, single-crystalline Au nanoparticles provide an ideal platform for evaluating the Au surface as a CO 2 reduction catalyst. The polyDDA-Au cathode affords high catalytic activity for CO production, with &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency over a wide potential range between −0.4 and −1.0 V versus RHE, along with high durability owing to the consecutive interaction between dimethylammonium and chloride on the Au surface. The influence of polyDDA on the Au particles, and the origins of the enhanced selectivity and stability are fully investigated using theoretical studies. Chemically adsorbed polyDDA is consecutively affected the initial adsorption of CO 2 and the stability of the *CO 2 , *COOH, and *CO intermediates during continuous CO 2 reduction reaction. The polyDDA functionalization is extended to improving the CO Faradaic efficiency of other metal catalysts such as Ag and Zn, indicating its broad applicability for CO 2 reduction.},

  abstract     = {Red blood cells (RBCs) are cleared from the circulation when they become damaged or display aging signals targeted by macrophages. This process occurs mainly in the spleen, where blood flows through submicrometric constrictions called inter-endothelial slits (IES), subjecting RBCs to large-amplitude deformations. In this work, RBCs are circulated through microfluidic devices containing microchannels that replicate the IES. The cyclic mechanical stresses experienced by the cells affect their biophysical properties and molecular composition, accelerating cell aging. Specifically, RBCs quickly transition to a more spherical, less deformable phenotype that hinders microchannel passage, causing hemolysis. This transition is associated with the release of membrane vesicles, which self-extinguishes as the spacing between membrane-cytoskeleton linkers becomes tighter. Proteomics analysis of the mechanically aged RBCs reveals significant losses of essential proteins involved in antioxidant protection, gas transport, and cell metabolism. Finally, it is shown that these changes make mechanically aged RBCs more susceptible to macrophage phagocytosis. These results provide a comprehensive model explaining how physical stress induces RBC clearance in the spleen. The data also suggest new biomarkers of early &quot;hemodamage&quot; and inflammation preceding hemolysis in RBCs subjected to mechanical stress.},

  abstract     = {The potential of dendrimers exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as emitters in solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has to date not yet been realized. This in part is due to a poor understanding of the structure–property relationship in dendrimers where reports of detailed photophysical characterization and mechanism studies are lacking. In this report, using absorption and solvatochromic photoluminescence studies in solution, the origin and character of the lowest excited electronic states in dendrimers with multiple dendritic electron-donating moieties connected to a central electron-withdrawing core via a para - or a meta -phenylene bridge is probed. Characterization of host-free OLEDs reveals the superiority of meta -linked dendrimers as compared to the already reported para -analogue. Comparative temperature-dependent time-resolved solid-state photoluminescence measurements and quantum chemical studies explore the effect of the substitution mode on the TADF properties and the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) mechanism, respectively. For TADF dendrimers with similarly small ∆ E ST , it is observed that RISC can be enhanced by the regiochemistry of the donor dendrons due to control of the reorganization energies, which is a heretofore unexploited strategy that is distinct from the involvement of intermediate triplet states through a nonadiabatic (vibronic) coupling with the lowest singlet charge transfer state.},

Despite the steady advances in imaging devices, there is a scarcity of fluorophores available to achieve optimal FGS. Here, 1) a pH-sensitive near-infrared fluorophore that exhibits rapid signal changes in acidic tumor microenvironments (TME) caused by the attenuation of intramolecular quenching, 2) the inherent targeting for cancer based on chemical structure (structure inherent targeting, SIT), and 3) mitochondrial and lysosomal retention are reported. After topical application of PH08 on peritoneal tumor regions in ovarian cancer-bearing mice, a rapid fluorescence increase (&lt; 10 min), and extended preservation of signals (&gt; 4 h post-topical application) are observed, which together allow for the visualization of submillimeter tumors with a high tumor-to-background ratio (TBR &gt; 5.0). In addition, PH08 is preferentially transported to cancer cells via organic anion transporter peptides (OATPs) and colocalizes in the mitochondria and lysosomes due to the positive charges, enabling a long retention time during FGS. PH08 not only has a significant impact on surgical and diagnostic applications but also provides an effective and scalable strategy to design therapeutic agents for a wide array of cancers.},

  abstract     = {Retroreflectors are ubiquitously used in a multitude of applications, such as cloaking, wireless communication, radar, and antenna, owing to their ability to augment the reflected electromagnetic (EM) waves in the incident direction. However, Current metasurface retroreflector designs have yet to mature into a practical method due to the limitations of low efficiency and narrow band, which actually originate from the difficulty in simultaneously engineering phase profiles of certain metasurface at distinct wavelengths. Here, a broadband spin-locked retroreflector with high efficiency that relies only on a simple metasurface layer is demonstrated. The metasurface is designed with low-loss dielectric resonators, introducing both the propagation and geometric phases to enable dispersive phase compensation. The results indicate that the proposed metasurface can achieve retroreflection over a broadband spectrum while keeping the spin state identical. Furthermore, a broadband spin-locked cloak is presented for validation. The work builds up a major advance for practice-oriented retroreflector and even envision this approach may open new vistas in the very cutting-edge research of 6G wireless communication network.},

  abstract     = {Bismuth telluride-based thermoelectric (TE) materials are historically recognized as the best p-type (ZT = 1.8) TE materials at room temperature. However, the poor performance of n-type (ZT≈1.0) counterparts seriously reduces the efficiency of the device. Such performance imbalance severely impedes its TE applications either in electrical generation or refrigeration. Here, a strategy to boost n-type Bi 2 Te 2.7 Se 0.3 crystals up to ZT = 1.42 near room temperature by a two-stage process is reported, that is, step 1: stabilizing Seebeck coefficient by CuI doping; step 2: boosting power factor (PF) by synergistically optimizing phonon and carrier transport via thermal-driven Cu intercalation in the van der Waals (vdW) gaps. Theoretical ab initio calculations disclose that these intercalated Cu atoms act as modulation doping and contribute conduction electrons of wavefunction spatially separated from the Cu atoms themselves, which simultaneously lead to large carrier concentration and high mobility. As a result, an ultra-high PF ≈63.5 µW cm −1 K −2 at 300 K and a highest average ZT = 1.36 at 300–450 K are realized, which outperform all n-type bismuth telluride materials ever reported.

Also, the HFBMZ can enhance the wettability of the separator to promote uniform Li deposition. HFBMZ can make Li + easy to be desolvated, resulting in the increase of Li + flux on Li anode surface. Moreover, the HFBMZ can optimize the composition and structure of SEI. Therefore, the Li||Li symmetrical cells with 1 wt% HFBMZ-contained electrolyte can achieve stable cycling for more than 1200 h at 0.5 mA cm –2 .

A series of structural, morphological, electrical, and photoelectric characterizations are employed to study the effects of the pre-annealing temperatures on absorber qualities, and an optimized temperature of 430 ℃ is determined. The growth mechanism of the large-grain spanning monolayer and the effect of redox reaction rate are carefully investigated. Three types of absorber growth mechanisms and a concept of critical temperature are proposed. The devices based on this large-grain spanning monolayer suppress the recombination of carriers at crystal boundaries and interfaces. The champion device exhibits a high V oc (&gt;500 mV) and PCE of 11.76%, which are both the maximum values among DMF-based solar cells at the current stage.},

However, PDRC polymers are limited to polyethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, and their derivatives. In this study, a series of polymer films based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and their composite films with silica aerogels (aerogel-functionalized TPU (AFTPU)) are prepared using a simple and scalable non-solvent-phase-separation strategy. The TPU and AFTPU films are freestanding, mechanically strong, show high solar reflection up to 94%, and emit strongly in the atmospheric transparency window, thereby achieving subambient cooling of 10.0 and 7.7 °C on a hot summer day for the TPU and AFTPU film (10 wt%), respectively. The AFTPU films can be used as waterproof and moisture permeable coatings for traditional textiles, such as cotton, polyester, and nylon, and the highest temperature drop of 17.6 °C is achieved with respect to pristine nylon fabric, in which both the cooling performance and waterproof properties are highly desirable for the PTM applications.

Mechanistic studies confirm the staging behavior for anion storage in the graphite positive electrode and the formation of lithiated phosphorus alloys in the negative electrode. BP-C containing full-cells demonstrate promising electrochemical performance with specific energies of up to 319 Wh kg –1 (related to masses of both electrode active materials) or 155 Wh kg –1 (related to masses of electrode active materials and active salt), and high Coulombic efficiency.

Herein, a novel ionogel is reported consisting of polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (P123), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (Emim:OAC). By delicately designing the interactions between ions and polymers, the migration of anions is restricted due to their strong binding with the hydroxyl groups of polymers, while the transport of cations is facilitated through segmental motions due to the increased amorphous regions, thereby leading to enlarged diffusion difference between the cations and anions. Moreover, the plasticizing effect of P123 and Emim:OAC can increase the elongation at break. As a consequence, the ionogel exhibits excellent properties including high S i (18 mV K −1 at relative humidity of 60%), good ionic conductivity (1.1 mS cm −1 ), superior stretchability (787%), and high stability (over 80% retention after 600 h). These findings show a promising strategy to obtain multifunctional iTE materials by engineering the intermolecular interactions and demonstrate the great potential of ionogels for harvesting low-grade heat in human-comfortable humidity environments.},

However, the underlying formation mechanism of the LESs still remains controversial. Also, the presence or creation of the LESs is of high randomness due to the lack of proper techniques to manually generate these LESs. Herein, using a single crystals platform of quasi-2D (BA) 2 (MA) n−1 Pb n I 3n+1 ( n &gt; 1) perovskites, the femtosecond laser ablation approach to design and write the LESs with a high spatial resolution is reported. Fundamentally, these LESs are of smaller bandgap 3D MAPbI 3 nanocrystals which are formed by the laser-induced BA escaping from the lattice and thus the lattice shrinkage from quasi-2D to 3D structures. Furthermore, by covering the crystal with tape, an additional high-energy emission state corresponding to the reformation of (BA) 2 PbI 4 ( n = 1) within the irradiation region is generated. This work presents a simple and efficient protocol to manually write LESs on single crystals and thus lays the foundation for utilizing these LESs to further enhance the performance of future photoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {The recently proposed bianisotropic acoustic metagratings offer promising opportunities for passive acoustic wavefront manipulation, which is of particular interest in flat acoustic lenses and ultrasound imaging at ultra-high frequency ultrasound. Despite this fact, acoustic metagratings have never been scaled to MHz frequencies that are common in ultrasound imaging. One of the greatest challenges is the production of complex microscopic structures. Owing to two-photon polymerization, a novel fabrication technique from the view of acoustic metamaterials, it is now possible to precisely manufacture sub-wavelength structures in this frequency range. However, shrinking in size poses another challenge; the increasing thermoviscous effects lead to a drop in efficiency and a frequency downshift of the transmission peak and must therefore be taken into account in the design. In this work three microacoustic metagrating designs refracting a normally incident wave toward −35° at 2 MHz are proposed. In order to develop meta-atoms insensitive to thermoviscous effects shape optimization techniques incorporating the linearized Navier–Stokes equations discretized with finite element method are used. The authors report for the first time microscopic acoustic metamaterials manufactured using two-photon polymerization and, subsequently, experimentally verify their effectiveness using an optical microphone as a detector in a range from 1.8 to 2.2 MHz.},

SOI allows the manipulation of spin degree of freedom by controlling the carrier&#39;s orbital motion via mechanical strain. Here, strain modulated spin dynamics in bilayer MoS 2 field-effect transistors (FETs) fabricated on crested substrates are demonstrated. Weak antilocalization (WAL) is observed at moderate carrier concentrations, indicating additional spin relaxation path caused by strain fields arising from substrate crests. The spin lifetime is found to be inversely proportional to the momentum relaxation time, which follows the Dyakonov–Perel spin relaxation mechanism. Moreover, the spin–orbit splitting is obtained as 37.5 ± 1.4 meV, an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical prediction for monolayer MoS 2 , suggesting the strain enhanced spin-lattice coupling.

  abstract     = {Dysfunctional triglyceride-very low-density lipoprotein (TG-VLDL) metabolism is linked to metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD); however, the underlying cause remains unclear. The study shows that hepatic E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2) controls MAFLD by blocking TG-VLDL secretion. A remarkable upregulation of MDM2 is observed in the livers of human and mouse models with different levels of severity of MAFLD. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of MDM2 protects against high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation, accompanied by a significant elevation in TG-VLDL secretion. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2 targets apolipoprotein B (ApoB) for proteasomal degradation through direct protein–protein interaction, which leads to reduced TG-VLDL secretion in hepatocytes. Pharmacological blockage of the MDM2-ApoB interaction alleviates dietary-induced hepatic steatohepatitis and fibrosis by inducing hepatic ApoB expression and subsequent TG-VLDL secretion. The effect of MDM2 on VLDL metabolism is p53-independent. Collectively, these findings suggest that MDM2 acts as a negative regulator of hepatic ApoB levels and TG-VLDL secretion in MAFLD. Inhibition of the MDM2-ApoB interaction may represent a potential therapeutic approach for MAFLD treatment.},

As a vital configuration in PIBs, the two-phase interface, which refers to K-ion diffusion from the electrolyte to the electrode surface (solid–liquid interface) and K-ion migration between different particles (solid–solid interface), deeply determines the diffusion/reaction kinetics and structural stability, thus significantly affecting the rate performance and cyclability. However, researches on two-phase interface are still in its infancy and need further attentions. This review first starts from the fundamental understanding of solid–liquid and solid–solid interfaces to in-depth analyzing the effect mechanism of different improvement strategies on them, such as optimization of electrolyte and binders, heterostructure design, modulation of interlayer spacing, etc. Afterward, the research progress of these improvement strategies is summarized comprehensively. Finally, the major challenges are proposed, and the corresponding solving strategies are presented. This review is expected to give an insight into the importance of two-phase interface on diffusion/reaction kinetics, and provides a guidance for developing other advanced anodes in PIBs.},

Here, the problem is addressed by engineering a negative electrode that furnishes an ultrahigh capacitance. An in situ developed metal–organic framework (MOF)-based thermal treatment is adopted to grow highly porous N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing submerged Co nanoparticles over nano-fibrillated electrospun hollow carbon nanofibers (HCNFs). The optimized CNT@HCNF-1.5 furnishes an ultrahigh capacitance approaching 712 F g –1 with excellent rate capability. The capacitance reported from this work is the highest for any carbonaceous material reported to date. The CNT@HCNF-1.5 is further used to fabricate symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs), as well as ASC devices. Remarkably, both the SSC and ASC devices furnish incredible performances in all aspects of SCs, such as a high energy density, long cycle life, and high rate capability, displaying decent practical applicability. The energy density of the SSC device reaches as high as 20.13 W h kg –1 , whereas that of ASC approaches 87.5 W h kg –1 .},

Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) based light emitting diodes (LEDs) have shown tremendous advances in recent times through improvement in synthesis chemistry, surface property, and device structures. Despite the tremendous advancements of CQD based LEDs in the visible range with efficiency reaching theoretical limits, their short-wave infrared (SWIR) counterparts mainly based on lead chalcogenide CQDs, have shown lower performance (≈8%). Here the authors report on highly efficient SWIR CQD LEDs with a recorded EQE of 11.8% enabled by the use of a binary CQD matrix comprising QD populations of different bandgaps at the emission wavelength of 1550 nm. By further optimizing the optical out-coupling via the use of a hemispherical lens to reduce optical waveguide loss, the EQE of the LED increased to 18.6%. The CQD LED has an electrical bandwidth of 2 MHz, which motivated them to demonstrate its use in the first SWIR free-space optical transmission link based entirely on CQD technology (photodetector and light emitter) opening a new window of applications for CQD optoelectronics.},

Herein, a space–time conversion vehicle based on covalent organic framework (COF)-coated mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSN) with a sandwiched polyethyleneimine (PEI) layer (MPCP), is designed. The space-specific drugs-loaded vehicle (M G P P C L P) is obtained by separately incorporating a chemotherapeutic agent (gemcitabine, G) into the MSN core, a P glycoprotein inhibitor (LY 335979, P) into the PEI layer, and an extracellular matrix disruptor (losartan, L) into the COF shell. Thereafter, a programmed drug delivery is achieved via the ordered degradation from COF shell to MSN core. Sequential release of the individual drugs, synergized with a change of nanoparticle surface charge, contribute to an obvious extracellular matrix distraction, distinct drug efflux inhibition, and consequently enhance chemotherapeutic outcomes in pancreatic carcinoma. This MPCP-based vehicle design suggests a robust space–time conversion strategy to achieve programmed multi-drugs delivery and represents a new avenue to the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma by overcoming extracellular matrix and drug reflux barriers.},

Aberration-corrected environmental TEM coupled with in-situ EELS is used for direct visualization of the evolution process at 200–1000 °C. Dissolution of carbon into the nanoparticles of Co is found to be key to modulating the wetting behavior of nanoparticles on the carbon support; melting of Co nanoparticles and their motion within the zeolitic architecture leads to the etching of the framework structure, yielding porous C/N support onto which Co-single atoms reside. This uniquely structured Co SAC is found to be effective for the oxidation of a series of aromatic alkanes to produce selective ketones among other possible products.

These sensors cannot be repaired after external mechanical damage and lack of tactile feedback applications. Herein, a high-performance flexible pressure sensor based on MXene/polyurethane (PU)/interdigital electrodes is fabricated by using a low-cost and universal spray method. The sprayed MXene on the spinosum structure PU and other arbitrary flexible substrates (represented by polyimide and membrane filter) act as the sensitive layer and the interdigital electrodes, respectively. The sensor shows an ultrahigh sensitivity (up to 509.8 kPa –1 ), extremely fast response speed (67.3 ms), recovery speed (44.8 ms), and good stability (10 000 cycles) due to the interaction between the sensitive layer and the interdigital electrodes. In addition, the hydrogen bond of PU endows the device with the self-healing function. The sensor can also be integrated with a circuit, which can realize tactile feedback function. This MXene-based high-performance pressure sensor, along with its designing/fabrication, is expected to be widely used in human activity detection, electronic skin, intelligent robots, and many other aspects.},

Herein, the authors synthesize ferrous ions, histidine, and MTX assembled nanoparticles (FHM) to deliver MTX at tumor site and enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to MTX with histidine catabolism. Furthermore, fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) is applied to intervene in the one-carbon metabolism and enhance the cytotoxicity of MTX. Meanwhile, FMD treatment can significantly augment the cellular uptake and tumor accumulation of FHM nanoparticles. Due to the triple inhibitions of the one-carbon metabolism, the proliferation of tumor cells is strongly disturbed, as which is highly replying on DNA and RNA production. Taken together, a 95% lower dose of MTX adopted in combined therapy significantly inhibits the growth of two types of murine tumors without evident systemic toxicity. This strategy may provide a promising nucleotide metabolism-based nanomedicine for cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {New strategies to decrease risk of relapse after surgery are needed for improving 5-year survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To address this need, a wound-targeted nanodrug is developed, that contains an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1)and an angiogenesis inhibitor (sorafenib)). These nanoparticles consist of highly biocompatible mesoporous silica (MSNP) that is surface-coated with platelet membrane (PM) to achieve surgical site targeting in a self-amplified accumulation manner. Sorafenib is introduced into the MSNP pores while covalently attaching anti-PD-L1 antibody on the PM surface. The resulting nano-formulation, abbreviated as a-PM-S-MSNP, can effectively target the surgical margin when intraperitoneally (IP) administered into an immune competent murine orthotopic HCC model. Multiple administrations of a-PM-S-MSNP generate potent anti-HCC effect and significantly prolong overall mice survival. Immunophenotyping and immunochemistry staining reveal the signatures of favorable anti-HCC immunity and anti-angiogenesis effect at tumor sites. More importantly, microscopic inspection of a-PM-S-MSNP treated mice shows that 2 out 6 are histologically tumor-free, which is in sharp contrast to the control mice where tumor foci can be easily identified. The data suggest that a-PM-S-MSNP can efficiently inhibit post-surgical HCC relapse without obvious side effects and holds considerable promise for clinical translation as a novel nanodrug.},

  abstract     = {The opening and closing of pine cones is based on the hygroscopic behavior of the individual seed scales around the cone axis, which bend passively in response to changes in environmental humidity. Although prior studies suggest a bilayer architecture consisting of lower actuating (swellable) sclereid and upper restrictive (non- or lesser swellable) sclerenchymatous fiber tissue layers to be the structural basis of this behavior, the exact mechanism of how humidity changes are translated into global movement are still unclear. Here, the mechanical and hydraulic properties of each structural component of the scale are investigated to get a holistic picture of their functional interplay. Measurements of the wetting behavior, water uptake, and mechanical measurements are used to analyze the influence of hydration on the different tissues of the cone scales. Furthermore, their dimensional changes during actuation are measured by comparative micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) investigations of dry and wet scales, which are corroborated and extended by 3D-digital image correlation-based displacement and strain analyses, biomechanical testing of actuation force, and finite element simulations. Altogether, a model allowing a detailed mechanistic understanding of pine cone actuation is developed, which is a prime concept generator for the development of biomimetic hygromorphic systems.},

Unfortunately, integrated systems that allow such analyses in serial fine needle aspirates within a day or at point-of-care currently do not exist. To achieve this, an integrated immunofluorescence single-cell analyzer (i2SCAN) for deep profiling of directly harvested cells is developed. By combining a novel cellular imaging system, highly cyclable bioorthogonal FAST antibody panels, and integrated computational analysis, it is shown that same-day analysis is possible in thousands of harvested cells. It is demonstrated that the i2SCAN approach allows comprehensive analysis of breast cancer samples obtained by fine needle aspiration or core tissues.

Herein, an efficient energy cascade channel is developed by introducing sodium bromide (NaBr) in phenyl-butylammonium (PBA)-containing mixed-halide Q-2D perovskites for a blue perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED). The incorporation of alkali metal contributes to the nucleation and growth of Q-2D perovskites into graded distribution of domains with different layer number &lt; n &gt;. The study of excitation dynamics by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy confirms that NaBr induces more Q-2D perovskite phases with small n number, providing a graded energy cascade pathway to facilitate more efficient energy transfer processes. In addition, the nonradiative recombination within the Q-2D perovskites is significantly suppressed upon Na + incorporation, as validated by the trap density estimation. Consequently, the optimized blue PeLEDs manifest a peak external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of 7.0% emitting at 486 nm with a maximum luminance of 1699 cd m −2 . It is anticipated that these findings will improve the understanding of alkali-metal-assisted optimization of Q-2D perovskites and pave the way toward high-performance blue PeLEDs.},

The extreme size disparity however between CMOS electronics and dielectric photonics inhibits the realization of efficient and compact electrically driven photonic switches, logic and routing elements. Here, the authors achieve an important milestone in harmonizing the two domains by demonstrating an electrically reconfigurable, ultra-compact and nonvolatile memory that is optically accessible. The platform relies on localized heat, generated within a plasmonic structure; this uniquely allows for both optical and electrical readout signals to be interlocked with the material state of the PCM while still ensuring that the writing operation is electrically decoupled. Importantly, by miniaturization and effective thermal engineering, the authors achieve unprecedented energy efficiency, opening up a path towards low-energy optoelectronic hardware for neuromorphic and in-memory computing.},

Herein, an injectable protein hydrogel with anti-thrombosis and anti-inflammation competency is developed to impede this cycle, cross-linked by silver ion mediated metal-ligand coordination and electronic interaction with sulfhydryl functionalized bovine serum albumin and heparin, respectively. The ex vivo experiments show that the hydrogel, HEP-Ag-BSA, exhibits excellent self-healing ability, injectability, biocompatibility, and sustained drug release. HEP-Ag-BSA also demonstrates anti-coagulation and anti-inflammation abilities via coagulation analysis and lipopolysaccharide stimulation assay. The in vivo imaging confirms the longer retention time of HEP-Ag-BSA at inflammatory sites than in normal mucosa owing to electrostatic interactions. The in vivo study applying a mouse model with colitis also reveals that HEP-Ag-BSA can robustly inhibit inflammatory microthrombosis with reduced bleeding risk. This versatile protein hydrogel platform can definitively hinder the “inflammation and microthrombosis” cycle, providing a novel integrated approach against IBD.},

Their topological origin is demonstrated by explicitly calculating their topological charges before and after BIC merging, accompanied by charges annihilation. Compared with other types of BICs, they are robust to the perturbation brought by fabrication imperfection. Moreover, it is found that such supercavity modes can be linked with the Friedrich–Wintgen BICs supported by an entire rectangular (cuboid) resonator sandwiched between two rectangular (or circular) waveguides and thus more supercavity modes are constructed. Then, these coupled resonators are fabricated and such a unique phenomenon—moving, merging, and vanishing of BICs—is experimentally confirmed by measuring their reflection spectra, which show good agreement with the numerical simulation and theoretical prediction of mode evolution. The results may find exciting applications in acoustic and photonics, such as enhanced acoustic emission, filtering, and sensing.},

The method can be combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry, for example, laser ablation ionization mass spectrometry, to simultaneously analyze chemically the material released. With increasing depth of the volume ablated, however, secondary effects start to play an important role and the ablation geometry deviates substantially from the desired cylindrical shape. Consequently, primarily conical but sometimes even more complex, rather than cylindrical, craters are created. Their dimensions need to be analyzed to enable a direct correlation with the element-specific analytical signals. Here, a post-ablation analysis method is presented that combines generic polydimethylsiloxane-based molding of craters with the volumetric reconstruction of the crater&#39;s inverse using X-ray computed tomography. Automated analysis yields the full, sub-micron accurate anatomy of the craters, thereby a scalable and generic method to better understand the fundamentals underlying ablation processes applicable to a wide range of materials.

  abstract     = {Organoids that mimic the structural and cellular characteristics of kidneys in vitro have recently emerged as a promising source for biomedical research. However, uncontrollable cellular heterogeneity after differentiation often results in the generation of off-target cells, one of the most challenging issues in organoid research. This study proposes a new method that enables the real-time assessment of kidney organoids derived from stem cells. When placed on a conductive surface, these organoids generate unique electrochemical signals at ≈0.3 V with intensities proportional to the amount of kidney-specific cell types. Off-target cells (i.e., non-kidney cells) produce an electrical signature at 0 V that is distinguishable from other surrounding cell types, enabling non-destructive assessment of both the differentiation, and maturation levels of kidney organoids. The developed platform can be applied to other types of organoids and is thus highly promising as a tool for organoid-based drug screening, toxicity assessment, and therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as a kind of promising candidate for large-scale energy storage technology. The development of advanced carbon anodes with high Na-storage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) from low cost, resources abundant precursors is critical for SIBs. Here, a carbon microcrystalline hybridization route to synthesize hard carbons with extensive pseudo-graphitic regions from lignite coal with the assistance of sucrose is proposed. Employing the cross-linked interaction between sucrose and lignite coal to generate carbon-based hybrid microcrystalline states, the obtained hard carbons possess pseudo-graphitic dominant phases with large interlayer spaces that facilitate Na ion&#39;s storage and transportation, as well as fewer surface defects that guarantee high ICE. The LCS-73 with an optimum cross-link demonstrates the highest Na-storage capacity of 356 mAh g −1 and an ICE of 82.9%. The corresponding full-cell delivers a high energy density of 240 Wh kg −1 (based on the mass of anode and cathode materials) and excellent rate capability of 106 mAh g −1 at 10 C in addition to outstanding cycle performance with 80% retention over 500 cycles at 2 C. The proposed work offers an efficient route to develop high-performance, low-cost carbon-based anode materials with potential application for advanced SIBs.},

Besides, tooth whitening represents one of the fastest-growing areas of cosmetic dentistry. It will thus be great if tooth biofilm eradication can be combined with tooth whitening. Herein, a highly efficient photodynamic dental therapy strategy is reported for tooth biofilm eradication and tooth discoloration by employing a photosensitizer (DTTPB) with aggregation-induced emission characteristics. DTTPB can efficiently inactivate S. mutans , and inhibit biofilm formation by suppressing the expression of genes associated with extracellular polymeric substance synthesis, bacterial adhesion, and superoxide reduction. Its inhibition performance can be further enhanced through combined treatment with chlorhexidine. Besides, DTTPB exhibits an excellent tooth-discoloration effect on both colored saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and clinical teeth, with short treatment time (less than 1 h), better tooth-whitening performance than 30% hydrogen peroxide, and almost no damage to the teeth. DTTPB also demonstrates excellent biocompatibility with neglectable hemolysis effect on mouse red blood cells and almost no killing effect on mammalian cells, which enables its potential applications for simultaneous tooth biofilm eradication and tooth whitening in clinical dentistry.},

These attributes in combination with safe clinical application of gold salts make this process a viable strategy for clinical translation.

However, their in vivo behavior, including early diagnosis and therapeutic effect are limited by their targeting efficiency.

This nanodevice comprises three functional modules: a size-tunable TDF nanostructure as kidney-targeting vehicle, a binding module for the biomarker kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), and a NIR signaling module. The cooperation of these modules allows the nanodevice to be selectively accumulated in injured kidney tissues with high Kim-1 level, generating strong NIR fluorescence; whereas the nanodevice with the proper size can be rapidly cleared in healthy kidneys to minimize the background. By using this nanodevice, the early diagnosis of AKI onset is demonstrated at least 6 h ahead of Kim-1 urinalysis, or 12 h ahead of blood detection. It is envisioned that this TDF-based nanodevice may have implications for the early diagnosis of AKI and other kidney diseases.},

Herein, a biomimetic drug delivery system based on lemon-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) nanodrugs (marked with heparin-cRGD-EVs-doxorubicin (HRED)) is demonstrated, achieving highly efficient overcoming cancer multidrug resistance. The HRED is fabricated by modifying functional heparin-cRGD (HR) onto the surface of EVs and then by loading with doxorubicin (DOX). The obtained HRED enable to effectively enter DOX-resistant cancer cells by caveolin-mediated endocytosis (main), macropinocytosis (secondary), and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (last), exhibiting excellent cellular uptake capacity. The diversified endocytosis capacity of HRED can efficiently dissipate intracellular energy and meanwhile trigger downstream production reduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), leading to a significant reduction of drug efflux. Consequently, they show excellent anti-proliferation capacities to DOX-resistant ovarian cancer, ensuring the efficiently overcoming ovarian cancer multidrug resistance in vivo. The authors believe this strategy provides a new strategy by endocytosis triggered-energy dissipation and ATP production reduction to design drug delivery system for overcoming cancer multidrug resistance.},

Owing to the advantage of dynamically controlling the electromagnetic (EM) focusing in the wavefront engineering, a transmissive programmable metasurface is presented to illuminate the forearm with more focusing spots and obtain comprehensive echo data, which can be processed under the machine learning technology to reach the non-contact gesture recognition with high accuracy. Compared with the traditional passive antennas, unique variations of echo coefficients resulted from near fields perturbed by finger and wrist agonist muscles can be aquired through the programmable metasurface by switching the positions of EM focusing. The authors realize the gesture recognition using support vector machine algorithm based on five individual focusing spots data and all-five-spot data. The influences of the focusing spots on the gesture recognition are analyzed through linear discriminant analysis algorithm and Fisher score. Experimental verifications prove that the proposed metasurface-based non-contact wireless design can realize the classification of hand gesture recognition with higher accuracy than traditional passive antennas, and give an HMI solution.},

Herein, the fabrication of sulfide-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on surface of SiO/C anode to boost the reversible Li-storage performance at low temperature is reported. Different from the traditional SEI layer, the present modification layer is composed of inorganic–organic hybrid components with three continuous layers as disclosed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The result shows that ROSO 2 Li, ROCO 2 Li, and LiF uniformly distribute over different layers. When coupled with LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathode, the capacity retention achieves 73% at −20 °C. The first principle calculations demonstrate that the gradient adsorption of sulfide-rich surface layer and traditional intermediate layer can promote the desolvation of Li + at low temperature. Meanwhile, the inner LiF-rich layer with rapid ionic diffusion capability can inhibit dendrite growth. These results offer new perspective of developing advanced SiO/C anode and low-temperature Li-ion batteries.},

The present work demonstrates why at least a single molecule out of a few diffusing in a 100 µL volume has a high probability to hit a large capturing and detecting electronic interface. To this end, sensing data, measured with an electrolyte-gated FET whose gate is functionalized with 10 12 capturing anti-immunoglobulin G, are here provided along with a Brownian diffusion-based modeling. The EG-FET assays solutions down to some tens of zM in concentrations with volumes ranging from 25 µL to 1 mL in which the functionalized gates are incubated for times ranging from 30 s to 20 min. The high level of accordance between the experimental data and a model based on the Einstein&#39;s diffusion-theory proves how the single-molecule detection process at large-capturing interfaces is controlled by Brownian diffusion and yet is highly probable and fast.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cells are addicted to glutamine. However, cancer cells often suffer from glutamine starvation, which largely results from the fast growth of cancer cells and the insufficient vascularization in the interior of cancer tissues. Herein, based on clinical samples, patient-derived cells (PDCs), and cell lines, it is found that liver cancer cells display stem-like characteristics upon glutamine shortage due to maintaining the stemness of tumor initiating cells (TICs) and even promoting transformation of non-TICs into stem-like cells by glutamine starvation. Increased expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) is essential for maintaining and promoting stem-like characteristics of liver cancer cells during glutamine starvation. Mechanistically, glutamine starvation activates Rictor/mTORC2 to induce HDAC3-mediated deacetylation and stabilization of GS. Rictor is significantly correlated with the expression of GS and stem marker OCT4 at tumor site, and closely correlates with poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinomas. Inhibiting components of mTORC2-HDAC3-GS axis decrease TICs and promote xenografts regression upon glutamine-starvation therapy. Collectively, the data provides novel insights into the role of Rictor/mTORC2-HDAC3 in reprogramming glutamine metabolism to sustain stemness of cancer cells. Targeting Rictor/HDAC3 may enhance the efficacy of glutamine-starvation therapy and limit the rapid growth and malignant progression of tumors.},

  abstract     = {Materials that can efficiently convert heat into electricity are widely utilized in energy conversion technologies. The existing thermoelectrics demonstrate rather limited performance characteristics at room temperature, and hence, alternative materials and approaches are very much in demand. Here, it is experimentally shown that manipulating an applied stress can greatly improve a thermoelectric power factor of layered p -type SnSe single crystals up to ≈180 µW K −2 cm −1 at room temperature. This giant enhancement is explained by a synergetic effect of three factors, such as: band-gap narrowing, Lifshitz transition, and strong sample deformation. Under applied pressure above 1 GPa, the SnSe crystals become more ductile, which can be related to changes in the prevailing chemical bonding type inside the layers, from covalent toward metavalent. Thus, the SnSe single crystals transform into a highly unconventional crystalline state in which their layered crystal stacking is largely preserved, while the layers themselves are strongly deformed. This results in a dramatic narrowing in a band gap, from E g = 0.83 to 0.50 eV (at ambient conditions). Thus, the work demonstrates a novel strategy of improving the performance parameters of chalcogenide thermoelectrics via tuning their chemical bonding type, stimulating a sample deformation and a band-structure reconstruction.},

Thus, the synthesis and characterization of these unique polyarenes with well-defined defective topologies have attracted increasing attention. Despite extensive research on nonalternant molecules since the last century, most studies focused on the corresponding mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. Recently, researchers have realized that the defective domain induces geometric bending and causes electronic perturbation, thus leading to significant alteration of the photophysical properties. This review discusses the synthesis and characterization of small nonalternant polycyclic hydrocarbons in the early stage and recent developments in embedding pentagon–heptagon (5–7) pairs into large carbon skeletons through in-solution chemistry.},

This huge variety not only represents enormous challenges for synthesis but also for theory, which aims at a comprehensive understanding and structuring of the plethora of possible compounds. Eventually computational methods should point to new, better materials, which have not yet been synthesized. In this perspective, it is shown that the answer to this question rests upon the delicate balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of the methods used in the virtual screening. To illustrate the fundamentals of virtual screening, chemical design of non-fullerene acceptors, thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, and nanographenes are discussed.},

This work reports the solution synthesis of a long and curved multi-edged GNR ( cMGNR ) with unprecedented cove–armchair–gulf edge structures. The synthesis involves an efficient A 2 B 2 -type Diels–Alder polymerization between a diethynyl-substituted prefused bichrysene monomer ( 3b ) and a dicyclopenta[ e , l ]pyrene-5,11-dione derivative ( 6 ) followed by FeCl 3 -mediated Scholl oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the obtained polyarylenes ( P1 ). Model compounds 1a and 1b are first synthesized to examine the suitability and efficiency of the corresponding polymers for the Scholl reaction. The successful formation of cMGNR from polymer P1 bearing prefused bichrysene units is confirmed by FTIR, Raman, and solid-state NMR analyses. The cove-edge structure of the cMGNR imparts the ribbon with a unique nonplanar conformation as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) simulation, which effectively enhances its dispersibility in solution. The cMGNR has a narrow optical bandgap of 1.61 eV, as estimated from the UV–vis absorption spectrum, which is among the family of low-bandgap solution-synthesized GNRs. Moreover, the cMGNR exhibits a carrier mobility of ≈2 cm 2 V −1 s −1 inferred from contact-free terahertz spectroscopy.},

Nevertheless, the extensive studies on BN-heteroarenes are largely limited to 1,2-azaborine-based compounds with B–N covalent bonds, whereas 1,3- and 1,4-BN-heteroarenes are relatively rare due to their greater challenge in the synthesis. Recently, significant progresses have been achieved in the synthesis and applications of BN-heteroarenes featuring 1,4-azaborines, especially driven by their significant potential as multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials. Therefore, it is timely to review these advances from the chemistry perspective. This review summarizes the synthetic methods and recent achievements of 1,4-azaborine-based BN-heteroarenes and discusses their unique properties and potential applications of this emerging class of materials, highlighting the value of 1,4-BN-heteroarenes beyond MR-TADF materials. It is hoped that this review would stimulate the conversation and cooperation between chemists who are interested in azaborine chemistry and materials scientists working in the fields of organic optoelectronics, metal catalysis, and carbon-based nanoscience etc.},

Here, it is demonstrated how resonant tunneling effect induces single molecular isomerization in a 2D crystal, self-assembled at solid–liquid interfaces under ambient conditions. Monolayers of a series of four π -expanded oligothiophene macrocycles are investigated by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at the interface between their octanoic acid solutions and the basal plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Current–voltage characteristics confirm the donor-type character of the macrocycles, with the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) positions consistent with time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Cyclic STS measurements show the redox isomerization from Z,Z -8T6A to its isomer E,E -8T6A occurring in the 2D crystal, due to the formation of a negatively charged species when the tunneling current is in resonance with the LUMO of the macrocycle.},

Here, an N-containing pentacene-based precursor (tetraazapentacene) is ex-professo synthesized endowed with terminal dibromomethylene (:CBr 2 ) groups to steer homocoupling via dehalogenation on metallic supports. Combined scanning probe microscopy investigations complemented by theoretical calculations reveal how the substrate selection drives different reaction mechanisms. On Ag(111) the dissociation of bromine atoms at room temperature triggers the homocoupling of tetraazapentacene units together with the binding of silver adatoms to the nitrogen atoms of the monomers giving rise to a N-containing conjugated coordination polymer ( P1 ). Subsequently, P1 undergoes ladderization at 200 °C, affording a pyrrolopyrrole-bridged conjugated polymer ( P2 ). On Au(111) the formation of the intermediate polymer P1 is not observed and, instead, after annealing at 100 °C, the conjugated ladder polymer P2 is obtained, revealing the crucial role of metal adatoms on Ag(111) as compared to Au(111). Finally, on Ag(100) the loss of :CBr2 groups affords the formation of tetraazapentacene monomers, which coexist with polymer P1 . Our results contribute to introduce protocols for the synthesis of N-containing conjugated polymers, illustrating the selective role of the metallic support in the underlying reaction mechanisms.},

However, the necessary vacuum processing makes the fabrication of large-area devices based on these emitters cumbersome and expensive. Here, the authors present high performance OLEDs, based on novel, TADF polymers that can be readily processed from a solution. These polymers are based on the acridine-benzophenone donor–acceptor motif as main-chain TADF chromophores, linked by various conjugated and non-conjugated spacer moieties. The authors’ extensive spectroscopic and electronic analysis shows that in particular in case of alkyl spacers, the properties and performance of the monomeric TADF chromophores are virtually left unaffected by the polymerization. They present efficient solution-processed OLEDs based on these TADF polymers, diluted in oligostyrene as a host. The devices based on the alkyl spacer-based TADF polymers exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) ≈12%, without any outcoupling-enhancing measures. What&#39;s more, the EQE of these devices does not drop substantially upon diluting the polymer down to only ten weight percent of active material. In contrast, the EQE of devices based on the monomeric chromophore show significant losses upon dilution due to loss of charge percolation.},

In this study, 5,5′-bibenzo[ rst ]pentaphene (BBPP) with two benzo[ rst ]pentaphene (BPP) units is synthesized in an efficient and versatile approach, and its structure is unambiguously elucidated by X-ray crystallography. BBPP exhibits axial chirality, and the ( M )- and ( P )-enantiomers are resolved by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography and studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These enantiomers have a relatively high isomerization barrier of 43.6 kcal mol −1 calculated by density functional theory. The monomer BPP and dimer BBPP are characterized by UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The results indicate that both BPP and BBPP fluoresce from a formally dark S 1 electronic state that is enabled by Herzberg–Teller intensity borrowing from a neighboring bright S 2 state. While BPP exhibits a relatively low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), BBPP exhibits a significantly enhanced PLQY due to a greater S 2 intensity borrowing. Moreover, symmetry-breaking charge transfer in BBPP is demonstrated by spectroscopic investigations in solvents of different polarity. This suggests high potential for singlet fission in such π -extended biaryls through appropriate molecular design.},

Herein, the preparation of a series of open-shell, π -extended Pors that contain magnetically active metal ions (i.e., Cu II , Co II , and Fe II ) through a combination of in-solution and on-surface synthesis is reported. A detailed study of the magnetic interplay between π - and d -electrons in these metalloPors has been performed by scanning probe methods and density functional theory calculations. For the Cu and FePors, ferromagnetically coupled π -electrons are determined to be delocalized over the Por edges. For the CoPor, the authors find a Kondo resonance resulting from the singly occupied Co II d z 2 orbital to dominate the magnetic fingerprint. The Fe derivative exhibits the highest magnetization of 3.67 μ B (S≈2) and an exchange coupling of 16 meV between the π -electrons and the Fe d -states.},

  abstract     = {A family of tunable halochromic switches is developed using a naphthalimide-fused dipyrrin as the core π -conjugated motif. Electronic properties of these dipyrrins are tuned by substitution of their alpha and meso positions with aryl groups of variable donor–acceptor strength. The first protonation results in a conformational change that enhances electronic coupling between the dipyrrin chromophore and the meso substituent, leading to halochromic effects that occasionally exceed 200 nm and switch the absorption between the near-infrared (NIR)-I and NIR-II ranges. A NIR-II photothermal effect, switchable by acid–base chemistry is demonstrated for selected dipyrrins. Further protonation is possible for derivatives bearing additional amino groups, leading to up to four halochromic switching step. The most electron-rich dipyrrins are also susceptible to chemical oxidation, yielding NIR-absorbing radical cations and closed-shell dications.},

  abstract     = {The charge transport of crystalline organic semiconductors is limited by dynamic disorder that tends to localize charges. It is the main hurdle to overcome in order to significantly increase charge carrier mobility. An innovative design that combines a chemical structure based on sulfur-rich thienoacene with a solid-state herringbone (HB) packing is proposed and the synthesis, physicochemical characterization, and charge transport properties of two new thienoacenes bearing a central tetrathienyl core fused with two external naphthyl rings: naphtho[2,3-b]thieno-[2′′′,3′′′:4′′,5′′]thieno[2″,3″:4′,5′]thieno[3′,2′-b]naphtho[2,3-b]thiophene (DN4T) and naphtho[1,2-b]thieno-[2′′′,3′′′:4′′,5′′]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[3′,2′-b]naphtho[1,2-b]thiophene are presented. Both compounds crystallize with a HB pattern structure and present transfer integrals ranging from 33 to 99 meV (for the former) within the HB plane of charge transport. Molecular dynamics simulations point toward an efficient resilience of the transfer integrals to the intermolecular sliding motion commonly responsible for strong variations of the electronic coupling in the crystal. Best device performances are reached with DN4T with hole mobility up to μ = 2.1 cm 2 V −1 s −1 in polycrystalline organic field effect transistors, showing the effectiveness of the electronic coupling enabled by the new aromatic core. These promising results pave the way to the design of high-performing materials based on this new thienoacene, notably through the introduction of alkyl side-chains.},

  abstract     = {Most of the reported covalent organic frameworks (COFs) so far are prepared from highly symmetric building blocks, which to some extent limits the expansion of COF diversity and complexity. Low-symmetric building blocks can be designed through a desymmetrized vertex strategy, which might be used to construct new topological COFs. But reports of COFs constructed by asymmetric building blocks are thus far very rare. Here, a feasible strategy to design asymmetric building blocks for COF synthesis is introduced, by simply varying the positions of functional groups in the monomer. As a proof of concept, two isomeric hexaphenylbenzene-based “two-in-one” type monomers (1,2,4-HPB-NH 2 and 1,3,5-HPB-NH 2 ) are designed and synthesized. To the authors’ surprise, self-polycondensation of the asymmetric 1,2,4-HPB-NH 2 (i.e., the isomer of common C 3 -symmetric 1,3,5-HPB-NH 2 ) also affords highly crystalline COF (1,2,4-HPB-COF) similar to the symmetric 1,3,5-HPB-NH 2 counterpart with identical topological structure. The triangular porous structures of both HPB-based COFs are well resolved by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), theoretical simulations, nitrogen sorption, and morphologies analysis. This work demonstrates the “two-in-one” type asymmetric building blocks can also produce highly crystalline frameworks and thus provides a new structural design strategy for reticular chemistry.},

Therefore, this review summarizes the recent advances in this research field combining the viewpoints of polymer and trituration mechanochemistry.

It is shown here that a water-soluble atomically-precise GQD (WAGQD-C 96 ) is synthesized and exhibits a deep-red emission and excellent sonodynamic sensitization. By decorating sterically hindered water-soluble functional groups, WAGQD-C 96 can be monodispersed in water without further aggregation. The deep-red emission of WAGQD-C 96 facilitates the tracking of its bio-process, showing a good cell-uptake and long-time retention in tumor tissue. Compared to traditional molecular sonosensitizers, WAGQD-C 96 generates superior reactive oxygen species and demonstrates excellent tumor inhibition potency as an anti-cancer sonosensitizer in in vivo studies. A good biosafety of WAGQD-C 96 is validated in both in vitro and in vivo assays.},

  abstract     = {Covalent functionalization of graphene (CFG) has shown attractive advantages in tuning the electronic, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of graphene. However, facile, large-scale, controllable, and highly efficient CFG remains challenging and often involves highly reactive and volatile compounds, requiring complex control of the reaction conditions. Here, a diazonium-based grafting ink consisting of only two components, i.e., an aryl diazonium salt and the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is presented. The efficient functionalization is attributed to the combination of the solvation of the diazonium cations by DMSO and n -doping of graphene by DMSO, thereby promoting electron transfer (ET) from graphene to the diazonium cations, resulting in the generation of aryl radicals which subsequently react with the graphene. The grafting density of CFG is controlled by the reaction time and very high levels of functionalization, up to the failing of the Tuinstra–Koenig (T–K) relation, while the functionalization layer remains at monolayer height. The grafting ink, effective for days at room temperature, can be used at ambient conditions and renders the patterning CFG by direct writing as easy as writing on paper. In combination with thermal sample treatment, reversible functionalization is possible by subsequent writing/erasing cycles.},

However, for most crystalline compounds, the changing of solvent would not influence the crystalline phase, let alone their physical performance. Here, the solvent selective effect occurs in the iodinated adamantanone ferroelectrics. By changing the solvent with different polarities, the ferroelectric crystals can be induced in two different phases, which is unprecedented to the knowledge. More strikingly, this solvent-induced transformation could realize the physical performance optimization in the orthorhombic phase ( orth -I-OA, obtained from ethanol) with a stronger second harmonic generation (SHG) response, greater piezoelectric coefficient d 33 of 5 pC N −1 , and larger spontaneous polarization ( P s ) of 3.43 µC cm −2 than those of monoclinic one ( mono -I-OA, obtained from ethyl acetate). Such an intriguing phenomenon might be closely related to solvent polarity. Based on the quantitative and qualitative analyses, the similar interaction energies of these two phases suggest that their transformation could be easily realized via changing the solvent.

High temperature and external doping are inevitably introduced and thus greatly hamper the applications of inorganic materials for mass production of flexible and tandem devices. Here, an amorphous and dopant-free inorganic material, Ni 3+ -rich NiO x , is reported to be fabricated by a novel UV irradiation strategy, which is facile, easily scaled-up, and energy-saving because all the processing temperatures are below 82 ℃. The as-prepared NiO x film shows highly improved conductivity and hole extraction ability. The rigid and flexible PSCs present the champion efficiencies of 22.45% and 19.7%, respectively. This work fills the gap of preparing metal oxide films at the temperature below 150 °C for inverted PSCs with the high efficiency of &gt;22%. More importantly, this work upgrades the substantial understanding about inorganic materials to function well as efficient carrier transport layers without external doping and high crystallization.},

  abstract     = {The slime of velvet worms (Onychophora) is a strong and fully biodegradable protein material, which upon ejection undergoes a fast liquid-to-solid transition to ensnare prey. However, the molecular mechanisms of slime self-assembly are still not well understood, notably because the primary structures of slime proteins are yet unknown. Combining transcriptomic and proteomic studies, the authors have obtained the complete primary sequences of slime proteins and identified key features for slime self-assembly. The high molecular weight slime proteins contain cysteine residues at the N- and C-termini that mediate the formation of multi-protein complexes via disulfide bonding. Low complexity domains in the N-termini are also identified and their propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation is established, which may play a central role in slime biofabrication. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, rigid and flexible domains of the slime proteins are mapped to specific peptide domains. The complete sequencing of major slime proteins is an important step toward sustainable fabrication of polymers inspired by the velvet worm slime.},

During the thermal reorganization, the in situ reaction between NiS 2 nanoparticles and carbon induces the formation of Ni 3 C between them and constructs tightly contacted two kinds of interfaces among the three components. The TEM and XPS reveal the intimately contacted three components and the as-constructed interacted dual interfaces, further confirming the formation of a porous double-heterojunctional nanostructure. Theoretical calculations uncover that the electron density redistribution occurs at Ni 3 C/C interface by spontaneous electron transfer from defected carbon to Ni 3 C and lower ΔG H* achieves at NiS 2 /Ni 3 C interface by the concentrated interfacial charge density, which favors the simultaneous realization of high catalytic activity and rapid charge/mass transfer. When applied for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the porous double-heterojunctional NiS 2 /Ni 3 C@C exhibits excellent HER activity and durability among all pH values.

  abstract     = {Topological field-effect transistor is a revolutionary concept that physical fields are used to switch on and off quantum topological states of the condensed matter. Although this emerging concept has been explored in electronics, how to realize it in the acoustic realm remains elusive. In this work, a class of magnetoactive acoustic topological transistors capable of on-demand switching on and off topological states and reconfiguring topological edges with external magnetic fields is presented. The key mechanism is to harness magnetic fields to tune air-cavity volumes within acoustic chambers, thus breaking or preserving the inversion symmetry to manifest or conceal the quantum valley Hall effect. To switch the topological transport beyond the in-plane routes, a magneto-tuned non-topological band gap to allow or forbid the wave transport out-of-plane is harnessed. With the reversible magnetic control, on-demand switching of topological routes to realize topological field-effect waveguides and wave regulators is demonstrated. Analogous to the impact of semiconductor transistors on modern electronics, this work may expand the scope of topological acoustics by achieving unprecedented functions in acoustic modulation.},

This hampers the capacity to predict the future of forest rewilding under changing global climates. Here, 120 studies are synthesized across five continents, and it is found that forest restoration promotes multiple dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem function such as soil fertility, plant biomass, microbial habitat, and carbon sequestration across contrasting climates and forest types. Based on global relationship between stand age and soil organic carbon stock, planting 350 million hectares of forest under the UN Bonn Challenge can sequester &gt;30 Gt soil C in the surface 20 cm over the next century. However, these findings also indicate that predicted increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation can constrain the positive effects of forest rewilding on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Further, important tradeoffs are found in very old forests, with considerable disconnection between biodiversity and ecosystem function. Together, these findings provide evidence of the importance of the multidimensional rewilding of forests, suggesting that on-going climatic changes may dampen the expectations of the positive effects of forest restoration on biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

Here, a dielectric elastomer nanogenerator (DENG) is reported, which consists of a dielectric elastomer capacitor, an electret electrostatic voltage source, and a charge pump circuit. Under biaxial stretching, DENG can convert tensile mechanical energy into electrical power without any external power supply. Different from traditional DEG with the charge outward transfer in direct current (DC), the DENG works based on shuttle movement of internal charges in an alternating current (AC). Through alternating current (AC) method, the charge density of the DENG can reach 26 mC m −2 per mechanical cycle, as well as energy density of up to 140 mJ g −1 . Due to the all-solid-state structure without air gap, the DENG is capable of working stably under different ambient humidity (20 RH%–100 RH%). To demonstrate the applications, a water wave harvester based on the DENG is constructed. The integrated device powers a sensing communication module for self-powered remote weather monitoring, showing the potential application in ocean wave energy harvesting.},

The authors developed a novel method to identify the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and predict seizure outcome using short-time resting-state stereotacticelectroencephalography (SEEG) data. In a cohort of 27 drug-resistant epilepsy patients, the authors estimated the information flow via directional connectivity and inferred the excitation-inhibition ratio from the 1/ f power slope. They hypothesized that the antagonism of information flow at multiple frequencies between SOZ and non-SOZ underlying the relatively stable epilepsy resting state could be related to the disrupted excitation-inhibition balance. They found flatter 1/ f power slope in non-SOZ regions compared to the SOZ, with dominant information flow from non-SOZ to SOZ regions. Greater differences in resting-state information flow between SOZ and non-SOZ regions are associated with favorable seizure outcome. By integrating a balanced random forest model with resting-state connectivity, their method localized the SOZ with an accuracy of 88% and predicted the seizure outcome with an accuracy of 92% using clinically determined SOZ. Overall, this study suggests that brief resting-state SEEG data can significantly facilitate the identification of SOZ and may eventually predict seizure outcomes without requiring long-term ictal recordings.},

However, the identification and interpretation of SVs in human cancer remain technologically challenging. Here, long-read sequencing is first employed to depict the signatures of structural variations in carcinogenesis of human pancreatic ductal epithelium. Then widespread reprogramming of the 3D chromatin architecture is revealed by an in situ Hi-C technique. Integrative analyses indicate that the distribution pattern of SVs among the 3D genome is highly cell-type specific and the bulk remodeling effects of SVs in the chromatin organization partly depend on intercellular genomic heterogeneity. Meanwhile, contact domains tend to minimize these disrupting effects of SVs within local adjacent genomic regions to maintain overall stability. Notably, complex genomic rearrangements involving two key driver genes CDKN2A and SMAD4 are identified, and their influence on the expression of oncogenes MIR31HG , MYO5B , etc., are further elucidated from both a linear view and 3D perspective. Overall, this work provides a genome-wide resource and highlights the impact, complexity, and dynamicity of the interplay between structural variations and high-order chromatin organization, which expands the current understanding of the pathogenesis of SVs in human cancer.},

The unique wide range of IV valence alloys helps to understand the nature of amorphous (a-) and nanocrystalline (nc-) hydrogenated (:H) germanium films with respect to the intrinsicity, chemical stability, and photoresponse.

The spatial distribution of cells is crucial for directing cellular behavior and maintaining tissue homeostasis and function. Herein, an artificial bone bioceramic scaffold with star-, Tai Chi-, or interlacing-shaped multicellular patterns is constructed. The “cross-talk” between mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and macrophages can be effectively manipulated by altering the spatial distribution of two kinds of cells in the scaffolds, thus achieving controllable modulation of the scaffold-mediated osteo-immune responses. Compared with other multicellular patterns, the Tai Chi pattern with a 2:1 ratio of MSCs to macrophages is more effective in activating anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, improving MSCs osteogenic differentiation, and accelerating new bone formation in vivo. In brief, the Tai Chi pattern generates a more favorable osteo-immune environment for bone regeneration, exhibiting enhanced immunomodulation and osteogenesis, which may be associated with the activation of BMP-Smad, Oncostatin M (OSM), and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in MSCs mediated by macrophage-derived paracrine signaling mediators.

  abstract     = {Previously, this study demonstrates the critical role of myeloid specific TLR4 in macrophage-mediated progressive renal injury in anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) crescentic glomerulonephritis (cGN); however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), pseudotime trajectories reconstruction, and motif enrichment analysis are used, and macrophage diversity in anti-GBM cGN under tight regulation of myeloid-TLR4 is uncovered. Most significantly, a myeloid-TLR4 deletion-induced novel reparative macrophage phenotype ( Nr4a1 + Ear2+ ) with significant upregulated anti-inflammatory and tissue repair-related signaling is discovered, thereby suppressing the M1 proinflammatory responses in anti-GBM cGN. This is further demonstrated in vitro that deletion of TLR4 from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) induces the Nr4a1/Ear2 -expressing anti-inflammatory macrophages while blocking LPS-stimulated M1 proinflammatory responses. Mechanistically, activation of the Nr4a1/Ear2-axis is recognized as a key mechanism through which deletion of myeloid-TLR4 promotes the anti-inflammatory macrophage differentiation in vivo and in vitro. This is confirmed by specifically silencing macrophage Nr4a1 or Ear2 to reverse the anti-inflammatory effects on TLR4 deficient BMDMs upon LPS stimulation. In conclusion, the findings decode a previously unidentified role for a myeloid-TLR4 dependent Nr4a1/Ear2 negative feedback mechanism in macrophage-mediated progressive renal injury, implying that activation of Nr4a1-Ear2 axis can be a novel and effective immunotherapy for anti-GBM cGN.},

  abstract     = {Ni-rich cathodes with high energy densities are considered as promising candidates for advanced lithium-ion batteries, whereas their commercial application is in dilemma due to dramatic capacity decay and poor structure stability stemmed from interfacial instability, structural degradation, and stress–strain accumulation, as well as intergranular cracks. Herein, a piezoelectric LiTaO 3 (LTO) layer is facilely deposited onto Li[Ni x Co y Mn 1− x − y ]O 2 ( x = 0.6, 0.8) cathodes to induce surface polarized electric fields via the intrinsic stress–strain of Ni-rich active materials, thus modulating interfacial Li + kinetics upon cycling. Various characterizations indicate that the electrochemical performances of LTO-modified cathodes are obviously enhanced even under large current density and elevated temperature. Intensive explorations from in situ X-ray diffraction technique, finite element analysis, and first-principle calculation manifest that the improvement mechanism of LTO decoration can be attributed to the enhanced structural stability of bulk material, suppressed stress accumulation, and regulated ion transportation. These findings provide deep insight into surface coupling strategy between mechanical and electric fields to regulate the interfacial Li + kinetics behavior and enhance structure stability for Ni-rich cathodes, which will also arouse great interest from scientists and engineers in multifunctional surface engineering for electrochemical systems.},

  abstract     = {HgTe film is widely used for quantum Hall well studies and devices, as it has unique properties, like band gap inversion, carrier-type switch, and topological evolution depending on the film thickness modulation near the so-called critical thickness (63.5 Å), while its counterpart bulk materials do not hold these nontrivial properties at ambient pressure. Here, much richer transport properties emerging in bulk HgTe crystal through pressure-tuning are reported. Not only the above-mentioned abnormal properties can be realized in a 400 nm thick bulk HgTe single crystal, but superconductivity is also discovered in a series of high-pressure phases. Combining crystal structure, electrical transport, and Hall coefficient measurements, a p-n carrier type switching is observed in the first high-pressure cinnabar phase. Superconductivity emerges after the semiconductor-to-metal transition at 3.9 GPa and persists up to 54 GPa, crossing four high-pressure phases with an increased upper critical field. Density functional theory calculations confirm that a surface-dominated topologic band structure contributes these exotic properties under high pressure. This discovery presents broad and efficient tuning effects by pressure on the lattice structure and electronic modulations compared to the thickness-dependent critical properties in 2D and 3D topologic insulators and semimetals.},

In this study, for the first time, multifunctional Zn clusters with shape memory, self-healing, triboelectricity, and optical sensing synergized with rollable form factor are designed and fabricated by coordinating  COO − and Zn 2+ . As pore forming agent, Zn clusters produce hierarchical porous structure depending on Zn amount. Zn clusters are applied as message transmitters and charge containers in optical sensing and corona charge injection, respectively. Moreover, Zn clusters in PVB-COO-Zn serve as positive tribomaterial due to Zn ion doping effect, increasing the output performance as the Zn amount reaches 20 wt%. In addition, injecting positive charge into PVB-COO-Zn 20 lead to more than 24 times increase in output performance compared to those of non-porous structures. The reversibility of Zn clusters endows shape memory and self-healing, synergized with the rollable form factor. The rollability is implemented using the long alkyl chain and the energy absorption of porous structure, providing damage resistance. The advancements in this work provide opportunities for multifunctional and unique applications (shape memory rotating-triboelectric nanogenerator, rollable self-healing touchpad, hidden tag) synergized with rollability that accomplishes working in broadened condition in near future.},

Herein, an edge-connected 2D/2D Z-scheme system that combines the facet junction and the interfacial heterojunction to achieve effective long-range charge separation and large reactive surface exposure is designed and fabricated. The heterostructure is realized by the selective growth of 2D-layered MoS 2 nanoflakes on the edge-sites of thin TiO 2 nanosheets via an Au-promoted photodeposition method. Attributed to the synergetic coupling of the facet junction and the interfacial heterojunction that assures the effective charge separation, and the tremendous but physically separated reactive sites offered by layered MoS 2 and highly-exposed (001) facets of TiO 2 , respectively, the artificial Z-scheme exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance in photodegradation tests. Moreover, the junctional plasmonic Au nanoclusters not only act as electron traps to promote the edge-selective synthesis but also generate “hot electrons” to further boost photocatalytic performance. The Z-scheme charge-flow direction in the heterostructure and the roles of electrons and holes are comprehensively studied using in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and photodegradation tests.

Herein, the crystal structure stability, charge/ion state, and bandgap of the active materials are found to be precisely modulated by favorable heteroatom doping, resulting in intrinsically fast kinetics of the electrode materials. Based on the combined mechanisms of intercalation and conversion reactions, electron and K + ion transfer in Ni-doped CoSe 2 embedded in carbon nanocomposites (Ni-CoSe 2 @NC) can be significantly enhanced via electronic engineering. Benefiting from the synthetic controlled Ni grains, the heterointerface formed by the intermediate products of electrochemical reactions in Ni-CoSe 2 @NC strengthens the conversion kinetics and interdiffusion process, developing a low-barrier mesophase with optimized potassium storage.

Here, a stacked quasi-2D (down)–3D (top) double-layered structure in perovskite films prepared via vacuum treatment is demonstrated, which can result in a planar bilayer heterojunction. In addition, it is found that the introduction of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) additive can improve the crystallinity and carrier mobility in the 2D perovskite layer and passivate defects in the whole film, leading to a long carrier lifetime (&gt;140 ns) in photoluminescence measurements. As a result, the PSCs show a high open circuit voltage (V OC ) up to 1.01 V with a voltage loss of only 0.39 V, which represents the record values ever reported for tin-based PSCs. The champion device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.79% with decent stability, retaining 90% of the initial PCE for 1200 h storage in N 2 -filled glovebox.},

Herein, ion conductivity of composite SSEs is characterized in an unprecedentedly wide frequency range of 10 –2 –10 10 Hz by combining chronoamperometry, electrochemical impedance spectrum, and dielectric spectrum. Using this method, it is unraveled that how the volume fraction v and surface fluorine content x F of TiO 2 fillers tune the ionic conductivity of composite SSEs. It is identified that activation energy E a is more important than carrier concentration c in this game. Specifically, c increases with v while E a has the minimum value at v = 10% and increases at larger v . Moreover, E a is further correlated with the dielectric constant of the SSE via the Marcus theory. A conductivity of 3.1×10 –5 S cm −1 is obtained at 30 °C by tuning v and x F , which is 15 times higher than that of the original SSE.

  abstract     = {The success of machine learning (ML) in materials property prediction depends heavily on how the materials are represented for learning. Two dominant families of material descriptors exist, one that encodes crystal structure in the representation and the other that only uses stoichiometric information with the hope of discovering new materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular have excelled in predicting material properties within chemical accuracy. However, current GNNs are limited to only one of the above two avenues owing to the little overlap between respective material representations. Here, a new concept of formula graph which unifies stoichiometry-only and structure-based material descriptors is introduced. A self-attention integrated GNN that assimilates a formula graph is further developed and it is found that the proposed architecture produces material embeddings transferable between the two domains. The proposed model can outperform some previously reported structure-agnostic models and their structure-based counterparts while exhibiting better sample efficiency and faster convergence. Finally, the model is applied in a challenging exemplar to predict the complex dielectric function of materials and nominate new substances that potentially exhibit epsilon-near-zero phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Rational architecture design of the artificial protective layer on the zinc (Zn) anode surface is a promising strategy to achieve uniform Zn deposition and inhibit the uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites. Herein, a red phosphorous-derived artificial protective layer combined with a conductive N-doped carbon framework is designed to achieve dendrite-free Zn deposition. The Zn–phosphorus (ZnP) solid solution alloy artificial protective layer is formed during Zn plating. Meanwhile, the dynamic evolution mechanism of the ZnP on the Zn anode is successfully revealed. The concentration gradient of the electrolyte on the electrode surface can be redistributed by this protective layer, thereby achieving a uniform Zn-ion flux. The fabricated Zn symmetrical battery delivers a dendrite-free plating/stripping for 1100 h at the current density of 2.0 mA cm –2 . Furthermore, aqueous Zn//MnO 2 full cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 200 mAh g –1 after 350 cycles at 1.0 A g –1 . This study suggests an effective solution for the suppression of Zn dendrites in Zn metal batteries, which is expected to provide a deep insight into the design of high-performance rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {Magnesium (Mg)-ion batteries with low cost and good safety characteristics has attracted a great deal of attention recently. However, the high polarity and the slow diffusion of Mg 2+ in the cathode material limit the development of practical Mg cathode materials. In this paper, an anion-rich electrode material, NiS 2 , and its composite with Ni-based carbon nanotubes (NiS 2 /NCNTs) are explored as the cathode materials for Mg-ion batteries. These NiS 2 /NCNTs with excellent Mg 2+ storage property is synthesized by a simple in situ growth of NiS 2 nanoparticles on NCNTs. NiS 2 with both a large regular cavity structure and abundant sulfur-sulfur (S  S) bonds with high electronegativity can provide a large number of active sites and unobstructed transport paths for the insertion–disinsertion of Mg 2+ . With the aid of 3D NCNTs skeleton as the transport channel of the electron, the NiS 2 /NCNTs exhibit a high capacity of 244.5 mAh g −1 at 50 mA g −1 and an outstanding rate performance (94.7 mAh g −1 at 1000 mA g −1 ). It achieves capacitance retention of 58% after 2000 cycles at 200 mA g −1 . Through theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations and a series of systematic ex situ characterizations, the magnesiation/demagnesiation mechanisms of NiS 2 and NiS 2 /NCNTs and are elucidated for fundamental understanding.},

  abstract     = {Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) has a significant impact on quality of life, but the etiopathogenesis remains largely unknown. The bladder microenvironment of patients with IC/BPS to obtain biological evidence supporting diagnosis and novel therapy is systematically characterized. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and image mass cytometry (IMC) are applied to bladder biopsies of the IC/BPS cohort. A total of 42 distinct cell clusters are identified from different groups. The increased hyperactivated Th1-biased response, but not Th2-biased response, and decreased immunosuppressive Treg are elucidated in the bladder microenvironment of non-Hunner-type IC (NHIC)/Hunner-type IC (HIC). M2/M2-like macrophage extends in the HIC and M1-like macrophage extends in NHIC, all of which secrete a range of chemokines with different pattern. The pro-inflammatory mediators, TNF-α, produced by tissue-resident macrophages and IL6, by the inflammatory fibroblasts are identified as key mediators of IC/BPS pathogenesis. Additionally, a regulatory network between different cell types is observed as a shift from structural cell communication in unaffected normal bladder to a Macrophage-Endothelial-dominated interactome in NHIC/HIC. The results demonstrate the high heterogeneity in NHIC/HIC, and provide an essential resource for diagnosis, and treatment of IC/BPS in the future by highlighting the importance of the microenvironment of bladder mucosa.},

  abstract     = {Piezoceramic films are an essential class of energy-conversion materials that have been widely used in the electronics industry. Although current methods create a great freedom for fabricating high-quality piezoceramic films, it requires well-controlled synthesis conditions, including special high-cost equipment and planar substrates particularly. The limited substrate selections hinder the applications of piezoceramic films in 3D conformal structures where most objects possess complex curvilinear surfaces. To overcome such limitations, a fast, energy-efficient, and cost-effective approach, named flame treated spray (FTS) coating, is developed for preparing piezoceramic films on free-form surfaces. The flame treatment significantly enhances the hydrophilicity of a substrate, assisting in forming a uniform and continuous thin film. The followed spray coating deposits hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers thick films on 3D free-form surfaces. Given the size controllability and arbitrary surface compatibility of the FTS method, a highly conformal piezoelectric tactile sensor array (4 × 4) is assembled on a spherical surface for mimicking robot fingers and an on-site thin-film sensor on the wing of an aircraft model to monitor the vibration in real-time during flight. The FTS film deposition offers a highly promising methodology for the application of functional thin-film from micro- to marcoscale devices, regardless of conformal problems.},

It identifies an odor source by analyzing the complicated mixed signals using a spiking neural network (SNN). The proposed E-nose does not require conversion circuits, which are essential for processing the sensory signals between the sensor array and processors in the conventional bulky E-nose. In addition, they do not have to include a central processing unit (CPU) and memory, which are required for von Neumann computing. The spike transmission of the biological olfactory system, which is known to be the main factor for reducing power consumption, is realized with the SNN for power savings compared to the conventional E-nose with a deep neural network (DNN).

A cytotoxicity test is also performed on MDABCO-NH 4 I 3 to evaluate its low-toxic nature. The as-synthesized MDABCO-NH 4 I 3 is further integrated into a piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG). The MDABCO-NH 4 I 3 -based PENG (MN-PENG) exhibits optimal output voltage and current of 15.9 V and 54.5 nA, respectively. In addition, the MN-PENG can serve as a self-powered strain sensor for human–machine interface applications or be adopted in in vitro electrical stimulation devices.

Unfortunately, nonuniform lithium deposition and dendrite penetration due to poor interfacial solid–solid contact are hindering their practical applications. Here, solid-state lithium naphthalenide (Li-Naph(s)) is introduced as a plastic monolithic mixed-conducting interlayer (PMMCI) between the garnet electrolyte and the Li anode via a facile cold process. The thin PMMCI shows a well-ordered layered crystalline structure with excellent mixed-conducting capability for both Li + (4.38 × 10 –3 S cm –1 ) and delocalized electrons (1.01 × 10 –3 S cm –1 ). In contrast to previous composite interlayers, this monolithic material enables an intrinsically homogenous electric field and Li + transport at the Li/garnet interface, thus significantly reducing the interfacial resistance and achieving uniform and dendrite-free Li anode plating/stripping. As a result, Li symmetric cells with the PMMCI-modified garnet electrolyte show highly stable cycling for 1200 h at 0.2 mA cm –2 and 500 h at a high current density of 1 mA cm –2 . The findings provide a new interface design strategy for solid-state batteries using monolithic mixed-conducting interlayers.},

In pursuit of superior batteries, designing and developing highly efficient electrode materials are indispensable for meeting the requirements of large-scale energy storage applications. Despite using graphite anodes in KIBs instead of in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), developing suitable KIB cathodes is extremely challenging and has attracted considerable research attention.

Therefore, the recent progress in layered metal-oxide cathodes is comprehensively reviewed for application to KIBs and the fundamental material design, classification, phase transitions, preparation techniques, and corresponding electrochemical performance of KIBs are presented.

The catalytic activity can be enhanced by simultaneous irradiation of ultrasound and light, but the existing piezoelectric semiconductors have trouble absorbing visible light. A piezoelectric catalyst is designed and tested for the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). It is based on Nb-doped tetragonal BaTiO 3 (BaTiO 3 :Nb) and is sensitized by carbon quantum dots (CDs). The photosensitizer injects electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor, while the piezoelectric polarization directed electrons to the semiconductor surface, allowing for a high-rate generation of H 2 O 2 . The piezoelectric polarization field restricts the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. A production rate of 1360 µmol g catalyst −1 h −1 of H 2 O 2 is achieved under visible light and ultrasound co-irradiation. Individual piezo- and photocatalysis yielded lower production rates. Furthermore, the CDs enhance the piezocatalytic activity of the BaTiO 3 :Nb. It is noted that moderating the piezoelectricity of BaTiO 3 :Nb via microstructure modulation influences the piezophotocatalytic activity.

In spite of recent progress in 3D printing glass, 3D printing of precision glass optics for imaging applications still faces challenges from shrinkage during printing and thermal processing, and from inadequate surface shape and quality to meet the requirements for imaging applications. This paper reports a new liquid silica resin (LSR) with higher curing speed, better mechanical properties, lower sintering temperature, and reduced shrinkage, as well as the printing process for high-precision glass optics for imaging applications. It is demonstrated that the proposed material and printing process can print almost all types of optical surfaces, including flat, spherical, aspherical, freeform, and discontinuous surfaces, with accurate surface shape and high surface quality for imaging applications. It is also demonstrated that the proposed method can print complex optical systems with multiple optical elements, completely removing the time-consuming and error-prone alignment process. Most importantly, the proposed printing method is able to print optical systems with active moving elements, significantly improving system flexibility and functionality. The printing method will enable the much-needed transformational manufacturing of complex freeform glass optics that are currently inaccessible with conventional processes.},

  abstract     = {While there have been numerous reports of long-range polariton transport at room-temperature in organic cavities, the spatiotemporal evolution of the propagation is scarcely reported, particularly in the initial coherent sub-ps regime, where photon and exciton wavefunctions are inextricably mixed. Hence the detailed process of coherent organic exciton-polariton transport and, in particular, the role of dark states has remained poorly understood. Here, femtosecond transient absorption microscopy is used to directly image coherent polariton motion in microcavities of varying quality factor. The transport is found to be well-described by a model of band-like propagation of an initially Gaussian distribution of exciton-polaritons in real space. The velocity of the polaritons reaches values of ≈ 0.65 × 10 6 m s −1 , substantially lower than expected from the polariton dispersion. Further, it is found that the velocity is proportional to the quality factor of the microcavity. This unexpected link between the quality-factor and polariton velocity is suggested to be a result of varying admixing between delocalized dark and polariton states.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic interactions within and across brain areas underlie behavioral and cognitive functions. To understand the basis of these processes, the activities of distributed local circuits inside the brain of a behaving animal must be synchronously recorded while the inputs to these circuits are precisely manipulated. Even though recent technological advances have enabled such large-scale recording capabilities, the development of the high-spatiotemporal-resolution and large-scale modulation techniques to accompany those recordings has lagged. A novel neural probe is presented in this work that enables simultaneous electrical monitoring and optogenetic manipulation of deep neuronal circuits at large scales with a high spatiotemporal resolution. The “hectoSTAR” micro-light-emitting-diode (μLED) optoelectrode features 256 recording electrodes and 128 stimulation μLEDs monolithically integrated on the surface of its four 30-µm thick silicon micro-needle shanks, covering a large volume with 1.3-mm × 0.9-mm cross-sectional area located as deep as 6 mm inside the brain. The use of this device in behaving mice for dissecting long-distance network interactions across cortical layers and hippocampal regions is demonstrated. The recording-and-stimulation capabilities hectoSTAR μLED optoelectrodes enables will open up new possibilities for the cellular and circuit-based investigation of brain functions in behaving animals.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are promising candidates to significantly exceed the energy densities of today&#39;s state-of-the-art technology, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To enable this advancement, optimizing the solid electrolyte (SE) is the key. β -Li 3 PS 4 ( β -LPS) is the most studied member of the Li 2 S-P 2 S 5 family, offering promising properties for implementation in electric vehicles. In this work, the microstructure of this SE and how it influences the electrochemical performance are systematically investigated. To figure this out, four batches of β -LPS electrolyte with different particle size, shape, and porosity are investigated in detail. It is found that differences in pellet porosities mostly originate from single-particle intrinsic features and less from interparticle voids. Surprisingly, the β -LPS electrolyte pellets with the highest porosity and larger particle size not only show the highest ionic conductivity (up to 0.049 mS cm –1 at RT), but also the most stable cycling performance in symmetrical Li cells. This behavior is traced back to the grain boundary resistance. Larger SE particles seem to be more attractive, as their grain boundary contribution is lower than that of denser pellets prepared using smaller β -LPS particles.},

  abstract     = {During mammalian cortical development, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) gradually alter their characteristics, and the timing of generation of neurons and glial cells is strictly regulated by internal and external factors. However, whether the blood vessels located near NSCs affect the neurogenic-to-gliogenic transition remain unknown. Here, it is demonstrated that endothelial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) deletion reduces blood vessel diameter and affects the transition timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Deletion of endothelial UCP2 results in a persistent increase in astrocyte production at the postnatal stage. Mechanistically, the endothelial UCP2/ROS/ERK1/2 pathway increases chymase-1 expression to enhance angiotensin II (AngII) secretion outside the brain endothelium. The endotheliocyte-driven AngII-gp130-JAK-STAT pathway also regulates gliogenesis initiation. Moreover, endothelial UCP2 knockdown decreases human neural precursor cell (hNPC) differentiation into neurons and accelerates hNPC differentiation into astrocytes. Altogether, this work provides mechanistic insights into how endothelial UCP2 regulates the neurogenic-to-gliogenic fate switch in the developing neocortex.},

However, existing methods for quantifying these biomarkers such as immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction are usually laborious, resource-intensive, and disruptive. This article reports the development and utilization of mRNA nanosensors (i.e., NanoFlare) that are topically applied on cutaneous wounds to reveal the healing status through targeted and semi-quantitative examination of the mRNA biomarkers in skin cells. In 2D and 3D in vitro models, the efficacy and efficiency of these nanosensors are demonstrated in revealing the dynamic changes of mRNA biomarkers for different stages of wound development. In mouse models, this platform permits the tracking and identification of wound healing stages and a normal and diabetic wound healing process by wound healing index in real time.},

  abstract     = {Carbonaceous materials are considered strong candidates as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which are expected to play an indispensable role in the carbon-neutral era. Herein, novel braided porous carbon fibres (BPCFs) are prepared using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The BPCFs possess interwoven porous structures and abundant vacancies. The growth mechanism of the BPCFs can be attributed to the polycrystalline transformation of the nanoporous copper catalyst in the early stage of CVD process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Na + adsorption energies of the mono-vacancy edges of the BPCFs (−1.22 and −1.09 eV) are lower than that of an ideal graphene layer (−0.68 eV), clarifying in detail the adsorption-dominated sodium storage mechanism. Hence, the BPCFs as an anode material present an outstanding discharge capacity of 401 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Remarkably, this BPCFs anode, under high-mass-loading of 5 mg cm−2, shows excellent long-term cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 201 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 over 1000 cycles. This study provided a novel strategy for the development of high-performance carbonaceous materials for SIBs.},

Here pronounced Nurr1 modulation by statins for which clinically relevant neuroprotective effects are demonstrated, is reported. Several statins directly affect Nurr1 activity in cellular and cell-free settings with low micromolar to sub-micromolar potencies. Simvastatin as example exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in astrocytes, which are abrogated by Nurr1 knockdown. Differential gene expression analysis in native and Nurr1-silenced cells reveals strong proinflammatory effects of Nurr1 knockdown while simvastatin treatment induces several neuroprotective mechanisms via Nurr1 involving changes in inflammatory, metabolic and cell cycle gene expression. Further in vitro evaluation confirms reduced inflammatory response, improved glucose metabolism, and cell cycle inhibition of simvastatin-treated neuronal cells. These findings suggest Nurr1 involvement in the well-documented but mechanistically elusive neuroprotection by statins.},

It is urgent and meaningful to perform early warning by noninvasive diagnosis, thus conducing to blockage of disease aggravation. Here, guanidinocalix[5]arene (GC5A) is successfully identified from the self-built macrocyclic library to specifically monitor UA from urine by the indicator displacement assay. UA is strongly bound to GC5A at micromolar-level, while simultaneously excluding fluorescein (Fl) from the GC5A·Fl complex in the “switch-on” mode. This method successfully differentiates patients with hyperuricemia from volunteers except for those with kidney dysfunction and targets a volunteer at high risk of hyperuricemia. In order to meet the trend from hospital-centered to individual-centered testing, visual detection of UA is studied through a smartphone equipped with a color-scanning feature, whose adaptability and feasibility are demonstrated in sensing UA from authentic urine, leading to a promising method in family-centered healthcare style. A high-throughput and visual detection method is provided here for alarming hyperuricemic by noninvasive diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Obesity and associated diseases, such as diabetes, have reached epidemic proportions globally. In this era of “diabesity”, white adipose tissue (WAT) has become a target of high interest for therapeutic strategies. To gain insights into mechanisms of adipose (patho-)physiology, researchers traditionally relied on animal models. Leveraging Organ-on-Chip technology, a microphysiological in vitro model of human WAT is introduced: a tailored microfluidic platform featuring vasculature-like perfusion that integrates 3D tissues comprising all major WAT-associated cellular components (mature adipocytes, organotypic endothelial barriers, stromovascular cells including adipose tissue macrophages) in an autologous manner and recapitulates pivotal WAT functions, such as energy storage and mobilization as well as endocrine and immunomodulatory activities. A precisely controllable bottom-up approach enables the generation of a multitude of replicates per donor circumventing inter-donor variability issues and paving the way for personalized medicine. Moreover, it allows to adjust the model&#39;s degree of complexity via a flexible mix-and-match approach. This WAT-on-Chip system constitutes the first human-based, autologous, and immunocompetent in vitro adipose tissue model that recapitulates almost full tissue heterogeneity and can become a powerful tool for human-relevant research in the field of metabolism and its associated diseases as well as for compound testing and personalized- and precision medicine applications.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting energy from natural water evaporation has been proposed as a promising alternative to supply power for self-powered and low-power devices and systems, owing to its spontaneous, ubiquitous, and sustainability. Herein, an approach is presented for harvesting water-evaporation-induced electricity based on liquid–solid triboelectric nanogenerators (LS-TENGs), which has various advantages of easy preparation, substrate needless, and robustness. This developed harvester with porous Al 2 O 3 ceramic sheet can generate a continuous and stable direct current of ≈0.3 µA and voltage of ≈0.7 V by optimizing the sheet physical dimensions and ambient parameters such as relative humidity, temperature, wind velocity, and ion concentration. The output power also can be improved significantly by series or parallel connection the harvesters, which has superior electrical compatibility and environmental suitability. The development of the water-evaporation-induced electricity harvesting shows many application prospects including power supply for digital calculator and charging capacitor. This research provides an in-depth experimental study on water-evaporation-induced electricity harvesting based on LS-TENGs and an efficient approach to supply electricity for low-power devices.},

  abstract     = {Charge separation efficiency of photocatalysts is still the key scientific issue for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. In this work, an electron donor–acceptor (D-A) interface with high charge separation between TPPS (tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin) and PDI (perylene diimide) is successfully constructed for boosting photocatalytic H 2 evolution. The TPPS/PDI with D-A interface shows excellent photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate of 546.54 µmol h –1 (30.36 mmol h –1 g –1 ), which is 9.95 and 9.41 times higher than that of pure TPPS and PDI, respectively. The TPPS/PDI has a markedly stronger internal electric field, which is respectively 3.76 and 3.01 times higher than that of pure PDI and TPPS. The D-A interface with giant internal electric field efficiently facilitates charge separation and urges TPPS/PDI to have a longer excited state lifetime than single component. The work provides entirely new ideas for designing materials with D-A interface to realize high photocatalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {The chiral-induced spin selectivity effect enables the application of chiral organic materials for spintronics and spin-dependent electrochemical applications. It is demonstrated on various chiral monolayers, in which their conversion efficiency is limited. On the other hand, relatively high spin polarization (SP) is observed on bulk chiral materials; however, their poor electronic conductivities limit their application. Here, the design of chiral MoS 2 with a high SP and high conductivity is reported. Chirality is introduced to the MoS 2 layers through the intercalation of methylbenzylamine molecules. This design approach activates multiple tunneling channels in the chiral layers, which results in an SP as high as 75%. Furthermore, the spin selectivity suppresses the production of H 2 O 2 by-product and promotes the formation of ground state O 2 molecules during the oxygen evolution reaction. These potentially improve the catalytic activity of chiral MoS 2 . The synergistic effect is demonstrated as an interplay of the high SP and the high catalytic activity of the MoS 2 layer on the performance of the chiral MoS 2 for spin-dependent electrocatalysis. This novel approach employed here paves way for the development of other novel chiral systems for spintronics and spin-dependent electrochemical applications.},

  abstract     = {Sodium-metal chloride batteries are considered a sustainable and safe alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale stationary electricity storage, but exhibit disadvantages in rate capability. Several studies identify metal-ion migration through the metal chloride conversion layer on the positive electrode as the rate-limiting step, limiting charge and discharge rates in sodium-metal chloride batteries. Here the authors present electrochemical nickel and iron chlorination with planar model electrodes in molten sodium tetrachloroaluminate electrolyte at 300 °C. It is discovered that, instead of metal-ion migration through the metal chloride conversion layer, it is metal-ion diffusion in sodium tetrachloroaluminate which limits chlorination of both the nickel and iron electrodes. Upon charge, chlorination of the nickel electrode proceeds via uniform oxidation of nickel and the formation of NiCl 2 platelets on the surface of the electrode. In contrast, the oxidation of the iron electrodes proceeds via localized corrosion attacks, resulting in nonuniform iron oxidation and pulverization of the iron electrode. The transition from planar model electrodes to porous high-capacity electrodes, where sodium-ion migration along the tortuous path in the porous electrode can become rate limiting, is further discussed. These mechanistic insights are important for the design of competitive next-generation sodium-metal chloride batteries with improved rate performance.},

Here, a domain engineering strategy for achieving a compact domain architecture with increased domain-wall density in (K,Na)NbO 3 (KNN)-based ferroelectric ceramics via mesoscopic chemical inhomogeneity (MCI) is developed. The MCI-induced interfaces can effectively hinder domain continuity and modify the domain configuration. Besides, the MCI effect also results in diffused phase transitions, which is beneficial for achieving enhanced thermal stability. Modulation of chemical inhomogeneity demonstrates great potential for engineering desirable domain configuration and properties in ferroelectric ceramics. Additionally, the MCI can be easily controlled by regulating the processing condition during solid-state synthesis, which is advantageous to industrial production.},

  abstract     = {Cholestatic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) induced by drugs or other xenobiotics is a severe and even fatal clinical syndrome. Here, living materials of hierarchy-assembled dual probiotics system are fabricated by sequentially encapsulating probiotic Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LDB) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) into Ca 2+ -complexed polymer microspheres for effective prevention of cholestatic DILI. Upon entering intestinal tract of the constructed living materials, LGG is released because of pH-triggered dissolution of outer enteric polymer coating. The released LGG can inhibit hepatic bile acids (BAs) synthesis by activating intestinal farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15（FGF-15) signaling pathway. BAs excretion is also facilitated by LGG through increasing the abundance of bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active gut commensal bacteria. Furthermore, exposed positively-charged chitosan shell can absorb the excessive BAs via electrostatic interaction, which leads to steady BAs fixation by the imprisoned LDB, decreasing the total BAs amounts in enterohepatic circulation. Together, the fabricated living materials, obtained here, can effectively prevent cholestatic DILI through dredging cholestasis via gut-liver axis modulation. The therapeutic effect is demonstrated in α -naphthylisothiocyanate and clinical antiepileptic drug valproate acid-induced cholestatic DILI mouse models, which reveal the great potential for effective cholestatic DILI management.},

However, the ubiquitous hypoxia and the insufficient content of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in tumor microenvironments inevitably hinder the effective production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To radically extricate from the shackles, peroxymonosulfate (PMS: HSO 5 − )-loaded hollow mesoporous copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared as the distinct ROS donors for sulfate radical (•SO 4 − )-mediated and stimuli-responsive tumor nanotherapy in an oxygen-independent manner. In this therapeutic modality, the second near-infrared laser irradiation, together with the released copper ions as well as the heat produced by CuS after illumination, work together to activate PMS thus triply ensuring the copious production of •SO 4 − . Different from conventional ROS, the emergence of •SO 4 − , possessing a longer half-life and more rapid reaction, is independent of the oxygen (O 2 ) and H 2 O 2 content within the tumor. In addition, this engineered nanosystem also exerts the function of photoacoustic imaging and skin restoration on the corresponding animal models. This study reveals the enormous potential of sulfate radical in oncotherapy and broadens pave for exploring the application of multifunctional and stimuli-responsive nanosystems in biomedicine.},

Developing efficient electrocatalysts with low potentials and high current densities is crucial for the large-scale productions of H 2 and other value-added chemicals. Herein, non-noble metal electrocatalysts Co-doped Ni 3 S 2 self-supported on a Ni foam (NF) substrate are prepared and used as catalysts for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) under alkaline aqueous conditions. For HMFOR, the Co 0.4 NiS@NF electode achieves an extremely low onset potential of 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and records a large current density of 497 mA cm –2 at 1.45 V versus RHE for HMFOR. During the HMFOR-assisted H 2 production, the yield rates of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and H 2 in a 10 mL electrolyte containing 10 × 10 −3 M HMF are 330.4 µmol cm –2 h –1 and 1000 µmol cm –2 h –1 , respectively. The Co 0.4 NiS@NF electrocatalyst displays a good cycling durability toward HMFOR and can be used for the electrooxidation of other biomass-derived chemicals. The findings present a facile route based on heteroatom doping to fabricate high-performance catalyses that can facilitate the industrial-level H 2 production by coupling the conventional HER cathodic processes with HMFOR.},

  abstract     = {Inorganic perovskite quantum dots CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) has recently received extensive attention as a new promising class of X-ray scintillators. However, relatively low light yield (LY) of CsPbX 3 and strong optical scattering of the thick opaque scintillator film restrict their practical applications for high-resolution X-ray microscopic imaging. Here, the Ce 3+ ion doped CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals (NCs) with enhanced LY and stability are obtained and then the ultrathin (30 µm) and transparent scintillator films with high density are prepared by a suction filtration method. The small amount Ce 3+ dopant greatly enhances the LY of CsPbBr 3 NCs (about 33 000 photons per MeV), which is much higher than that of bare CsPbBr 3 NCs. Moreover, the scintillator films made by these NCs with high density realize a high spatial resolution of 862 nm thanks to its thin and transparent feature, which is so far a record resolution for perovskite scintillator-based X-ray microscopic imaging. This strategy not only provides a simple way to increase the resolution down to nanoscale but also extends the application of as-prepared CsPbBr 3 scintillator for high resolution X-ray microscopic imaging.},

  abstract     = {The cellular response to stress is an important determinant of disease pathogenesis. Uncovering the molecular fingerprints of distinct stress responses may identify novel biomarkers and key signaling pathways for different diseases. Emerging evidence shows that transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) play pivotal roles in stress responses. However, RNA modifications present on tDRs are barriers to accurately quantifying tDRs using traditional small RNA sequencing. Here, AlkB-facilitated methylation sequencing is used to generate a comprehensive landscape of cellular and extracellular tDR abundances in various cell types during different stress responses. Extracellular tDRs are found to have distinct fragmentation signatures from intracellular tDRs and these tDR signatures are better indicators of different stress responses than miRNAs. These distinct extracellular tDR fragmentation patterns and signatures are also observed in plasma from patients on cardiopulmonary bypass. It is additionally demonstrated that angiogenin and RNASE1 are themselves regulated by stressors and contribute to the stress-modulated abundance of sub-populations of cellular and extracellular tDRs. Finally, a sub-population of extracellular tDRs is identified for which AGO2 appears to be required for their expression. Together, these findings provide a detailed profile of stress-responsive tDRs and provide insight about tDR biogenesis and stability in response to cellular stressors.},

In this work, abundant electromagnetic heterointerfaces are customized in multilevel hollow architecture via a one-step synergistic polymerizing-etching strategy. Fe/Fe 3 O 4 @C spindle-on-tube structures are transformed from FeOOH@polydopamine precursors by a controllable reduction process. The impressive electromagnetic heterostructures are realized on the Fe/Fe 3 O 4 @C hollow spindle arrays and induce strong interfacial polarization. The highly dispersive Fe/Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles within spindles build multi-dimension magnetic networks, which enhance the interaction with incident microwaves and reinforce magnetic loss capacity. Moreover, the hierarchically hollow structure and electromagnetic synergistic components are conducive to the impedance matching between absorbing materials and air medium. Furthermore, the mechanisms of electromagnetic heterointerfaces on the MA are systematically investigated. Accordingly, the as-prepared hierarchical Fe/Fe 3 O 4 @C microtubes exhibit remarkable MA performance with a maximum refection loss of −55.4 dB and an absorption bandwidth of 4.2 GHz. Therefore, in this study, the authors not only demonstrate a synergistic strategy to design multilevel hollow architecture, but also provide a fundamental guide in heterointerface engineering of highly efficient electromagnetic functional materials.},

The effects of chemotherapy on fertility have been well-documented previously. This study investigates how busulfan, an alkylating agent that is often used for chemotherapeutic purposes, affects male fertility. Specifically, the role of the TGR5 pathway is investigated on spermatogonia homeostasis using in vivo, in vitro, and pharmacological methods. In vivo studies are performed using wild-type and Tgr5 -deficient mouse models. The results clearly show that Tgr5 deficiency can facilitate restoration of the spermatogonia homeostasis and allow faster resurgence of germ cell lineage after exposure to busulfan. TGR5 modulates the expression of key genes of undifferentiated spermatogonia such as Gfra1 and Fgfr2. At the molecular level, the present data highlight molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions among the TGR5, GLIS2, and TP53 pathways in spermatogonia associated with germ cell apoptosis following busulfan exposure. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it shows that TGR5 plays key role on undifferentiated germ cell homeostasis and that modulating the TGR5 signaling pathway could be used as a potential therapeutic tool for fertility disorders.},

  abstract     = {The construction of biomembranes that faithfully capture the properties and dynamic functions of cell membranes remains a challenge in the development of synthetic cells and their application. Here a new concept for synthetic cell membranes based on the self-assembly of amphiphilic comb polymers into vesicles, termed ionic combisomes (i-combisomes) is introduced. These combs consist of a polyzwitterionic backbone to which hydrophobic tails are linked by electrostatic interactions. Using a range of microscopies and molecular simulations, the self-assembly of a library of combs in water is screened. It is discovered that the hydrophobic tails form the membrane&#39;s core and force the backbone into a rod conformation with nematic-like ordering confined to the interface with water. This particular organization resulted in membranes that combine the stability of classic polymersomes with the biomimetic thickness, flexibility, and lateral mobility of liposomes. Such unparalleled matching of biophysical properties and the ability to locally reconfigure the molecular topology of its constituents enable the harboring of functional components of natural membranes and fusion with living bacteria to “hijack” their periphery. This provides an almost inexhaustible palette to design the chemical and biological makeup of the i-combisomes membrane resulting in a powerful platform for fundamental studies and technological applications.},

Herein, a high-stable, all-in-one structured 3D lithium-metal battery is designed which consists of paralleled microcell arrays. Fast ion-transport kinetics in full cell level can not only address the key issue of lithium dendrites in anode but also improve electrochemical performance of cathode. As a result, the resultant lithium metal anode acquires long-term stability of 1000-cycle life at a high current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Also the all-in-one structured lithium metal battery has general applicability for various cathodic materials and delivers significantly improved rate and cycling performance, as well as high areal capacity up to 10.4 mAh cm −2 .},

With regard to this, the presented study focuses on the use of in situ IR spectroscopy in combination with a multivariate curve resolution approach to gain insight into both the molecular structures of the active materials present within the electrolyte as well as crucial electrolyte state parameters, represented by the electrolyte&#39;s state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH).

The study&#39;s findings highlight the impact of in situ spectroscopy and spectral deconvolution tools on the precision of the obtainable SOC and SOH values. Furthermore, the study indicates the occurrence of multiple viologen dimers, which possibly influence the electrolyte lifetime and charging characteristics.},

The unique microstructured catalyst can provide enough catalytic surface to facilitate the barrier-free transport of oxygen as well as lithium ions.

In this study, boron atoms are introduced into phosphorus-doped nanoporous carbon via an efficient strategy, so that the resulting material delivers better catalytic performance. The doped B atoms alter the electronic structures of active sites and cause the adjacent C atoms to act as additional active sites that catalyze the reaction. The B/P co-doped nanoporous carbon shows remarkable catalytic performance for benzyl alcohol oxidation, achieving high yield (over 91% within 2 h) and selectivity (95%), as well as low activation energy (32.2 kJ mol −1 ). Moreover, both the conversion and selectivity remain above 90% after five reaction cycles. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the introduction of B to P-doped nanoporous carbon significantly increases the electron density at the Fermi level and that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol occurs via a different reaction pathway with a very low energy barrier. These findings provide important insights into the relationship between catalytic performance and electronic structure for the design of dual-doped metal-free carbon catalysts.},

Inflammation is one core cause of the DED vicious cycle, a multifactorial deterioration in DED process. However, there are also reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulating inflammation and other points in the cycle from the upstream, leading to treatment failure of current therapies merely targeting inflammation. Accordingly, the authors develop micelle-based eye drops (more specifically p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) inhibitor Losmapimod (Los)-loaded and ROS scavenger Tempo (Tem)-conjugated cationic polypeptide micelles, designated as MTem/Los) for safe and efficient DED management. Cationic MTem/Los improve ocular retention of conjugated water-soluble Tem and loaded water-insoluble Los via electrostatic interaction with negatively charged mucin on the cornea, enabling an increase in therapeutic efficiency and a decrease in dosing frequency. Mechanistically, MTem/Los effectively decrease ROS over-production, reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, restrain macrophage proinflammatory phenotypic transformation, and inhibit cell apoptosis. Therapeutically, the dual-functional MTem/Los suppress the inflammatory response, reverse corneal epithelial defect, save goblet cell dysfunction, and recover tear secretion, thus breaking the vicious cycle and alleviating the DED. Moreover, MTem/Los exhibit excellent biocompatibility and tolerability for potential application as a simple and rapid treatment of oxidative stress- and inflammation-induced disorders, including DED.},

Herein, a proton-driven transformable 1 O 2 -nanotrap (ANBDP NPs) with endosomal escape capability is presented to improve hypoxic tumor PDT. In the acidic endosomal environment, the protonated 1 O 2 -nanotrap ruptures endosomal membranes via a “proton-sponge” like effect and undergoes a drastic morphology-and-size change from nanocubes (≈94.1 nm in length) to nanospheres (≈12.3 nm in diameter). Simultaneously, anthracenyl boron dipyrromethene-derived photosensitizer (ANBDP) in nanospheres transforms to its protonated form (ANBDPH) and switches off its charge-transfer state to achieve amplified 1 O 2 photogeneration capability. Upon 730 nm photoirradiation, ANBDPH prominently produces 1 O 2 and traps generated- 1 O 2 in the anthracene group to form endoperoxide (ANOBDPH). Benefitting from the hypoxia-tolerant 1 O 2 -release property of ANOBDPH in the dark, the 1 O 2 -nanotrap brings about sustained therapeutic effect without further continuous irradiation, thereby achieving remarkable antitumor performance.},

  abstract     = {Lesion positioning therapy optimizes medical treatment by directly targeting lesions. However, strong physical barriers greatly hinder its wide use. Here, the Chinese acupuncture needles (CA-needles) with a screw-thread structure at the tip (ST-needle) and the hydrogel with the function of adhesive metal and loaded drug sustained-release structure are designed, through the minimally invasive and precise positioning of lesions by ST-needles, the dry-wet conversion of hydrogel with absorbing fluids and swelling, and the rotation back of ST-needles, the hydrogel is precisely positioned in the subchondral bone with physical barrier to achieve precise positioning therapy for lesions. In vitro experiments show that the ST-needle penetrates the physical barrier of cartilage and enters the subchondral bone. Simultaneously, the hydrogel transfer efficiency of the ST-needle (73.25%) is significantly higher than that of the CA-needle (29.92%) due to the protective effect of the screw-thread structure. In vivo experiments demonstrate that precise positioning in subchondral bone in osteoarthritis rats with ST-needles effectively inhibits abnormal subchondral bone remodeling, alleviating the degeneration and degradation of cartilage. Therefore, ST-needles achieve lesion positioning therapy through minimally invasive penetration of physical barriers, precisely positioning within lesions, and delivering hydrogel to release drugs.},

A clinical trial is performed to determine the effect of microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The authors perform single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from six patients before and after ablation. NK and CD8 + T cells are activated by MWA of breast cancer, with the increased inhibitory signature of CD8 + T cells but not dysfunctional. Enhanced co-stimulatory signature of CD4 + T cells is observed and increased frequency of ICOS + CD4 + T cells after MWA is confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. After ablation, T-cell clones expand with increased T-cell receptor diversities. Activated antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathways are found in B cells. Enhanced interactions between B cells and CD4 + T cells are found, indicating that B cells are important antigen-presenting cells that initiate CD4 + T cells in MWA-induced immune response. Blockade of CTLA-4 or PD-1 of post-MWA PBMCs show higher T-cell activity than that of pre-MWA PBMCs. This study provide global characteristics of MWA-induced systemic immune response and pave a way for the identification of potential targets to improve the immune response.},

  abstract     = {Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) typically suffers from compromised anticancer efficacy owing to the low reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield and complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) which can consume ROS and support the occurrence and development of tumors. Herein, ultrathin-FeOOH-coated MnO 2 nanospheres (denoted as MO@FHO) as sonosensitizers which can not only facilitate ultrasound (US)-triggered ROS but also tune the TME by hypoxia alleviation, H 2 O 2 consumption as well as glutathione (GSH) depletion are designed. The FeOOH coating will boost the production yield of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radicals ( • OH) by inhibiting the recombination of US-initiated electron–hole pairs and Fenton-like reaction, respectively. Additionally, the catalase-like and GSH peroxidase-like activities of MO@FHO nanospheres enable them to break the TME equilibrium via hypoxia alleviation and GSH depletion. The combination of high ROS yield and fundamental destruction of TME equilibrium results in satisfactory antitumor outcomes, as demonstrated by the high tumor suppression efficacy of MO@FHO on MDA-MB-231-tumor-bearing mice. No obvious toxicity is detected to normal tissues at therapeutic doses in vivo. The capability to modulate the ROS production and TME simultaneously can afford new probability for the development of advanced sonosensitizers for synergistic comprehensive cancer therapy.},

Understanding how the spatial confinement in 3D can regulate the behavior of the embedded cells is crucial to design and predict ELM&#39;s function, minimize their environmental impact and facilitate their translation into applied materials. This study investigates the growth and metabolic activity of bacteria within an associative hydrogel network (Pluronic-based) with mechanical properties that can be tuned by introducing a variable degree of acrylate crosslinks. Individual bacteria distributed in the hydrogel matrix at low density form functional colonies whose size is controlled by the extent of permanent crosslinks. With increasing stiffness and elastic response to deformation of the matrix, a decrease in colony volumes and an increase in their sphericity are observed. Protein production follows a different pattern with higher production yields occurring in networks with intermediate permanent crosslinking degrees. These results demonstrate that matrix design can be used to control and regulate the composition and function of ELMs containing microorganisms. Interestingly, design parameters for matrices to regulate bacteria behavior show similarities to those elucidated for 3D culture of mammalian cells.},

  abstract     = {Infectious virus outbreaks pose a significant challenge to public healthcare systems. Early and accurate virus diagnosis is critical to prevent the spread of the virus, especially when no specific vaccine or effective medicine is available. In clinics, the most commonly used viral detection methods are molecular techniques that involve the measurement of nucleic acids or proteins biomarkers. However, most clinic-based methods require complex infrastructure and expensive equipment, which are not suitable for low-resource settings. Over the past years, smartphone-based point-of-care testing (POCT) has rapidly emerged as a potential alternative to laboratory-based clinical diagnosis. This review summarizes the latest development of virus detection. First, laboratory-based and POCT-based viral diagnostic techniques are compared, both of which rely on immunosensing and nucleic acid detection. Then, various smartphone-based POCT diagnostic techniques, including optical biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and other types of biosensors are discussed. Moreover, this review covers the development of smartphone-based POCT diagnostics for various viruses including COVID-19, Ebola, influenza, Zika, HIV, et al. Finally, the prospects and challenges of smartphone-based POCT diagnostics are discussed. It is believed that this review will aid researchers better understand the current challenges and prospects for achieving the ultimate goal of containing disease-causing viruses worldwide.},

It significantly improves optical imaging resolution and depth, by which the cortical and calvarial vascular injury and regeneration processes after ischemic injury are longitudinally monitored in awake mice. Results show that calvarial blood vessels recover earlier than the cortex. And the transcriptome analysis reveals that gene expression patterns and immune cells abundances exist substantial differences between brain and skull after ischemic injury, which may be one of the causes for the time lag between their vascular recovery. These findings bring great enlightenment to vascular regeneration and reconstruction. Moreover, LCCW provides a minimally invasive approach for imaging the brain and skull bone marrow.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a rapid rise of artificial neural networks being employed in a number of cognitive tasks. The ever-increasing computing requirements of these structures have contributed to a desire for novel technologies and paradigms, including memristor-based hardware accelerators. Solutions based on memristive crossbars and analog data processing promise to improve the overall energy efficiency. However, memristor nonidealities can lead to the degradation of neural network accuracy, while the attempts to mitigate these negative effects often introduce design trade-offs, such as those between power and reliability. In this work, authors design nonideality-aware training of memristor-based neural networks capable of dealing with the most common device nonidealities. The feasibility of using high-resistance devices that exhibit high I - V nonlinearity is demonstrated—by analyzing experimental data and employing nonideality-aware training, it is estimated that the energy efficiency of memristive vector-matrix multipliers is improved by almost three orders of magnitude (0.715 TOPs −1 W −1 to 381 TOPs −1 W −1 ) while maintaining similar accuracy. It is shown that associating the parameters of neural networks with individual memristors allows to bias these devices toward less conductive states through regularization of the corresponding optimization problem, while modifying the validation procedure leads to more reliable estimates of performance. The authors demonstrate the universality and robustness of this approach when dealing with a wide range of nonidealities.},

In this paper, three of the most important variables affecting the breakdown strength of polymer-based composites are considered: the filler dielectric constants, filler sizes, and filler contents. High-throughput stochastic breakdown simulation is performed on 504 groups of data, and the simulation results are used as the machine learning database to obtain the breakdown strength prediction of polymer-based composites. Combined with the classical dielectric prediction formula, the energy storage density prediction of polymer-based composites is obtained. The accuracy of the prediction is verified by the directional experiments, including dielectric constant and breakdown strength.

The proposed QD@Phage nanosystem not only specifically binds to the host GFP- P. aeruginosa while preserving the infectivity of the phage itself, but also shows a superior capacity for synergistic bacterial killing by phage and by the photocatalytic localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from anchored QD components. Notably, this highly targeted QD@Phage nanosystem achieves robust in vitro antibacterial elimination for both planktonic (over 99.9%) and biofilm (over 99%) modes of growth. In a mouse wound infection model, this system also shows remarkable activity in eliminating the wound infection and promoting its recovery. These results demonstrate that the novel QD@Phage nanosystem can diversify the existing pool of antibacterial agents and inspire the development of promising therapeutic strategies against MDR bacterial infection.},

The molecular conductance of TBT1 with intramolecular O•••S noncovalent interactions is enhanced by about one order of magnitude in comparison to their analogue TBT2 (which contains alkyl instead of alkoxy chains). By replacing the methoxy groups in TBT1 with extending alkoxy chains in TBT3 , TBT4 , and TBT5 , the molecular backbones become twisted and as a consequence the single-molecule conductance decreases gradually, showing that the intramolecular O•••S noncovalent interaction is influenced by the structural features of alkoxy chains. More importantly, the single-molecule conductance of TBT3 , TBT4 , and TBT5 can be boosted by increasing the electric field applied to the molecular junctions. Remarkably, the conductance of TBT3 , TBT4 , and TBT5 can be reversibly modulated due to the conformational changes between twisted and planar ones by varying the electric field. These results demonstrate that molecules with intramolecular O•••S noncovalent interactions have the potential for in situ control of the electrical properties of molecular-scale devices.},

  abstract     = {In bimetallic heterostructured nanoparticles (NPs), the synergistic effect between their different metallic components leads to higher catalytic activity compared to the activity of the individual components. However, how the dynamic changes through which these NPs adopt catalytically active structures during a reaction and how the restructuring affects their activity are largely unknown. Here, using operando transmission electron microscopy, structural changes are studied in bimetallic Ni–Rh NPs, comprising of a Ni core whose surface is decorated with smaller Rh NPs, during a CO oxidation reaction. The direct atomic-scale imaging reveals that, under O 2 -rich conditions, Ni core partially transforms into NiO, forming a (Ni+NiO)–Rh hollow nanocatalyst with high catalytic activity. Under O 2 -poor conditions, Rh NPs alloy with the surface of the core to form a NiRh-alloy surface, and the NPs display significantly lower activity. The theoretical calculations indicate that NiO component that forms only under O 2 -rich conditions enhances the activity by preventing the CO poisoning of the nanocatalysts. The results demonstrate that visualizing the structural changes during reactions is indispensable in identifying the origin of catalytic activity. These insights into the dynamic restructuring of NP catalysts under a reactive environment are critical for the rational design of high-performance nanocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have attracted considerable attention over the last two decades because of a high energy density and low cost. However, the wide application of Li–S batteries has been severely impeded due to the poor electrical conductivity of S, shuttling effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and sluggish redox kinetics of S species, especially under high S loading. To address all these issues, a Ni–CeO 2 heterostructure-doped carbon nanofiber (Ni-CeO 2 -CNF) is developed as an S host that combines the strong adsorption with the high catalytic activity and the good electrical conductivity, where the LiPSs anchored on the heterostructure surface can directly gain electrons from the current collector and realize a fast conversion between S 8 and Li 2 S. Therefore, Li–S batteries with S@Ni-CeO 2 -CNF cathodes exhibit superior long-term cycling stability, with a capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle over 1000 cycles, even at 2 C. Noteworthy, under a sulfur loading up to 6 mg cm −2 , a high reversible areal capacity of 5.3 mAh cm −2 can be achieved after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. The heterostructure-modified S cathode effectively reconciles the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of LiPSs for adsorption and conversion, furthering the development of high-performance Li–S batteries.},

The membrane-less technology is one of the promising approaches to solve the problem and thus has attracted much attention and been explored in a variety of research paths. This review introduces one of the representative membrane-less battery types, Biphasic membrane-less redox batteries that eliminate the IEMs according to the principle of solvent immiscibility and realizes the phase splitting in a thermodynamically stable state. It is systematically classified and summarizes their performances as well as the problems they are suffering from, and then several effective solutions are proposed based on the modification of electrodes and electrolytes. Finally, special attention is given to the challenges and prospects of Biphasic membrane-less redox batteries, which could contribute to the development of membrane-less batteries.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most fatal central nervous system tumors and lacks effective or sufficient therapies. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered method of programmed cell death and opens a new direction for GBM treatment. However, poor blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration, reduced tumor targeting ability, and potential compensatory mechanisms hinder the effectiveness of ferroptosis agents during GBM treatment. Here, a novel composite therapeutic platform combining the magnetic targeting features and drug delivery properties of magnetic nanoparticles with the BBB penetration abilities and siRNA encapsulation properties of engineered exosomes for GBM therapy is presented. This platform can be enriched in the brain under local magnetic localization and angiopep-2 peptide-modified engineered exosomes can trigger transcytosis, allowing the particles to cross the BBB and target GBM cells by recognizing the LRP-1 receptor. Synergistic ferroptosis therapy of GBM is achieved by the combined triple actions of the disintegration of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and the glutathione peroxidase 4 ferroptosis defense axis with Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle-mediated Fe 2+ release. Thus, the present findings show that this system can serve as a promising platform for the treatment of glioblastoma.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic interventions via targeting intratumoral dysregulated metabolism pathways have shown promise in reinvigorating antitumor immunity. However, approved small molecule immunomodulators often suffer from ineffective response rates and severe off-target toxicity. ATP occupies a crucial role in energy metabolism of components that form the tumor microenvironment (TME) and influences cancer immunosurveillance. Here, a nanocarrier-assisted immunometabolic therapy strategy that targets the ATP-adenosine axis for metabolic reprogramming of TME is reported. An ecto-enzyme (CD39) antagonist POM1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonist metformin are both encapsulated into cancer cell-derived exosomes and used as nanocarriers for tumor targeting delivery. This method increases the level of pro-inflammatory extracellular ATP (eATP) while preventing the accumulation of immunosuppressive adenosine and alleviating hypoxia. Elevated eATP triggers the activation of P2X7-NLRP3-inflammasome to drive macrophage pyroptosis, potentiates the maturation and antigen capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) to enhance the cytotoxic function of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. As a result, synergistic antitumor immune responses are initiated to suppress tumor progress, inhibit tumor distant metastases, provide long-term immune memory that offers protection against tumor recurrence and overcome anti-PD1 resistance. Overall, this study provides an innovative strategy to advance eATP-driven antitumor immunity in cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Both Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and osteoporosis (OP) are common age-associated degenerative diseases and are strongly correlated with clinical epidemiology. However, there is a lack of clear pathological relationship between the brain and bone in the current understanding. Here, it is found that young osteocyte, the most abundant cells in bone, secretes extracellular vesicles (OCY Young -EVs) to ameliorate cognitive impairment and the pathogenesis of AD in APP/PS1 mice and model cells. These benefits of OCY Young -EVs are diminished in aged osteocyte-derived EVs (OCY Aged -EVs). Based on the self-constructed OCY-EVs tracer transgenic mouse models and the in vivo fluorescent imaging system, OCY-EVs have been observed to be transported to the brain under physiological and pathological conditions. In the hippocampal administration of A β 40 induced young AD model mice, the intramedullary injection of Rab27a -shRNA adenovirus inhibits OCY Young -EVs secretion from bone and aggravates cognitive impairment. Proteomic quantitative analysis reveals that OCY Young -EVs, compared to OCY Aged -EVs, enrich multiple protective factors of AD pathway. The study uncovers the role of OCY-EV as a regulator of brain health, suggesting a novel mechanism in bone-brain communication.},

Among them, π -conjugated molecules have significantly special influence on halide perovskite due to the superior electrical conductivity, rigidity property, and good planarity of π -electrons. In particular, π -conjugated additives usually have stronger interaction with halide perovskites. Therefore, they help with higher charge mobility and longer device lifetime compared with alkyl-based molecules. In this review, the detailed effect of conjugated molecules is discussed in the following parts: defect passivation, lattice orientation guidance, crystallization assistance, energy level rearrangement, and stability improvement. Meanwhile, the roles of conjugated ligands played in low-dimensional perovskite devices are summarized. This review gives an in-depth discussion about how conjugated molecules interact with halide perovskites, which may help understand the improved performance mechanism of perovskite device with π -conjugated additives. It is expected that π -conjugated organic additives for halide perovskites can provide unprecedented opportunities for the future improvement of perovskite devices.},

Cumulative evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRs) are emerging as novel therapeutic targets for CNS disorders. In this study, it is sought to determine the regulatory role of miR-15a/16-1 in VCID. It is found that miR-15a/16-1 knockout (KO) mice exhibit less cognitive and sensorimotor deficits following VCID. Genetic deficiency of miR-15a/16-1 in VCID mice also mitigate myelin degeneration, axonal injury, and neuronal loss. Mechanistically, miR-15a/16-1 binds to the 3’-UTR of AKT3 and IL-10RA. Genetic deletion of miR-15a/16-1 increases AKT3 and IL-10RA expression in VCID brains, and intranasal delivery of AKT3 and IL-10RA siRNA-loaded nanoparticles partially reduce brain protection and cognitive recovery in miR-15a/16-1 KO mice after VCID. In conclusion, the miR-15a/16-1-IL/10RA/AKT3 axis plays a critical role in regulating vascular brain damage and cognitive decline after VCID. Targeting miR-15a/16-1 is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of VCID.},

Gradients and patterns of chemoattractants are well-described guides of multicellular organization, but the influences of 3D geometry of soft hydrogels are less well defined. Here, the discovery of a new mode of endothelial cell self-organization guided by combinatorial effects of stiffness and geometry, independent of protein or chemical patterning, is described. Endothelial cells in 2 kPa microwells are found to be ≈30 times more likely to migrate to the edge to organize in ring-like patterns than in stiff 35 kPa microwells. This organization is independent of curvature and significantly more pronounced in 2 kPa microwells with aspect ratio (perimeter/depth) &lt; 25. Physical factors of cells and substrates that drive this behavior are systematically investigated and a mathematical model that explains the organization by balancing the dynamic interaction between tangential cytoskeletal tension, cell–cell, and cell–substrate adhesion is presented. These findings demonstrate the importance of combinatorial effects of geometry and stiffness in complex cellular organization that can be leveraged to facilitate the engineering of bionics and integrated model organoid systems with customized nutrient vascular networks.},

The soft gripper grasp can lift objects using the suction generated by the pump in the soft disc. Moreover, the protruded funnel-shaped end of the deformed suctorial mouth can adapt to smooth and rough surfaces. Furthermore, when the gripper contacts the submerged target objects in a turbid environment, local suctorial mouth arrays on the suction disc are locked, causing the variable flow inside them, which can be detected as a tactile perception signal to the target objects instead of visual perception. Aided by the 3D-printed linkage mechanism, the soft gripper can grasp objects of different shapes and dimensions, including flat objects, objects beyond the grasping range, irregular objects, scattered objects, and a moving turtle. The results report the soft gripper&#39;s versatility and demonstrate the vast application potentials of self-adaptive grasping and sensing in various environments, including but are not limited to underwater, which is always a key challenge of grasping technology.},

  abstract     = {Sub-nanometric materials (SNMs) represent a series of unprecedented size-/morphology-related properties applicable in theoretical research and diverse cutting-edge applications. However, in-depth investigation and wide utilization of organic SNMs are frequently hindered, owing to the complex synthesis procedures, insufficient colloidal stability, poor processability, and high cost. In this work, a low-cost, energy-efficient, convenient, effective, and scalable method is demonstrated for directly exfoliating chitin SNMs from their natural sources through a one-pot “tandem molecular intercalation” process. The resultant solution-like sample, which exhibits ribbon-like feature and contains more than 85% of the single molecular layer (thickness &lt;0.6 nm), is capable of being solution-processed to different types of materials. Thanks to the sub-nanometric size and rich surface functional groups, chitin SNMs reveal versatile intriguing properties that rarely observe in their nano-counterparts (nanofibrils), e.g., crystallization-like assembly in the colloidal state and alcoplasticity/self-adhesiveness in the bulk aggregate state. The finding in this work not only opens a new avenue for the high value-added utilization of chitin, but also provides a new platform for both the theoretical study and practical applications of organic SNMs.},

However, the accumulation of stress and strain upon sodium storage leads to the formation of cracks and fractures, resulting in electrode failure upon extended cycling. In this work, the design and construction of Bi x Sb 1−x bimetallic alloy films with a compositional gradient to mitigate the intrinsic structural instability is reported. In the gradient film, the top is rich in Sb, contributing to the capacity, while the bottom is rich in Bi, helping to reduce the stress in the interphase between the film and the substrate. Significantly, this gradient film affords a high reversible capacity of ≈500 mAh g −1 and sustains 82% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C, drastically outperforming the solid-solution counterpart and many recently reported alloy anodes. Such a gradient design can open up the possibilities to engineering high-capacity anode materials that are structurally unstable due to the huge volume variation upon energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous interface design to boost interfacial polarization has become a feasible way to realize high electromagnetic wave absorbing (EMA) performance of dielectric materials. However, interfacial polarization in simple structures such as particles, rods, and flakes is weak and usually plays a secondary role. In order to enhance the interfacial polarization and simultaneously reduce the electronic conductivity to avoid reflection of electromagnetic wave, a more rational geometric structure for dielectric materials is desired. Herein, a Ti 3 C 2 T x /MoS 2 self-rolling rod-based foam is proposed to realize excellent interfacial polarization and achieve high EMA performance at ultralow density. Different surface tensions of Ti 3 C 2 T x and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate are utilized to induce the self-rolling of Ti 3 C 2 T x sheets. The rods with a high aspect ratio not only remarkably improve the polarization loss but also are beneficial to the construction of Ti 3 C 2 T x /MoS 2 foam, leading to enhanced EMA capability. As a result, the effective absorption bandwidth of Ti 3 C 2 T x /MoS 2 foam covers the whole X band (8.2–12.4 GHz) with a density of only 0.009 g cm −3 , at a thickness of 3.3 mm. The advantages of rod structures are verified through simulations in the CST microwave studio. This work inspires the rational geometric design of micro/nanostructures for new-generation EMA materials.},

However, foreign body response and performance loss over time are major challenges stemming from the chemomechanical mismatch between sensors and tissues. Herein, microgels are utilized as large crosslinking centers in hydrogel networks to modulate the tradeoff between modulus and fatigue resistance/stretchability for producing hydrogels that closely match chemomechanical properties of neural tissues. The hydrogels exhibit notably different characteristics compared to nanoparticles reinforced hydrogels. The hydrogels exhibit relatively low modulus, good stretchability, and outstanding fatigue resistance. It is demonstrated that the hydrogels are well suited for fashioning into wearable and implantable sensors that can obtain physiological pressure signals, record the local field potentials in rat brains, and transmit signals through the injured peripheral nerves of rats. The hydrogels exhibit good chemomechanical match to tissues, negligible foreign body response, and minimal signal attenuation over an extended time, and as such is successfully demonstrated for use as long-term implantable sensory devices. This work facilitates a deeper understanding of biohybrid interfaces, while also advancing the technical design concepts for implantable neural probes that efficiently obtain physiological information.},

The diradical character is investigated by quantum chemical calculations and variable temperature electron spin resonance. The diode devices based on this molecule show a large change in electric current in magnetic fields below 100 mT with a strong dependence on the measurement temperatures; as the population of the triplet diradicals increases at high temperatures, the magnetoconductance (MC) values increase. As a result, a MC of −19.4% is achieved at 120 °C, which is the largest negative MC observed for organic molecules to date. In contrast, a smaller diradicaloid molecule based on quinoidal thieno[3,2-b]thiophene without thermally accessible triplet state shows no MC, indicating the essential role of the triplet diradicals. The strong correlation between the MC and the triplet diradical concentrations suggests that the charge conduction in the diradicaloid is suppressed through a spin-blocking mechanism, which can be controlled through the magnetic modulation of the hyperfine fields. The compound forms high-crystallinity thin films and has high monopolar electron transport in organic field-effect transistors, with an average mobility of 1.01 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for edge-cast films.},

In this work, the first example of excitation-dependent persistent luminescence in a reverse mode for smart optical materials through tailoring the excited-state proton transfer process of metal cytosine halide hybrids is reported. This approach enables ultralong phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence emission colors highly tuned by modulation of excitation wavelength, time evolution, and temperature, which realize multi-mode dynamic color adjustment from green to blue or cyan to yellow-green. At the single crystal level, the 2D excitation/space/time-resolved optical waveguides with triple color conversion have been constructed on the organic-metal halide microsheets, which represent a new strategy for multi-dimensional information encryption and optical logic gate applications.},

In this paper, a novel 3D printing strategy is developed to manufacture the ultraflexible magnetic actuator, in which the printed material is composed of magnetic particles and thermoplastic rubber materials. Different from the traditional fused deposition printing, this printing strategy introduces screw extrusion technology to the heating components of the printer to overcome the problem of filament buckling in the flexible material. Thus, the tensile modulus of the printed products can be reduced to as low as ≈2 MPa. Based on the above method, biomimetic magnetic actuators of the sucker and the pump are constructed for adhering and releasing object and pumping liquid. The contraction performance of the magnetic actuator is studied via a series of experiments and the magnetic field-induced deformation is analyzed by the multiphysics-based finite element model. This work proves that ultraflexible magnetic actuators fabricated by this 3D printing strategy show broad prospects in the fields of soft robotics and bionics.},

ZnETTB shows specific host–guest interaction with amide, where N,N -diethylformamide (DEF), as an example, is anchored through C  H···O and C  H··· π bonds with Zn cluster and ETTB 8− ligand, respectively. DEF anchoring reduces both the distortion level and the intramolecular motions of ETTB 8− ligand to lead a blueshifted and intensified emission for DEF ∈ ZnETTB. Moreover, amide anchoring also affords the DEF ∈ ZnETTB with the excellent thermofluorochromic behavior, and further increases the piezofluorochromic sensitivity at low-pressure ranges on the basis of its elastic framework. This work is one of the rare examples of amide-responsive smart materials, which shall shed new lights on design of smart MOFs with twisted AIE rotors for further sensing and detection applications.},

Triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) is introduced into PCPs to generate phosphonium-based PCPs (pPCPs), which further assembled with hyaluronic acid into pPCP nanoparticles (pPCP-NPs). pPCP-NPs with quaternary phosphonium cations selectively anchor on and destroy bacterial cell membranes through electrostatic action. Under 1064 nm laser irradiation, pPCP-NPs (pPCP-NPs/+L) produce near-infrared-II (NIR-II) photothermal antibacterial effect, thereby killing bacteria in a sustained manner. pPCP-NPs are readily degraded upon ROS abundant at infection sites, therefore exhibiting enough biosafety. pPCP-NPs/+L display an almost 100% bacterial inhibition rate in vitro and resultin a nearly complete recovery of bacteria-induced mouse wounds. A further metabolomics analysis denotes that pPCP-NPs/+L work in a concerted way to induce bacterial DNA damage, inhibit bacterial carbon/nitrogen utilization and amino acid/nucleotide synthesis. Taken together, degradable pPCP-NPs with both NIR-II photothermal effect and cationic phosphonium structural bacteriostasis provide a new avenue for antibiotics-alternative anti-infection therapy.},

However, current bladder cancer treatments involve high-dose chemotherapy and high-irradiance PDT which cause debilitating side effects. Moreover, low penetration of light and drugs in target tissues and cumbersome light delivery procedures hinder the clinical utility of PDT and chemotherapy combination for PCI. To circumvent these challenges, a photodynamic-chemotherapy approach is developed comprising tumor-targeting glycosylated nanocarriers, coloaded with chlorin e6 (Ce6) and gemcitabine elaidate (GemE), and a miniaturized implantable wirelessly powered light-emitting diode (LED) as a light source. The device successfully delivers four weekly light doses to the bladder while the nanocarrier promoted the specific accumulation of drugs in tumors. This approach facilitates the combination of low-irradiance PDT (1 mW cm −2 ) and low-dose chemotherapy (≈1500× lower than clinical dose) which significantly cures and controls orthotopic disease burden (90% treated vs control, 35%) in mice, demonstrating a potential new bladder cancer treatment option.},

  abstract     = {Despite their puzzling vibrational characteristics that include strong signatures of anharmonicity and thermal disorder already around room temperature, halide perovskites (HaPs) exhibit favorable optoelectronic properties for applications in photovoltaics and beyond. Whether these vibrational properties are advantageous or detrimental to their optoelectronic properties remains, however, an important open question. Here, this issue is addressed by investigation of the finite-temperature optoelectronic properties in the prototypical cubic CsPbBr 3 , using first-principles molecular dynamics based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the dynamic flexibility associated with HaPs enables the so-called transversality , which manifests as a preference for large halide displacements perpendicular to the Pb-Br-Pb bonding axis. The authors find that transversality is concurrent with vibrational anharmonicity and leads to a rapid rise in the joint density of states, which is favorable for photovoltaics since this implies sharp optical absorption profiles. These findings are contrasted to the case of PbTe, a material that shares several key properties with CsPbBr 3 but cannot exhibit any transversality and, hence, is found to exhibit much wider band-edge distributions. The authors conclude that the dynamic structural flexibility in HaPs and their unusual vibrational characteristics might not just be a mere coincidence, but play active roles in establishing their favorable optoelectronic properties.},

  abstract     = {Although ion gels are attractive sensing materials for deformable epidermal sensors or implantable devices, their sensing performances are highly affected by environmental humidity change, so that their sensing reliability cannot be secured. This study proposes a new concept of maintaining the high-precision temperature sensing performance of highly deformable ion gel sensors. In this approach, a hydrophobic ion gel sensing layer is kept water-saturated by attaching a hydrogel layer, rather than attempting to completely block water penetration. This study performs experimental and theoretical investigation on water concentration in the ion gel, using the analysis of mass transportation at the interface of the ion gel and the hydrogel. By using the charge relaxation time of the ionic molecules, the temperature sensor is not affected by environmental humidity in the extreme range of humidity (30%–100%). This study demonstrates a highly deformable on-skin temperature sensor which shows the same performance either in water or dry state and while exercising with large strains ( ε = 50%).},

In this work, rubber-derived lithium-conducting elastomer has been developed via sulfur vulcanization of nitrile butadiene rubber with a polymerizable ionic liquid to provide both high resilience and dramatically improved ionic conductivity. Owing to the chemically crosslinked network between rubber chains and ionic liquid fragments generated during vulcanization, the elastic lithium-conductor achieves high resilience of 0.92 MJ m −3 , superior cyclic durability of 1000 cycles at 50% strain, and high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 2.7 × 10 −4 S cm −1 . Consequently, the corresponding solid-state lithium/LiFePO 4 battery exhibits a high capacity of ≈146 mAh g −1 with a high capacity retention of 94.3% for up to 300 cycles.},

Here, a novel strategy for large-scale preparing spinel Ni x Mn 3-x O 4 solid solution immobilized with iridium single-atoms (Ir-SAs) is developed by the sol–gel method. Benefitting from the surface-exposed Ir-SAs, Ir 1 /Ni 1.6 Mn 1.4 O 4 reveals boosted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, achieving overpotentials of 330 and 350 mV at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm –2 in alkaline seawater.

Hence, enabling charge compensation in sodium layered oxides is a fascinating task for extending the cycle life of sodium-ion batteries. Herein a Ti/Mg co-doping strategy for a model P2-Na 2/3 Ni 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 cathode material is put forward to activate charge compensation through highly hybridized O 2 p  TM 3 d covalent bonds. In this way, the interlayer O  O electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2–O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid-solution-type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample. This study starts a perspective way of optimizing the sodium layered cathodes by rational structural design coupling electrochemical reactions, which can be extended to widespread battery researches.},

  abstract     = {Bile reflux gastritis (BRG) is associated with the development of gastric cancer (GC), but the specific mechanism remains elusive. Here, a comprehensive study is conducted to explore the roles of refluxed bile acids (BAs) and microbiome in gastric carcinogenesis. The results show that conjugated BAs, interleukin 6 (IL-6), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the relative abundance of LPS-producing bacteria are increased significantly in the gastric juice of both BRG and GC patients. A secondary BA, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), is significantly and positively correlated with the LPS-producing bacteria in the gastric juice of these patients. TDCA promotes the proliferation of normal gastric epithelial cells (GES-1) through activation of the IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 pathway. These results are further verified in two mouse models, one by gavage of TDCA, LPS, and LPS-producing bacteria ( Prevotella melaninogenica ), respectively, and the other by bile reflux (BR) surgery, mimicking clinical bile refluxing. Moreover, the bile reflux induced gastric precancerous lesions observed in the post BR surgery mice can be prevented by treatment with cryptotanshinone, a plant-derived STAT3 inhibitor. These results reveal an important underlying mechanism by which bile reflux promotes gastric carcinogenesis and provide an alternative strategy for the prevention of GC associated with BRG.},

However, unlike chemical cues, mechanical cues are not efficient enough to determine cell fate independently and improving the mechanosensitivity of cells is rather challenging. In this study, the combined effect of chemical and mechanical cues on the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells is examined. These results show that chemical cues such as the presence of an osteogenic medium, induce cells to secrete more collagen, and induce integrin for recruiting focal adhesion proteins that mature and cascade a series of events with the help of the mechanical force of the scaffold material. High-resolution, highly ordered hollow-micro-frustum-arrays using double-layer lithography, combined with modified methacrylate gelatin loaded with pre-defined soluble chemicals to provide both chemical and mechanical cues to cells. This approach ultimately facilitates the achievement of cellular osteodifferentiation and enhances bone repair efficiency in a model of femoral fracture in vivo in mice. Moreover, the results also reveal these pivotal roles of Integrin α2/Focal adhesion kinase/Ras homolog gene family member A/Large Tumor Suppressor 1/Yes-associated protein in human mesenchymal stem cells osteogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, these results show that chemical cues enhance the microtopographical sensitivity of cells.},

In this context, a plethora of tissue engineering strategies have been envisioned over the last two decades, such as combining cells, biological molecules, and/or biomaterials, yet with little evidence of successful clinical transfer to date.

This systematic review aims to provide a deeper insight into the field of material-assisted strategies for OC regeneration, with particular considerations for the therapeutic potential of the different approaches (with or without cells or biological molecules), and current OC regeneration evaluation methods.

According to the findings, the application of EM organoids on scleroderma skin can significantly reduce the degree of skin fibrosis.

This study demonstrates the robust and stable nature of a closo -borate based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE), which enables outstanding electrochemical stability and capacity retention upon extensive cycling. The GPE developed herein has an ionic conductivity of 7.3 × 10 −4 S cm −2 at room temperature and stability over a wide temperature range from −35 to 80 °C with a high lithium transference number ( t Li + $t_{{\rm{Li}}}^ + $ = 0.51). Multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared are used to understand the solvation environment and interaction between the GPE components. Density functional theory calculations are leveraged to gain additional insight into the coordination environment and support spectroscopic interpretations. The GPE is also established to be a suitable electrolyte for extended cycling with four different active electrode materials when paired with a lithium metal electrode. The GPE can also be incorporated into a flexible battery that is capable of being cut and still functional. The incorporation of a closo -borate into a gel polymer matrix represents a new direction for enhancing the electrochemical and physical properties of this class of materials.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis with unstable plaques is the dominant pathological basis of lethal cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which can cause acute death due to the rupture of plaques. Plaque-targeted drug delivery to achieve promoted treatment remains the main challenge because of the systemic occurrence of atheroma. Herein, a rapamycin (RAP) spherical nucleic acid (SNA) structure, capable of specifically accumulating in plaques for synergistic atherosclerosis treatment is constructed. By designing consecutive phosphorothioate (PS) at 3’ terminus of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand, multiple hydrophobic RAPs are covalently grafted onto the PS segment to form an amphiphilic drug-grafted DNA (RAP-DNA), which successively self-assembles into micellar SNA (RAP-SNA). Moreover, the phosphodiester-DNA segment constitutes the outer shell of RAP-SNA, enabling further hybridization with functional siRNA (targeting lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1, LOX-1) to obtain the drug codelivered SNA (LOX-1/RAP-SNA). With two active ingredients inside, LOX-1/RAP-SNA can not only induce robust autophagy and decrease the evil apoptosis of the pathological macrophages, but also simultaneously prohibit the LOX-1-mediated formation of damageable foam cells, realizing the effect of synergistic therapy. As a result, the LOX-1/RAP-SNA significantly reduces the progression of atheroma and stabilizes the plaques, providing a new strategy for synergistically targeted atherosclerosis treatment.},

  abstract     = {The blood–brain barrier (BBB) severely blocks the intracranial accumulation of most systemic drugs. Inspired by the contribution of the bacterial outer membrane to Escherichia coli K1 (EC-K1) binding to and invasion of BBB endothelial cells in bacterial meningitis, utilization of the BBB invasion ability of the EC-K1 outer membrane for brain-targeted drug delivery and construction of a biomimetic self-assembled nanoparticle with a surface featuring a lipopolysaccharide-free EC-K1 outer membrane are proposed. BBB penetration of biomimetic nanoparticles is demonstrated to occur through the transcellular vesicle transport pathway, which is at least partially dependent on internalization, endosomal escape, and transcytosis mediated by the interactions between outer membrane protein A and gp96 on BBB endothelial cells. This biomimetic nanoengineering strategy endows the loaded drugs with prolonged circulation, intracranial interstitial distribution, and extremely high biocompatibility. Based on the critical roles of gp96 in cancer biology, this strategy reveals enormous potential for delivering therapeutics to treat gp96-overexpressing intracranial malignancies.},

  abstract     = {Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are essential elements of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, which have been widely implicated in pathways that contribute to leukemia growth and resistance. Recent reports showed genotypic and phenotypic alterations in leukemia patient-derived MSCs, indicating that MSCs might be educated/reprogrammed. However, the results have been inconclusive, possibly due to the heterogeneity of leukemia. Here, the authors report that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induces MSCs towards an adipogenic differentiation propensity. RNAseq analysis reveal significant upregulation of gene expression enriched in the adipocyte differentiation process and reduction in osteoblast differentiation. The alteration is accompanied by a metabolic switch from glycolysis to a more oxidative phosphorylation-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies identify that AML cell-derived exosomes play a vital role during the AML cell-mediated MSCs education/reprogramming process. Pre-administration of mice BM microenvironment with AML-derived exosomes greatly enhance leukemia engraftment in vivo. The quantitative proteomic analysis identified a list of exosomal protein components that are differently expressed in AML-derived exosomes, which represent an opportunity for novel therapeutic strategies based on the targeting of exosome-based AML cells-MSCs communication. Collectively, the data show that AML-educated MSCs tend to differentiate into adipocytes contributing to disease progression, which suggests complex interactions of leukemia with microenvironment components.},

The Rayleigh-type SAWs form by an interdigital transducer propagated along the surface of a piezoelectric substrate in order to allow the dynamic stimulation of functional immune cells in a noncontact and rotor-free manner. The developed acoustofluidic microreactor enables a dynamic cell culture to be set up in a miniaturized system while maintaining the performance of agitating media. The present SAW system creates acoustic streaming flow in the cylindrical microreactor and applies flow-induced shear stress to the cells. The suspended NK cells are found to not be damaged by the SAW operation of the adjusted experimental setup. Suspended NK cell aggregates subjected to an SAW treatment show increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations. Simultaneously treating the NK cells with SAWs and protein kinase C activator enhances the lysosomal protein expressions of the cells and the cell-mediated cytotoxicity against target tumor cells. These have important implications by showing that acoustically actuated system allows dynamic cell culture without cell damages and further alters cytotoxicity-related cellular activities.},

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing heart-on-a-chip systems featuring simplified fabrication, accurate imitation and microphysiological visuality. In this paper, the authors present a novel electroconductive and anisotropic structural color hydrogel by simply polymerizing non-close-packed colloidal arrays on super aligned carbon nanotube sheets (SACNTs) for visualized and accurate heart-on-a-chip construction. The generated anisotropic hydrogel consists of a colloidal array-locked hydrogel layer with brilliant structural color on one surface and a conductive methacrylated gelatin (GelMA)/SACNTs film on the other surface. It is demonstrated that the anisotropic morphology of the SACNTs could effectively induce the alignment of cardiomyocytes, and the conductivity of SACNTs could contribute to the synchronous beating of cardiomyocytes. Such consistent beating rhythm caused the deformation of the hydrogel substrates and dynamic shifts in structural color and reflection spectra of the whole hybrid hydrogels. More attractively, with the integration of such cardiomyocyte-driven living structural color hydrogels and microfluidics, a visualized heart-on-a-chip system with more consistent beating frequency has been established for dynamic cardiomyocyte sensing and drug screening. The results indicate that the electroconductive and anisotropic structural color hydrogels are potential for various biomedical applications.},

The spin Hall angle of Pt 1 −x (TiO 2 ) x in an yttrium iron garnet/Pt 1 −x (TiO 2 ) x double-layer heterostructure is estimated from a combination of ferromagnetic resonance, spin pumping, and inverse spin Hall experiments.

The great enhancement of spin Hall angle is attributed to strong side-jump induced by TiO 2 impurities. These findings provide a new nanocomposite spin Hall material combining a giant spin Hall angle, low resistivity and excellent process compatibility with semiconductors for developing highly efficiency current-induced magnetization switching memory devices and logic devices.},

Although thick electrodes (≥300 µm) have the potential for reducing the proportion of inactive components inside LIBs and increasing battery energy density, the Li + ion concentration gradient problem is exacerbated. Most understanding of Li + ion diffusion in the electrodes is based on computational modeling because of the low atomic number ( Z ) of Li. There are few experimental methods to visualize Li + ion concentration distribution of the electrode within a battery of typical configurations, for example, coin cells with stainless steel casing. Here, for the first time, an interrupted in situ correlative imaging technique is developed, combining novel, full-field X-ray Compton scattering imaging with X-ray computed tomography that allows 3D pixel-by-pixel mapping of both Li + stoichiometry and electrode microstructure of a LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 cathode to correlate the chemical and physical properties of the electrode inside a working coin cell battery. An electrode microstructure containing vertically oriented pore arrays and a density gradient is fabricated. It is shown how the designed electrode microstructure improves Li + ion diffusivity, homogenizes Li + ion concentration through the ultra-thick electrode (1 mm), and improves utilization of electrode active materials.},

However, the synthesis of low-cost and porous BCN with tunable porosity is challenging, limiting its full potential in a variety of applications. Herein, the preparation of well-defined mesoporous boron carbon nitride (MBCN) with high specific surface area, tunable pores, and nitrogen contents is demonstrated through a simple integration of chemical polymerization of readily available sucrose and borane ammonia complex (BAC) through the nano-hard-templating approach. The bimodal pores are introduced in MBCN by controlling the self-organization of BAC and sucrose molecules within the nanochannels of the template. It is found that the optimized sample shows a high specific capacitance (296 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ), large specific capacity for sodium-ion battery (349 mAg h −1 at 50 mAh g −1 ), and excellent CO 2 adsorption capacity (27.14 mmol g −1 at 30 bar). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that different adsorption sites (B  C, B  N, C  N, and C  C) and the large specific surface area strongly support the high adsorption capacity.

By introducing a tilt angle between the vdW structure and the incident electron beam, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that the accessible photon energy range is more than doubled. This allows for greater versatility in real-time tuning of the vdW X-ray source. Furthermore, this work shows that the accessible photon energy range is maximized by simultaneously controlling both the electron energy and the vdW structure tilt.

Here, it is demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF115 inhibits the post-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trafficking of TLRs and TLRs-mediated immune responses by catalyzing ubiquitination of the small GTPases RAB1A and RAB13. It is shown that the 14-3-3 chaperones bind to AKT1-phosphorylated RNF115 and facilitate RNF115 localizing on the ER and the Golgi apparatus. RNF115 interacts with RAB1A and RAB13 and catalyzes K11-linked ubiquitination on the Lys49 and Lys61 residues of RAB1A and on the Lys46 and Lys58 residues of RAB13, respectively. Such a modification impairs the recruitment of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) dissociation inhibitor 1 (GDI1) to RAB1A and RAB13, a prerequisite for the reactivation of RAB proteins. Consistently, knockdown of RAB1A and RAB13 in Rnf115 +/+ and Rnf115 −/− cells markedly inhibits the post-ER and the post-Golgi trafficking of TLRs, respectively. In addition, reconstitution of RAB1A K49/61R or RAB13 K46/58R into Rnf115 +/+ cells but not Rnf115 −/− cells promotes the trafficking of TLRs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, respectively.

  abstract     = {Structural reconstruction is a process commonly observed for Cu-based catalysts in electrochemical CO 2 reduction. The Cu-based precatalysts with structural complexity often undergo sophisticated structural reconstruction processes, which may offer opportunities for enhancing the electrosynthesis of multicarbon products (C 2+ products) but remain largely uncertain due to various new structural features possibly arising during the processes. In this work, the Cu 2 O superparticles with an assembly structure are demonstrated to undergo complicated structure evolution under electrochemical reduction condition, enabling highly selective CO 2 -to-C 2+ products conversion in electrocatalysis. As revealed by electron microscopic characterization together with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, the building blocks inside the superparticle fuse to generate numerous grain boundaries while those in the outer shell detach to form nanogap structures that can efficiently confine OH − to induce high local pH. Such a combination of unique structural features with local reaction environment offers two important factors for facilitating C−C coupling. Consequently, the Cu 2 O superparticle-derived catalyst achieves high faradaic efficiencies of 53.2% for C 2 H 4 and 74.2% for C 2+ products, surpassing the performance of geometrically simpler Cu 2 O cube-derived catalyst and most reported Cu electrocatalysts under comparable conditions.

  abstract     = {Sodium-ion batteries are commonly regarded as a promising candidate in large-scale energy storage. Layered iron/manganese oxide cathodes receive extensive attentions due to the element abundance and large theoretical capacity. However, these materials usually undergo obvious degradation of electrochemical performance due to the tendency of Mn dissolution and Fe migration during continuous sodium release and uptake. Herein, a strategy of anion–cation synergetic redox is proposed to suppress the structural deterioration originated from overusing the electrochemical activity of transition-metal ions, and decreased lattice strain as well as superior electrochemical performance are realized simultaneously. Results show that the Na 0.8 Li 0.2 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.6 O 2 (NLFM) electrode is highly resistant to the erosion of moisture that is distinct from the traditional Mn/Fe-based electrodes. Moreover, the NLFM electrode demonstrates solid solution behavior without phase transition during cycles. The ultra-small volume change of 0.85% is ascribed to the negligible manganese dissolution and invisible transition-metal migration. The high-stable layered structure assures superior reversible capacity of ≈165 mA h g –1 , excellent rate capability, and splendid capacity retention of over 98.3% with 100 cycles. The findings deepen the understanding of the synergy between anion and cation redox and provide new insights to design the high-stable layered cathode for sodium-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {The formation and the evolution of electronic metallic states localized at the surface, commonly termed 2D electron gas (2DEG), represents a peculiar phenomenon occurring at the surface and interface of many transition metal oxides (TMO). Among TMO, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), particularly in its anatase polymorph, stands as a prototypical system for the development of novel applications related to renewable energy, devices and sensors, where understanding the carrier dynamics is of utmost importance. In this study, angle-resolved photo-electron spectroscopy (ARPES) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are used, supported by density functional theory (DFT), to follow the formation and the evolution of the 2DEG in TiO 2 thin films. Unlike other TMO systems, it is revealed that, once the anatase fingerprint is present, the 2DEG in TiO 2 is robust and stable down to a single-unit-cell, and that the electron filling of the 2DEG increases with thickness and eventually saturates. These results prove that no critical thickness triggers the occurrence of the 2DEG in anatase TiO 2 and give insight in formation mechanism of electronic states at the surface of TMO.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of platinum-based catalysts promotes efficient methanol oxidation reactions (MOR). However, the defects of such noble metal catalysts are high cost, easy poisoning, and limited commercial applications. The efficient utilization of a low-cost, anti-poisoning catalyst has been expected. Here, it is skillfully used N-doped graphdiyne (NGDY) to prepare a zero-valent platinum atomic catalyst (Pt/NGDY), which shows excellent activity, high pH adaptability, and high CO tolerance for MOR. The Pt/NGDY electrocatalysts for MOR with specific activity 154.2 mA cm −2 (1449.3 mA mg Pt −1 ), 29 mA cm −2 (296 mA mg Pt −1 ) and 22 mA cm −2 (110 mA mg Pt −1 ) in alkaline, acid, and neutral solutions. The specific activity of Pt/NGDY is 9 times larger than Pt/C in alkaline solution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the incorporation of electronegativity nitrogen atoms can increase the high coverage of Pt to achieve a unique atomic state, in which the shared contributions of different Pt sites reach the balance between the electroactivity and the stability to guarantee the higher performance of MOR and durability with superior anti-poisoning effect.},

  abstract     = {Astrocytes have crucial functions in the central nervous system (CNS) and are major players in many CNS diseases. Research on astrocyte-centered diseases requires efficient and well-characterized gene transfer vectors. Vectors derived from the Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) target astrocytes in the brains of rodents and nonhuman primates. A recombinant (r) synthetic peptide-displaying AAV9 variant, rAAV9P1, that efficiently and selectively transduces cultured human astrocytes, has been described previously. Here, it is shown that rAAV9P1 retains astrocyte-targeting properties upon intravenous injection in mice. Detailed analysis of putative receptors on human astrocytes shows that rAAV9P1 utilizes integrin subunits α v, β 8, and either β 3 or β 5 as well as the AAV receptor AAVR. This receptor pattern is distinct from that of vectors derived from wildtype AAV2 or AAV9. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide knockout screening revealed the involvement of several astrocyte-associated intracellular signaling pathways in the transduction of human astrocytes by rAAV9P1. This study delineates the unique receptor and intracellular pathway signatures utilized by rAAV9P1 for targeting human astrocytes. These results enhance the understanding of the transduction biology of synthetic rAAV vectors for astrocytes and can promote the development of advanced astrocyte-selective gene delivery vehicles for research and clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Synaptic polarity, that is, whether synapses are inhibitory (−) or excitatory (+), is challenging to map, despite being a key to understand brain function. Here, synaptic polarity is inferred computationally considering three experimental scenarios, depending on the nature of available input data, using the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome as an example. First, the inputs consist of detailed neurotransmitter (NT) and receptor (R) gene expression, integrated through the connectome model (CM). The CM formulates the problem through a wiring rule network that summarizes how NT-R pairs govern synaptic polarity, and resolves 356 synaptic polarities in addition to the 1752 known polarities. Second, known synaptic polarities are considered as an input, in addition to the NT and R gene expression data, but without wiring rules. These data train the spatial connectome model, which infers the polarity of 81% of the CM-resolved connections at % precision, while also inferring 147 of the remaining unknown polarities. Last, without known expression or wiring rules, polarities are inferred through a network sign prediction problem. As an illustration of high performance in this case, the generalized CM is introduced. These results address imminent challenges in unveiling large-scale synaptic polarities, an essential step toward more realistic brain models.},

  abstract     = {Perioperative neurocognitive disorder may develop in vulnerable patients following major operation. While neuroinflammation is linked to the cognitive effects of surgery, how surgery and immune signaling modulate neuronal circuits, leading to learning and memory impairment remains unknown. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, Ca 2+ activity and postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex of a mouse model of thoracic surgery are imaged. It is found that surgery causes neuronal hypoactivity, impairments in learning-dependent dendritic spine formation, and deficits in multiple learning tasks. These neuronal and synaptic alterations in the cortex are mediated by peripheral monocytes through the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1 β production. Depleting peripheral monocytes or inactivating NLRP3 inflammasomes before surgery reduces levels of IL-1 β and ameliorates neuronal and behavioral deficits in mice. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of IL-1 β -producing myeloid cells from mice undertaking thoracic surgery is sufficient to induce neuronal and behavioral deficits in naïve mice. Together, these findings suggest that surgery leads to excessive NLRP3 activation in monocytes and elevated IL-1 β signaling, which in turn causes neuronal hypoactivity and perioperative neurocognitive disorder.},

  abstract     = {Tumor heterogeneity plays a key role in cancer relapse and metastasis, however, the distinct cellular behaviors and kinetics of interactions among different cancer cell subclones and the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. By profiling an isogenic model that resembles spontaneous human ovarian cancer metastasis with an highly metastatic (HM) and non-metastatic (NM) tumor cell pair, one finds an upregulation of Wnt/ β -catenin signaling uniquely in HM. Using humanized immunocompetent mice, one shows for the first time that activated β -catenin acts nonautonomously to modulate the immune microenvironment by enhancing infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) at the metastatic site. Single-cell time-lapse microscopy further reveals that upon contact with macrophages, a significant subset of HM, but not NM, becomes polyploid, a phenotype pivotal for tumor aggressiveness and therapy resistance. Moreover, HM, but not NM, polarizes macrophages to a TAM phenotype. Mechanistically, β -catenin upregulates cancer cell surface metadherin, which communicates through CEACAM1 expressed on macrophages to produce CCL3. Tumor xenografts in humanized mice and clinical patient samples both corroborate the relevance of enhanced metastasis, TAM activation, and polyploidy in vivo. The results thus suggest that targeting the β -catenin-metadherin/CEACAM1-CCL3 positive feedback cascade holds great therapeutic potential to disrupt polyploidization of the cancer subclones that drive metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is the transcriptional template of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which interacts with both host and viral proteins to form minichromosome in the nucleus and is resistant to antiviral agents. Identification of host factors involved in cccDNA transcriptional regulation is expected to prove a new venue for HBV therapy. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mediating the interaction of host factors with various viruses, however, lncRNAs that HBV targets and represses cccDNA transcription have not been fully elucidated. Here, the authors identified LINC01431 as a novel host restriction factor for HBV transcription. Mechanically, LINC01431 competitively bound with type I protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT1) to block the HBx-mediated PRMT1 ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, LINC01431 increased the occupancy of PRMT1 on cccDNA, leading to enhanced H4R3me2a modification and reduced acetylation of cccDNA-bound histones, thereby repressing cccDNA transcription. In turn, to facilitate viral replication, HBV transcriptionally repressed LINC01431 expression by HBx-mediated repression of transcription factor Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2). Collectively, the study demonstrates LINC01431 as a novel epigenetic regulator of cccDNA minichromosome and highlights a feedback loop of HBx-LINC01431-PRMT1 in HBV replication, which provides potential therapeutic targets for HBV treatment.},

  abstract     = {Endothelial monolayers physiologically adapt to flow and flow-induced wall shear stress, attaining ordered configurations in which elongation, orientation, and polarization are coherently organized over many cells. Here, with the flow direction unchanged, a peculiar bi-stable (along the flow direction or perpendicular to it) cell alignment is observed, emerging as a function of the flow intensity alone, while cell polarization is purely instructed by flow directionality. Driven by the experimental findings, the parallelism between endothelia is delineated under a flow field and the transition of dual-frequency nematic liquid crystals under an external oscillatory electric field. The resulting physical model reproduces the two stable configurations and the energy landscape of the corresponding system transitions. In addition, it reveals the existence of a disordered, metastable state emerging upon system perturbation. This intermediate state, experimentally demonstrated in endothelial monolayers, is shown to expose the cellular system to a weakening of cell-to-cell junctions to the detriment of the monolayer integrity. The flow-adaptation of monolayers composed of healthy and senescent endothelia is successfully predicted by the model with adjustable nematic parameters. These results may help to understand the maladaptive response of in vivo endothelial tissues to disturbed hemodynamics and the progressive functional decay of senescent endothelia.},

  abstract     = {Dysregulated maternal nutrition, such as vitamin deficiencies and excessive levels of glucose and fatty acids, increases the risk for congenital heart disease (CHD) in the offspring. However, the association between maternal amino-acid levels and CHD is unclear. Here, it is shown that increased leucine levels in maternal plasma during the first trimester are associated with elevated CHD risk in the offspring. High levels of maternal leucine increase embryonic lysine-leucylation (K-Leu), which is catalyzed by leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS). LARS preferentially binds to and catalyzes K-Leu modification of lysine 339 within T-box transcription factor TBX5, whereas SIRT3 removes K-Leu from TBX5. Reversible leucylation retains TBX5 in the cytoplasm and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Increasing embryonic K-Leu levels in high-leucine-diet fed or Sirt3 knockout mice causes CHD in the offspring. Targeting K-Leu using the leucine analogue leucinol can inhibit LARS activity, reverse TBX5 K-Leu modification, and decrease the occurrence of CHD in high-leucine-diet fed mice. This study reveals that increased maternal leucine levels increases CHD risk in the offspring through inhibition of embryonic TBX5 signaling, indicating that leucylation exerts teratogenic effects during heart development and may be an intervening target of CHD.},

Considering the lifelong need of chelating agents for iron overload patients, a sustained-release formulation that can reduce the number of chelator administrations is essential. Here, injectable hydrogel formulations prepared by integrating crosslinked hyaluronic acid into Pluronic F127 for an extended release of DFO nanochelators are reported. The subcutaneously injected hydrogel shows a thermosensitive sol–gel transition at physiological body temperature and provides a prolonged release of renal clearable nanochelators over 2 weeks, resulting in a half-life 47-fold longer than that of the nanochelator alone. In addition, no chronic toxicity of the nanochelator-loaded hydrogel is confirmed by biochemical and histological analyses. This injectable hydrogel formulation with DFO nanochelators has the potential to be a promising formulation for the treatment of iron overload disorders.},

Graphene as a wonderful additive is often added into polymer to build composite TIMs. However, owing to the lack of a specific design of the graphene skeleton, thermal conductivity of graphene-based composite TIMs is not significantly improved. Here a chloroform-assisted method for rapid growth of vertical graphene (VG) arrays in electric field-assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system is reported. Under the optimum intensity and direction of electric field and by introducing the highly electronegative chlorine into the reactor, the record growth rate of 11.5 µm h −1 is achieved and VG with a height of 100 µm is successfully synthesized. The theoretical study for the first time reveals that the introduction of chlorine accelerates the decomposition of methanol and thus promotes the VG growth in PECVD. Finally, as an excellent filler framework in polymer matrix, VG arrays are used to construct a free-standing composite TIM, which yields a high vertical thermal conductivity of 34.2 W m −1 K −1 at the graphene loading of 8.6 wt% and shows excellent cooling effect in interfacial thermal dissipation of light emitting diode.},

  abstract     = {As an indispensable constituent of plasmonic materials/dielectrics for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effects, dielectrics play a key role in excitation and transmission of surface plasmons which however remain more elusive relative to plasmonic materials. Herein, different roles of vertical dielectric walls, and horizontal and vertical dielectric layers in SERS via 3D periodic plasmonic materials/dielectrics structures are studied. Surface plasmon polariton (SPP) interferences can be maximized within dielectric walls besieged by plasmonic layers at the wall thicknesses of integral multiple half-SPP plasmonic material-dielectric -wavelength which effectively excites localized surface plasmon resonance to improve SERS effects by one order of magnitude compared to roughness and/or nanogaps only. The introduction of extra Au nanoparticles on thin dielectric layers can further enhance SERS effects only slightly. Thus, the designed Au/SiO 2 based SERS chips show an enhancement factor of 8.9 × 10 10 , 265 times higher relative to the chips with far thinner SiO 2 walls. As many as 1200 chips are batch fabricated for a 4 in wafer using cost-effective nanoimprint lithography which can detect trace Hg ions as low as 1 ppt. This study demonstrates a complete generalized platform from design to low-cost batch-fabrication to applications for novel high performance SERS chips of any plasmonic materials/dielectrics.},

However, more advanced capabilities, such as human-like self-protection modalities with a sense of pain, sign of injury, and healing, are more challenging. Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust diffusive memristor based on a copolymer of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinylidene fluoride (FK-800) as an artificial nociceptor (pain sensor) is reported. Devices composed of Ag/FK-800/Pt have outstanding switching endurance &gt;10 6 cycles, orders of magnitude higher than any other two-terminal polymer/organic memristors in literature (typically 10 2 –10 3 cycles). In situ conductive atomic force microscopy is employed to dynamically switch individual filaments, which demonstrates that conductive filaments correlate with polymer grain boundaries and FK-800 has superior morphological stability under repeated switching cycles. It is hypothesized that the high thermal stability and high elasticity of FK-800 contribute to the stability under local Joule heating associated with electrical switching. To mimic biological nociceptors, four signature nociceptive characteristics are demonstrated: threshold triggering, no adaptation, relaxation, and sensitization. Lastly, by integrating a triboelectric generator (artificial mechanoreceptor), memristor (artificial nociceptor), and light emitting diode (artificial bruise), the first bioinspired injury response system capable of sensing pain, showing signs of injury, and healing, is demonstrated.},

Herein, a promising strategy that harnesses functional optical fibers is developed and demonstrated to realize an in vivo endoscopic cancer sensing and therapy ensemble. Tumor detection is investigated using hypoxia-sensitive fluorescent fibers to realize fast and accurate tumor recognition and diagnosis. The tumor treatment is further performed by exploiting the endogenous photothermal effect of rare-earth-doped optical fibers. The eradication of orthotopic and subcutaneous xenografts significantly validates the availability of tumoricidal fibers.

These folded molecules possess excellent ET ability with electron mobilities of three orders of magnitude higher than those of linear and planar counterparts. Theoretical calculation and crystallography analysis demonstrate the through-space conjugated folded configuration has not only reduced reorganization energy but also enlarged charge transfer integral at various dimensions, bringing about efficient multi-dimensional ET, independent of molecular orientation. By adopting the folded molecule as ET layers, OLEDs with no matter delayed fluorescence or phosphorescence emitters can achieve high external quantum efficiencies and long operational lifetimes simultaneously.

Compared with liquid assembling and catalytic templating methods, laser-induced graphene (LIG) is showing facile and scalable advantages but still faces limited sizes and geometries by using template induction or on-site lay-up strategies. In this work, a new LIG protocol is developed for facile stacking and shaping 3D LIG macrostructures by laminating layers of LIG papers (LIGPs) with combined resin infiltration and hot pressing. Specifically, the constructed 3D LIGP composites (LIGP-C) are compatible with large area, high thickness, and customizable flat or curved shapes. Additionally, systematic research is explored for investigating critical processing parameters on tuning its multifunctional properties. As the laminated layers are stacked from 1 to 10, it is discovered that piezoresistivity (i.e., gauge factor) of LIGP-C dramatically reflects an ≈3900% improvement from 0.39 to 15.7 while mechanical and electrical properties maintain simultaneously at the highest levels, attributed to the formation of densely packed fusion layers. Along with excellent durability for resisting multiple harsh environments, a sensor-array system with 5 × 5 LIGP-C elements is finally demonstrated on fiber-reinforced polymeric composites for accurate strain mapping.},

  abstract     = {In this work, immobilization of the often unwanted filaments in dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) is achieved and used for one-step deposition of patterned coatings. By texturing one of the dielectric surfaces, a discharge containing stationary plasma filaments is ignited in a mix of argon and propargyl methacrylate (PMA) in a reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. From PMA, hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical and topographical contrasts at sub-millimeter scale are obtained on silicon and glass substrates. Chemical and physical characterizations of the samples are performed by micrometer-scale X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared imaging and by water contact angle and profilometry, respectively. From the latter and additional information from high-speed imaging of the plasma phase and electrical measurements, it is suggested that filaments, denser in energetic species, lead to higher deposition rate with higher fragmentation of the precursor, while surface discharges igniting outwards the filaments are leading to smoother and slower deposition. This work opens a new route for a one-step large-area chemical and morphological patterning of surfaces at sub-millimeter scales. Moreover, the possibility to separately deposit coatings from filaments and the surrounding plasma phase can be helpful to better understand the processes occurring during plasma polymerization in filamentary DBD.},

  abstract     = {Here, a sol-gel method is used to prepare a Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA) precursor with a 2D network, which is further annealed to an Fe 3 O 4 /NiC x composite (NiFe-PBA-gel-cal), inheriting the ultrahigh specific surface area of the parent structure. When the composite is used as both anode and cathode catalyst for overall water splitting, it requires low voltages of 1.57 and 1.66 V to provide a current density of 100 mA cm −2 in alkaline freshwater and simulated seawater, respectively, exhibiting no obvious attenuation over a 50 h test. Operando Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that NiOOH 2–x active species containing high-valence Ni 3+ /Ni 4+ are in situ generated from NiC x during the water oxidation. Density functional theory calculations combined with ligand field theory reveal that the role of high valence states of Ni is to trigger the production of localized O 2p electron holes, acting as electrophilic centers for the activation of redox reactions for oxygen evolution reaction. After hydrogen evolution reaction, a series of ex situ and in situ investigations indicate the reduction from Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ and the evolution of Ni(OH) 2 are the origin of the high activity.},

Its binding induces a unique “up” conformation for one of the V2 loops in the trimeric envelope glycoprotein and is heavily dependent on glycan, which provides nearly half of the binding surface. Their unmutated common ancestor neutralizes the autologous virus. Continuous maturation enhances neutralization potency and breadth of J038 lineage antibodies via expanding antibody-Env contact areas surrounding the core region contacted by germline-encoded residues.

Utilizing the proposed logic scheme in an elegant form of unity structure and minimum cost, the implementation of a 1-bit adder is demonstrated economically, and a promising circuit scheme for the N -bit adder is exhibited. Some critical issues including the crosstalk problem, energy consumption, and peripheral circuits are further simulated and discussed.

Using hydrogen evolution (HER) as a model reaction, it is found that the subsurface doping Ru can optimize the hydrogen adsorption energy and improve the catalytic performance, with overpotentials of 28 and 45 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline and acidic media, respectively, and in particular, 28 mV in neutral electrolyte.

The introduction of AEM tetrahedral unit MgSe 4 effectively widens the band gap of DCL compounds. The title compound exhibits a wide band gap of 2.96 eV, resulting in a high laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of ≈3.0 × AgGaS 2 (AGS). Furthermore, the compound shows a suitable second harmonic generation (SHG) response (≈0.9 × AGS) with a type-I phase-matching (PM) behavior and a wide IR transparent range.

The machine vision with the sensor reservoir constituted by designed self-powered Au/P(VDF-TrFE)/Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 /ITO devices is competent for both static and dynamic vision tasks. It shows an accuracy of 99.97% for face classification and 100% for dynamic vehicle flow recognition.

  abstract     = {Molecular systems that can function as photoresists are essential for the fabrication of flexible electronics through all-photolithographic processes. Most of the reported molecular systems for photo-patterning of polymeric semiconductors contain binary or multi-components. In comparison, single component semiconducting photoresist is advantageous since it will circumvent the optimization of phase separation and ensure the patterned semiconducting thin films to be more uniform. In this paper, a single component semiconducting photoresist (PDPP4T-N 3 ) by incorporating azide groups into the branching alkyl chains of a diketopyrrolopyrrole-based conjugated polymer is reported. The results reveal that i) the azide groups make the side chains to be photo-cross-linkable; ii) uniform patterns with size as small as 5 µm form under mild UV irradiation (365 nm, 85 mW cm −2 ) at ambient conditions; iii) such photo-induced cross-linking does not affect the inter-chain packing; iv) benefiting from the single component feature, field-effect transistors (FETs) with the individual patterned thin films display satisfactorily uniform performances with average charge mobility of 0.61 ± 0.10 cm 2 V –1 s –1 and threshold voltage of 3.49 ± 1.43 V.

The hybrid film is elegantly compounded with a clinical artificial ligament to act as a buffer zone to bridge the soft (ligament) and hard tissues (bone). Moreover, the bioactive film-decorated ligament can be rolled into a 3D bio-instructive implant with spatial-controllable distribution of CPC bioactive motifs. CPC then promotes the recruitment and differentiation of endogenous cells in to the implant inside part, which enables a vascularized bone growth into the implant, and forms a structure mimicking the biological ligament–bone interface, thereby significantly improving osteointegration and biomechanical property. Thus, this special design provides an effective SHID-guided implant-bioactivation strategy unreached by the traditional manufacturing methods, enlightening a promising technology to develop an ideal SHID for translational use in the future.},

The robust therapeutics of FEGCG/Zn are measured in terms of the regulating effect on programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the effective delivery of diverse biomolecules, and the hitchhiking ability using living cells. Taking small interfering RNA of PD-L1 (siPD-L1) and erythrocytes as an example, the fabricated biomimetic system achieves excellent siPD-L1 delivery and further improves siPD-L1 accumulation in tumors. Finally, the combination of FEGCG/Zn and siPD-L1 promotes antitumor immunotherapy through alleviation of T cells exhaustion by regulating PD-L1 expression in tumor cells.

  abstract     = {Atomically precise gold clusters are highly desirable due to their well-defined structure which allows the study of structure–property relationships. In addition, they have potential in technological applications such as nanoscale catalysis. The structural, chemical, electronic, and optical properties of ligated gold clusters are strongly defined by the metal–ligand interaction and type of ligands. This critical feature renders gold–phosphine clusters unique and distinct from other ligand-protected gold clusters. The use of multidentate phosphines enables preparation of varying core sizes and exotic structures beyond regular polyhedrons. Weak gold–phosphorous (Au–P) bonding is advantageous for ligand exchange and removal for specific applications, such as catalysis, without agglomeration. The aim of this review is to provide a unified view of gold–phosphine clusters and to present an in-depth discussion on recent advances and key developments for these clusters. This review features the unique chemistry, structural, electronic, and optical properties of gold–phosphine clusters. Advanced characterization techniques, including synchrotron-based spectroscopy, have unraveled substantial effects of Au–P interaction on the composition-, structure-, and size-dependent properties. State-of-the-art theoretical calculations that reveal insights into experimental findings are also discussed. Finally, a discussion of the application of gold–phosphine clusters in catalysis is presented.},

  abstract     = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is a complex disease. An ongoing accumulation of mutations results in increased genetic diversity, with the tumor acquiring distinct subclones. However, non-genetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity, the cellular differentiation state and the interplay between subclonal evolution and transcriptional heterogeneity are poorly understood. Here, the authors perform single-cell RNA sequencing from 14 untreated PCa patients. They create an extensive cell atlas of the PCa patients and mapped developmental states onto tumor subclonal evolution. They identify distinct subclones across PCa patients and then stratify tumor cells into four transcriptional subtypes, EMT-like (subtype 0), luminal A-like (subtype 1), luminal B/C-like (subtype 2), and basal-like (subtype 3). These subtypes are hierarchically organized into stem cell-like and differentiated status. Strikingly, multiple subclones within a single primary tumor present with distinct combinations of preferential subtypes. In addition, subclones show different communication strengths with other cell types within the tumor ecosystem, which may modulate the distinct transcriptional subtypes of the subclones. Notably, by integrating TCGA data, they discover that both tumor cell transcriptional heterogeneity and cellular ecosystem diversity correlate with features of a poor prognosis. Collectively, their study provides the analysis of subclonal and transcriptional heterogeneity and its implication for patient prognosis.},

  abstract     = {Understanding metabolism is of great significance to decipher various physiological and pathogenic processes. While great progress has been made to profile gene expression, how to capture organ-, tissue-, and cell-type-specific metabolic profile (i.e., metabolic tissue atlas) in complex mammalian systems is lagging behind, largely owing to the lack of metabolic imaging tools with high resolution and high throughput. Here, the authors applied mid-infrared imaging coupled with heavy water (D 2 O) metabolic labeling to a scope of mouse organs and tissues. The premise is that, as D 2 O participates in the biosynthesis of various macromolecules, the resulting broad C-D vibrational spectrum should interrogate a wide range of metabolic pathways. Applying multivariate analysis to the C-D spectrum, the authors successfully identified both inter-organ and intra-tissue metabolic signatures of mice. A large-scale metabolic atlas map between different organs from the same mice is thus generated. Moreover, leveraging the power of unsupervised clustering methods, spatially-resolved metabolic signatures of brain tissues are discovered, revealing tissue and cell-type specific metabolic profile in situ. As a demonstration of this technique, the authors captured metabolic changes during brain development and characterized intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity of glioblastoma. Altogether, the integrated platform paves a way to map the metabolic tissue atlas for complex mammalian systems.},

  abstract     = {Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Exogenous delivery of nitric oxide (NO) to the infarcted myocardium has proven to be an effective strategy for treating MI due to the multiple physiological functions of NO. However, reperfusion of blood flow to the ischemic tissues is accompanied by the overproduction of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can further exacerbate tissue damage and compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Here, an injectable hydrogel is synthesized from the chitosan modified by boronate-protected diazeniumdiolate (CS-B-NO) that can release NO in response to ROS stimulation and thereby modulate ROS/NO disequilibrium after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Furthermore, administration of CS-B-NO efficiently attenuated cardiac damage and adverse cardiac remodeling, promoted repair of the heart, and ameliorated cardiac function, unlike a hydrogel that only released NO, in a mouse model of myocardial I/R injury. Mechanistically, regulation of the ROS/NO balance activated the antioxidant defense system and protected against oxidative stress induced by I/R injury via adaptive regulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Inflammation is then reduced by inhibition of the activation of NF- κ B signaling. Collectively, these results show that this dual-function hydrogel may be a promising candidate for the protection of tissues and organs after I/R injury.},

However, it is still unclear whether a lack of social connectedness affects trauma-related intrusions and the neural processing of fear signals. Moreover, it is uncertain, whether loneliness plays a different role in women and men. A prestratification strategy is used and n = 47 ( n = 20 women) healthy lonely individuals and n = 35 controls ( n = 18 women) are recruited. Participants are exposed to an experimental trauma and evoked intrusive thoughts in daily life are monitored for three consecutive days. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to assess neural habituation to fearful faces and fear learning (conditioning and extinction) prior to trauma exposure. The results reveal a significant interaction between loneliness and sex such that loneliness is associated with more intrusions in men, but not in women. A similar pattern emerges at the neural level, with both reduced amygdala habituation to repeated fearful faces and amygdala hyperreactivity during the conditioning of fear signals in lonely men. The findings indicate that loneliness may confer vulnerability to intrusive memories after trauma exposure in healthy men and that this phenotype relates to altered limbic processing of fear signals.},

In this work, the tetragonal zircon BiVO 4 is prepared by epitaxial growth on FTO substrate and its overall water splitting reaction is studied. Under the influence of epitaxial strain, the conduction band position shifts negatively and beyond H + /H 2 reduction potential (0 V vs NHE), which enables it to possess the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. After loading cocatalysts, the overall water splitting ( λ &gt; 400 nm) is realized (H 2 : ≈65.7 µmol g −1 h −1 , O 2 : ≈32.6 µmol g −1 h −1 ), and the value of solar hydrogen conversion efficiency is 0.012%. The single-particle photoluminescence (PL) spectra and PL decay kinetics tests demonstrate the cocatalysts are beneficial to the separation and transfer of carriers.

Herein, an implantable miniaturized sensor and telemetry system are developed that can detect this process, discern the different cell types associated with ISR, distinguish sub plaque components as demonstrated with ex vivo samples, and differentiate blood from blood clot, all on a silicon substrate making it suitable for integration onto a vascular stent.

Bacterial infection can disrupt blood vessels and trigger thrombosis in tumor tissues, resulting in the cut-off of nutrient supply to tumor cells and the arrest of tumor growth. The expression of cytolysin A induced by the acidic tumor microenvironment further strengthens thrombosis and provides a complementary therapeutic option due to its pore-forming function.

PG can deform as much as 27.2% within 110 ms, and its actuation pressure reaches ≈354.6 MPa. Surprisingly, PG exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of ≈66.8%, which can be attributed to its super-viscous nanoconfined water that efficiently translates the movement of water molecules to PG&#39;s mechanical deformation.

Firstly, the inner ZnS and ZnSe shells confine the excitons inside the cores of QDs and provide a better lattice matching with respect to the outermost shell, which ensures high photoluminescence quantum yields of QDs. Secondly, the CdZnS shell affords its QDs with shallow valence bands (VBs). Therefore, the CdZnS shell could be used as a springboard, which decreases the energy barrier for hole injection from polymers to QDs to be below 1.0 eV. It makes the holes to be easily injected into the QD EMLs and enables a balanced recombination of charge carriers in quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). Thirdly, the RGB QLEDs made by these new QDs exhibit peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 20.2%, 19.2%, and 8.4%, respectively. In addition, the QLEDs exhibit unexpected luminance values at low applied voltages and therefore high power efficiencies.

Previously, the combination of this jamming phenomenon with the ability to transport grains across multiple soft actuators for shape morphing has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the use of hollow glass spheres as granular media that functions as a jammable “quasi-hydraulic” fluid in a fluidic elastomeric actuator that better mimics a key featur of animal musculature: independent control over i) isotonic actuation for motion; and ii) isometric actuation for stiffening without shape change. To best implement the quasi-hydraulic fluid, the authors design and build a fluidic device. Leveraging this combination of physical properties creates a new option for fluidic actuation that allows higher specific stiffness actuators using lower volumetric flow rates in addition to independent control over shape and stiffness. These features are showcased in a robotic catcher&#39;s mitt by stiffening the fluid in the glove&#39;s open configuration for catching, unjamming the media, then pumping additional fluid to the mitt to inflate and grasp.},

EV secreted by hiPSC and cardiac derivatives show a typical size distribution profile and the expression of specific EV markers. Bioactivity assays show increased tube formation and migration in HUVEC treated with hiPSC-EV compared to EV from committed cell populations. hiPSC-EV also significantly increase cell cycle activity of hiPSC-CM. Global miRNA expression profiles, obtained by small RNA-seq analysis, corroborate an EV-miRNA pattern indicative of stem cell to cardiomyocyte specification, confirming that hiPSC-EV are enriched in pluripotency-associated miRNA with higher in vitro pro-angiogenic and pro-proliferative properties. In particular, a stemness maintenance miRNA cluster upregulated in hiPSC-EV targets the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, involved in cell proliferation and survival.

Interestingly, culturing these cells leads to generation of kidney-like structures. First, the assembly of self-organizing 3D kidney-like structures is observed. These kidney organoids contain podocytes, proximal tubules, and endothelial cells that form networks of capillary loop-like structures. Second, the differentiation of kidney stem cells into functionally mature tubules and self-organizing kidney-shaped structures in monolayer culture that selectively endocytoses dextran, is shown. Finally, the de novo generation of an entire self-organizing nephron from monolayer cultures is observed. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that Sirt2-mediated canonical Wnt/ β -catenin signaling is critical for the development of kidney organoids.

  abstract     = {Metal halide perovskite scintillators encounter unprecedented opportunities in indirect ionizing radiation detection due to their high quantum yields. However, the long scintillation lifetime of microseconds upon irradiation, known as the afterglow phenomenon, obviously limits their fast development. Here, a new type of hybrid X-ray detector wafer combining direct methylamine lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) semiconductor and indirect zero-dimensional cesium copper iodide (Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 ) scintillator through low-cost fast tableting processes is reported. Due to the fast energy transfer from Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 to MAPbI 3 , the device response time to X-rays is dramatically reduced by nearly 30 times to 36.6 ns, which enables fast X-ray detection capability by a large area detector arrays within 1 s. Moreover, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 exists at the grain boundaries of MAPbI 3 crystals, and blocks the paths of mobile ions of perovskite, leading to the lowest detectable dose rate of hybrid X-ray detector is thus reduced by 1.5 times compared with control MAPbI 3 direct-type semiconductor, and 10 times compared with the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 indirect-type scintillator. The direct/indirect hybrid wafer also exhibits improved operation stability at ambient conditions without any encapsulation. This new kind of hybrid X-ray detectors provides strong competitiveness by combining the advantages of both direct perovskite semiconductors and indirect perovskite scintillators for next-generation products.},

  abstract     = {Despite the efficacy demonstrated by immunotherapy recently, liver cancer still remains one of the deadliest cancers, mainly due to heterogeneity of this disease. Continuous exploration of new therapeutics is therefore necessary. Chemical-induced cell differentiation can serve as a promising approach, with its ability to consistently remodel gene expression profile and alter cell fate. Inspired by advances in stem cell and reprogramming field, here it is reported that a small molecule cocktail (SMC) consisted of: SB431542 (TGF β inhibitor), CHIR99021 (GSK3 β inhibitor), BIX01294 (H3K9 methyltransferase/G9a inhibitor), and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), can induce differentiation of liver cancer cells including cell lines, primary cancer cells, cancer stem cells, and drug resistant cells. Treated cells lose malignant characteristics and regain hepatocyte phenotype instead. When applied in vivo, SMC induces wide range of tissue necrosis or fibrosis within the tumors, while remaining tissues begin to express hepatic nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4 α) , the hepatic nuclear marker. SMC also leads to tumor abrogation in orthotopic xenograft models and life span extension of animals. The powerful differentiation induction of SMC is exerted through modulation of Akt/mTOR/HIF1 α signaling and metabolic reprogramming, as well as suppressing Snail and enhancing HNF4 α expression. Together, these results highlight that chemical-induced differentiation has the potential to effectively treat liver cancer disregard of heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have extensive potential for disease modelling and regenerative medicine. However, the limited vascularization and immaturity of kidney organoids have been still remained to overcome. Extracellular matrix (ECM) can provide mechanical support and a biochemical microenvironment for cell growth and differentiation. Here in vitro methods using a kidney decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogel to culture hPSC-derived kidney organoids, which have extensive vascular network and their own endothelial cells, are reported. Single-cell transcriptomics reveal that the vascularized kidney organoids cultured using the kidney dECM have more mature patterns of glomerular development and higher similarity to human kidney than those cultured without the kidney dECM. Differentiation of α -galactosidase A (GLA)-knock-out hPSCs generated using CRISPR/Cas9 into kidney organoids by the culture method using kidney dECM efficiently recapitulate Fabry nephropathy with vasculopathy. Transplantation of kidney organoids with kidney dECM into kidney of mouse accelerates the recruitment of endothelial cells from the host mouse kidney and maintains vascular integrity with the more organized slit diaphragm-like structures than those without kidney dECM. The kidney dECM methodology for inducing extensive vascularization and maturation of kidney organoids can be applied to studies for kidney development, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine.},

  abstract     = {Two new fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA) isomers with nonlinear and linear molecular conformation, m -BAIDIC and p -BAIDIC, are designed and synthesized. Despite the similar light absorption range and energy levels, the two isomers exhibit distinct electron reorganization energies and molecular packing motifs, which are directly related to the molecular conformation. Compared with the nonlinear acceptor, the linear p -BAIDIC shows more ordered molecular packing and higher crystallinity. Furthermore, p -BAIDIC-based devices exhibit reduced nonradiative energy loss and improved charge transport mobilities. It is beneficial to enhance the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and short-current current density ( J SC ) of the devices. Therefore, the linear FREA, p -BAIDIC yields a relatively higher efficiency of 7.71% in the binary device with PM6, in comparison with the nonlinear m -BAIDIC. When p -BAIDIC is incorporated into the binary PM6/BO-4Cl system to form a ternary system, synergistic enhancements in V OC , J SC , fill factor (FF), and ultimately a high efficiency of 17.6% are achieved.},

Given advances in material science, nanochemistry, and nanobiotechnology, a broad spectrum of functional nanosystems has been explored to satisfy the extensive requirements of ophthalmologic applications. In the present review, the recent progress in nanosystems, both conventional and emerging nanomaterials in ophthalmology from state-of-the-art studies, are comprehensively examined and the role of their fundamental physicochemical properties in bioavailability, tissue penetration, biodistribution, and elimination after interacting with the ophthalmologic microenvironment emphasized. Furthermore, along with the development of surface engineering of nanomaterials, emerging theranostic methodologies are promoted as potential alternatives for multipurpose ocular applications, such as emerging biomimetic ophthalmology (e.g., smart electrochemical eye), thus provoking a holistic review of “ocular nanomedicine.” By affording insight into challenges encountered by ocular nanomedicine and further highlighting the direction of future studies, this review provides an incentive for enriching ocular nanomedicine-based fundamental research and future clinical translation.},

A resin formulation based on dicyclopentadiene is produced using a latent olefin metathesis catalyst, various photosensitizers (PSs) and photobase generators (PBGs) to achieve efficient initiation at one wavelength (e.g., blue light) and fast catalyst decomposition and polymerization deactivation at a second (e.g., UV-light). This process enables 2D stereolithographic (SLA) printing, either using photomasks or patterned, collimated light. Importantly, the same process is readily adapted for 3D continuous AM, with printing rates of 36 mm h –1 for patterned light and up to 180 mm h –1 using un-patterned, high intensity light.},

  abstract     = {All-solid-state (ASS) Na–S batteries are promising for a large-scale energy-storage system owing to numerous merits. However, the high conversion reaction barrier impedes their practical application. In this work, the basic mechanism on how Se catalyzes the conversion reaction in the Na–S batteries is unraveled. The sodiation/desodiation of Na–SeS 2 nanobatteries are systematically evaluated via in situ transmission electron microscopy (in situ TEM) with a microheating device. The real-time analyses reveal an amorphous Na–Se x S y intermediate phase appears during the direct conversion from SeS 2 to Na 2 S, and a reverse reaction succeeds at 100 °C with a prior formation of Se. The absence of polysulfides and a much lower desodiation temperature in contrast to Na–S nanobatteries demonstrate that the Se incorporation significantly lowers the conversion reaction barrier. According to these findings, the ASS SeS 2 batteries using a Na 3 SbS 4 solid electrolyte (SE) are assembled using various SE:C ratios in the composite cathodes to investigate the effect of the ion and electron transport on the electrochemical properties, including the effective transport properties, MacMullin number, and the tortuosity factor. The obtained results in turn confirm the findings from the in situ TEM. These findings are applicable to optimize other S-based active materials and improve their utilization.},

  abstract     = {The tuning of vertical morphology is critical and challenging for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) binary D18-Cl/L8-BO system is attained while maintaining the high short-circuit current ( J SC ) and fill factor (FF) by employing 1,4-diiodobenzene (DIB), a volatile solid additive. It is suggested that DIB can act as a linker between donor or/and acceptor molecules, which significantly modifies the active layer morphology. The overall crystalline packing of the donor and acceptor is enhanced, and the vertical domain sizes of phase separation are significantly decreased. All these morphological changes contribute to exciton dissociation, charge transport, and collection. Therefore, the best-performing device exhibits an efficiency of 18.7% with a V OC of 0.922 V, a J SC of 26.6 mA cm −2 , and an FF of 75.6%. As far as it is known, the V OC achieved here is by far the highest among the reported OSCs with efficiencies over 17%. This work demonstrates the high competence of solid additives with two iodine atoms to tune the morphology, particularly in the vertical direction, which can become a promising direction for future optimization of OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key half-reaction in many electrochemical transformations, and efficient electrocatalysts are critical to improve its kinetics which is typically sluggish due to its multielectron-transfer nature. Perovskite oxides are a popular category of OER catalysts, while their activity remains insufficient under the conventional adsorbate evolution reaction scheme where scaling relations limit activity enhancement. The lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) has been recently reported to overcome such scaling relations and boost the OER catalysis over several doped perovskite catalysts. However, direct evidence supporting the LOM participation is still very little because the doping strategy applied would introduce additional active sites that may mask the real reaction mechanism. Herein, a dopant-free, cation deficiency manipulation strategy to tailor the bulk diffusion properties of perovskites without affecting their surface properties is reported, providing a perfect platform for studying the contribution of LOM to OER catalysis. Further optimizing the A-site deficiency achieves a perovskite candidate with excellent intrinsic OER activity, which also demonstrates outstanding performance in rechargeable Zn–air batteries and water electrolyzers. These findings not only corroborate the key role of LOM in OER electrocatalysis, but also provide an effective way for the rational design of better catalyst materials for clean energy technologies.},

  abstract     = {Despite ongoing research into photocontrolled supramolecular switches, reversible photoswitching between room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and delayed fluorescence is rare in the aqueous phase. Herein, an efficient RTP-fluorescence switch based on a cascaded supramolecular assembly is reported, which is constructed using a 6-bromoisoquinoline derivative (G 3 ), cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4A4), and a photochromic spiropyran (SP) derivative. Benefiting from the confinement effect of CB[7], initial complexation with CB[7] arouses an emerging RTP signal at 540 nm for G 3 . This structure subsequently coassembles with amphiphilic SC4A4 to form tight spherical nanoparticles, thereby further facilitating RTP emission (≈12 times) in addition to a prolonged lifetime (i.e., 1.80 ms c.f., 50.1 µs). Interestingly, following cascaded assembly with a photocontrolled energy acceptor (i.e., SP), the efficient light-driven RTP energy transfer occurs when SP is transformed to its fluorescent merocyanine (MC) state. Ultimately, this endows the final system with an excellent RTP–fluorescence photoswitching property accompanied by multicolor tunable long-lived emission. Moreover, this switching process can be reversibly modulated over multiple cycles under alternating UV and visible photoirradiation. Finally, the prepared switch is successfully applied to photocontrolled multicolor cell labeling to offer a new approach for the design and fabrication of novel advanced light-responsive RTP materials in aqueous environments.},

  abstract     = {Bi 2 Te 3 based thermoelectric alloys have been commercialized in solid-state refrigeration, but the poor mechanical properties restrict their further application. Nanotwins have been theoretically proven to effectively strengthen these alloys and could be sometimes constructed by strong deformation during synthesis. However, the obscure underlying formation mechanism restricts the feasibility of twin boundary engineering on Bi 2 Te 3 based materials. Herein, thorough microstructure characterizations are employed on a series of Bi 0.4 Sb 1.6 Te 3+ δ alloys to systematically investigate the twins’ formation mechanism. The results show that the twins belong to the annealing type formed in the sintering process, which is sensitive to Te deficiency, rather than the deformation one. The Te deficiency combined with mechanical deformation is prerequisite for constructing dense nanotwins. By reducing the δ below −0.01 and undergoing strong deformation, samples with a high density of nanotwins are obtained and exhibit an ultrahigh compressive strength over 250 MPa, nearly twice as strong as the previous record reported in hierarchical nanostructured (Bi, Sb) 2 Te 3 alloy. Moreover, benefitting from the suppressed intrinsic excitation, the average zT value of this robust material could reach near 1.1 within 30–250 °C. This work opens a new pathway to design high-performance and mechanically stable Bi 2 Te 3 based alloys for miniature device development.},

  abstract     = {Calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are considered as promising alternatives in large-scale energy storage due to their divalent electron redox properties, low cost, and high volumetric/gravimetric capacity. However, the high charge density of Ca 2+ contributes to strong electrostatic interaction between divalent Ca 2+ and hosting lattice, leading to sluggish kinetics and poor rate performance. Here, in situ formed poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) (PAQS)@CNT composite is reported as nonaqueous calcium-ion battery cathode. The enolization redox chemistry of organics has fast redox kinetics, and the introduction of carbon nanotube (CNT) accelerates electron transportation, which contributes to fast ionic diffusion. As the conductivity of the PAQS is enhanced by the increasing content of CNT, the voltage gap is significantly reduced. The PAQS@CNT electrode exhibits specific capacity (116 mAh g −1 at 0.05 A g −1 ), high rate capacity (60 mAh g −1 at 4 A g −1 ), and an initial capacity of 82 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 (83% capacity retention after 500 cycles). The electrochemical mechanism is proved to be that the PAQS undergoes reduction reaction of their carbonyl bond during discharge and becomes coordinated by Ca 2+ and Ca(TFSI) + species. Computational simulation also suggests that the construction of Ca 2+ and Ca(TFSI) + co-intercalation in the PAQS is the most reasonable pathway.},

Here, an outstanding electrode of yolk–shell ZnS@C nanorods is developed, introducing considerable void space via a self-sacrificial template method. Such carbon encapsulated nanorods moderate integral electronic conductivity, thus ensuring rapid alkali-ions/electrons transporting. Furthermore, the porous structure of these nanorods endows enough void space to mitigate volume stress caused by the insertion/extraction of alkali-ions. Due to the unique structure, these yolk–shell ZnS@C nanorods achieve superior rate performance and cycling performance (740 mAh g −1 at 1.0 A g −1 after 540 cycles) for lithium-ion batteries. As a potassium-ion batteries anode, they achieve an ultra-long lifespan delivering 211.1 mAh g −1 at 1.0 A g −1 after 5700 cycles.

Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses indicate that such yolk–shell ZnS@C anode is a typical reversible conversion reaction mechanism accomplished by alloying processes.

  abstract     = {For valence change memory (VCM)-type synapses, a large number of vacancies help to achieve very linearly changed dynamic range, and also, the low activation energy of vacancies enables low-voltage operation. However, a large number of vacancies increases the current of artificial synapses by acting like dopants, which aggravates low-energy operation and device scalability. Here, mixed-dimensional formamidinium bismuth iodides featuring in-situ formed type-I band structure are reported for the VCM-type synapse. As compared to the pure 2D and 0D phases, the mixed phase increases defect density, which induces a better dynamic range and higher linearity. In addition, the mixed phase decreases conductivity for non-paths despite a large number of defects providing lots of conducting paths. Thus, the mixed phase-based memristor devices exhibit excellent potentiation/depression characteristics with asymmetricity of 3.15, 500 conductance states, a dynamic range of 15, pico ampere-scale current level, and energy consumption per spike of 61.08 aJ. A convolutional neural network (CNN) simulation with the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research-10 (CIFAR-10) dataset is also performed, confirming a maximum recognition rate of approximately 87%. This study is expected to lay the groundwork for future research on organic bismuth halide-based memristor synapses usable for a neuromorphic computing system.},

  abstract     = {Biomimetic skins featuring customizable functions and human tissue-compatible mechanical properties have garnered tremendous interest for potential applications in human–machine interfaces, flexible wearable devices, and soft robotics. However, most existing skin-like materials require complex molecular design or multistep functionalization to achieve various functionalities that match or even surpass the performance of human skin. Thus, simultaneously minimizing production costs and achieving customizable features are still highly desirable yet challenging. Herein, inspired by a well-known kneading technique that renders a homogeneous mixture of all the ingredients, a versatile method involving two steps of kneading and resting is employed to prepare biomimetic skins with a wide scope of customizable features. Commonly used one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) nanofillers and even solvents are demonstrated to be homogeneously dispersed in the viscoelastic hydrogel matrices by hand kneading, which not only contributes to improved mechanical properties and new functionalities, but also makes full use of raw materials without waste. Furthermore, similar to the combination of “condiments” in kneading dough, the flexible integration of functional fillers offers exciting and versatile platforms for the design of biomimetic skins with tunable application-specific properties, such as mechanical compliance, sensory capabilities, freezing resistance, 3D printability, fluorescence tunability, etc.},

Hydrophilic coatings can prevent surface fogging by instantly facilitating pseudo-film water condensation but suffer from short antifogging duration due to water film thickening with further condensation. Here, an innovative strategy is reported to achieve longer antifogging duration via thickening the robust bonded hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymer heteronetwork coating to enhance its water absorption capacity. The combination of strong interfacial adhesion and hydrophilic/hydrophobic heteronetwork structure is key to this approach, which avoids interfacial failure and swelling-induced wrinkles under typical fogging conditions. The developed antifogging coating exhibits prolonged antifogging durations over a wide temperature range for repetitious usages. Eyeglasses coated with this coating successfully maintained fog-free vision in two typical scenarios. Besides, the coating recipes developed in this study also have potential as underwater glues as they demonstrate strong adhesions to both glass and polymer substrates in wet conditions.},

This progress has promoted the property modulation of SWCNTs and the development of SWCNT-based optoelectronic devices. Here, the recent advances in the structure separation of SWCNTs are reviewed, from metallic/semiconducting SWCNTs, to single-chirality species, and to enantiomers by several typical separation techniques and the application of the corresponding sorted SWCNTs. Based on the separation procedure, efficiency, and scalability, as well as, the separable SWCNT species, purity, and quantity, the advantages and disadvantages of various separation techniques are compared.

Although HD cells have been shown to act as an internal neuronal compass in various cortical and subcortical regions, the neural substrate of HD cells is incompletely understood. It is reported that HD cells in the somatosensory cortex comprise regular-spiking (RS, putative excitatory) and fast-spiking (FS, putative inhibitory) neurons. Surprisingly, somatosensory FS HD cells fire in bursts and display much sharper head-directionality than RS HD cells. These FS HD cells are nonconjunctive, rarely theta rhythmic, sparsely connected and enriched in layer 5. Moreover, sharply tuned FS HD cells, in contrast with RS HD cells, maintain stable tuning in darkness; FS HD cells’ coexistence with RS HD cells and angular head velocity (AHV) cells in a layer-specific fashion through the somatosensory cortex presents a previously unreported configuration of spatial representation in the neocortex. Together, these findings challenge the notion that FS interneurons are weakly tuned to sensory stimuli, and offer a local circuit organization relevant to the generation and transmission of HD signaling in the brain.},

Under natural sunlight (&gt;700 W m −2 ), it efficiently harvests 78% NIR light to trigger the thermochromism of perovskites, blocking the heat gain from both the visible and NIR light. Meanwhile, it also exhibits a low mid-infrared emissivity of &lt;0.3, suppressing thermal radiation to the indoor environment. A field test demonstrates that this smart window can reduce the indoor temperature by 8 °C compared to a normal glass window at noon. The near-room-temperature color change, multispectral thermal management, outstanding energy-saving ability, and climate adaptability, and solution-based process of this window make it unique and promising for real applications.},

The clinical AD therapy is usually subjected to low blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and complex interaction mechanisms between A β and phosphorylated Tau. A “Drug-Carrier” synergy therapy is herein designed to simultaneously target A β and Tau-associated pathways for AD treatment. To imitate natural nanoparticle configuration, the endogenous apolipoprotein A-I and its mimicking peptide 4F fused angiopep-2 (Ang) are sequentially grafted onto lipid nanocomposite (APLN), providing liberty of BBB crossing and microglia targeted A β clearance. For synergy treatment, methylene blue (MB) is further assembled into APLN (APLN/MB) for Tau aggregation inhibition. After intravenous administration, the optimized density (5 wt%) of Ang ligands dramatically enhances APLN/MB intracerebral shuttling and accumulation, which is 2.15-fold higher than that Ang absent-modification. The site-specific release of MB collaborates APLN to promote A β capture for microglia endocytosis clearance and reduce p-Tau level by 25.31% in AD pathogenesis. In AD-A β –Tau bearing mouse models, APLN/MB can relieve AD symptoms, rescue neuron viability and cognitive functions. Collectively, it is confirmed that “Drug-Carrier” synergy therapy of APLN/MB is a promising approach in the development of AD treatments.},

With sunlight illumination at subzero temperatures (&gt; −35 °C), the coatings show pronounced capabilities to inhibit freezing, melt accumulated frost, and decrease ice adhesion. Precisely, the icephobic surfaces remain free of frost at −35 °C as long as sunlight illumination is present; the accumulated frost melts rapidly within 300 s. The ice adhesion strength decreases to ≈0 kPa as the melted water acts as a lubricant.

Herein, a ferroelectric domain-mediated strategy is proposed to manipulate the Zn plating behavior and achieve controllable Zn growth orientation by coating Zn foil with a ferroelectric tetragonal KTN (t-KTN) layer. The ferroelectric domain of t-KTN single crystals exhibits periodic distribution of upward and downward polarizations, corresponding to alternating positively and negatively charged surfaces. The charged ferroelectric surfaces can manipulate the transfer kinetics of Zn ions and the concentration distribution of anions via the interplay between ferroelectric dipoles and adsorbed ions. With the synergistic effect of the ferroelectric polarization and domain configurations, the well-aligned interlamellar arrays composed of electrodeposited Zn are formed in the initial deposition process, which enable selective deposition within interlamellar arrays and eliminate the dendrite growth during the following plating process. As a result, the t-KTN layer-modified Zn anode enables reversible Zn plating/stripping with low voltage hysteresis for over 1200 h at 1 mA cm −2 in symmetric cells, and the assembled full cell exhibits a significantly enhanced cycling stability of over 5500 cycles at 5 A g −1 .},

In vivo studies illustrate that the toxicity caused by peptide nanoparticles NPs1 and NPs2 is negligible, and these nanoparticles can alleviate systemic bacterial infections in mice and piglets.

Here, CsPb(BrCl) 1.5 nanocrystals in metal-organic frameworks (MOF) thin films are demonstrated to achieve bright and stable blue LEDs. The lead metal nodes in the MOF thin film react with Cs-halide salts, resulting in 10–20 nm nanocrystals. This is revealed by X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Employing the CsPbX 3 -MOF thin films as emission layers, bright deep blue and sky-blue LEDs are demonstrated that emit at 452 and 476 nm respectively. The maximum external quantum efficiencies of these devices are 0.72% for deep blue LEDs and 5.6% for sky blue LEDs. More importantly, the device can maintain 50% of its original electroluminescence ( T 50 ) for 2.23 h when driving at 4.2 V. Detailed optical spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy suggest that the ion migration can be suppressed that maintains the emission brightness and spectra.

Herein, a strategy of metabolic engineering labeled anaerobic oncolytic bacteria ( Clostridium butyricum ) is demonstrated to achieve the ablation of melanoma. In this system, the metabolic substrate of C. butyricum d -alanine ( d -Ala) is first conjugated with a photosensitizer (TPApy) showing aggregation-induced emission (AIE). The yielded metabolic substrate of d -Ala-TPAPy can be metabolically incorporated into bacterial peptidoglycan to form engineered C. Butyricum . Once the engineered C. butyricum is injected into melanoma, the bacteria can only proliferate in an anaerobic zone, stimulate the tumor immune microenvironment, and ablate the tumor hypoxia region. Following that, the relatively rich oxygen content in the peripheral area can induce the death of C. butyricum . The photosensitizer (PS) on the bacteria can subsequently exert a photodynamic effect in the oxygen-rich region and further remove the melanoma residue under light irradiation. Prominent in vivo melanoma ablation results revealed that the engineering oncolytic bacteria can provide a promising regime for solid tumor eradication.},

  abstract     = {Pnictides are superior infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) material candidates, but the exploration of NLO pnictides is still tardy due to lack of rational material design strategies. An in-depth understanding structure–performance relationship is urgent for designing novel and eminent pnictide NLO materials. Herein, this work unravels a vital band gap mechanism of pnictides, namely P atom with low coordination numbers (2 CN) will cause the decrease of band gap due to the delocalization of non-bonding electron pairs. Accordingly, a general design paradigm for NLO pnictides, ionicity–covalency–metallicity regulation is proposed for designing wide-band gap NLO pnictides with maintained SHG effect. Driven by this idea, millimeter-level crystals of MgSiP2 are synthesized with a wide band gap (2.34 eV), a strong NLO performance (3.5 x AgGaS 2 ), and a wide IR transparency range (0.53–10.3 µm). This work provides an essential guidance for the future design and synthesis of NLO pnictides, and also opens a new perspective at Zintl chemistry important for other material fields.},

However, it is still a significant challenge to fulfill these requirements simultaneously in a single pressure sensor. Herein, a high-performance pressure sensor enabled by polyimide fiber fabric with functionalized carbon-nanotube (PI/FCNT) is obtained via a facile electrophoretic deposition (EPD) approach. High-density FCNT is evenly wrapped and chemically bonded to the fiber surface during the EPD process, forming a conductive hierarchical fiber/FCNT matrix. Benefiting from the large compressible region of PI fiber fabric, abundant yet firm contacting points and high elastic modulus of both PI and CNT, the proposed pressure sensor can be customized and modulated to achieve both an ultra-broad sensing range, long-term stability and high-temperature resistance. Thanks to these merits, the proposed pressure sensor could monitor the human physiological information, detect tiny and extremely high pressure, can be integrated into an intelligent mechanical hand to detect the contact force under high-temperature.},

  abstract     = {Piezoelectric materials enable the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice-versa. Ultrahigh piezoelectricity has been only observed in single crystals. Realization of piezoelectric ceramics with longitudinal piezoelectric constant ( d 33 ) close to 2000 pC N –1 , which combines single crystal-like high properties and ceramic-like cost effectiveness, large-scale manufacturing, and machinability will be a milestone in advancement of piezoelectric ceramic materials. Here, guided by phenomenological models and phase-field simulations that provide conditions for flattening the energy landscape of polarization, a synergistic design strategy is demonstrated that exploits compositionally driven local structural heterogeneity and microstructural grain orientation/texturing to provide record piezoelectricity in ceramics. This strategy is demonstrated on [001] PC -textured and Eu 3+ -doped Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -PbTiO 3 (PMN-PT) ceramics that exhibit the highest piezoelectric coefficient (small-signal d 33 of up to 1950 pC N –1 and large-signal d 33 * of ≈2100 pm V –1 ) among all the reported piezoelectric ceramics. Extensive characterization conducted using high-resolution microscopy and diffraction techniques in conjunction with the computational models reveals the underlying mechanisms governing the piezoelectric performance. Further, the impact of losses on the electromechanical coupling is identified, which plays major role in suppressing the percentage of piezoelectricity enhancement, and the fundamental understanding of loss in this study sheds light on further enhancement of piezoelectricity. These results on cost-effective and record performance piezoelectric ceramics will launch a new generation of piezoelectric applications.},

With the application of pressure, it is surprisingly found that the power factor of this material exhibits λ behavior with a high value of 4.8 mW m −1 K −2 at pressure of 1.8 GPa. Such an enhancement is found to be driven by pressure-induced electronic topological transition, which is revealed by multiple techniques.

However, protein phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of EZH2-S21 remain elusive. Here, it is demonstrated that EZH2 is highly expressed in the ocular lens, and AKT-EZH2 axis is important in TGF β -induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). More importantly, it is identified that MYPT1/PP1 dephosphorylates EZH2-S21 and thus modulates its functions. MYPT1 knockout accelerates EMT, but expression of the EZH2-S21A mutant suppresses EMT through control of multiple families of genes. Furthermore, the phosphorylation status and gene expression modulation of EZH2 are implicated in control of anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) in human and mouse eyes. Together, the results identify the specific phosphatase for EZH2-S21 and reveal EZH2 dephosphorylation control of several families of genes implicated in lens EMT and ASC pathogenesis.

This direct printing strategy avoids tedious processes and offers low-cost and high-volume production, enabling the fabrication of high-resolution, high-aspect ratio embedded metal meshes without sacrificing transparency.

The embedded metal structure still has excellent mechanical stability and good environmental suitability under different harsh working conditions. The practical feasibility of the FTEs is successfully demonstrated with a thermally driven 4D printing structure and a resistive transparent strain sensor.

Moreover, nanocarriers that are not eliminated from the body may cause side effects. These limitations have motivated the development of self-delivery systems that are formed by the self-assembly of different therapeutic agents.

This platform exhibits an excellent synergistic effect to enhance the photothermal bactericidal effect for Staphylococcus aureus under near-infrared irradiation. Furthermore, the results showed that PHMB@Au NPs inhibit the formation of biofilms, quickly remove bacteria to promote wound healing through PTT in infection model in vivo, and even mediate the transition of macrophages from M1 to M2 type, and accelerate tissue angiogenesis.

Here, a new synthetic approach is developed to tune the 3D structure of Pt-based alloys, and switch a synthetic reaction which produces solid PtCu octahedral stars (OSs) to produce PtCu nested skeleton cubes (NSCs) by simple addition of Ni(acac) 2 . In particular, Ni 2+ -guided anisotropic growth is observed to generate the nested skeleton structure in PtCu NSCs. Ni 2+ , though absent from the nanoalloys, not only endows faster Cu reduction kinetics but also acts as a structure-directing agent. Moreover, it is shown that acetic acid treatment of PtCu NSCs/C exposes Pt-rich surface with a fine-tuned Pt d-band center energy and the reduced Cu leaching, resulting in strikingly high activity and stability. Acid-treated PtCu NSCs/C shows a remarkable ORR mass activity of 5.13 A mg Pt –1 , about 26 times higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst. This catalyst also exhibits excellent stability with a lower activity decay of 11.5% and the negligible variation in structure after 10 000 cycles.},

PDAP kills fungal cells by penetrating the fungal cytoplasm, generating reactive oxygen, and inducing fungal apoptosis. The optimal PDAP displays potent antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration as low as 0.4 µg mL −1 against Candida albicans , negligible hemolysis and cytotoxicity, and no susceptibility to antifungal resistance. In addition, PDAP effectively inhibits the formation of fungal biofilms and eradicates the mature biofilms.

  abstract     = {Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are becoming widely utilized as hole-selective layers in high-performance p-i-n architecture perovskite solar cells. Ultrasonic spray coating and airbrush coating are demonstrated here as effective methods to deposit MeO-2PACz; a carbazole-based SAM. Potential dewetting of hybrid perovskite precursor solutions from this layer is overcome using optimized solvent rinsing protocols. The use of air-knife gas-quenching is then explored to rapidly remove the volatile solvent from an MAPbI 3 precursor film spray-coated onto an MeO-2PACz SAM, allowing fabrication of p-i-n devices with power conversion efficiencies in excess of 20%, with all other layers thermally evaporated. This combination of deposition techniques is consistent with a rapid, roll-to-roll manufacturing process for the fabrication of large-area solar cells.},

  abstract     = {SPHK1 (sphingosine kinase-1) catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is found to be highly expressed in solid tumors. Here, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are identified as the key transporters of SPHK1 to the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, SPHK1-packaged EVs elevate S1P levels in the tumor microenvironment, where S1P appears as an immunosuppressive agent. However, the exact mechanism of how S1P mediates its immunosuppressive effects in cancer is not understood. It is investigated that S1P can induce T cell exhaustion. S1P can also upregulate programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) expression through E2F1-mediated transcription. Notably, an SPHK1 inhibitor PF543 improves T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, combining PF543 with an anti-PD-1 antibody reduces tumor burden and metastasis more effectively than PF543 alone in vivo. These data demonstrate a previously unrecognized mechanism of how SPHK1-packaged EVs contribute to the progression of ovarian cancer and thus present the potential clinical application of inhibiting SPHK1/S1P signaling to improve immune checkpoint blockage (anti-PD-1 antibody) therapy in ovarian cancer.},

  abstract     = {Although adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) isolated from patients’ fat are considered as the most important autologous stem cells for tissue repair, significant difficulties in the neural differentiation of ADMSCs still impede stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, a wireless-electrical stimulation method is proposed to direct the neural differentiation of ADMSCs based on the electromagnetic effect using a graphene film as a conductive scaffold. By placing a rotating magnet on the top of a culture system without any inducer, the ADMSCs cultured on graphene differentiate into functional neurons within 15 days. As a conductive biodegradable nanomaterial, graphene film acts as a wireless electrical signal generator driven by the electromagnetic induction, and millivolt-level voltage generated in situ provokes ADMSCs to differentiate into neurons, proved by morphological variation, extremely high levels of neuron-specific genes, and proteins. Most importantly, Ca 2+ intracellular influx is observed in these ADMSC-derived neurons once exposure to neurotransmitters, indicating that these cells are functional neurons. This research enhances stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases using autologous ADMSCs and overcomes the lack of neural stem cells. This nanostructure-mediated physical-signal simulation method is inexpensive, safe, and localized, and has a significant impact on neural regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a global public health threat. Hence, more effective and specific antivirals are urgently needed. Here, COVID-19 hyperimmune globulin (COVID-HIG), a passive immunotherapy, is prepared from the plasma of healthy donors vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine). COVID-HIG shows high-affinity binding to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the N -terminal domain of the S protein, and the nucleocapsid protein; and blocks RBD binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Pseudotyped and authentic virus-based assays show that COVID-HIG displays broad-spectrum neutralization effects on a wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including D614G, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Kappa (B.1.617.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) in vitro. However, a significant reduction in the neutralization titer is detected against Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants. Additionally, assessments of the prophylactic and treatment efficacy of COVID-HIG in an Adv5-hACE2-transduced IFNAR −/− mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection show significantly reduced weight loss, lung viral loads, and lung pathological injury. Moreover, COVID-HIG exhibits neutralization potency similar to that of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin from pooled convalescent plasma. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of COVID-HIG against SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide reference for subsequent clinical trials.},

  abstract     = {The treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most difficult challenges in neurodevelopmental diseases, because of the unclear pathogenesis research and low brain-lesion targeting efficiency. Besides, maternal immune activation has been reported as the most mature and widely used model of ASD and aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4 is a potent anti-inflammatory mediator being involved in the resolution of neuroinflammation in ASD. Therefore, an aspirin encapsulated cascade drug delivery system (Asp@TMNPs) is established, which can successively target the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and microglial cells and response to the acid microenvironment in lysosome. As a result, the mitochondrial oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammation of microglial cells are prominently alleviated. After the treatment of Asp@TMNPs, the social interaction, stereotype behavior, and anxious condition of ASD mice are notably improved and the activation of microglial cells is inhibited. Overall, this system successively penetrates the BBB and targets microglial cells, therefore, it significantly enhances the intracephalic drug accumulation and improves anti-neuroinflammatory efficacy of aspirin, providing a promising strategy for ASD treatment.},

  abstract     = {The metabolite adenosine plays an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) through its ligation with the metabolic checkpoint adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR). Here, an adenosine-A2AR negative feedback pathway is highlighted during photothermal-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD). Adenosine, hydrolyzed from ATP, is amplified during the photothermal-induced ICD process. It is possible to achieve a robust ICD-based immunotherapy via targeting the adenosine-A2AR metabolic pathway. In this regard, an A2AR inhibitor-loaded polydopamine nanocarrier masked by an acid-sensitive PEG shell is designed to enable tumor-specific delivery and photothermal-induced ICD simultaneously. Upon reaching the acidic TME, the PEG shell selectively detaches and exposes the adhesive polydopamine layer, causing the inhibitors to accumulate at the tumor tissue. The accumulated inhibitors attenuate adenosine&#39;s metabolically suppressive effect and strengthen the ICD immune response. It occurs through promoting dendritic cell (DC) activation, increasing CD8 + T lymphocyte infiltration, and reducing the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) population. Furthermore, this synergistic therapy significantly regresses the primary tumor, inhibits distal tumor growth, and prevents lung metastasis. The study highlights a strategy to enhance the immunotherapy efficacy of ICD by blocking the metabolic checkpoint A2AR using advanced nanomaterials.},

While it has been well recognized that the intricate architectural designs of biomineralized composites contribute to their remarkable mechanical performance, the structural features within and corresponding mechanical properties of individual mineral building blocks are often less appreciated in the context of bio-inspired structural composites. The mineral building blocks in biomineralized composites exhibit a variety of salient intracrystalline structural features, such as, organic inclusions, inorganic impurities (or trace elements), crystalline features (e.g., amorphous phases, single crystals, splitting crystals, polycrystals, and nanograins), residual stress/strain, and twinning, which significantly modify the mechanical properties of biogenic minerals. In this review, recent progress in elucidating the intracrystalline structural features of three most common biomineral systems (calcite, aragonite, and hydroxyapatite) and their corresponding mechanical significance are discussed. Future research directions and corresponding challenges are proposed and discussed, such as the advanced structural characterizations and formation mechanisms of intracrystalline structures in biominerals, amorphous biominerals, and bio-inspired synthesis.},

A human model of ectopic LF formation will provide a tool to understand LF development and an alternative to non-human primates for preclinical evaluation of vaccines. Here, it is shown that primary human blood B- and T-lymphocytes autonomously assemble into ectopic LFs when cultured in a 3D extracellular matrix gel within one channel of a two-channel organ-on-a-chip microfluidic device. Superfusion via a parallel channel separated by a microporous membrane is required for LF formation and prevents lymphocyte autoactivation. These germinal center-like LFs contain B cells expressing Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase and exhibit plasma cell differentiation upon activation. To explore their utility for seasonal vaccine testing, autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells are integrated into LF Chips. The human LF chips demonstrate improved antibody responses to split virion influenza vaccination compared to 2D cultures, which are enhanced by a squalene-in-water emulsion adjuvant, and this is accompanied by increases in LF size and number. When inoculated with commercial influenza vaccine, plasma cell formation and production of anti-hemagglutinin IgG are observed, as well as secretion of cytokines similar to vaccinated humans over clinically relevant timescales.},

The origin of these features is computationally rationalized as quantum mechanical interference of localized edge states showing significant amplitude and interlayer coupling variations as a function of the interface stacking configuration.

  abstract     = {Rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs) have attracted great interests for emerging energy applications. Nevertheless, one of the major bottlenecks lies in the fabrication of bifunctional catalysts with high electrochemical activity, high stability, low cost, and free of precious and rare metals. Herein, a high-performance metal-free bifunctional catalyst is synthesized in a single step by regulating radicals within the recently invented high-flux plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (HPECVD) system equipped with in situ plasma diagnostics. Thus-derived (N, O)-doped vertical few-layer graphene film (VGNO) is of high areal population with perfect vertical orientation, tunable catalytic states, and configurations, thus enabling significantly enhanced electrochemical kinetic processes of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with reference to milestone achievements to date. Application of such VGNO to aqueous ZABs (A-ZABs) and flexible solid-state ZABs (S-ZABs) exhibited high discharge power density and excellent cycling stability, which remarkably outperformed ZABs using benchmarked precious-metal based catalysts. The current work provides a solid basis toward developing low-cost, resource-sustainable, and eco-friendly ZABs without using any metals for outstanding OER and ORR catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are fundamental for proper physiological functioning of multicellular organisms. By shuttling nucleic acids and proteins between cells, EVs regulate a plethora of cellular processes, especially those involved in immune signalling. However, the mechanistic understanding concerning the biophysical principles underlying EV-based communication is still incomplete. Towards holistic understanding, particular mechanisms explaining why and when cells apply EV-based communication and how protein-based signalling is promoted by EV surfaces are sought. Here, the authors study vesicle-induced receptor sequestration (VIRS) as a universal mechanism augmenting the signalling potency of proteins presented on EV-membranes. By bottom-up reconstitution of synthetic EVs, the authors show that immobilization of the receptor ligands FasL and RANK on EV-like vesicles, increases their signalling potential by more than 100-fold compared to their soluble forms. Moreover, the authors perform diffusion simulations within immunological synapses to compare receptor activation between soluble and EV-presented proteins. By this the authors propose vesicle-triggered local clustering of membrane receptors as the principle structural mechanism underlying EV-based protein presentation. The authors conclude that EVs act as extracellular templates promoting the local aggregation of membrane receptors at the EV contact site, thereby fostering inter-protein interactions. The results uncover a potentially universal mechanism explaining the unique structural profit of EV-based intercellular signalling.},

These discoveries, at the foundations of the emergent field of twistronics, have so far been mostly limited to explorations in atomically thin condensed matter and photonic systems, with limitations on the degree of control over geometry and twist angle, and inherent challenges in the fabrication of carefully engineered stacked multilayers. Here, this work extends twistronics to widely reconfigurable macroscopic elastic metasurfaces consisting of LEGO pillar resonators. This work demonstrates highly tailored anisotropy over a single-layer metasurface driven by variations in the twist angle between a pair of interleaved spatially modulated pillar lattices. The resulting quasi-periodic moiré patterns support topological transitions in the isofrequency contours, leading to strong tunability of highly directional waves. The findings illustrate how the rich phenomena enabled by twistronics and moiré physics can be translated over a single-layer metasurface platform, introducing a practical route toward the observation of extreme phenomena in a variety of wave systems, potentially applicable to both quantum and classical settings without multilayered fabrication requirements.},

In this study, a novel all-in-one process exchanging ligands and halide anions in film-state for facile color tuning and patterning of cesium lead halide perovskite colloidal quantum dot (PeQD) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is proposed. The proposed all-in-one process significantly enhances the performances of PeQD LEDs by passivating the PeQD with shorter ligands. In addition, the all-in-one process is repeated more stably in the film state. Red, green, and blue LEDs with extremely narrow emission spectra using cesium lead bromide PeQDs and appropriate butylammonium halide solutions are fabricated. Furthermore, the proposed all-in-one process in film-state facilitated rapid color change in localized areas, thereby aiding in realizing fine patterns of narrow widths (300 µm) using simple contact masks. Consequently, various paint-over red/green/blue patterns in PeQD LEDs by applying halide solutions additively are fabricated.},

In combination with theoretical calculations, the reciprocating and unidirectional motions in the trans form as well as the restrained reciprocating motion in the cis form due to the steric hindrance is observed, which could be reversibly switched by visible and UV irradiation. The integration of individual supramolecules into nanocircuits not only offers a facile and effective strategy to probe the dynamic process of supramolecular systems, but also paves the way to construct functional molecular devices toward real applications such as switches, sensors, and logic devices.},

Significantly, the conversion mechanism of NiS in MLIBs is unambiguously demonstrated for the first time, affirming the corporate involvement of both Mg 2+ and Li + at the cathodic side.

Here an effective strategy to achieve high σ and low κ simultaneously is reported on p-type polycrystalline SnSe with isovalent Te ion substitution. The nonequilibrium Sn(Se 1− x Te x ) solid solution bulks with x up to 0.4 are synthesized by the two-step process composed of high-temperature solid-state reaction and rapid thermal quenching. The Te ion substitution in SnSe realizes high σ due to the 10 3 -times increase in hole carrier concentration and effectively reduced lattice κ less than one-third at room temperature. The large-size Te ion in Sn(Se 1− x Te x ) forms weak Sn  Te bonds, leading to the high-density formation of hole-donating Sn vacancies and the reduced phonon frequency and enhanced phonon scattering. This result—doping of large-size ions beyond the equilibrium limit—proposes a new idea for carrier doping and controlling thermal properties to enhance the ZT of polycrystalline SnSe.},

Furthermore, the ferroelectric engineering is able to effectively suppress the growth of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the interface between polymer electrolytes and Na metal electrodes, and it can also enhance the ion diffusion across the electrolyte-ferroelectric-cathode/anode interfaces. Notably, an extraordinarily high discharge capacity of 160.3 mAh g –1 , with 97.4% in retention, is achieved in the ferroelectric-engineered all-solid-state Na metal cell after 165 cycles at room temperature. Moreover, outstanding stability is demonstrated that a high discharge capacity retention of 86.0% is achieved over 180 full charge/discharge cycles, even though the cell has been aged for 2 months.

Despite great demands, the current designs either exhibit limited energy-absorption capacities or perform well only for one-time usage. Here a new kind of energy-absorbing architected materials is created with both high absorption capacity and superior reusability, reaching 10 kJ kg −1 per cycle for more than 200 cycles, that is, unprecedentedly 2000 kJ kg −1 per lifetime. The extraordinary performance is achieved by exploiting the rate-dependent frictional dissipation between prestressed stiff cores and a porous soft elastomer, which is reinforced by an intertwined stiff porous frame. The vast interfaces between the cores and elastomer enable high energy dissipation, while the magnitude of the friction force can adapt passively with the loading rate. The intertwined structure prevents stress concentration and ensures no damage and reusability of the constituents after hundreds of loading cycles. The behaviors of the architected materials, such as self-recoverability, force magnitude, and working stroke, are further tailored by tuning their structure and geometry. This design strategy opens an avenue for developing high-performance reusable energy-absorbing materials that enable novel designs of machines or structures.},

  abstract     = {The development of aqueous rechargeable zinc-iodine (Zn-I 2 ) batteries is still plagued by the polyiodide shuttle issue, which frequently causes batteries to have inadequate cycle lifetimes. In this study, quaternization engineering based on the concept of “electric double layer” is developed on a commercial acrylic fiber skeleton ($1.55–1.7 kg −1 ) to precisely constrain the polyiodide and enhance the cycling durability of Zn-I 2 batteries. Consequently, a high-rate (1 C–146.1 mAh g −1 , 10 C–133.8 mAh g −1 ) as well as, ultra-stable (2000 cycles at 20 C with 97.24% capacity retention) polymer-based Zn-I 2 battery is reported. These traits are derived from the strong electrostatic interaction generated by quaternization engineering, which significantly eliminates the polyiodide shuttle issue and simultaneously realizes peculiar solution-based iodine chemistry (I − /I 3 − ) in Zn-I 2 batteries. The quaternization strategy also presents high practicability, reliability, and extensibility in various complicated environments. In particular, cutting-edge Zn-I 2 batteries based on the concept of derivative material (commercially available quaternized resin) demonstrate ≈100% capacity retention over 17 000 cycles at 20 C. This work provides a general and fresh insight into the design and development of large-scale, low-cost, and high-performance zinc-iodine batteries, as well as, other novel iodine storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Electroconductive hydrogels are very attractive candidates for accelerated spinal cord injury (SCI) repair because they match the electrical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. However, electroconductive hydrogel implantation can potentially aggravate inflammation, and hinder its repair efficacy. Bone marrow stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-exosomes) have shown immunomodulatory and tissue regeneration effects, therefore, neural tissue-like electroconductive hydrogels loaded with BMSC-exosomes are developed for the synergistic treatment of SCI. These exosomes-loaded electroconductive hydrogels modulate microglial M2 polarization via the NF- κ B pathway, and synergistically enhance neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) while inhibiting astrocyte differentiation, and also increase axon outgrowth via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, exosomes combined electroconductive hydrogels significantly decrease the number of CD68-positive microglia, enhance local NSCs recruitment, and promote neuronal and axonal regeneration, resulting in significant functional recovery at the early stage in an SCI mouse model. Hence, the findings of this study demonstrate that the combination of electroconductive hydrogels and BMSC-exosomes is a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI repair.},

Understanding the role of the choice of materials and the filler-matrix architecture is critical to achieving desired functionality of a composite towards applications in flexible electronics and energy harvest devices. Herein, a high-throughput phase-field simulation is conducted to systematically reveal the influence of morphology and spatial orientation of an oxide filler on the piezoelectric, mechanical, and dielectric properties of the piezoelectric nanocomposites. It is discovered that with a constant filler volume fraction, a composite composed of vertical pillars exhibits superior piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling coefficient as compared to the other geometric configurations. An analytical regression is established from a linear regression-based machine learning model, which can be employed to predict the performance of nanocomposites filled with oxides with a given set of piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric permittivity, and stiffness. This work not only sheds light on the fundamental mechanism of piezoelectric nanocomposites, but also offers a promising material design strategy for developing high-performance polymer/inorganic oxide composite-based wearable electronics.},

Despite continued research efforts on membrane-perforating peptides for antimicrobial applications, success in anticancer peptide therapeutics remains elusive given the muted distinction between cancerous and normal cell membranes and the challenge of peptide degradation and neutralization upon intravenous delivery. Using triple-negative breast cancer as a model, the authors report the development of a new class of anticancer peptides. Through function-conserving mutations, the authors achieved cancer cell selective membrane perforation, with leads exhibiting a 200-fold selectivity over non-cancerogenic cells and superior cytotoxicity over doxorubicin against breast cancer tumorspheres. Upon continuous exposure to the anticancer peptides at growth-arresting concentrations, cancer cells do not exhibit resistance phenotype, frequently observed under chemotherapeutic treatment. The authors further demonstrate efficient encapsulation of the anticancer peptides in 20 nm polymeric nanocarriers, which possess high tolerability and lead to effective tumor growth inhibition in a mouse model of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer. This work demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach for enabling translationally relevant membrane-lytic peptides in oncology, opening up a vast chemical repertoire to the arms race against cancer.},

However, the high interface resistance and low ionic conductivity of ASSBs hinder their application. In this study, a self-developed electrochemical model based on an open-source computational fluid dynamics platform is presented. The effect of contact area reduction at the electrode/solid-state electrolyte interface is investigated. Then, a new conceptual 3D structure is introduced to circumvent the existing barriers. The results demonstrate that the discharge time is shortened by over 20% when the area contact ratio reduces from 1.0 to 0.8 at 1 C-rate, owing to the increased overpotential. By adopting the new 3D pillar design, the energy density of ASSBs can be improved. However, it is only when a 3D current collector is contained in the cathode that the battery energy/power density, capacity, and material utilization can be greatly enhanced without being limited by pillar height issues. Therefore, this work provides important insight into the enhanced performance of 3D structures.},

TEGDME in the PPC allows the uniform distribution of conductive LiF species throughout the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) layer which plays a critically important role in the formation of a stable and efficient CEI. In addition, the high modulus of SPEs suppresses the formation of a protrusion-type CEI on the cathode. The SPE with the optimized TEGDME content exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.89 mS cm −1 , an adequate potential stability of up to 4.89 V, and a high Li-ion transference number of 0.81 at 60 °C. Moreover, the Li/SPE/Li cell demonstrates excellent cycling stability for 1650 h, and the Li/SPE/LFP full cell exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 103 mAh g −1 and improved stability over 500 cycles at a rate of 1 C.

However, the critical feature sizes of meta-atom span several orders of magnitude in length scale, almost all the metamaterials are designed to operate at limited bands. It is challenging for a single type of meta-atom with ultra-broadband adaptability. Inspired by the natural hierarchical architectures, herein, the authors introduce a new constructing scheme of cross-wavelength hierarchical metamaterials with a single type of meta-atom that can realize enhancement of terahertz (THz) resonance and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) at the same time. By combining multiple subwavelength structures at different hierarchical levels into a single meta-atom, the obtained metamaterial can operate in two frequencies and realize multiple functionalities. Armed with this hierarchical metamaterial, detecting analytes as small as sub-nanoscale chemical molecules or as big as microscale biomolecules simultaneously can be realized in one single metamaterial for the first time. As a proof-of-concept example, a smart sensory packaging is developed, which allowed them to real-time monitor the kinetic growth of pathogenic bacteria and their metabolites in food without opening the packaging. They believe that their work will provide a valuable example that satisfies the unmet need for multiscale functional meta-devices.},

However, the fundamental trade-off relationship between PCE and transparency limits the performance of BISTPV because implementing a higher semitransparency lowers the optical budget of incoming light. To expand the available optical budget and to enhance the PCE while maintaining a suitable transparency in STUT CIGSe solar cell with single-stage coevaporated 500-nm-thick absorber, an atomic layer deposited wide bandgap Zn(O,S) buffer is introduced as the replacement of conventional CdS buffer, which partially limits incoming light less than 520 nm in wavelength. As a replacement result, more incoming light becomes valid for power conversion, and the short circuit current density ( J sc ) has increased comparatively by 17%, which has directly lead to a large increase in PCE up to 12.41%. Furthermore, Zn(O,S) buffer in the STUT CIGSe solar cell also has enhanced the bifacial compatible efficiency (BCE), which has increased to 14.44% at 1.3 sun and 19.42% at 2.0 sun.},

Nowadays, the advances in understanding and tuning of these properties have greatly promoted a broader application potential especially in energy and environmental fields, by harvesting solar, mechanical, and heat energies. For example, high piezoelectricity and high pyroelectricity can be designed by defect or microstructure engineering for piezo- and pyro-catalyst, respectively. Moreover, highly piezoelectric and broadband (UV–Vis–NIR) light-responsive ferroelectrics can be designed via defect engineering, giving rise to a new concept of photoferroelectrics for efficient photocatalysis, piezocatalysis, pyrocatalysis, and related cocatalysis. This article first summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectrics in terms of piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, and photovoltaic effects based on defect and microstructure engineering. Then, the potential applications in energy generation (i.e., photovoltaic effect, H 2 generation, and self-powered multisource energy harvesting and signal sensing) and environmental protection (i.e., photo-piezo-pyro- cocatalytic dye degradation and CO 2 reduction) are reviewed. Finally, the outlook and challenges are discussed.

  abstract     = {Photocatalysis has the potential to make a major technological contribution to solving pressing environmental and energy problems. There are many strategies for improving photocatalysts, such as tuning the composition to optimize visible light absorption, charge separation, and surface chemistry, ensuring high crystallinity, and controlling particle size and shape to increase overall surface area and exploit the reactivity of individual crystal facets. These processes mainly affect the nanoscale and are therefore summarized as nanostructuring. In comparison, microstructuring is performed on a larger size scale and is mainly concerned with particle assembly and thin film preparation. Interestingly, most structuring efforts stop at this point, and there are very few examples of geometry optimization on a millimeter or even centimeter scale. However, the recent work on nanoparticle-based aerogel monoliths has shown that this size range also offers great potential for improving the photocatalytic performance of materials, especially when the macroscopic geometry of the monolith is matched to the design of the photoreactor. This review article is dedicated to this aspect and addresses some issues and open questions that arise when working with macroscopically large photocatalysts.

Here, circREEP3 is found to be upregulated in CRC tissues. circREEP3 upregulation predicts poor patient survival. circREEP3 knockout suppresses CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis, and impairs stem cell-like phenotype. Mechanistically, circREEP3 recruits the chromatin remodeling protein CHD7 to FKBP10 promoter and activates its transcription. Moreover, circREEP3 restricts RIG-1-dependent antitumor immunity.

  abstract     = {Biodegradable electronics are considered as an important bio-friendly solution for electronic waste (e-waste) management, sustainable development, and emerging implantable devices. Elastic electronics with higher imitative mechanical characteristics of human tissues, have become crucial for human-related applications. The convergence of biodegradability and elasticity has emerged a new paradigm of next-generation electronics especially for wearable and implantable electronics. The corresponding biodegradable elastic materials are recognized as a key to drive this field toward the practical applications. The review first clarifies the relevant concepts including biodegradable and elastic electronics along with their general design principles. Subsequently, the crucial mechanisms of the degradation in polymeric materials are discussed in depth. The diverse types of biodegradable elastomers and gels for electronics are then summarized. Their molecular design, modification, processing, and device fabrication especially the structure–properties relationship as well as recent advanced are reviewed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and the future directions are proposed. The critical insights of biodegradability and elastic characteristics in the elastomers and gel allows them to be tailored and designed more effectively for electronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Biodegradable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have drawn tremendous attention for potential applications such as green electronic skins, degradable flexible displays, and novel implantable devices. However, it remains a huge challenge to simultaneously achieve high mobility, stable operation and controllable biodegradation of OFETs, because most of the widely used biodegradable insulating materials contain large amounts of hydrophilic groups. Herein, it is firstly proposed fungal-degradation ultraflexible OFETs based on the crosslinked dextran (C-dextran) as dielectric layer. The crosslinking strategy effectively eliminates polar hydrophilic groups and improves water and solvent resistance of dextran dielectric layer. The device with spin-coated 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) semiconductor and C-dextran dielectric exhibits the highest mobility up to 7.72 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is higher than all the reported degradable OFETs. Additionally, the device still maintains high performance regardless of in an environment humidity up to 80% or under the extreme bending radius of 0.0125 mm. After completion of their mission, the device can be controllably biodegraded by fungi without any adverse environmental effects, promoting the natural ecological cycles with the concepts of “From nature, for nature”. This work opens up a new avenue for realizing high-performance biodegradable OFETs, and advances the process of the “green” electrical devices in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Pesticide overuse is a major global problem and the cause of this problem is noticeable pesticide loss from undesired bouncing of sprayed pesticide droplets and rain erosion. This further becomes a primary source of soil and groundwater pollution. Herein, the authors report a method that can enhance pesticide droplet deposition and adhesion on superhydrophobic plant leave surfaces by amyloid-like aggregation of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Through the reduction of the disulfide bond of BSA by tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), the amyloid-like phase transition of BSA is triggered that rapidly affords abundant phase-transitioned BSA (PTB) oligomers to facilitate the invasion of the PTB droplet into the nanostructures on a leaf surface. Such easy penetration is further followed by a robust amyloid-mediated interfacial adhesion of PTB on leaf surface. As a result, after mixing with pesticides, the PTB system exhibits a remarkable pesticide adhesion capacity that is more than 10 times higher than conventional fixation of commercial pesticides. The practical farmland experiments show that the use of PTB aggregation could reduce the use of pesticides by 70–90% while ensuring yield. This work demonstrates that current pesticide dosage in actual agriculture production may be largely reduced by utilizing eco-friendly amyloid-like protein aggregation.},

The cellular applications of NP cells during IDD are currently limited due to the lack of in vivo studies showing whether NP cells are heterogeneous and contain ProNPs throughout postnatal stages. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing of purified NP cells is used to map four molecularly defined populations and urotensin II receptor (UTS2R)-expressing postnatal ProNPs is identified, which are markedly exhausted during IDD, in mouse and human specimens. The lineage tracing shows that UTS2R + ProNPs preferentially resides in the NP periphery with its niche factor tenascin-C and give rise to functional NP cells. It is also demonstrated that transplanting UTS2R + ProNPs with tenascin-C into injured intervertebral discs attenuate the progression of IDD. The study provides a novel NP cell atlas, identified resident ProNPs with regenerative potential, and revealed promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets for IDD.},

Currently, the clinical treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is severely limited by drug resistance and adverse effects. Herein, a dual-targeting proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) protein drug, termed PMI Bcr/Abl-R6, is designed by engrafting an MDM2/p53 inhibition peptide sequence onto the Bcr/Abl tetramerization domain. PMI Bcr/Abl-R6, harboring a Bcr/Abl targeting sequence and an MDM2 binding sequence, acts as a PROTAC drug in Ph+ leukemia cells. Its dual-targeting constitution suggests that PMI Bcr/Abl-R6 designs to target the tetramerization domain instead of the Abl kinase domain, therefore has the potential to overcome drug resistance mutations in the kinase domain. The efficient ability of PMI Bcr/Abl-R6 is demonstrated to simultaneously induce Bcr/Abl degradation and activate the p53 pathway.

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death caused by disruption of redox homeostasis and is closely linked to amino acid metabolism. Yin Yang 2 (YY2) and its homolog Yin Yang 1 (YY1) are highly homologous, especially in their zinc-finger domains. Furthermore, they share a consensus DNA binding motif. Increasing evidences have demonstrated the tumor suppressive effect of YY2, in contrast with the oncogenic YY1; however, little is known about the biological and pathological functions of YY2. Here, it is determined that YY2 induces tumor cell ferroptosis and subsequently suppresses tumorigenesis by inhibiting solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) transcription, leading to the decreased glutathione biosynthesis. Furthermore, YY2 and YY1 bind competitively to the same DNA binding site in the SLC7A11 promoter and antagonistically regulate tumor cell ferroptosis, thus suggesting the molecular mechanism underlying their opposite regulation on tumorigenesis. Moreover, mutations of YY2 zinc-finger domains in clinical cancer patients abrogate YY2/SLC7A11 axis and tumor cell ferroptosis. Together, these results provide a new insight regarding the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis, and a mechanistic explanation regarding the tumor suppressive effect of YY2. Finally, these findings demonstrate that homeostasis between YY1 and YY2 is crucial for maintaining redox homeostasis in tumor cells.},

However, the fabrication of large-area high-quality SCTFs with thin thickness still remains a significant challenge due to the elusive growth mechanism of this process. In this work, the influence of three key factors on in situ growth of high-quality large-size MAPbBr 3 SCTFs on HTLs is investigated. An optimal “sweet spot” is determined: low interface energy between the precursor solution and substrate, a slow heating rate, and a moderate precursor solution concentration. As a result, the as-obtained perovskite SCTFs with a thickness of 540 nm achieve a record area to thickness ratio of 1.94 × 10 4 mm, a record X-ray diffraction peak full width at half maximum of 0.017°, and an ultralong carrier lifetime of 1552 ns. These characteristics enable the as-obtained perovskite SCTFs to exhibit a record carrier mobility of 141 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and good long-term structural stability over 360 days.},

Current approaches to transdifferentiation are usually achieved by directly targeting the nuclear functions, such as manipulating the lineage-specific transcriptional factors, microRNAs, and epigenetic modifications. Here, a robust method to convert fibroblasts to neurons through targeting the cytoskeleton followed by exposure to lineage-specification surroundings is reported. Treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts with a single molecule inhibitor of the actomyosin contraction, can disrupt the cytoskeleton, promote cell softening and nuclear export of YAP/TAZ, and induce a neuron-like state. These neuron-like cells can be further converted into mature neurons, while single-cell RNA-seq shows the homogeneity of these cells during the induction process. Finally, transcriptomic analysis shows that cytoskeletal disruption collapses the original lineage expression profile and evokes an intermediate state. These findings shed a light on the underestimated role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining cell identity and provide a paradigm for lineage conversion through the regulation of mechanical properties.},

Specifically, various alloy compositions of (K,A)NbO 3 are considered and their mixing thermodynamics and associated polar properties are examined. To establish structure-property design rules for high-performance ferroelectrics, the sure independence screening sparsifying operator (SISSO) method is employed to extract key features to explain the A-site driven polarization in (K,A)NbO 3 . Using a new metric of agreement via feature-assisted regression and classification, the SISSO model is further extended to predict A-site driven polarization in multicomponent systems as a function of alloy composition, reducing the prediction errors to less than 1%. With the machine learning model outlined in this work, a polarity-composition map is established to aid the development of new multicomponent lead-free polar oxides which can offer up to 25% boosting in A-site driven polarization and achieving more than 150% of the total polarization in pristine KNbO 3 .

In addition to the associated biochemical factors, the physical regulation of morphogenesis has attracted increasing attention. However, the driving force of morphogenesis initiation remains elusive. Here, it is shown that during the growth of multilayered tissues, a morphogenetic process can be self-organized by the progression of compression gradient stemmed from the interfacial mechanical interactions between layers. In tissues with low fluidity, the compression gradient is progressively strengthened during growth and induces stratification by triggering symmetric-to-asymmetric cell division reorientation at the critical tissue size. In tissues with high fluidity, compression gradient is dynamic and induces cell rearrangement leading to 2D in-plane morphogenesis instead of 3D deformation. Morphogenesis can be tuned by manipulating tissue fluidity, cell adhesion forces, and mechanical properties to influence the progression of compression gradient during the development of cultured cell sheets and chicken embryos. Together, the dynamics of compression gradient arising from interfacial mechanical interaction provides a conserved mechanism underlying morphogenesis initiation and size control during tissue growth.},

Here, following an analytical background introduction, a systematic review of medical gas research is presented, focusing on tissue protections, mechanisms, data tangibility, and translational challenges. The pharmacological efficacies of carbon monoxide (CO) and xenon (Xe) are further examined with emphasis on intracellular messengers associated with cytoprotection and functional improvement for the CNS, heart, retina, liver, kidneys, lungs, etc. Overall, the outcome supports the hypothesis that readily deliverable “biological gas” (CO, H 2 , H 2 S, NO, O 2 , O 3 , and N 2 O) or “noble gas” (He, Ar, and Xe) treatment may preserve cells against common pathologies by regulating oxidative, inflammatory, apoptotic, survival, and/or repair processes. Specifically, CO, in safe dosages, elicits neurorestoration via igniting sGC/cGMP/MAPK signaling and crosstalk between HO-CO, HIF-1 α /VEGF, and NOS pathways. Xe rescues neurons through NMDA antagonism and PI3K/Akt/HIF-1 α /ERK activation. Primary findings also reveal that the need to utilize cutting-edge molecular and genetic tactics to validate mechanistic targets and optimize outcome consistency remains urgent; the number of neurotherapeutic investigations is limited, without published results from large in vivo models. Lastly, the broad-spectrum, concurrent multimodal homeostatic actions of medical gases may represent a novel pharmaceutical approach to treating critical organ failure and neurotrauma.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence suggests that physiological distress is highly correlated with cancer incidence and mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying psychological challenges-mediated tumor immune evasion are not systematically explored. Here, it is demonstrated that acute restraint (AR) increases the level of the plasma neuropeptide hormones, kisspeptin, and the expression levels of its receptor, Gpr54 , in the hypothalamus, splenic and tumor-infiltrating T cells, suggesting a correlation between the neuroendocrine system and tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, administration of kisspeptin-10 significantly impairs T cell function, whereas knockout of Gpr54 in T cells inhibits lung tumor progression by suppressing T cell dysfunction and exhaustion with or without AR. In addition, Gpr54 defective OT-1 T cells show superior antitumor activity against OVA peptide-positive tumors. Mechanistically, ERK5-mediated NR4A1 activation is found to be essential for kisspeptin/GPR54-facilitated T cell dysfunction. Meanwhile, pharmacological inhibition of ERK5 signaling by XMD8-92 significantly reduces the tumor growth by enhancing CD8 + T cell antitumor function. Furthermore, depletion of GPR54 or ERK5 by CRISPR/Cas9 in CAR T cells intensifies the antitumor responses to both PSMA + and CD19 + tumor cells, while eliminating T cell exhaustion. Taken together, these results indicate that kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling plays a nonredundant role in the stress-induced tumor immune evasion.},

Here, a slippery, water-infusing surface (SWIS) that retains a thick and stable water layer on the membrane is presented, robustly maintaining the oil repellency against the pressure and friction of immiscible liquids. Inspired by the plant trichome structures and their function, grooved nanotrichome, formed on the fibrous membrane by the oxygen plasma etching, induces robust water lubrication on the SWIS. SWIS membrane repels and separates highly viscous and adhesive oils in air and underwater by preventing oils from adhering to the lubricating surface. Repeated tests both in air and underwater confirm the antiadhesion and self-cleaning properties of the SWIS. The SWIS oil scooper, fixed on a frame with a handle, successfully collects spilled oil on a pilot-scale oil spill site and a real ocean oil spill site by simply scooping and recovering the oil. In addition, SWIS membrane is expected to help protect environments with further applications such as oil-wastewater treatment and oil separation in food.},

Despite recent advances, challenges remain in finding materials that exhibit RSL on macrolength and time scales and possess vigorous electrical conduction ability. Here, the discovery of RSL is reported on hydrated NbB 2 films that exhibit vanishingly small coefficient of friction (0.001–0.006) and superlow wear rate (≈10 −17 m 3 N −1 m −1 ) on large length scales reaching millimeter range and prolonged time scales lasting through extensive loading durations. Moreover, the measured low resistivity (≈10 −6 Ω m) of the synthesized NbB 2 film indicates ample capability for electrical conduction, extending macroscale RSL to hitherto largely untapped metallic materials. Pertinent microscopic mechanisms are elucidated by deciphering the intricate load-driven chemical reactions that generate and sustain the observed superlubricating state and assessing the strong stress responses under diverse strains that produce the superior durability.},

Here, a method that enables ion migration to be studied allowing different segregation mechanisms to be elucidated is described. Statistical analysis is applied to cathodoluminescence data to generate compositional distribution histograms. Using these histograms, two different ion migration phenomena, horizontal ion migration (HIM) and vertical ion migration (VIM), are identified in different perovskite films. It is found that most passivating agents inhibit HIM, but not VIM. However, VIM can be reduced by deposition of imidazolium iodide on the perovskite surface. This method can be used to study perovskite-based devices efficiency and stability by providing molecular level mechanistic understanding of passivation approaches leading to performance improvement of perovskite solar cells via rational design.},

  abstract     = {The mechanism of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction involves the development of systemic inflammation, largely mediated by macrophages. Switching of M1-like adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) to M2-like ATMs, a population of macrophages associated with weight loss and insulin sensitivity, is considered a viable therapeutic strategy for obesity-related metabolic syndrome. However, mechanisms for reestablishing the polarization of ATMs remain elusive. This study demonstrates that CD146 + ATMs accumulate in adipose tissue during diet-induced obesity and are associated with increased body weight, systemic inflammation, and obesity-induced insulin resistance. Inactivating the macrophage CD146 gene or antibody targeting of CD146 alleviates obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Macrophage CD146 interacts with Glycoprotein 130 (Gp130), the common subunit of the receptor signaling complex for the interleukin-6 family of cytokines. CD146/Gp130 interaction promotes pro-inflammatory polarization of ATMs by activating JNK signaling and inhibiting the activation of STAT3, a transcription factor for M2-like polarization. Disruption of their interaction by anti-CD146 antibody or interleukin-6 steers ATMs toward anti-inflammatory polarization, thus attenuating obesity-induced chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in mice. The results suggest that macrophage CD146 is an important determinant of pro-inflammatory polarization and plays a pivotal role in obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction. CD146 could constitute a novel therapeutic target for obesity complications.},

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy with toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG ODN offers an emergent strategy to treat life-threatening malignant glioma. CpG is typically applied invasively by intracranial and intrathecal administration which induces not only poor compliance and lessened potency but also possibly strong adverse effects and immunotoxicity. Here, it is reported that immunotherapy of murine LCPN glioma is greatly boosted by polymersome-steered intravenous and intranasal brain delivery of CpG. CpG is efficiently loaded in apolipoprotein E peptide-directed polymersomes to give blood-brain barrier permeable and glioma and cervical lymph node-homing CpG nano-immunoadjuvant (t-NanoCpG) which strongly stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells, antigen cross-presentation, and production of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo. Intriguingly, both intravenous and intranasal administration of t-NanoCpG brings about significant survival benefits in murine LCPN glioma-bearing mice while free CpG and nontargeted CpG nano-immunoadjuvant (NanoCpG) afford modest therapeutic effects. Moreover, combination of t-NanoCpG with radiotherapy further boosts the immunotherapeutic effects leading to more improved survival rate of mice. This intelligent brain-permeable nano-immunoadjuvant provides a new, minimally invasive and highly potent strategy for immunotherapy of glioma.},

However, two crucial drawbacks, that is, lack of intrinsic multi-level operation and low on/off ratio, greatly hinder their further application for advanced computing concepts, such as deep neural network (DNN) accelerator. In this paper, a spintronic multi-level memory unit with high on/off ratio is proposed by integrating several series-connected magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and a Schottky diode in parallel. Due to the rectification effect on the PMA MTJ, an on/off ratio over 100, two orders of magnitude higher than intrinsic values, is obtained under proper proportion of alternating current and direct current. Multiple resistance states are stably achieved and can be reconfigured by spin transfer torque effect. A computing-in-memory architecture based DNN accelerator for image classification with the experimental parameters of this proposal to evidence its application potential is also evaluated. This work can satisfy the rigorous requirements of DNN for memory unit and promote the development of high-accuracy and robust artificial intelligence applications.},

Fe-MSC-NVs containing multifunctional therapeutic cytokines are encapsulated in the inner HA core of the MN tips for accelerating angiogenesis. The PDA NPs are encapsulated in the outer methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) shell of the MN tips to overcome the adverse impacts from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-derived oxidative stress. With the gradual degradation of HAMA patch tips in the skin, the PDA NPs are sustainably released at the lesion to suppress the ROS-induced inflammation reaction, while the Fe-MSC-NVs significantly increase the migration, proliferation, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). More attractively, the combination of PDA NPs and Fe-MSC-NVs further promotes M2 macrophage polarization, thereby suppressing wound inflammation. Through in vivo experiment, the Fe-MSC-NVs/PDA MN patch shows an excellent effect for diabetic wound healing.

Metal ions play many crucial roles, such as in MXene delamination, structure regulation, surface modification, MXene composite construction, and even some unique applications. The different roles of metal ions are attributed to their many interactions with MXenes and the unique nature of MXenes, including their layered structure, surface chemistry, and the existence of multi-valent transition metals. Interactions with metal ions are crucial for the energy storage of MXene electrodes, especially in metal ion batteries and supercapacitors with neutral electrolytes. This review aims to provide a good understanding of the interactions between metal ions and MXenes, including the classification and fundamental chemistry of their interactions, in order to achieve their more effective utilization and rational design. It also provides new perspectives on MXene evolution and exfoliation, which may suggest optimized synthesis strategies. In this respect, the different effects of metal ions on MXene synthesis and processing are clarified, and the corresponding mechanisms are elaborated. Research progress on the roles metal ions have in MXene applications is also introduced.},

These requirements necessitate novel concepts in adhesion engineering and material science. Considerable studies have been carried out to develop a wide range of adhesives.

Low-cost and size-tailorable carbon paper is used as the heating source during the thermal shock. It is reported that by thermal shock technique, only ≈13 s including heating and treating time is needed to fabricate the exsolution-based NDMs (the fastest method to date). Benefitted by the sufficiently provided driving force and the short treating time, as compared to the product prepared by the conventionally furnace-based method, higher particle density and smaller particle size of the exsolved catalysts are acquired for the thermal shock fabricated NDM, giving rise to a fascinating improvement (12-fold) of the electrochemical performance.

The Boudouard reaction serves for the first time to produce individual monolayer structures on the surface of a metal catalyst, thereby providing a chemical vapor deposition technique free from molecular and atomic hydrogen as well as vacuum conditions. This approach facilitates inhibition of the graphene nucleation from the CO/CO 2 mixture and maintains a high growth rate of graphene seeds reaching large-scale monocrystals. Unique features of the Boudouard reaction coupled with CO-driven catalyst engineering ensure not only suppression of the second layer growth but also provide a simple and reliable technique for surface cleaning. Aside from being a novel carbon source, carbon monoxide ensures peculiar modification of catalyst and in general opens avenues for breakthrough graphene-catalyst composite production.},

  abstract     = {While organic batteries have attracted great attention due to their high theoretical capacities, high-voltage organic active materials (&gt; 4 V vs Li/Li + ) remain unexplored. Here, density functional theory calculations are combined with cyclic voltammetry measurements to investigate the electrochemistry of croconic acid (CA) for use as a lithium-ion battery cathode material in both dimethyl sulfoxide and γ -butyrolactone (GBL) electrolytes. DFT calculations demonstrate that CA dilitium salt (CA–Li 2 ) has two enolate groups that undergo redox reactions above 4.0 V and a material-level theoretical energy density of 1949 Wh kg –1 for storing four lithium ions in GBL—exceeding the value of both conventional inorganic and known organic cathode materials. Cyclic-voltammetry measurements reveal a highly reversible redox reaction by the enolate group at ≈4 V in both electrolytes. Battery-performance tests of CA as lithium-ion battery cathode in GBL show two discharge voltage plateaus at 3.9 and 3.1 V, and a discharge capacity of 102.2 mAh g –1 with no capacity loss after five cycles. With the higher discharge voltages compared to the known, state-of-the-art organic small molecules, CA promises to be a prime cathode-material candidate for future high-energy-density lithium-ion organic batteries.},

Here, polyzwitterionic micelles of poly(tertiary amine-oxide)- block -poly( ε -caprolactone) (PTAO-PCL) amphiphiles that enable all the required functions are presented. The zwitterionic nature and unique cell membrane affinity confer the PTAO micelles long blood circulation, efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and fast cellular internalization. The mitochondrial targeting capability allows drug delivery into the mitochondria to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and overcome tumor multidrug resistance. As a result, the PTAO/drug micelles exhibit potent anticancer efficacy. This simple yet multipotent carrier system holds great promise as a generic platform for potential clinical translation.},

Herein, magic concave Pt–Zn nanocubes with high-index faceted Pt skin (Pt 78 Zn 22 ) are proposed for high-efficiency catalysis toward proton exchange membrane fuel cells. These unique structural features endow the Pt-skin Pt 78 Zn 22 /KB with a mass activity of 1.18 mA μg Pt –1 and a specific activity of 3.64 mA cm –2 for the ORR at 0.9 V (vs RHE). Meanwhile, the H 2 –O 2 fuel cell assembled by this catalyst delivers an ultrahigh peak power density of ≈1449 mW cm –2 . Both experiments and theoretical calculations show that the electronic structure of the surface is adjusted, thereby shortening the length of the Pt–Pt bond and reducing the adsorption energy of OH*/O* on the Pt surface. This work demonstrates the synergistic effect of the oxidation-resistant metal Zn and the construction of Pt-rich surface engineering.

Yet the rational molecular design for materials to possess strong absorption in solar-blind region is rarely addressed. Here, an organic solar-blind photodetector is reported by designing a novel asymmetric molecule integrated strong solar-blind absorption with high charge transport property. Such alkyl substituted [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]-benzothiophene (BTBT) derivatives C n -BTBTN ( n = 6, 8, and 10) can be easily assembled into 2D molecular crystals and perform high mobility up to 3.28 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the non-substituted core BTBTN. C n -BTBTNs also exhibit dramatically higher thermal stability than the symmetric alkyl substituted C8-BTBT. Moreover, C10-BTBTN films with the highest mobility and strongest solar-blind absorption among the C n -BTBTNs are applied for solar-blind photodetectors, which reveal record-high photosensitivity and detectivity up to 1.60 × 10 7 and 7.70 × 10 14 Jones. Photodetector arrays and flexible devices are also successfully fabricated. The design strategy can provide guidelines for developing materials featuring high thermal stability and stimulating such materials in solar-blind photodetector application.},

However, it is the diverse variables of alloys that lead to the difficulty in understanding the structure-property relationship for conventional experimental and theoretical methods. Fortunately, machine learning methods are helpful to address the issue. Machine learning can not only deal with a large number of data rapidly, but also help establish the physical picture of reactions in multidimensional heterogeneous catalysis. The key challenge in machine learning is the exploration of suitable general descriptors to accurately describe various types of alloy catalysts, which help reasonably design catalysts and efficiently screen candidates. In this review, several kinds of machine learning methods commonly used in the design of alloy catalysts is introduced, and the applications of various reactivity descriptors corresponding to different alloy systems is summarized. Importantly, this work clarifies the existing understanding of physical picture of heterogeneous catalysis, and emphasize the significance of rational selection of universal descriptors. Finally, the development of heterogeneous catalytic descriptors for machine learning are presented.},

  abstract     = {Thermally activated delayed fluorophores (TADF) with donor–acceptor (D-A) structures always face strong conjugation between donor and acceptor segments, rendering delocalized new molecular orbitals that go against blue emission. Developing TADF emitters with blue colors, high efficiencies, and long lifetimes simultaneously is therefore challenging. Here, a D-void-A structure with D and A moieties connected at the void-position where the frontier orbital from donor and acceptor cannot be distributed, resulting in nonoverlap of the orbitals is proposed. A proof-of-the-concept TADF emitter with 3,6-diphenyl-9 H -carbazole (D) connected at the 3’3-positions of 9 H -xanthen-9-one (A), the void carbon-atom with no distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of A-segment, realizes more efficient and blue-shifted emission compared with the contrast D-A isomers. The deeper HOMO-2 of A is found to participate into conjugation rather than HOMO, providing a wider-energy-gap. The corresponding blue device exhibits a y color coordinate (CIE y ) of 0.252 and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.5%. The stability of this compound is further evaluated as a sensitizer for a multiple resonance fluorophore, realizing a long lifetime of ≈650 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m −2 with a CIE y of 0.195 and a narrowband emission with a full-width-at-half-maxima of 21 nm.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as the most promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, their practical applications are seriously hindered by several inevitable drawbacks, especially the shuttle effects of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) which lead to rapid capacity decay and short cycling lifespan. This review specifically concentrates on the shuttle path of LiPSs and their interaction with the corresponding cell components along the moving way, systematically retrospect the recent advances and strategies toward polysulfides diffusion suppression. Overall, the strategies for the shuttle effect inhibition can be classified into four parts, including capturing the LiPSs in the sulfur cathode, reducing the dissolution in electrolytes, blocking the shuttle channels by functional separators, and preventing the chemical reaction between LiPSs and Li metal anode. Herein, the fundamental aspect of Li–S batteries is introduced first to give an in-deep understanding of the generation and shuttle effect of LiPSs. Then, the corresponding strategies toward LiPSs shuttle inhibition along the diffusion path are discussed step by step. Finally, general conclusions and perspectives for future research on shuttle issues and practical application of Li–S batteries are proposed.},

Herein, utilizing the orthogonal solubility and good wettability between CsPbBr 3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and OSCs, fabrication of solution-processed PQD/OSC PHJs are reported. The phototransistors based on bilayer PQD/PDVT-10 PHJs show responsivity up to 1.64 × 10 4 A W −1 , specific detectivity of 3.17 × 10 12 Jones, and photosensitivity of 5.33 × 10 6 when illuminated by 450 nm light. Such high photodetection performance is attributed to efficient charge dissociation and transport, as well as the photogating effect in the PHJs. Furthermore, the tri-layer PDVT-10/PQD/Y6 PHJs are used to construct photodiodes working in self-powered mode, which exhibit broad range photoresponse from ultraviolet to near-infrared, with responsivity approaching 10 −1 A W −1 and detectivity over 10 6 Jones.

Herein, the synthesis of a self-supported hierarchical porous electrocatalyst based on a high-entropy alloy (HEA) containing multiple transitional metals via physical metallurgy and dealloying strategies is reported. Microscale phase separation and nanoscale spinodal decomposition are modulated in a highly concentrated FeCoNiCu HEA, which makes it possible to obtain a porous structure with different length scales, i.e., relatively large porous channels formed by removing one separated phase and ultrafine mesopores obtained from leaching out one decomposition phase. The resultant hierarchical porous HEA exhibits superior water splitting performance, which takes full advantage of the enlarged surface area offered by the bi-continuous mesoporous structure with the exceptional intrinsic reactivity originating from the synergetic electronic effects of the different components in alloying. Moreover, the microscale porous structure plays an important role in the significantly improved mass transportation, as well as the durability during electrocatalysis. This effective strategy that simultaneously utilizes the chemical and microstructural advantages of HEAs opens up a new avenue for developing HEA-based, high-performance porous electrocatalysts for various energy conversion/store applications.},

Repeatability requires temporary interactions between the adhesive and the substrate, while high adhesion toughness is usually achieved by permanent bonding. Integrating these two features into one adhesive system is still a daunting challenge. Here, the development of a series of viscoelastic elastomers composed of a soft and hard segment is reported, which exhibit tough, instant, yet repeatable adhesion to a variety of soft and hard surfaces. Such a combination of mutually exclusive properties is attributed to the synergy of high mobility of polymer chains and massive viscoelastic dissipation of the elastomers around the interface. By optimizing the relaxation time and mechanical dissipation, the resulting adhesives can achieve a tough yet repeatable adhesion toughness above 2000 J m −2 , superior to the best-in-class commercial adhesives. Numerous acrylate monomers are proven applicable to the preparation of such adhesives, validating the universality of the fabrication method. The application of these elastomers as adhesive and protective layers in soft electronics by virtue of their universal and tough adhesion to various soft and hard substrates is also demonstrated.},

Although multiple approaches have been developed for osteochondral regeneration, how to balance the biochemical and physical microenvironment in OA remains a big challenge. In this study, a bioceramic scaffold by 3D printed akermanite (AKT) integrated with hair-derived antioxidative nanoparticles (HNPs)/microparticles (HMPs) for ROS scavenging and osteochondral regeneration has been developed. The prepared bioscaffold with multi-mimetic enzyme effects, which can scavenge a broad spectrum of free radicals in OA, can protect chondrocytes under the ROS microenvironment. Importantly, the bioscaffold can distinctly stimulate the proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes due to the stimulation of the glucose transporter pathway (GLUT) via HNPs/HMPs. Furthermore, it significantly accelerated osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). In vivo results showed that the bioscaffold can effectively enhance the osteochondral regeneration compared to the unmodified scaffold. The work shows that integration of antioxidant and mechanical properties via the bioscaffold is a promising strategy for osteochondral regeneration in OA treatment.},

Here, the combination of the II–VI cadmium telluride (CdTe) with the III–V InSb in the form of core–shell (InSb–CdTe) nanowires is investigated and potential applications based on the electronic structure of the InSb–CdTe interface and the epitaxy of CdTe on the InSb nanowires are explored. The electronic structure of the InSb–CdTe interface using density functional theory is determined and a type-I band alignment is extracted with a small conduction band offset ( ⩽0.3 eV). These results indicate the potential application of these shells for surface passivation or as tunnel barriers in combination with superconductors. In terms of structural quality, it is demonstrated that the lattice-matched CdTe can be grown epitaxially on the InSb nanowires without interfacial strain or defects.

Therefore, there is significant value to explore the antitumor potential of antidepressants and discover new therapeutic targets for breast patients.

After combining functional experiments with online database analysis, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (HTR1A is selected with antitumor potential in breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.

In addition, HTR1A is an independent predictive factor for breast cancer patients. The combined treatment of HTR1A agonists with demethylation drugs may significantly improve patient survival.

Nonetheless only a small number of studies to date report 2DEGs in BaSnO 3 -based heterostructures. Here, 2DEG formation at the LaScO 3 /BaSnO 3 (LSO/BSO) interface with a room-temperature mobility of 60 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at a carrier concentration of 1.7 × 10 13 cm –2 is reported. This is an order of magnitude higher mobility at room temperature than achieved in SrTiO 3 -based 2DEGs. This is achieved by combining a thick BSO buffer layer with an ex situ high-temperature treatment, which not only reduces the dislocation density but also produces a SnO 2 -terminated atomically flat surface, followed by the growth of an overlying BSO/LSO interface. Using weak beam dark-field transmission electron microscopy imaging and in-line electron holography technique, a reduction of the threading dislocation density is revealed, and direct evidence for the spatial confinement of a 2DEG at the BSO/LSO interface is provided. This work opens a new pathway to explore the exciting physics of stannate-based 2DEGs at application-relevant temperatures for oxide nanoelectronics.},

Unfortunately, the Li-deposition (growth) mechanism is poorly understood on the atomic scale. Here, machine learning is used to construct a Li potential model with quantum-mechanical computational accuracy. Molecular dynamics simulations in this study with this model reveal two self-healing mechanisms in a large Li-metal system, viz. surface self-healing, and bulk self-healing. It is concluded that self-healing occurs rapidly in nanoscale; thus, minimizing the voids between the Li grains using several comprehensive methods can effectively facilitate the formation of dendrite-free Li.},

  abstract     = {Medical therapies achieve their control at expense to the patient in the form of a range of toxicities, which incur costs and diminish quality of life. Magnetic resonance navigation is an emergent technique that enables image-guided remote-control of magnetically labeled therapies and devices in the body, using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Minimally INvasive IMage-guided Ablation (MINIMA), a novel, minimally invasive, MRI-guided ablation technique, which has the potential to avoid traditional toxicities, is presented. It comprises a thermoseed navigated to a target site using magnetic propulsion gradients generated by an MRI scanner, before inducing localized cell death using an MR-compatible thermoablative device. The authors demonstrate precise thermoseed imaging and navigation through brain tissue using an MRI system (0.3 mm), and they perform thermoablation in vitro and in vivo within subcutaneous tumors, with the focal ablation volume finely controlled by heating duration. MINIMA is a novel theranostic platform, combining imaging, navigation, and heating to deliver diagnosis and therapy in a single device.},

  abstract     = {While matrix stiffness regulates cell behavior on 2D substrates, recent studies using synthetic hydrogels have suggested that in 3D environments, cell behavior is primarily impacted by matrix degradability, independent of stiffness. However, these studies did not consider the potential impact of other confounding matrix parameters that typically covary with changes in stiffness, particularly, hydrogel swelling and hydrolytic stability, which may explain the previously observed distinctions in cell response in 2D versus 3D settings. To investigate how cells sense matrix stiffness in 3D environments, a nonswelling, hydrolytically stable, linearly elastic synthetic hydrogel model is developed in which matrix stiffness and degradability can be tuned independently. It is found that matrix degradability regulates cell spreading kinetics, while matrix stiffness dictates the final spread area once cells achieve equilibrium spreading. Importantly, the differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells toward adipocytes or osteoblasts is regulated by the spread state of progenitor cells upon initiating differentiation. These studies uncover matrix stiffness as a major regulator of cell function not just in 2D, but also in 3D environments, and identify matrix degradability as a critical microenvironmental feature in 3D that in conjunction with matrix stiffness dictates cell spreading, cytoskeletal state, and stem cell differentiation outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Fusobacterium nucleatum is a critical microbe that contributes to colorectal cancer progression and chemoresistance. However, whether and how F. nucleatum regulates colorectal cancer stem-like cells (CCSCs) remains unknown. Here, the authors show that F. nucleatum promotes CCSC self-renewal, and non-CCSCs to acquire CCSC features by manipulating cellular lipid accumulation. F. nucleatum infection decreases lipid accumulation in CCSCs by enhancing fatty acid oxidation, thus promoting CCSC self-renewal. In contrast, F. nucleatum increases lipid accumulation in non-CCSCs by promoting fatty acid formation. Lipids are deposited as lipid droplets, which recruits Numb, a key cell fate regulator, through the AP2A/ACSL3 complex, and MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, though VCP and UBXD8. On lipid droplets, Numb is degraded by MDM2, activating Notch signaling, thus promoting gain of stem-like cell features. Their findings demonstrate that F. nucleatum directly manipulates colorectal cancer cell fate and reveal the mechanism of lipid droplet-mediated Numb degradation for activating Notch signaling.},

The temperature difference (Δ T ) between the body and the environment is a stable source driving the WTEG, but this driving force is limited by the ambient temperature itself at the same time. Here, a novel WTEG that can be operated using the dual source of body heat and light with exceptionally high driving force is fabricated. The printable solar absorbing layer attached to the bottom of the WTEG absorbs ≈95% of the light from ultraviolet to far infrared and converts it into heat. To optimize the power density of WTEGs, the fill factor of the thermoelectric (TE) leg/electrode is considered through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. When operated by the dual sources, the WTEG exhibits a power density of 15.33 µW cm −2 , which is the highest under “actual operating conditions” among all kinds of WTEGs. In addition, unlike conventional WTEGs, the WTEG retains 83.1% of its output power at an ambient temperature of 35 °C compared to its output power at room temperature. This study will accelerate the commercialization of WTEGs by introducing a novel method to overcome their limitations.},

Here, novel arrowhead composite microneedle patches (MNPs) are presented with anisotropic surface adhesion and growth factor encapsulation using a heterogeneous template replication approach for endometrium repair and intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) prevention. The arrowhead structures bring about interlocking between the microneedle (MN) tips and tissues, allowing these MNPs to steadily adhere to the tissues. Besides, benefitting from the cytoadhesive needle-tip material and the antiadhesive base material, these MNPs possess anisotropic surface adhesion and can facilitate cell adhesion on one surface to repair damaged tissues while restrain tissue contact on the other to prevent adverse adhesion. In the meanwhile, the encapsulated growth factor can be delivered through the MNs to the deep tissue, further accelerating tissue repair. Additionally, as the bases are soft and their patterns are highly tunable, the MNPs can change their shapes flexibly to adjust to the irregular morphology of uteri. It is demonstrated that these MNPs show good performances in treating injured endometrium and preventing IUAs of a rat model, indicating their great potential in versatile postoperative adhesion prevention and other clinical applications.},

This native layer with Mo 6+ suppresses the hydrogen evolution significantly and promotes the activation of nitrogen as supported by both experimental characterization and theoretical calculation. The as-prepared MoO 2+ x catalyst shows a high ammonia yield of 3.95 µg mg cat −1 h −1 with a high Faradaic efficiency of 22.1% at −0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is much better than the MoO 2 catalyst with Mo 6+ etched away.

In this work, a titanium-doped zinc–cobalt sulfide hollow superstructure (Ti–ZnCoS HSS) is rationally designed as an efficient electrocatalyst for H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis. Synthesized by using hybrid metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors after sulfidation treatment, the resultant Ti–ZnCoS HSS exhibits a hollow-on-hollow superstructure with small nanocages assembled around a large cake-like cavity. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the polymetallic composition tailors the d-band center and binding energy with oxygen species. Moreover, the hollow superstructure provides abundant active sites and promotes mass and electron transfer. The synergistic d-band center and superstructure engineering at both atomic and nanoscale levels lead to the remarkable 2e-ORR performance of Ti–ZnCoS HSS with a high selectivity of 98%, activity (potential at 1 mA cm −2 of 0.774 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), a H 2 O 2 production rate of 675 mmol h –1 g cat –1 , and long-term stability in alkaline condition, among the best 2e-ORR electrocatalysts reported to date.

However, current contact lens sensors often require complex electronics, which may obstruct the user&#39;s vision or even damage the cornea. Moreover, most of the reported contact lens sensors can only detect one analyte. Therefore, an optical-based dual-functional smart contact lens sensor has been introduced to monitor intraocular pressure (IOP) and detect matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), both of which are key biomarkers in many eye-related diseases such as glaucoma. Specifically, the elevated IOP is continuously monitored by applying an antiopal structure through color changes, without any complex electronics. Together with the peptide modified gold nanobowls (AuNBs) surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate, the quantitative analysis of MMP-9 at a low nanomolar range is achieved in real tear samples. The dual-sensing functions are thus demonstrated, providing a convenient, noninvasive, and potentially multifunctional sensing platform for monitoring health and diagnostic biomarkers in human tears.},

The design and manufacturing of devices for low power/low noise neural recording and safe and energy-efficient stimulation that are, at the same time, conformable to the brain, with matched mechanical properties and biocompatibility, is a convergence area of research where neuroscientists, materials scientists, and nanotechnologists operate synergically. The biotic–abiotic neural interface, however, remains a formidable challenge that prompts for new materials platforms and innovation in device layouts. Conductive polymers (CP) are attractive materials to be interfaced with the neural tissue and to be used as sensing/stimulating electrodes because of their mixed ionic-electronic conductivity, their low contact impedance, high charge storage capacitance, chemical versatility, and biocompatibility. This manuscript reviews the state-of-the-art of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-based neural interfaces for extracellular recording and stimulation, focusing on those technological approaches that are successfully demonstrated in vivo.

To further expand the scope of the US-controlled drug activation strategy, herein a mechano-responsive nanoswitch for the selective activation of doxorubicin (DOX) to inhibit cancer cell proliferation is constructed.

Blood Aβ can become a reliable surrogate biomarker if issues of low concentration for conventional laboratory instruments and uncertain correlation with brain Aβ are solved. Here, brain-to-blood efflux of Aβ is stimulated in AD transgenic mice by orally administrating a chemical that dissociates amyloid plaques and observing the subsequent increase of blood Aβ concentration. 5XFAD transgenic and wild-type mice of varying ages and genders are prepared, and blood samples of each mouse are collected six times for 12 weeks; three weeks of no treatment and additional nine weeks of daily oral administration, ad libitum, of Aβ plaque-dissociating chemical agent. By the dissociation of Aβ aggregates, the altered levels of plasma Aβ distinguish between transgenic and wild-type mice, displaying potential as an amyloid burden marker of AD brains.},

The first aim of this study is to identify the subtypes of MCI by employing a regional radiomics similarity network (R2SN). The second aim is to characterize the abnormality patterns associated with the clinical manifestations of each subtype. An individual-level R2SN is constructed for N = 605 normal controls (NCs), N = 766 MCI patients, and N = 283 Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) patients. MCI patients’ R2SN profiles are clustered into two subtypes using nonnegative matrix factorization. The patterns of brain alterations, gene expression, and the risk of cognitive decline in each subtype are evaluated. MCI patients are clustered into “similar to the pattern of NCs” (N-CI, N = 252) and “similar to the pattern of AD” (A-CI, N = 514) subgroups. Significant differences are observed between the subtypes with respect to the following: 1) clinical measures; 2) multimodal neuroimaging; 3) the proportion of progression to dementia (61.54% for A-CI and 21.77% for N-CI) within three years; 4) enriched genes for potassium-ion transport and synaptic transmission. Stratification into the two subtypes provides new insight for risk assessment and precise early intervention for MCI patients.},

  abstract     = {Metasurfaces have appeared as a versatile platform for miniaturized functional nonlinear optics due to their design freedom in tailoring wavefronts. The key factor that limits its application in functional devices is the low conversion efficiency. Recently, dielectric metasurfaces governed by either high-quality factor modes (quasi-bound states in the continuum) or Mie modes, enabling strong light–matter interaction, have become a prolific route to achieve high nonlinear efficiency. Here, an effective way of spatial nonlinear phase control by using the Pancharatnam–Berry phase principle with a high third harmonic conversion efficiency of 10 −4 W −2 is demonstrated both numerically and experimentally. It is found that the magnetic Mie resonance appears to be the main contributor to the third harmonic response, while the contribution from the quasi-bound states in the continuum is negligible. This is confirmed by a phenomenological model based on coupled anharmonic oscillators. Besides, the metasurface provides experimentally a high diffraction efficiency (80%–90%) in both polarization channels. A functional application of this approach is shown by experimentally reconstructing an encoded polarization-multiplexed vortex beam array with different topological charges at the third harmonic frequency with high fidelity. The approach has the potential viability for future on-chip nonlinear signal processing and wavefront control.},

However, the alkali lithium with high reducibility can react with the solid-state electrolytes resulting in the inferior cycle lifespan. Herein, inspired by the idea of interface design, the 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide as an initiator to generate an artificial protective layer in polymer electrolyte is selected. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is in situ formed between the electrolyte/Li interface. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images demonstrate that the constructed SEI can promote homogeneous Li deposition. As a result, the Li/Li symmetrical cells enable stable cycle ultralong-term for over 4500 h. Moreover, the as-prepared LiFePO 4 /Li SLMBs exhibit an impressive ultra-long cycle lifespan over 1300 cycles at 1 C, as well as 1600 cycles at 0.5 C with a capacity retention ratio over 80%.

  abstract     = {Optogenetics has become a widely used technique in neuroscience research, capable of controlling neuronal activity with high spatiotemporal precision and cell-type specificity. Expressing exogenous opsins in the selected cells can induce neuronal activation upon light irradiation, and the activation depends on the power of incident light. However, high optical power can also lead to off-target neuronal activation or even cell damage. Limiting the incident power, but enhancing power distribution to the targeted neurons, can improve optogenetic efficiency and reduce off-target effects. Here, the use of optical lenses made of polystyrene microspheres is demonstrated to achieve effective focusing of the incident light of relatively low power to neighboring neurons via photonic jets. The presence of microspheres significantly localizes and enhances the power density to the target neurons both in vitro and ex vivo, resulting in increased inward current and evoked action potentials. In vivo results show optogenetic stimulation with microspheres that can evoke significantly more motor behavior and neuronal activation at lowered power density. In all, a proof-of-concept of a strategy is demonstrated to increase the efficacy of optogenetic neuromodulation using pulses of reduced optical power.},

Here, poly( N -vinylcaprolactam) μgels that resist mechanical disruption through supramolecular hydrogen bonds provided by (+)-catechin hydrate (+C) are synthesized. When +C is added to the microgel structure, an increased resistance against shear force exerted by ultrasonication is observed compared to μgels crosslinked by covalent bonds. While covalently crosslinked μgels degrade already after a few seconds, it is found that μgels having both supramolecular interchain interactions and covalent crosslinks show the highest mechanical durability. By the incorporation of optical force probes, it is found that the covalent bonds of the μgels are not stressed beyond their scission threshold and mechanical energy is dissipated by the force-induced reversible dissociation of the sacrificial +C bonds for at least 20 min of ultrasonication. Additionally, +C renders the μgels pH-sensitive and introduces multiresponsivity. The μgels are extensively characterized using Fourier-transform infrared, Raman and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. These results may serve as blueprint for the preparation of many mechanically durable μgels.},

There is a strong need to improve the quality and efficiency of integrated circuit inspection, but it remains a great challenge to provide both rapid imaging and circuit node-level high-resolution images simultaneously using a conventional microscope. This paper proposes a nondestructive, high-throughput, multiscale correlation imaging method that combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) with microlens-based scanning optical microscopy. In this method, a microlens is coupled to the end of the AFM cantilever and the sample-facing side of the microlens contains a focused ion beam deposited tip which serves as the AFM scanning probe. The introduction of a microlens improves the imaging resolution of the AFM optical system, providing a 3–4× increase in optical imaging magnification while the scanning imaging throughput is improved ≈8×. The proposed method bridges the resolution gap between traditional optical imaging and AFM, achieves cross-scale rapid imaging with micrometer to nanometer resolution, and improves the efficiency of AFM-based large-scale imaging and detection. Simultaneously, nanoscale-level correlation between the acquired optical image and structure information is enabled by the method, providing a powerful tool for semiconductor device inspection.},

To address these clinical issues, the emerged nerve guide conduits (NGCs) are expected to offer effective platforms to repair peripheral nerve defects, especially those with large or complex topological structures. Up to now, numerous technologies are developed for preparing diverse NGCs, such as solvent casting, gas foaming, phase separation, freeze-drying, melt molding, electrospinning, and three-dimensional (3D) printing. 3D printing shows great potential and advantages because it can quickly and accurately manufacture the required NGCs from various natural and synthetic materials.

Thus, identifying the driving force behind the obesity-breast cancer relationship is an urgent need. Here it is identified that diet-induced obesity (DIO) facilitates tumorigenesis of TNBC cells. Mechanistically, DIO induces a metabolic addiction to fatty acid oxidation (FAO), accompanied by coordinated activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling. Specifically, YAP governs mitochondrial redox homeostasis via transcriptional regulation of antioxidant-related enzymes, which renders tumor cells capable of extenuating FAO-elicited mitochondrial oxidative stress. Moreover, adipocytes-derived fatty acids are identified to be responsible for enhancing the FAO-YAP axis and antioxidative capacity, and higher expression of an obesity signature in breast cancer patients is positively correlated with YAP signaling and antioxidant genes. The findings uncover the crucial role of YAP in dictating mitochondrial redox homeostasis for obesity-mediated metabolic adaptation and breast tumor progression.},

Targeted regulation of the degree of inflammation has been a potential strategy for AKI management. Macrophages are the main effector cells of kidney inflammation. However, macrophage heterogeneity in ischemia reperfusion injury induced AKI (IRI-AKI) remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of the mononuclear phagocytic system in the murine IRI model, the authors demonstrate the complementary roles of kidney resident macrophages (KRMs) and monocyte-derived infiltrated macrophages (IMs) in modulating tissue inflammation and promoting tissue repair. A unique population of S100a9 hi Ly6c hi IMs is identified as an early responder to AKI, mediating the initiation and amplification of kidney inflammation. Kidney infiltration of S100A8/A9 + macrophages and the relevance of renal S100A8/A9 to tissue injury is confirmed in human AKI. Targeting the S100a8/a9 signaling with small-molecule inhibitors exhibits renal protective effects represented by improved renal function and reduced mortality in bilateral IRI model, and decreased inflammatory response, ameliorated kidney injury, and improved long-term outcome with decreased renal fibrosis in the unilateral IRI model. The findings support S100A8/A9 blockade as a feasible and clinically relevant therapy potentially waiting for translation in human AKI.},

  abstract     = {Atovaquone, an FDA-approved drug for malaria, is known to inhibit mitochondrial electron transport. A recently synthesized mitochondria-targeted atovaquone increased mitochondrial accumulation and antitumor activity in vitro. Using an in situ vaccination approach, local injection of mitochondria-targeted atovaquone into primary tumors triggered potent T cell immune responses locally and in distant tumor sites. Mitochondria-targeted atovaquone treatment led to significant reductions of both granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Mitochondria-targeted atovaquone treatment blocks the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, which may lead to death of granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. Mitochondria-targeted atovaquone inhibits expression of genes for mitochondrial complex components, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis in both granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. The resulting decreases in intratumoral granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells could facilitate the observed increase in tumor-infiltrating CD4 + T cells. Mitochondria-targeted atovaquone also improves the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. The results implicate granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells as novel targets of mitochondria-targeted atovaquone that facilitate its antitumor efficacy.},

However, the relatively low device efficiency hinders its further development. Herein, highly efficient and stable CsPb 0.7 Sn 0.3 IBr 2 compositional perovskite-based inorganic PSCs are fabricated by introducing appropriate amount of multifunctional zinc oxalate (ZnOX). In addition to offset Pb and Sn vacancies through Zn 2+ ions incorporation, the oxalate group can strongly interact with undercoordinated metal ions to regulate film crystallization, delivering perovskite film with low defect density, high crystallinity, and superior electronic properties. Correspondingly, the resulting device delivers a champion efficiency of 14.1%, which presents the highest reported efficiency for bromine-rich inorganic PSCs thus far. More importantly, chemically reducing oxalate group can effectively suppress the notorious oxidation of Sn 2+ , leading to significant enhancement on air stability.},

However, the therapeutic effects of PDA nanoparticles are generally limited by the low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, PDA@Ag nanoparticles are synthesized via growing Ag on the surface of PDA nanoparticles and then encapsulated into a cationic guar gum (CG) hydrogel network. The optimized CG/PDA@Ag platform exhibits a high PCE (38.2%), which is more than two times higher than that of pure PDA (16.6%). More importantly, the formulated CG/PDA@Ag hydrogel with many active groups can capture and kill bacteria through effective interactions between hydrogel and bacteria, thereby benefiting the antibacterial effect. As anticipated, the designed CG/PDA@Ag system combined the advantages of PDA@Ag nanoparticles (high PCE) and hydrogel (preventing aggregation of PDA@Ag nanoparticles and possessing inherent antibacterial ability) is demonstrated to have superior antibacterial efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This study develops a facile approach to boost the PCE of PDA for photothermal antibacterial therapy, providing a significant step forward in advancing the application of PDA nano-photothermal agents.},

By cascading the power amplifier between patches placed on two sides of the metasurface, the metasurface can transmit the spatial EM waves in the forward direction while blocking it in the backward direction. Two status of power amplifier biased at the standard working voltage and zero voltage are represented as codes “1” and “0,” respectively. By periodically setting adequate code sequences and proportions in the temporal dimension, according to the space-time coding strategy, the amplitudes and phases of the harmonic transmission coefficients can be adjusted in a programmable way. A metasurface prototype is fabricated and measured in the microwave frequency to validate the concept and feasibility. The experimental results show good agreement with the theoretical predictions and numerical simulations.

Herein, a flexible free-standing bifunctional electrode (N 2 -NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60) is constructed by the 3D spatial combination of CN vacancy-mediated NiFe Prussian Blue Analogue (NiFe-PBA) and N-doped carbon nanofibers (NCF) rooted on carbon cloth (CC). The in situ formed CN vacancies by N 2 -plasma activation tune the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Ni-Fe active sites in NiFe-PBA, thus improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic intrinsic activity, and restraining the loss of Fe element during OER process. The combination of NiFe-PBA and NCF presents a 3D interworking network structure, which exhibits a large specific surface and excellent electrical conductivity, thus guaranteeing sufficient, stable, and efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/OER active sites. Therefore, the N 2 -NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60 electrode delivers high-efficiency OER activity with a low overpotential (270 mV at 50 mA cm −2 ) and excellent ORR performance with a positive potential of 0.89 V at 5 mA cm −2 . The N 2 -NiFe-PBA/NCF/CC-60 based Zn–air batteries display outstanding discharge/charge stability for 2000 cycles. Meanwhile, the corresponding flexible Zn–air batteries with satisfactory mechanical properties exhibit a low voltage gap of 0.52 V at 1.0 mA cm −2 .},

  abstract     = {Monitoring structural health using mechanoluminescent (ML) effects is widely considered as a potential full-field and direct visualizing optical method with high spatial and temporal resolution and simple setup in a noncontact manner. The challenges and uncertainties in the mapping of ML field to effective strain field, however, tend to limit significant commercial ML applications for structural health monitoring systems. Here, however, quantification problems are resolved using the digital image correlation (DIC) method. Specifically, an image containing mechanically induced photon information is processed using a DIC algorithm to measure the strain field components, which enables the establishment of a calibration curve when the ML field is mapped onto the effective strain field using pixel level information. The results show a linear relationship between effective strain and ML intensity despite the plastic flow in ML skin. Furthermore, the calibration curve allows for easy conversion of ML field to effective-strain field at the crack-tip plastic zone of the alloy structure, retaining its spatial resolution. The compatibility of ML skin with the DIC algorithm not only enables the quantification of the ML effects of several organic/inorganic ML materials, but may also be useful in elucidating the fundamentals of the trap-controlled mechanism.},

The flow intensity of the pumped air is controlled by the pore structure of nanofilbrillated cellulose, urea-modified chitosan, or polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ) aerogels. The MnO 2 -induced photothermal conversion drives both the passive gas flow and the catalytic degradation of volatile organic pollutants.

  abstract     = {New materials are the backbone of their technology-driven modern civilization and at present carbon nanostructures are the leading candidates that have attracted huge research activities. Diamanes and diamanoids are the new nanoallotropes of sp 3 hybridized carbon which can be fabricated by proper functionalization, substitution, and via Birch reduction under controlled pressure using graphitic system as a precursor. These nanoallotropes exhibit outstanding electrical, thermal, optical, vibrational, and mechanical properties, which can be an asset for new technologies, especially for quantum devices, photonics, and space technologies. Moreover, the features like wide bandgap, tunable thermal conductivity, excellent thermal insulation, etc. make diamanes and diamanoids ideal candidates for nano-electrical devices, nano-resonators, optical waveguides, and the next generation thermal management systems. In this review, diamanes and diamanoids are discussed in detail in terms of its historical prospect, method of synthesis, structural features, broad properties, and cutting-edge applications. Additionally, the prospects of diamanes and diamanoids for new applications are carefully discussed. This review aims to provide a critical update with important ideas for a new generation of quantum devices based on diamanes and diamanoids which are going to be an important topic in the future of carbon nanotechnology.},

  abstract     = {Exogenous stimulation catalytic therapy has received enormous attention as it holds great promise to address global medical issues. However, the therapeutic effect of catalytic therapy is seriously restricted by the fast charge recombination and the limited utilization of exogenous stimulation by catalysts. In the past few decades, many strategies have been developed to overcome the above serious drawbacks, among which heterojunctions are the most widely used and promising strategy. This review attempts to summarize the recent progress in the rational design and fabrication of heterojunction nanomedicine, such as semiconductor–semiconductor heterojunctions (including type I, type II, type III, P  N, and Z–scheme junctions) and semiconductor–metal heterojunctions (including Schottky, Ohmic, and localized surface plasmon resonance–mediated junctions). The catalytic mechanisms and properties of the above junction systems are also discussed in relation to biomedical applications, especially cancer treatment and sterilization. This review concludes with a summary of the challenges and some perspectives on future directions in this exciting and still evolving field of research.},

SnO 2 electron transport layers (ETL) typically undergo significant cracking during the bending process of FPSCs, which can significantly compromise their charge transport properties. Herein, the semi-planar non-fullerene acceptor molecule Y6 (BT-core-based fused-unit dithienothiophen [3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole derivative) is introduced as the buffer layer for SnO 2 -based FPSCs. It is found that the Y6 buffer layer can enhance the ability of charge extraction and bending stability for SnO 2 ETL. Moreover, the internal stress of perovskite films is also reduced. As a result, SnO 2 /Y6-based FPSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.09% and retained over 80% of their initial efficiency after 1000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 8 mm, while SnO 2 -based devices only retain 60% of their initial PCE (18.60%) upon the same bending cycles. In addition, the interfacial charge extraction is also effectively improved in conjunction with reduced defect density upon incorporation of Y6 on the SnO 2 ETL, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption (Fs-TA) measurements.},

  abstract     = {Due to their light-weight and cost-effectiveness, cellular thermoplastic foams are considered as important engineering materials. On the other hand, additive manufacturing or 3D printing is one of the emerging and fastest growing manufacturing technologies due to its advantages such as design freedom and tool-less production. Nowadays, 3D printing of polymer compounds is mostly limited to manufacturing of solid parts. In this context, a merged foaming and printing technology can introduce a great alternative for the currently used foam manufacturing technologies such as foam injection molding. This perspective review article tackles the attempts taken toward initiating this novel technology to simultaneously foam and print thermoplastics. After explaining the basics of polymer foaming and additive manufacturing, this article classifies different attempts that have been made toward generating foamed printed structures while highlighting their challenges. These attempts are clustered into 1) architected porous structures, 2) syntactic foaming, 3) post-foaming of printed parts, and eventually 4) printing of blowing agents saturated filaments. Among these, the latest approach is the most practical route although it has not been thoroughly studied yet. A filament free approach that can be introduced as a potential strategy to unlock the difficulties to produce printed foam structures is also proposed.},

Throughout the in vitro cultivation stage, the system&#39;s components have a synergistic effect, providing appropriate cues for SC neurogenesis. While the initial biomaterial supported efficient cell differentiation in 3D, the cells remodeled it to provide an inductive microenvironment for the assembly of functional SC implants. The engineered tissues are characterized for morphology and function, and their therapeutic potential is investigated, revealing improved structural and functional outcomes after acute and chronic SC injuries.

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly emerges in an immunologically “cold” state, thereafter protects it away from cytolytic attack by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in poor response to immunotherapy. Herein, an acidic/photo-sensitive dendritic cell (DCs)-based neoantigen nano-vaccine has been explored to convert tumor immune “cold” state into “hot”, and remodel tumor-associated neutrophils to potentiate anticancer immune response for enhancing immunotherapy efficiency. The nano-vaccine is constructed by SiPCCl 2 -hybridized mesoporous silica with coordination of Fe(III)-captopril, and coating with exfoliated membrane of matured DCs by H22-specific neoantigen stimulation. The nano-vaccines actively target H22 tumors and induce immunological cell death to boost tumor-associated antigen release by the generation of excess 1 O 2 through photodynamic therapy, which act as in situ tumor vaccination to strengthen antitumor T-cell response against primary H22 tumor growth. Interestingly, the nano-vaccines are also home to lymph nodes to directly induce the activation and proliferation of neoantigen-specific T cells to suppress the primary/distal tumor growth. Moreover, the acidic-triggered captopril release in tumor microenvironment can polarize the protumoral N2 phenotype neutrophils to antitumor N1 phenotype for improving the immune effects to achieve complete tumor regression (83%) in H22-bearing mice and prolong the survival time. This work provides an alternative approach for developing novel HCC immunotherapy strategies.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient and stable water adsorbents for adsorption-driven heat transfer technology still remains a challenge due to the lack of efficient strategies to enhance low-pressure water uptakes. The authors herein demonstrate that the immobilization of Lewis basic nitrogen sites into metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can improve water uptake and target benchmark coefficient of performances (COPs) for cooling and heating. They present the water sorption properties of a chemically stable MOF (termed as Zr-adip), designed by incorporating hydrophilic nitrogen sites into the adsorbent MIP-200. Zr-adip exhibits S-shaped sorption isotherms with an extremely high water uptake of 0.43 g g −1 at 303 K and P / P 0 = 0.25, higher than MIP-200 (0.39 g g −1 ), KMF-1 (0.39 g g −1 ) and MOF-303 (0.38 g g −1 ). Theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporated N sites can serve as secondary adsorption sites to moderately interact with water, providing more binding sites to strengthen the water binding affinity. Zr-adip achieves exceptionally high COPs of 0.79 (cooling) and 1.75 (heating) with a low driving temperature of 70 °C, outperforming MIP-200 (0.78 and 1.53) and KMF-1 (0.75 and 1.74). Combined with its ultrahigh stability, excellent cycling performance, and easy regeneration, Zr-adip represents one of the best water adsorbents for adsorption-driven cooling and heating.},

Their practical applications, however, are hindered by several intrinsic problems, such as the sluggish kinetic, shuttle effect, and the incomplete conversion of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Here a sulfur host material that is based on tungsten nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene is reported. The incorporation of tungsten nanoparticles significantly accelerates the polysulfides conversion (especially the reduction of Na 2 S 4 to Na 2 S, which contributes to 75% of the full capacity) and completely suppresses the shuttle effect, en route to a fully reversible reaction of NaPSs. With a host weight ratio of only 9.1% (about 3–6 times lower than that in recent reports), the cathode shows unprecedented electrochemical performances even at high sulfur mass loadings. The experimental findings, which are corroborated by the first-principles calculations, highlight the so far unexplored role of tungsten nanoparticles in sulfur hosts, thus pointing to a viable route toward stable Na–S batteries at room temperatures.},

While real-time strain assessment of implants is crucial for the postsurgery study of fracture union and failure of prostheses, integrating precise and durable sensors on orthopedic implants remains a great challenge. Herein, a laser direct-write technique is presented to pattern conductive features (minimum sheet resistance &lt;1.7 Ω sq –1 ) on CRF-PEEK-based parts, which can act as strain sensors. The as-fabricated sensors exhibit excellent linearity ( R 2 = 0.997) over the working range (0–2.5% strain). While rigid silicon- or metal-based sensor chips have to be packaged onto flat surfaces, all-carbon-based sensors can be written on the complex curved surfaces of CFR-PEEK joints using a portable laser mounted on a six-axis robotic manipulator. A wireless transmission prototype is also demonstrated using a Bluetooth module.

CrOCl possesses strong magnetic anisotropy at 2D limit, and is an ideal antiferromagnet for constructing FM/AFM heterostructures to explore the exchange bias effect. Here, the exchange bias effect in Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT)/CrOCl heterostructures through both anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) measurements is studied. In the AHE measurements, the exchange bias field ( H EB ) at 3 K exhibits a distinct increase from ≈150 Oe to ≈450 Oe after air exposure, and such variation is attributed to the formation of an oxidized layer in FGT by analyzing the cross-sectional microstructure. The H EB is successfully tuned by changing the FGT/CrOCl thickness and the cooling field. Furthermore, a larger H EB of ≈750 Oe at 1.7 K in FGT/CrOCl heterostructure through RMCD measurements is observed, and it is proposed that the larger H EB in RMCD measurements is related to the distribution of uncompensated spins at the interface.

  abstract     = {The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) strain is a variant of concern (VOC) that has become the dominant strain worldwide in 2021. Its transmission capacity is approximately twice that of the original strain, with a shorter incubation period and higher viral load during infection. Importantly, the breakthrough infections of the Delta variant have continued to emerge in the first-generation vaccine recipients. There is thus an urgent need to develop a novel vaccine with SARS-CoV-2 variants as the major target. Here, receptor binding domain (RBD)-conjugated nanoparticle vaccines targeting the Delta variant, as well as the early and Beta/Gamma strains, are developed. Under both a single-dose and a prime-boost strategy, these RBD-conjugated nanoparticle vaccines induce the abundant neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and significantly protect hACE2 mice from infection by the authentic SARS-CoV-2 Delta strain, as well as the early and Beta strains. Furthermore, the elicitation of the robust production of broader cross-protective NAbs against almost all the notable SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Omicron variant in rhesus macaques by the third re-boost with trivalent vaccines is found. These results suggest that RBD-based monovalent or multivalent nanoparticle vaccines provide a promising second-generation vaccine strategy for SARS-CoV-2 variants.},

  abstract     = {The development of low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte is still challenging. Herein, interfacial Co/CoMoN heterostructures supported on Ni foam (Co/CoMoN/NF) are constructed by thermal ammonolysis of CoMoO x . In 1.0 m KOH solution, Co/CoMoN/NF heterostructures exhibit excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 173 mV at 100 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec −1 . Density functional theory calculations indicate that the low valence state Co site acts as efficient water-dissociation promoter, while CoMoN substrate has favorable hydrogen adsorption energy, leading to an enhanced HER activity. The Co/CoMoN/NF heterostructures also achieve high OER activity with an overpotential of 303 mV at 100 mA cm −2 and a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec −1 . Using Co/CoMoN/NF heterostructures as the cathode and anode, the alkaline electrolyzer requires a low voltage of 1.56 V to reach the current density of 100 mA cm −2 along with superior long-term durability. This study provides a new design strategy toward low-cost and excellent catalysts for water splitting.},

  abstract     = {The ability to control interfacial tension electrochemically is uniquely available for liquid metals (LMs), in particular gallium-based LM alloys. This imparts them with excellent locomotion and deformation capabilities and enables diverse applications. However, electrochemical oxidation of LM is a highly dynamic process, which often induces Marangoni instabilities that make it almost impossible to elongate LM and manipulate its morphology directly and precisely on a 2D plane without the assistance of other patterning methods. To overcome these limitations, this study investigates the use of an LM–iron (Fe) particle mixture that is capable of suppressing instabilities during the electrochemical oxidation process, thereby allowing for superelongation of the LM core of the mixture to form a thin wire that is tens of times of its original length. More importantly, the elongated LM core can be manipulated freely on a 2D plane to form complex patterns. Eliminating Marangoni instabilities also allows for the effective spreading and filling of the LM–Fe mixture into molds with complex structures and small features. Harnessing these excellent abilities, a channel-less patterning method for fabricating elastomeric wearable sensors is demonstrated to detect motions. This study shows the potential for developing functional and flexible structures of LM with superior performance.},

Inspired by the homodimerize structure of antibody, the homodimerization contributes hugely to generating the optimized affinity is conjectured. Herein, a statistical-mechanics-theory-guided method is established to quantize the affinity of ligands with different topologies through analyzing the change of enthalpy and the loss of translational and rotational entropies. A peptide modulator for p53-MDM2 termed CPAP is used to homodimerize connecting, and this simple homodimerization can significantly increase the affinity. To realize the cellular internalization and tumor accumulation, Dimer CPAP and Mono CPAP are nanoengineered into gold(I)-CPAP supermolecule by the aurophilic interaction-driven self-assembly. Nano- Dimer CPAP potently suppressed tumor growth in lung cancer allograft model and a patient-derived xenograft model in more action than Nano- Mono CPAP, while keeping a favorable drug safety profile. This work not only presents a physico-mechanical method for calculating the affinity of PPI modulators, but also provides a simple yet robust homodimerization strategy to optimize the affinity of PPI modulators.},

  abstract     = {The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN- γ ) is a master regulator of innate and adaptive immunity involved in a broad array of human diseases that range from atherosclerosis to cancer. IFN- γ exerts it signaling action by binding to a specific cell surface receptor, the IFN- γ receptor (IFN- γ R), whose activation critically depends on its partition into lipid nanodomains. However, little is known about the impact of specific lipids on IFN- γ R signal transduction activity. Here, a new conserved cholesterol (chol) binding motif localized within its single transmembrane domain is identified. Through direct binding, chol drives the partition of IFN- γ R2 chains into plasma membrane lipid nanodomains, orchestrating IFN- γ R oligomerization and transmembrane signaling. Bioinformatics studies show that the signature sequence stands for a conserved chol-binding motif presented in many mammalian membrane proteins. The discovery of chol as the molecular switch governing IFN- γ R transmembrane signaling represents a significant advance for understanding the mechanism of lipid selectivity by membrane proteins, but also for figuring out the role of lipids in modulating cell surface receptor function. Finally, this study suggests that inhibition of the chol-IFN γ R2 interaction may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for various IFN- γ -dependent diseases.},

Species of glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae), representatives of the first metazoans, with a broad diversity of skeletal structures with hierarchical architecture unchanged since the late Precambrian, are studied. By etching their skeletons, organic templates dominated by individual F-actin filaments, including branched fibers and the longest, thickest actin fiber bundles ever reported, are isolated.

Herein, a facile and universal strategy to prepare metal–phenolic-network (MPN)-coated AIE dots in a high encapsulation efficiency is reported. Through precise control on the nucleation of AIEgens and deposition of MPNs in tetrahydrofuran/water mixtures, termed as coacervation, core–shell MPN-coated AIE dots with bright emission are assembled in a one-pot fashion. The optical properties of MPN-coated AIE dots can be readily tuned by varying the incorporated AIEgens. Different metal ions, such as Fe 3+ , Ti 4+ , Cu 2+ , Ni 2+ , can be introduced to the nanoparticles. The MPN-coated AIE dots with a red-emissive AIEgen core are successfully used to perform magnetic resonance/fluorescence dual-modality imaging in a tumor-bearing mouse model and blood flow visualization in a zebrafish larva.

Here, metagenomic landscape of gut antibiotic resistome is profiled in a large multiomics human cohort ( n = 1210). There is a significant overall shift in gut antibiotic resistome structure among healthy, prediabetes, and T2D groups. It is found that larger ARG diversity is associated with a higher risk of T2D. The novel diabetes ARG score is positively associated with glycemic traits. Longitudinal validation analysis confirms that the ARG score is associated with T2D progression, characterized by the change of insulin resistance.

However, although white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs), as a fundamental core technology of displays, are essential for realizing full-color displays and solid-state lighting, fiber-based WOLEDs are still challenging due to structural issues and the lack of approaches to implementing WOLEDs on fiber. Herein, the first fiber WOLED is reported, exhibiting high optoelectronic performance and a reliable color index, comparable to those of conventional planar WOLEDs. As key features, it is found that WOLEDs can be successfully introduced on a cylindrical fiber using a dip-coatable single white-emission layer based on simulation and optimization of the white spectra. Furthermore, to ensure durability from usage, the fiber WOLED is encapsulated by an Al 2 O 3 /elastomer bilayer, showing stable operation under repetitive bending and pressure, and in water.

As a result, IrO 2 /V 2 O 5 demonstrates not only ultralow overpotentials at 10 mA cm −2 (266 mV, pH = 0; 329 mV, pH = 7; 283 mV, pH = 14) for OER, but also high-performance overall water electrolysis over a broad pH range, with a potential of mere 1.50 V (pH = 0), 1.65 V (pH = 7) or 1.49 V (pH = 14) at 10 mA cm −2 . In addition, SOSI can simultaneously secure the distorted active sites and thus remarkably improving the catalytic stability, making it a promising strategy to develop high-performance catalytic systems.},

  abstract     = {Photobiomodulation (PBM) has received attention due to its potential for improving tissue function and enhancing regeneration in stroke. A lightweight, compact, and simple system of miniaturized electronic devices consisting of packaged light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that incorporates a flexible substrate for in vivo brain PBM in a mouse model is developed. Using this device platform, the preventive and therapeutic effects of PBM affixed to the exposed skull of mice in the photothrombosis and middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model are evaluated. Among the wavelength range of 630, 850, and 940 nm LED array, the PBM with 630-nm LED array is proved to be the most effective for reducing the infarction volume and neurological impairment after ischemic stroke. Moreover, the PBM with 630 nm LED array remarkably improves the capability of spatial learning and memory in the chronic poststroke phase, attenuates AIM2 inflammasome activation and inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis, and modulates microglial polarization in the hippocampus and cortex 7 days following ischemic stroke. Thus, PBM may prevent tissue and functional damage in acute ischemic injury, thereby attenuating the development of cognitive impairment after stroke.},

Here, using a preclinical model, it is reported that inadequate microwave ablation (iMWA) induces immunosuppressive niche predominated by myeloid cells. The gene signature of ablated tumor presented by transcriptome analyses is highly correlated with immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) resistance. Thus, an in situ scaffold with synergistic delivery of IPI549 and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 blocking antibody (aPDL1) for postablative cancer immunotherapy is designed and engineered, in which IPI549 capable of targeting myeloid cells could disrupt the immunosuppressive niche and subsequently improve ICB-mediated antitumor immune response. Based on five mouse cancer models, it is demonstrated that this biomaterial system (aPDL1&amp;IPI549@Gel) could mimic a “hot” tumor-immunity niche to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis, and protect cured mice against tumor rechallenge. This work enables a new standard-of-care paradigm for the immunotherapy of myeloid cells-mediated “cold” tumors after loco-regional inadequate practices.},

Owing to a high surface area to volume ratio and free oxygen groups, the oxidized derivative, graphene oxide (GO) has promising potential as a drug delivery system. Here, the lung tolerability of two distinct GO varying in lateral dimensions is investigated, to reveal the most suitable candidate platform for pulmonary drug delivery. Following repeated chronic pulmonary exposure of mice to GO sheet suspensions, the innate and adaptive immune responses are studied. An acute and transient influx of neutrophils and eosinophils in the alveolar space, together with the replacement of alveolar macrophages by interstitial ones and a significant activation toward anti-inflammatory subsets, are found for both GO materials. Micrometric GO give rise to persistent multinucleated macrophages and granulomas. However, neither adaptive immune response nor lung tissue remodeling are induced after exposure to micrometric GO. Concurrently, milder effects and faster tissue recovery, both associated to a faster clearance from the respiratory tract, are found for nanometric GO, suggesting a greater lung tolerability. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of dimensions in the design of biocompatible 2D materials for pulmonary drug delivery system.},

In this work, polygonal coffee-ring-less QD microarrays are created using two spontaneous and sequential solutal Marangoni flows. During the initial evaporation, internal circulating flows are controlled by polygonal-shaped droplets. After that, sequential interfacial flows are generated by the captured volatile vapors.

The available therapies for tendinopathy are limited in number and efficacy and have unclear cellular and molecular mechanisms. Here it is shown that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- β ) activated by integrin α v β 6 promotes tendinopathy in mice. Excessive active TGF- β is found during tendinopathy progression, which led to tenocytes’ phenotype transition to chondrocytes. Transgenic expression of active TGF- β in tendons induced spontaneous tendinopathy, whereas systemic injection of a TGF- β neutralizing antibody attenuated tendinopathy. Inducible knockout of the TGF- β type 2 receptor gene (Tgfbr2) in tenocytes inhibited tendinopathy progression in mice. Moreover, it is found that integrin α v β 6 induces TGF- β activation in response to mechanical load in tendons. Conditional knockout of the integrin α v gene in tendons prevented tendinopathy in mice. The study suggests that integrin α v β 6 activation of TGF- β is the mechanism of tendinopathy, and that integrin α v β 6 may be a therapeutic target in tendinopathy.},

Moreover, in the setting of assisted reproductive technology clinics, there is a distinct absence of effective and noninvasive technology to increase sperm motility without detriment to the sperm cells. Here, a new method is presented to boost sperm motility by increasing the intracellular rate of metabolic activity using high frequency ultrasound. An increase of 34% in curvilinear velocity (VCL), 10% in linearity, and 32% in the number of motile sperm cells is shown by rendering immotile sperm motile, after just 20 s exposure. A similar effect with an increase of 15% in VCL treating human sperm with the same setting is also identified. This cell level mechanotherapy approach causes no significant change in cell viability or DNA fragmentation index, and, as such, has the potential to be applied to encourage natural fertilization or less invasive treatment choices such as in vitro fertilization rather than intracytoplasmic injection.},

STIM1β, highly conserved in mammals, is aberrantly upregulated in glioma tissues to perturb Ca 2+ signaling. At the molecular level, the 31-residue insertion destabilizes STIM1β by perturbing its cytosolic inhibitory domain and accelerating its activation kinetics to efficiently engage and gate ORAI calcium channels. Functionally, STIM1β depletion affects SOCE in glioblastoma cells, suppresses tumor cell proliferation and growth both in vitro and in vivo.

Supramolecular peptide nanofiber hydrogels (SPNHs) are emerging biomaterials because of their inherent biocompatibility, satisfied biodegradability, high purity, facile functionalization, and tunable mechanical properties. This review initially focuses on the multihierarchical fabrications by SPNHs to emulate natural bony extracellular matrix. Structurally, supramolecular peptides based on distinctive building blocks can assemble into nanofiber hydrogels, which can be used as nanomorphology-mimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering. Biochemically, bioactive motifs and bioactive factors can be covalently tethered or physically absorbed to SPNHs to endow various functions depending on physiological and pharmacological requirements. Mechanically, four strategies are summarized to optimize the biophysical microenvironment of SPNHs for bone regeneration. Furthermore, comprehensive applications about SPNHs for bone tissue engineering are reviewed. The biomaterials can be directly used in the form of injectable hydrogels or composite nanoscaffolds, or they can be used to construct engineered bone grafts by bioprinting or bioreactors. Finally, continuing challenges and outlook are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Protein therapeutics, except for antibodies, have a short plasma half-life and poor stability in circulation. Covalent coupling of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to protein drugs addresses this limitation. However, unlike previously thought, PEG is immunogenic. In addition to induced PEG antibodies, ≈70% of the US population has pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies. Both induced and preexisting anti-PEG antibodies result in accelerated drug clearance, reduced clinical efficacy, and severe hypersensitivity reactions that have limited the clinical utility of uricase, an enzyme drug for treatment for refractory gout that is decorated with a PEG corona. Here, the authors synthesize a poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA) conjugate of uricase that decorates the protein with multiple polymer chains to create a corona to solve these problems. The resulting uricase-POEGMA is well-defined, has high bioactivity, and outperforms its PEG counterparts in its pharmacokinetics (PK). Furthermore, the conjugate does not induce anti-POEGMA antibodies and is not recognized by anti-PEG antibodies. These findings suggest that POEGMA conjugation may provide a solution to the immunogenicity and antigenicity limitations of PEG while improving upon its PK benefits. These results transcend uricase and can be applied to other PEGylated therapeutics and the broader class of biologics with suboptimal PK.},

  abstract     = {Compared to traditional organic liquid electrolytes, which often present leakage, flammability, and chemical stability problems, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely regarded as one of the most promising candidates for the development of safer lithium-ion batteries. Vitrimers are a new class of polymer materials consisting of dynamic covalent networks that can change their topology by thermally activated bond-exchange reactions. Herein, the recyclable and self-healing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with a soy protein isolate (SPI)-based imine bond dynamic network are reported. This malleable covalent cross-linked network polymer can be reshaped and recycled at high temperature (100 °C) or only with water at ambient temperature (25 °C), which may realize the green processing of energy materials. The introduction of bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) significantly reinforces the conductivity of the dynamic network to a maximum of 3.3 × 10 −4 S cm -1 . This simple and applicable method establishes new principles for designing scalable and flexible strategies for fabricating polymer electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been propelled into the limelight over the past decade due to the rapid-growing power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the internal defects and the interfacial energy level mismatch are detrimental to the device performance and stability. In this study, it is demonstrated that a small amount of indium (In 3+ ) ions in mixed cation and halide perovskites can effectively passivate the defects, improve the energy-level alignment, and reduce the exciton binding energy. Additionally, it is confirmed that In 3+ ions can significantly elevate the initial carrier temperature, slow down the hot-carrier cooling rate, and reduce the heat loss before carrier extraction. The device with 1.5% of incorporated In 3+ achieves a PCE of 22.4% with a negligible hysteresis, which is significantly higher than that of undoped PSCs (20.3%). In addition, the unencapsulated PSCs achieve long-term stability, which retain 85% of the original PCE after 3,000 h of aging in dry air. The obtained results demonstrate and promote the development of practical, highly efficient, and stable hot-carrier-enhanced PSCs.},

  abstract     = {In magnetic systems, spin and exchange disorder can provide access to quantum criticality, frustration, and spin dynamics, but broad tunability of these responses and a deeper understanding of strong limit disorder are lacking. Here, it is demonstrated that high entropy oxides present a previously unexplored route to designing materials in which the presence of strong local compositional disorder may be exploited to generate tunable magnetic behaviors—from macroscopically ordered states to frustration-driven dynamic spin interactions. Single-crystal La(Cr 0.2 Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 )O 3 films are used as a model system hosting a magnetic sublattice with a high degree of microstate disorder in the form of site-to-site spin and exchange type inhomogeneity. A classical Heisenberg model simplified to represent the highest probability microstates well describes how compositionally disordered systems can paradoxically host magnetic uniformity and demonstrates a path toward continuous control over ordering types and critical temperatures. Model-predicted materials are synthesized and found to possess an incipient quantum critical point when magnetic ordering types are designed to be in direct competition, this leads to highly controllable exchange bias behaviors previously accessible only in intentionally designed bilayer heterojunctions.},

  abstract     = {The development of MnO 2 as a cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) is severely limited by the low intrinsic electrical conductivity and unstable crystal structure. Herein, a multifunctional modification strategy is proposed to construct N-doped KMn 8 O 16 with abundant oxygen vacancy and large specific surface area (named as N-KMO) through a facile one-step hydrothermal approach. The synergetic effects of N-doping, oxygen vacancy, and porous structure in N-KMO can effectively suppress the dissolution of manganese ions, and promote ion diffusion and electron conduction. As a result, the N-KMO cathode exhibits dramatically improved stability and reaction kinetics, superior to the pristine MnO 2 and MnO 2 with only oxygen vacancy. Remarkably, the N-KMO cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 262 mAh g −1 after 2500 cycles at 1 A g −1 with a capacity retention of 91%. Simultaneously, the highest specific capacity can reach 298 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 . Theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen vacancy and N-doping can improve the electrical conductivity of MnO 2 and thus account for the outstanding rate performance. Moreover, ex situ characterizations indicate that the energy storage mechanism of the N-KMO cathode is mainly a H + and Zn 2+ co-insertion/extraction process.},

Herein, a viable approach is demonstrated to tackle the challenge by in situ fixing a predesigned aggregation induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) at the polymer/liquid crystal (LC) interface via precisely controlled interfacial engineering, in which the AIEgen is enriched in LC phases during polymerization induced phase separation and subsequently driven to the interface by the interfacial thiol-ene click reaction. Crosstalk-free integration of holographic and fluorescent dual-thermosensitive images with high sensitivity, high contrast ratio, and robust performance is successfully realized in a single unit, attributed to the simultaneously LC-facilitated AIEgen molecular motion and polymer-restricted AIEgen diffusion at the interface. The exciting characteristics of these orthogonally integrated dual images will enable them to prevent illegal replication and thus are expected to be promising for high-security-level anticounterfeiting applications.},

  abstract     = {Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) with the ability to grow and remodel open new perspectives for cardiovascular surgery. Equipping TEVGs with synthetic polymers and biological components provides a good compromise between high structural stability and biological adaptability. However, imaging approaches to control grafts’ structural integrity, physiological function, and remodeling during the entire transition between late in vitro maturation and early in vivo engraftment are mandatory for clinical implementation. Thus, a comprehensive molecular imaging concept using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) to monitor textile scaffold resorption, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and endothelial integrity in TEVGs is presented here. Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPION) incorporated in biodegradable poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) fibers of the TEVGs allow to quantitatively monitor scaffold resorption via MRI both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, ECM formation can be depicted by molecular MRI using elastin- and collagen-targeted probes. Finally, molecular US of α v β 3 integrins confirms the absence of endothelial dysfunction; the latter is provocable by TNF- α . In conclusion, the successful employment of noninvasive molecular imaging to longitudinally evaluate TEVGs remodeling is demonstrated. This approach may foster its translation from in vitro quality control assessment to in vivo applications to ensure proper prostheses engraftment.},

  abstract     = {The competition between different spatiotemporal carrier relaxation determines the carrier harvesting in optoelectronic semiconductors, which can be greatly optimized by utilizing the ultrafast spatial expansion of highly energetic carriers before their energy dissipation via carrier–phonon interactions. Here, the excited-state dynamics in layered tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) are primarily imaged in the temporal, spatial, and spectral domains by transient absorption microscopy. Ultrafast hot carrier expansion is captured in the first 1.4 ps immediately after photoexcitation, with a mean diffusivity up to 980 cm 2 s −1 . This carrier diffusivity then rapidly weakens, reaching a conventional linear spread of 10.5 cm 2 s −1 after 2 ps after the hot carriers cool down to the band edge and form bound excitons. The novel carrier diffusion can be well characterized by a cascaded transport model including 3D thermal transport and thermo-optical conversion, in which the carrier temperature gradient and lattice thermal transport govern the initial hot carrier expansion and long-term exciton diffusion rates, respectively. The ultrafast hot carrier expansion breaks the limit of slow exciton diffusion in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, providing potential guidance for high-performance applications and thermal management of optoelectronic technology.},

  abstract     = {Urea electrosynthesis under mild conditions starting from the adsorption of inert N 2 molecules has brought out a promising alternative experimentally to conquer its huge energy consumption in industrial Haber-Bosch process. The most crucial and inevitable reaction is the formation of urea precursor *NCON from *N 2 and CO based on the pre-selected reaction pathway, together with the following protonated processes. It is significant to comprehend their intrinsic intercorrelation and explore the principal descriptor from massive reaction data. Hereby, the authors study the dispersed dual-metals (homonuclear MN 3 –MN 3 moiety and heteronuclear MN 3 –M&#39;N 3 moiety) anchored on N-doped graphene as electrocatalysts to synthesize urea. Based on the screened out 72 stable systems by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations as the database, six significant linear correlations between the computed Gibbs free energy and other important factors are achieved. Most encouragingly, the principal descriptor (Δ E (*NCONH)) is established because 72% low-performance systems can be filtered out and its effective range (−1.0 eV &lt; Δ E E(*NCONH) &lt; 0.5 eV) is identified by eight optimal systems. This study not only suggests that dispersed dual-metals via MN 3 moiety can serve as promising active sites for urea production, but also identifies the principal descriptor and its effective range in high-throughput methods.},

Herein, fabricating Li-based ultrathin alloys with electronic localization and high surface work function via depositing Bi, Al, or Au metals on the surface of copper foil for in situ alloying with lithium is proposed. It is discovered that the electronic localization can induce self-smoothing effect of Li ions, as a result, significantly suppressing the growth of dendritic lithium. Meanwhile, the high surface work function can effectively alleviate side reactions between the electrolyte and lithium. With the as-obtained ultrathin alloys as anodes, excellent cycling performance is achieved. The half cells run stably after more than 120 cycles under high capacity of 4 mAh cm −2 . The S||Bi/Cu-Li full cell delivers a specific capacity of 736 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles. This work provides a new strategy for fabricating long-life and high-capacity lithium batteries.},

However, the effects of these biophysical stimuli on internal nuclear architecture and cellular responses remain poorly understood. This study investigates the direct impact of ECM adhesion on nucleolar remodeling in human keratinocytes using micropatterned substrates. Limited adhesion on small micropatterns promotes fusion of nucleoli, alongside a reduction in nuclear volume and condensation of heterochromatin. These changes in nucleolar architecture are mediated by altered chromatin biomechanics and depend on integration of the nucleus with the actin cytoskeleton. Functionally, nucleolar remodeling regulates ribogenesis and protein synthesis in keratinocytes and is associated with specific transcriptional changes in ribogenesis genes. Together, these findings demonstrate that cell shape and nuclear morphology control nucleolar structure and function and implicate the nucleolus as a key mechano-sensing element within the cell.},

Therefore, it often fails to meet the requirements for application in clinical practice. This technology mainly increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the IVD. As so, it is particularly critical to develop strategies to avoid this degeneration mechanism. Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) are found to enhance development under magnetic resonance T1 and have antioxidant enzyme activity. The key results of the present study confirm that PBNPs alleviate intracellular oxidative stress and increase the intracellular activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). PBNPs can rescue nucleus pulposus cell degeneration by increasing oxidoreductase system-related mRNA and proteins, especially by stabilizing SOD1 from ubiquitination-proteasome degradation, thus improving the mitochondrial structure to increase antioxidation ability, and finally rescuing ROS-induced IVDD in a rat model. Therefore, it is considered that PBNPs can be a potential antioxidation-protective discography contrast agent.},

Here, magnetic structures in a prototypical skyrmion-hosting centrosymmetric tetragonal magnet GdRu 2 Si 2 is exhaustively studied by performing the resonant X-ray scattering experiments. A rich variety of double- Q magnetic structures, including the antiferroic order of meron(half-skyrmion)/anti-meron-like textures with fractional local topological charges are identified. The observed intricate magnetic phase diagram is successfully reproduced by the theoretical framework considering the four-spin interaction mediated by itinerant electrons and magnetic anisotropy. The present results will contribute to the better understanding of the novel skyrmion formation mechanism in this centrosymmetric rare-earth compound, and suggest that itinerant electrons can ubiquitously host a variety of unique multiple- Q spin orders in a simple crystal lattice system.},

Herein, an oxygen plasma treatment on a polymer separator combined with high-speed centrifugal spraying to construct ultrastable interfacial contacts is reported. With the treatment, abundant hydrophilic oxygen-containing functional groups are produced and ensure strong chemical adhesion between the separator and the active materials. With single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) sprayed onto the active materials, a dense thin film is formed as the current collector. Meanwhile, the centrifugal force caused by high-speed rotation together with van der Waals forces under fast evaporation produces a much closer interface between the current collector and the active materials. As a result of this ultrastable interfacial interaction, the integrated electrode shows no structural failure after 5000 bending cycles with the charge-transfer resistance as low as 35.8% and a Li-ion diffusion coefficient nearly 19 times of the untreated electrode. Flexible LIBs assembled with these integrated electrodes show excellent structural and electrochemical stability, and can work steadily under various deformed states and repeated bending. This work provides a new technique toward rational design of electrode configuration for flexible LIBs.},

  abstract     = {Catheters integrated with microcoils for electromagnetic steering under the high, uniform magnetic field within magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (3–7 Tesla) have enabled an alternative approach for active catheter operations. Achieving larger ranges of tip motion for Lorentz force-based steering have previously been dependent on using high power coupled with active cooling, bulkier catheter designs, or introducing additional microcoil sets along the catheter. This work proposes an alternative approach using a heat-mitigated design and actuation strategy for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-driven microcatheter. A quad-configuration microcoil (QCM) design is introduced, allowing miniaturization of existing MRI-driven, Lorentz force-based catheters down to 1-mm diameters with minimal power consumption (0.44 W). Heating concerns are experimentally validated using noninvasive MRI thermometry. The Cosserat model is implemented within an MR scanner and results demonstrate a desired tip range up to 110° with 4° error. The QCM is used to validate the proposed model and power-optimized steering algorithm using an MRI-compatible neurovascular phantom and ex vivo kidney tissue. The power-optimized tip orientation controller conserves as much as 25% power regardless of the catheter&#39;s initial orientation. These results demonstrate the implementation of an MRI-driven, electromagnetic catheter steering platform for minimally invasive surgical applications without the need for camera feedback or manual advancement via guidewires. The incorporation of such system in clinics using the proposed design and actuation strategy can further improve the safety and reliability of future MRI-driven active catheter operations.},

Herein, the unexpected role and molecular mechanism of Corranulene π -bowls are uncovered in biomedical applications as an effective anticancer agent for Warburg effect mediated selective tumor targeting. The corannulene triazolyl monosaccharides Cor-sugars exhibit highly potent cytotoxicity against human cancer cells and effectively inhibit xenograft growth of hyperglycolytic tumors. Particularly, the galactose-conjugated Cor-gal exhibits superior in vivo anticancer efficacy in A549 tumor models with outstanding safety profile compared to doxorubicin. Moreover, the combined treatment of Cor-gal with immune checkpoint inhibitor results in an effective synergy in treating H460 human lung carcinoma. An uptake mechanism study reveals that Cor-sugars exploit tumor-specific glucose transporter glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) for targeted cell delivery and intra-tumoral accumulation through the cancer-specific Warburg effect. Their significant anticancer activity is attributed to multiphasic DNA-binding and cell cycle alteration effects.

  abstract     = {The emergence of bacterial resistance due to the evolution of microbes under antibiotic selection pressure, and their ability to form biofilm, has necessitated the development of alternative antimicrobial therapeutics. Physical stimulation, as a powerful antimicrobial method to disrupt microbial structure, has been widely used in food and industrial sterilization. With advances in nanotechnology, nanophysical antimicrobial strategies (NPAS) have provided unprecedented opportunities to treat antibiotic-resistant infections, via a combination of nanomaterials and physical stimulations. In this review, NPAS are categorized according to the modes of their physical stimulation, which include mechanical, optical, magnetic, acoustic, and electrical signals. The biomedical applications of NPAS in combating bacterial infections are systematically introduced, with a focus on their design and antimicrobial mechanisms. Current challenges and further perspectives of NPAS in the clinical treatment of bacterial infections are also summarized and discussed to highlight their potential use in clinical settings. The authors hope that this review will attract more researchers to further advance the promising field of NPAS, and provide new insights for designing powerful strategies to combat bacterial resistance.},

  abstract     = {Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with little response to standard therapies. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has emerged as a novel ablative technique for the clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer. Combinations of IRE and immunotherapies, including anti-programmed death 1 ( α PD1) immune checkpoint blockade, have shown promising efficacy in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, tumor recurrence remains an obstacle that needs to be overcome. It herein is shown that IRE induces a substantial infiltration of neutrophils into pancreatic tumors. These neutrophils are then polarized into a protumor phenotype by immunosuppressive cues, in particular transforming growth factor β (TGF- β ). Using glutathione-responsive degradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with SB525334, an inhibitor of TGF- β 1 receptor, it is demonstrated that local inhibition of TGF- β within the tumor microenvironment promotes neutrophil polarization into an antitumor phenotype, enhances pancreatic cancer response to combined IRE and α PD1 therapy, and induces long-term antitumor memory. The therapeutic efficacy is also attributed to tumor infiltration by CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, depletion of regulatory T cells, and maturation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Thus, modulating neutrophil polarization with nanomedicine is a promising strategy for treating pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract     = {The ability of melanoma to acquire metastasis through the induction of angiogenesis is one of the major causes of skin cancer death. Here, it is found that high transcript levels of DEP domain containing 1B ( DEPDC1B ) in cutaneous melanomas are significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Tissue microarray analysis indicates that DEPDC1B expression is positively correlated with SOX10 in the different stages of melanoma. Consistently, DEPDC1B is both required and sufficient for melanoma growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and functions as a direct downstream target of SOX10 to partly mediate its oncogenic activity. In contrast to other tumor types, the DEPDC1B-mediated enhancement of melanoma metastatic potential is not dependent on the activities of RHO GTPase signaling and canonical Wnt signaling, but is acquired through secretion of signal peptide, CUB domain and EGF like domain containing 3 (SCUBE3), which is crucial for promoting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DEPDC1B regulates SCUBE3 protein stability through the competitive association with ubiquitin ligase cell division cycle 16 (CDC16) to prevent SCUBE3 from undergoing degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Importantly, expression of SOX10, DEPDC1B, and SCUBE3 are positively correlated with microvessel density in the advanced stage of melanomas. In conclusion, it is revealed that a SOX10-DEPDC1B-SCUBE3 regulatory axis promotes melanoma angiogenesis and metastasis, which suggests that targeting secreted SCUBE3 can be a therapeutic strategy against metastatic melanoma.},

  abstract     = {Compared to the commonly applied metallic ion charge carriers (e.g., Li + and Na + ), batteries using nonmetallic charge carriers (e.g., H + and NH 4 + ) generally have much faster kinetics and high-rate capability thanks to the small hydrated ionic sizes and nondiffusion control topochemistry. However, the hosts for nonmetallic charge carriers are still limited. In this work, it is suggested that mixed ionic–electronic conductors can serve as a promising host for NH 4 + storage. Using hexagonal tungsten oxide ( h -WO 3 ) as an example, it is shown that the existence of ionic conductive tunnels greatly promotes the high-rate NH 4 + storage. Specifically, a much higher capacity of 82 mAh g –1 at 1 A g –1 is achieved on h -WO 3 , in sharp contrast to 14 mAh g –1 of monoclinic tungsten oxide ( m -WO 3 ). In addition, unlike layered materials, the insertion and desertion of NH 4 + ions are confined within the tunnels of the h -WO 3 , which minimizes the damage to the crystal structure. This leads to outstanding stability of up to 200 000 cycles with 68% capacity retention at a high current of 20 A g –1 .},

  abstract     = {Skin wound repair is a multistage process involving multiple cellular and molecular interactions, which modulate the cell behaviors and dynamic remodeling of extracellular matrices to maximize regeneration and repair. Consequently, abnormalities in cell functions or pathways inevitably give rise to side effects, such as dysregulated inflammation, hyperplasia of nonmigratory epithelial cells, and lack of response to growth factors, which impedes angiogenesis and fibrosis. These issues may cause delayed wound healing or even non-healing states. Current clinical therapeutic approaches are predominantly dedicated to preventing infections and alleviating topical symptoms rather than addressing the modulation of wound microenvironments to achieve targeted outcomes. Bioactive materials, relying on their chemical, physical, and biological properties or as carriers of bioactive substances, can affect wound microenvironments and promote wound healing at the molecular level. By addressing the mechanisms of wound healing from the perspective of cell behaviors, this review discusses how bioactive materials modulate the microenvironments and cell behaviors within the wounds during the stages of hemostasis, anti-inflammation, tissue regeneration and deposition, and matrix remodeling. A deeper understanding of cell behaviors during wound healing is bound to promote the development of more targeted and efficient bioactive materials for clinical applications.},

Single atoms have been widely used in catalytic applications because of their remarkable redox property, implying that the single atom is highly capable of catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acts as an anti-biofouling substance for controlling biofouling. In this study, the Co single atom loaded polyacrylamidoxime (PAO) material, PAO-Co, is fabricated based on the binding ability of the amidoxime group to uranyl and cobalt ions. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms from the amidoxime group stabilize the Co single atom. The fabricated PAO-Co exhibits a broad range of antimicrobial activity against diverse marine microorganisms by producing ROS, with an inhibition rate up to 93.4%. The present study is the first to apply the single atom for controlling biofouling. The adsorbent achieves an ultrahigh uranium adsorption capacity of 9.7 mg g −1 in biofouling-containing natural seawater, which decreased only by 11% compared with that in biofouling-removed natural seawater. These findings indicate that applying single atoms would be a promising strategy for designing biofouling-resistant adsorbents for uranium extraction from seawater.},

  abstract     = {Immunogenic cell death (ICD) through apoptosis or necroptosis is widely adopted to improve the therapeutic effect in cancer treatment by triggering a specific antitumor immunity. However, the tumor resistance to apoptosis/necroptosis seriously impedes the therapeutic effect. Recently, ferroptosis featured with excessive lipid peroxidation is demonstrated capable of bypassing the apoptosis/necroptosis resistance to kill cancer cells. To date, numerous efficient ferroptosis inducers are developed and successfully utilized for sensitizing cancer cells to ferroptosis. Unfortunately, these inducers can hardly generate adequate immunogenicity during induction of ferroptotic cancer cell death, which distinctly attenuates the efficacy of triggering antitumor immune response, therefore leads to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Herein, a novel high-performance photothermal nanoparticle (TPA-NDTA NP) is designed by exploiting energy via excited-state intramolecular motion and employed for immensely assisting ferroptosis inducer to evoke highly efficient ICD through ferroptosis pathway. Tumor models with poor immunogenicity are used to demonstrate the tremendously enhanced therapeutic effect endowed by highly enhanced immunogenic ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo by virtue of the NPs. This study sheds new light on a previously unrecognized facet of boosting the immunogenicity of ferroptosis for achieving satisfactory therapeutic effect in cancer therapy.},

However, typical fabrication methods of colloidal suprastructures are carried out under toxic or harmful conditions for unstable biomolecules, such as, biocatalytic enzymes. For this reason, biocatalytic enzymes have rarely been used with suprastructures, even though biocatalytic cascade reactions in confined environments are more efficient than in open conditions. Here, multimodal enzyme- and photocatalyst-carrying superstructures with efficient cascade reactions for colorimetric glucose detection are demonstrated. The suprastructures consisting of various functional nanoparticles, including enzyme-carrying nanoparticles, are fabricated by surface-templated evaporation driven suprastructure synthesis on polydimethylsiloxane-grafted surfaces at ambient conditions. For the fabrication of suprastructures, no additional chemicals and reactions are required, which allows maintaining the enzyme activities. The multimodal enzymes (glucose oxidase and peroxidase)-carrying suprastructures exhibit rapid and highly sensitive glucose detection via two enzyme cascade reactions in confined geometry. Moreover, the combination of enzymatic and photocatalytic cascade reactions of glucose oxidase to titanium dioxide nanoparticles is successfully realized for the same assay. These results show promising abilities of multiple colloidal mixtures carrying suprastructures for effective enzymatic reactions and open a new door for advanced biological reactions and enzyme-related works.},

Here, whether sorting of T cells based on their distinct phenotype (Tphe cells) yields gluten-reactive cells in CeD is tested. The method′s efficiency is benchmarked by parallel isolation of gluten-reactive T cells (Ttet cells), using HLA-DQ:gluten peptide tetramers. From gut biopsies of 12 untreated HLA-DQ2.5 + CeD patients, Ttet + /Tphe + , Ttet − /Tphe + , and Ttet − /Tphe − cells are sorted for single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing ( n = 8) and T-cell clone (TCC)-generation ( n = 5). The generated TCCs are TCR sequenced and tested for their reactivity against deamidated gluten. Gluten-reactivity is observed in 91.2% of Ttet + /Tphe + TCCs, 65.3% of Ttet − /Tphe + TCCs and 0% of Ttet − /Tphe − TCCs. TCR sequencing reveals clonal expansion and sequence sharing across patients, features reflecting antigen-driven responses.

The numerous advantages of MXenes, including their excellent metallic conductivity, high optical transmittance, solution processability, tunable work-function, and hydrophilicity, make them suitable for deployment in PV technology. This comprehensive review focuses on the synthesis methodologies and properties of MXenes and MXene-based materials for PV systems. Titanium carbide MXene (Ti 3 C 2 T x ), a well-known member of the MXene family, has been studied in many PV applications. Herein, the effectiveness of Ti 3 C 2 T x as an additive in different types of PV cells, and the synergetic impact of Ti 3 C 2 T x as an interfacial material on the photovoltaic performance of PV cells, are systematically examined. Subsequently, the utilization of Ti 3 C 2 T x as a transparent conductive electrode, and its influence on the stability of the PV cells, are discussed. This review also considers problems that emerged from previous studies, and provides guidelines for the further exploration of Ti 3 C 2 T x and other members of the 2D MXene family in PV technology. This timely study is expected to provide comprehensive understanding of the current status of MXenes, and to set the direction for the future development in 2D material design and processing for PVs.},

  abstract     = {Tailorable electron distribution of the active sites is widely regarded as the key issue to boost the catalytic activity and provide mechanistic insights into the structure–property–performance relationship. Here, a selective metal atom in situ growth strategy to construct highly active interface of mixed metal atom with different Nb y RhO x species on sp-/sp 2 -cohybridized graphdiyne (Nb y RhO x /GDY) is reported. With this innovative idea implemented, experimental results show that the asymmetric electron distribution and the variation of coordination environment of bimetallic species significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of Nb y RhO x /GDY. Optimal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is achieved at the Nb/Rh ratio of 0.23, exhibiting excellent HER activity with the small overpotentials of 14 and 10 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The data show the strong potential for real-system application of such catalysts, which outperform commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). These results shown in this study represent a platform for designing novel catalytic materials by selectively introducing metal atoms on different supports, which can be used as a general method extended to other catalytic systems.},

  abstract     = {Formation of biomolecular condensates by phase separation has recently emerged as a new principle for regulating gene expression in response to extracellular signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coupling of signal transduction and gene activation through condensate formation, and how dysregulation of these mechanisms contributes to disease progression, remain elusive. Here, the authors report that CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) translocates to the nucleus and forms phase-separated condensates upon activation of cAMP signaling. They show that intranuclear CRTC2 interacts with positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and activates P-TEFb by disrupting the inhibitory 7SK snRNP complex. Aberrantly elevated cAMP signaling plays central roles in the development of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). They find that CRTC2 localizes to the nucleus and forms condensates in cystic epithelial cells of both mouse and human ADPKD kidneys. Genetic depletion of CRTC2 suppresses cyst growth in an orthologous ADPKD mouse model. Using integrative transcriptomic and cistromic analyses, they identify CRTC2-regulated cystogenesis-associated genes, whose activation depends on CRTC2 condensate-facilitated P-TEFb recruitment and the release of paused RNA polymerase II. Together, their findings elucidate a mechanism by which CRTC2 nuclear condensation conveys cAMP signaling to transcription elongation activation and thereby promotes cystogenesis in ADPKD.},

However, the oxygen levels of in vitro cell culture systems, particularly microscale cell culture, are typically dominated by either supply or demand. Further, the oxygen microenvironment in these systems is rarely monitored or reported. Here, a method to establish and dynamically monitor autonomously regulated oxygen microenvironments (AROM) using an oil overlay in an open microscale cell culture system is presented. Using this method, the oxygen microenvironment is dynamically regulated via the supply–demand balance of the system. Numerical simulation and experimental validation of oxygen transport within multi-liquid-phase, microscale culture systems involving a variety of cell types, including mammalian, fungal, and bacterial cells are presented. Finally, AROM is applied to establish a coculture between cells with disparate oxygen demands—primary intestinal epithelial cells (oxygen consuming) and Bacteroides uniformis (an anaerobic species prevalent in the human gut).},

  abstract     = {Microbes have developed their own specific strategies to cope with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase, a heme-containing tetramer expressed in a broad range of aerobic fungi, shows remarkable efficiency in degrading hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) for fungal survival and host invasion. Here, it is demonstrated that catalase inactivation by blue light renders fungal cells highly susceptible to ROS attack. To confirm catalase as a major molecular target of blue light, wild type Candida albicans are systematically compared with a catalase-deficient mutant strain regarding their susceptibility to ROS through 410 nm treatment. Upon testing a wide range of fungal species, it is found that intracellular catalase can be effectively and universally inactivated by 410 nm blue light. It is also found that photoinactivation of catalase in combination with ROS-generating agents is highly effective in total eradication of various fungal species, including multiple Candida auris strains, the causative agent of the global fungal epidemic. In addition, photoinactivation of catalase is shown to facilitate macrophage killing of intracellular Candida albicans . The antifungal efficacy of catalase photoinactivation is further validated using a C. albicans- induced mouse model of skin abrasion. Taken together, the findings offer a novel catalase-photoinactivation approach to address multidrug-resistant Candida infections.},

Due to increasing drug-resistance of virulent pathogen such as Gardnerella vaginalis ( G. vaginalis ), more than half of BV patients suffer recurrence after antibotics treatment. Here, metastable iron sulfides (mFeS) act in a Gram-dependent manner to kill bacteria, with the ability to counteract resistant G. vaginalis for BV treatment. With screening of iron sulfide minerals, metastable Fe 3 S 4 shows suppressive effect on bacterial growth with an order: Gram-variable G. vaginalis &gt;Gram-negative bacteria&gt;&gt; Gram-positive bacteria. Further studies on mechanism of action (MoA) discover that the polysulfide species released from Fe 3 S 4 selectively permeate bacteria with thin wall and subsequently interrupt energy metabolism by inhibiting glucokinase in glycolysis, and is further synergized by simultaneously released ferrous iron that induces bactericidal damage. Such multiple MoAs enable Fe 3 S 4 to counteract G. vaginalis strains with metronidazole-resistance and persisters in biofilm or intracellular vacuole, without developing new drug resistance and killing probiotic bacteria. The Fe 3 S 4 regimens successfully ameliorate BV with resistant G. vaginalis in mouse models and eliminate pathogens from patients suffering BV. Collectively, mFeS represent an antibacterial alternative with distinct MoA able to treat challenged BV and improve women health.},

  abstract     = {Epigenetic modifications are involved in the onset, development, and maintenance of pain; however, the precise epigenetic mechanism underlying pain regulation remains elusive. Here it is reported that the epigenetic factor chromodomain Y-like (CDYL) is crucial for pain processing. Selective knockout of CDYL in sensory neurons results in decreased neuronal excitability and nociception. Moreover, CDYL facilitates histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) deposition at the Kcnb1 intron region thus silencing voltage-gated potassium channel (K v ) subfamily member K v 2.1 transcription. Loss function of CDYL enhances total K v and K v 2.1 current density in dorsal root ganglia and knockdown of K v 2.1 reverses the pain-related phenotypes of Cdyl deficiency mice. Furthermore, focal administration of a novel potent CDYL antagonist blunts nociception and attenuates neuropathic pain. These findings reveal that CDYL is a critical regulator of pain sensation and shed light on the development of novel analgesics targeting epigenetic mechanisms.},

By the first time of pyramidal-patterned hydrogel fabrication method and laminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) encapsulation process, the self-powered THS shows the advantages of remarkable flexibility, good transparency (≈85%), and excellent sensing performance, including extraordinary sensitivity (45.97 mV Pa −1 ), fast response (≈20 ms), very low limit of detection (50 Pa) as well as good stability (36 000 cycles). Moreover, with the LiBr immersion treatment method, the THS possesses excellent long-term hyper anti-freezing and anti-dehydrating properties, broad environmental tolerance (−20 to 60 °C), and instantaneous peak power density of 20 µW cm −2 , providing reliable contact outputs with different materials and detecting very slight human motions. By integrating the signal acquisition/process circuit, the THS with excellent self-power sensing ability is utilized as a switching button to control electric appliances and robotic hands by simulating human finger gestures, offering its great potentials for wearable and multi-functional electronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Wound healing is a long-term, multistage biological process that includes hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling and requires intelligent designs to provide comprehensive and convenient treatment. The complexity of wounds has led to a lack of adequate wound treatment materials, which must systematically regulate unique wound microenvironments. Hydrogels have significant advantages in wound treatment due to their ability to provide spatiotemporal control over the wound healing process. Self-assembling peptide-based hydrogels are particularly attractive due to their innate biocompatibility and biodegradability along with additional advantages including ligand-receptor recognition, stimulus-responsive self-assembly, and the ability to mimic the extracellular matrix. The ability of peptide-based materials to self-assemble in response to the physiological environment, resulting in functionalized microscopic structures, makes them conducive to wound treatment. This review introduces several self-assembling peptide-based systems with various advantages and emphasizes recent advances in self-assembling peptide-based hydrogels that allow for precise control during different stages of wound healing. Moreover, the development of multifunctional self-assembling peptide-based hydrogels that can regulate and remodel the wound immune microenvironment in wound therapy with spatiotemporal control has also been summarized. Overall, this review sheds light on the future clinical and practical applications of self-assembling peptide-based hydrogels.},

However, most in vitro models fail to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) multi-scale hierarchical architecture of collagen-rich tissues and as a result, are unable to mirror native or disease phenotypes. Herein, using primary human fibroblasts seeded into custom fabricated 3D non-adhesive agarose molds, a novel strategy is proposed to direct the morphogenesis of engineered 3D ring-shaped tissue constructs with tensile and histological properties that recapitulate key features of fibrous connective tissue. To characterize the shift from monodispersed cells to a highly-aligned, collagen-rich matrix, a multi-modal approach integrating histology, multiphoton second-harmonic generation, and electron microscopy is employed. Structural changes in collagen synthesis and alignment are then mapped to functional differences in tissue mechanics and total collagen content. Due to the absence of an exogenously added scaffolding material, this model enables the direct quantification of cell-derived changes in 3D matrix synthesis, alignment, and mechanics in response to the addition or removal of relevant biomolecular perturbations. To illustrate this, the effects of nutrient composition, fetal bovine serum, rho-kinase inhibitor, and pro- and anti-fibrotic compounds on ECM synthesis, 3D collagen architecture, and mechanophenotype are quantified.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) evolves over an extended and variable period in humans; years prior to the onset of classical motor symptoms, sleep and biological rhythm disorders develop, significantly impacting the quality-of-life of patients. Circadian-rhythm disorders are accompanied by mild cognitive deficits that progressively worsen with disease progression and can constitute a severe burden for patients at later stages. The gold-standard 6-methyl-1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin (MPTP) macaque model of PD recapitulates the progression of motor and nonmotor symptoms over contracted periods of time. Here, this multidisciplinary/multiparametric study follows, in five animals, the steady progression of motor and nonmotor symptoms and describes their reversal following grafts of neural precursors in diverse functional domains of the basal ganglia. Results show unprecedented recovery from cognitive symptoms in addition to a strong clinical motor recuperation. Both motor and cognitive recovery and partial circadian rhythm recovery correlate with the degree of graft integration, and in a subset of animals, with in vivo levels of striatal dopaminergic innervation and function. The present study provides empirical evidence that integration of neural precursors following transplantation efficiently restores function at multiple levels in parkinsonian nonhuman primates and, given interindividuality of disease progression and recovery, underlines the importance of longitudinal multidisciplinary assessments in view of clinical translation.},

Here the authors set out to longitudinally study the dynamics of the EPR effect upon single- and double-dose nanotherapy with fluorophore-labeled and paclitaxel-loaded polymeric micelles. Using computed tomography-fluorescence molecular tomography imaging, it is shown that the extent of nanomedicine tumor accumulation is predictive for therapy outcome. It is also shown that the interindividual heterogeneity in EPR-based tumor accumulation significantly increases during treatment, especially for more efficient double-dose nanotaxane therapy. Furthermore, for double-dose micelle therapy, tumor accumulation significantly increased over time, from 7% injected dose per gram (ID g –1 ) upon the first administration to 15% ID g –1 upon the fifth administration, contributing to more efficient inhibition of tumor growth. These findings shed light on the dynamics of the EPR effect during nanomedicine treatment and they exemplify the importance of using imaging in nanomedicine treatment prediction and clinical translation.},

Importantly, through the investigation of the transdifferentiation processes between the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and the bipolar neuron (BN), a quantitative description for the transdifferentiation is provided, which can be linked to the Waddington landscape. In addition, compared to the direct transdifferentiation between PBMC and BN, the transdifferentiation via the intermediate state neural progenitor cell (NPC) follows a different path (an “uphill” followed by a “downhill”). These theoretical studies bridge the gap among the chromosome fluctuations/ensembles, the epigenetics, and gene expressions in determining the cell fate.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a two component microgel assembly using soft anisometric microgels that interlink to create a 3D macroporous construct for cell growth is reported. Reactive microgel rods with variable aspect ratio are produced via microfluidics in a continuous plug-flow on-chip gelation method by photoinitiated free-radical polymerization of star-polyethylene glycol-acrylate with glycidyl methacrylate or 2-aminoethyl methacrylate comonomers. The resulting complementary epoxy- and amine-functionalized microgels assemble and interlink with each other via a ring opening reaction, resulting in macroporous constructs with pores up to several hundreds of micrometers. The level of crosslinking depends on the functionalization degree of the microgels, which also affects the stiffness and cell adhesiveness of the microgels when modified with the cell-adhesive GRGDS-PC peptide. Therefore, 3D spreading and growth of cells inside the macroporous structure is influenced not only by the presence of macropores but also by the mechanical and biochemical properties of the individual microgels.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer are associated with dysregulation of cytokine networks. However, it is challenging to target cytokines for effective intervention because of the overlapping functions and unpredictable interactions of cytokines in such diverse networks. Here, it is shown that IL-36 γ and IL-36Ra, an agonist and an antagonist for IL-36R signaling respectively, reciprocally regulate the experimental colitis and the colon cancer development in mice. Knockout or neutralization of IL-36 γ alleviates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and inhibits colon cancer development, whereas knockout of IL-36Ra exacerbates DSS-induced colitis and promotes colonic tumorigenesis in multiple colon cancer models in mice. Mechanistically, IL-36 γ upregulates extracellular matrix and cell–matrix adhesion molecules and facilitates Wnt signaling, which is mitigated by IL-36Ra or IL-36 γ neutralizing antibody. Consistently, IL-36 γ levels are positively correlated with extracellular matrix levels and β -catenin levels in human colorectal tumor biopsies. These findings suggest the critical role of IL-36 γ and IL-36Ra in gut inflammation and tumorigenesis and indicate that targeting the IL-36 γ /IL-36Ra signal balance provides potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal cancers.},

A new type of porphyrin–iron metal organic framework (Fe-MOF) nanocrystals is engineered here as acid-degradable drug carrier and hydrogen donor by the coordination between porphyrin and zero-valence Fe atom. Fe-MOF nanocrystals exhibit excellent acid-responsive degradation for H 2 generation and simultaneous release of the loaded drug for combined hydrogen-chemotherapy of cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) and metastasis and for local hydrogen eradication of the off-target induced toxic side effects of the drug to normal cells/tissues. Mechanistically, released H 2 assists chemotherapeutic drug to efficiently inhibit cancer metastasis by immunoactivating intratumoral M1-phenotype macrophages and consequently downregulating the expression of metastasis-related matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and can also downregulate the expressions of both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) protein and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in MDR cancer cells to sensitize chemotherapeutic drug for enhanced damage to mitochondria and DNA. High anti-MDR/antimetastasis efficacies and high biocompatibility endow Fe-MOF nanocrystals and the Fe-MOF-based nanomedicine with high potential for clinical translation.},

Herein, a novel functional interlayer consisting of a poly(amic acid)-polyimide copolymer is introduced for use in OLEDs. It is shown that an OLED sample with a polyimide-copolymer interlayer exhibits high peak brightness of nearly 96 000 cd m −2 and efficiency of ≈92 cd A −1 , much higher than those (≈73 000 cd m −2 and ≈83 cd A −1 ) of a well-organized reference OLED. Moreover, the growth of dark spots is strongly suppressed in the sample OLED and the device lifetime is extended considerably. Further, highly stable and uniform large-area OLEDs are successfully produced when using the interlayer. These improvements are ascribed not only to the excellent film-forming and hole-transferring properties but also to the inner passivating capability of the polyimide-copolymer interlayer. The results here suggest that the introduction of an inner passivating/encapsulating hole-transferable polyimide-copolymer interlayer together with conventional external encapsulation technology represents a promising breakthrough that enhances the longevity of high-performance next-generation OLEDs.},

  abstract     = {Macrophage infiltration in mammary tumors is associated with enhanced tumor progression, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome, and considered as target for therapeutic intervention. By using different genetic mouse models, the authors show that ablation of the tyrosine kinase PYK2, either in breast cancer cells, only in the tumor microenvironment, or in both, markedly reduces the number of infiltrating tumor macrophages and concomitantly inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. Strikingly, PYK2 ablation only in macrophages is sufficient to induce similar effects. These phenotypic changes are associated with reduced monocyte recruitment and a substantial decrease in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Mechanistically, the authors show that PYK2 mediates mutual communication between breast cancer cells and macrophages through critical effects on key receptor signaling. Specifically, PYK2 ablation inhibits Notch1 signaling and consequently reduces CCL2 secretion by breast cancer cells, and concurrently reduces the levels of CCR2, CXCR4, IL-4Rα, and Stat6 activation in macrophages. These bidirectional effects modulate monocyte recruitment, macrophage polarization, and tumor angiogenesis. The expression of PYK2 is correlated with infiltrated macrophages in breast cancer patients, and its effects on macrophage infiltration and pro-tumorigenic phenotype suggest that PYK2 targeting can be utilized as an effective strategy to modulate TAMs and possibly sensitize breast cancer to immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Rapid insulin release plays an essential role in maintaining blood-glucose homeostasis in mammalians. Patients diagnosed with type-I diabetes mellitus experience chronic and remarkably high blood-sugar levels, and require lifelong insulin injection therapy, so there is a need for more convenient and less invasive insulin delivery systems to increase patients’ compliance and also to enhance their quality of life. Here, an endoplasmic-reticulum-localized split sec-tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp)-based rapamycin-actuated protein-induction device (RAPID) is engineered, which is composed of the rapamycin-inducible dimerization domains FK506 binding protein (FKBP) and FKBP-rapamycin binding protein fused with modified split sec-TEVp components. Insulin accumulation inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is achieved through tagging its C-terminus with KDEL, an ER-retention signal, spaced by a TEVp cleavage site. In the presence of rapamycin, the split sec-TEVp-based RAPID components dimerize, regain their proteolytic activity, and remove the KDEL retention signal from insulin. This leads to rapid secretion of accumulated insulin from cells within few minutes. Using liver hydrodynamic transfection methodology, it is shown that RAPID quickly restores glucose homeostasis in type-1-diabetic (T1DM) mice treated with an oral dose of clinically licensed rapamycin. This rapid-release technology may become the foundation for other cell-based therapies requiring instantaneous biopharmaceutical availability.},

Despite moderate mitochondrial complex II dysfunction, hepatic Sdhaf4 knockout mice present intriguingly improved glucose tolerance and systemic insulin sensitivity, consistent with mice after ADF intervention. Mechanistically, it is found that hepatocytes activate arginine-nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis axle in response to complex II and citric acid cycle dysfunction, the release of NO from liver can target muscle and adipocytes in addition to its autocrine action for enhanced insulin sensitivity. These results highlight the pivotal role of liver in ADF-associated systemic benefits, and suggest that targeting hepatic complex II assembly can be an intriguing strategy against metabolic disorders.},

  abstract     = {Euthyroidism is of profound importance for lifetime health. However, the early diagnosis or therapeutics of thyroid developmental defects has not been established, mainly due to limited understanding of human thyroid development and a lack of recapitulating research model. Herein, the authors elaborate the cell atlas and potential regulatory signaling of the evolution of heterogeneous thyrocyte population from 12 to 16 gestational weeks. Moreover, they establish a long-term culture of human fetal thyroid organoids (hFTOs) system, which retains the fetal thyroid lineages and molecular signatures, as well as the ability to generate functional human thyroid follicles post mice renal transplantation. Notably, cAMP signaling activation in hFTOs by forskolin boosts the maturation of follicle and thus thyroid hormone T4 secretion, which recapitulates the key developmental events of fetal thyroid. Employing this ex vivo system, it is found that enhanced chromatin accessibility at thyroid maturation genes (such as TPO and TG ) loci permits the transcription for hormone production. This study provides the cell atlas of and an organoid model for human thyroid development, which will facilitate thyroid research and prospective medicine.},

Herein, Co-MnO 2 has excellent electrochemical properties in tests as the cathode electrode of sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries. The rate performance remains at 50.2 mAh g −1 at 200 mA g −1 for sodium-ion batteries. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is utilized to evaluate the crystal structure transition from Co 0.2 -MnO 2 to NaMnO 2 with discharge to 1 V, proving that Co-doping does indeed facilitate the acceleration of ion transport and support layer spacing to stabilize the structure of MnO 2 . Subsequently, highly conductive (0.0848 S cm −1 ) gel-type supercapacitors are prepared by combining Co 0.2 -MnO 2 , potassium hydroxide (KOH), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) together. Co 0.2 -MnO 2 provides capacitive behavior and strengthens the hydrogen bonds between molecules. KOH acts as an ion crosslinker to enhance hydrogen bond and as electrolyte to transport ions. 5 wt% Co 0.2 -MnO 2 @KOH/PVA has superb mechanical endurance, appreciable electrical conductivity, and ideal capacitive behavior. The quasi-solid-state supercapacitor demonstrates stabilized longevity (86.5% at 0.2 mA cm −3 after 500 cycles), which can greatly promote the integration of flexible energy storage fabric devices.},

Here, it is shown for the first time that Raman spectroscopy is an efficient tool to characterize the adsorption capacity and selectivity of translucent functionalized porous materials at high pressures, whereby translucence is the precondition to study mass transport inside of a material. As a proof of function, the performance of three silica ionogels to separate an equimolar (hydrogen + carbon dioxide) gas mixture is determined by both accurate gravimetric sorption measurements and Raman spectroscopy, with the observed consistency establishing the latter as a novel measurement technique for the determination of adsorption capacity. These results encourage the use of the spectroscopic approach as a rapid screening method for translucent porous materials, particularly since only very small amounts of sample are required.},

The volume and occupancy data of the emulsions are then used to infer the nucleic acid concentration based on the Poisson distribution. deep-dLAMP can accurately predict the sizes and occupancy status of each emulsion and provide accurate measurements of nucleic acid concentrations with a limit of detection of 5.6 copies µl -1 and a dynamic range of 37.2 to 11000 copies µl -1 . In addition, deep-dLAMP shows robust performance under various parameters, such as the vortexing time and image qualities. Leveraging the state-of-the-art deep learning models, deep-dLAMP represents a significant advancement in digital nucleic acid tests by significantly reducing the instrument cost. We envision deep-dLAMP would be readily adopted by biomedical laboratories and be developed into a point-of-care digital nucleic acid test system.},

Simultaneous detection of multiple stimuli in a single self-powered device is desired to simplify artificial somatosensory systems. Here, inspired by the structure and function of human skin, an ultrasensitive self-powered multimodal sensor is demonstrated based on an interlocked ferroelectric copolymer microstructure. The triboelectric and pyroelectric effects of ferroelectric microstructures enable the simultaneous detection of mechanical and thermal stimuli in a spacer-free single device, overcoming the drawbacks of conventional devices, including complex fabrication, structural complexity, and high-power consumption. Furthermore, the interlocked microstructure induces electric field localization during ferroelectric polarization, leading to enhanced output performance. The multimodal tactile sensor provides ultrasensitive pressure and temperature detection capability (2.2 V kPa −1 , 0.27 nA °C −1 ) over a broad range (0.1–98 kPa, −20 °C &lt; Δ T &lt; 30 °C). Furthermore, multiple simultaneous stimuli can be distinguished based on different response times of triboelectric and pyroelectric effects. The remarkable performance of this sensor enables real-time monitoring of pulse pressure, acoustic wave detection, surface texture analysis, and profiling of multiple stimuli.},

In this work, a volatile solid additive-assisted sequential deposition (SD) strategy is reported to regulate the molecular order and phase separation in solid state. The OSC adopts polymer donor D18-Cl and acceptor N3 as active layer, as well as 1,4-diiodobenzene (DIB) as volatile additive. Compared to the D18-Cl:N3 (one-time deposition of mixture) and D18-Cl/N3 (SD) platforms, the D18-Cl/N3(DIB) device based on DIB-assisted SD method exhibits a finer phase separation with greatly enhanced molecular crystallinity. The optimal morphology delivers superior charge transport and extraction, offering a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.42% with significantly enhanced short-circuit current density ( J sc ) of 27.18 mA cm −2 and fill factor of 78.8%. This is one of the best performances in binary SD OSCs to date. Angle-dependent grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering technique effectively reveals the vertical phase separation and molecular crystallinity of the active layer. This work demonstrates the combination of volatile solid additive and sequential deposition is an effective method to develop high-performance OSCs.},

The photoluminescent PNs are encapsulated in angle-independent PhC microspheres to impart them with binary optical signals as coding information. Through the multimask superposition approach, PNs-integrated PhC microspheres with different codes are placed into fluorosilane-treated PDMS substrate to form different arrays. These arrays could converge moisture on PhC microspheres in wet environment, which avoids the ions loss of the PNs and effectively prevented mutual contamination. In addition, the fluorescence of the PNs inside PhC microspheres could reversibly quench or recover in response to the environmental moisture. Based on these features, it is demonstrated that the PNs-integrated PhC microsphere arrays could realize various information encryption modes, which indicate their excellent values in information security fields.},

  abstract     = {The chemical transformation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has been considered as a promising strategy to utilize and further upgrade it to value-added chemicals, aiming at alleviating global warming. In this regard, sustainable driving forces (i.e., electricity and sunlight) have been introduced to convert CO 2 into various chemical feedstocks. Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can generate carbonaceous molecules (e.g., formate, CO, hydrocarbons, and alcohols) via multiple-electron transfer. With the assistance of extra light energy, photoelectrocatalysis effectively improve the kinetics of CO 2 conversion, which not only decreases the overpotentials for CO 2 RR but also enhances the lifespan of photo-induced carriers for the consecutive catalytic process. Recently, rational-designed catalysts and advanced characterization techniques have emerged in these fields, which make CO 2 -to-chemicals conversion in a clean and highly-efficient manner.

  abstract     = {Potassium ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have attracted considerable interest due to their low cost, competitive power/energy densities, and ultra-long lifespan. However, the more sluggish insertion kinetics of battery-type anodes than capacitor-type cathodes in PIHCs seriously limits their practical application. Therefore, developing advanced anodes with high capacitor and suitable K + intercalation is imperative and significant. A novel core–shell structure of Ni  Co oxide/Ni  Co oxyphosphide (NCOP) nanowires are designed and constructed in this study via efficient and facile strategy. Combining the merits of the core–shell structure and the massive active sites in the oxyphosphide layer, the as-prepared NCOP composites manifest highly reversible capacitors and outstanding rate capability. Meanwhile, the insertion and conversion potassium storage mechanisms of the NCOP are successfully revealed through in situ X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations, respectively. Furthermore, the PIHC was assembled with NCOP anode and borocarbonitride cathode, which displays a large energy density and high-power density, along with an exceptional capacity retention of ≈90% over 10 000 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 . This work provides the anion regulation strategy for modifying the transition metal oxide and constructing the advancing electrode materials for next-generation energy storage and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Antimony selenide (Sb 2 Se 3 ) is an ideal photovoltaic candidate profiting from its advantageous material characteristics and superior optoelectronic properties, and has gained considerable development in recent years. However, the further device efficiency breakthrough is largely plagued by severe open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) deficit under the existence of multiple defect states and detrimental recombination loss. In this work, an effective absorber layer growth engineering involved with vapor transport deposition and post-selenization is developed to grow Sb 2 Se 3 thin films. High-quality Sb 2 Se 3 with large compact crystal grains, benign [hk1] growth orientation, stoichiometric chemical composition, and suitable direct bandgap are successfully fulfilled under an optimized post-selenization scenario. Planar Sb 2 Se 3 thin-film solar cells with substrate configuration of Mo/Sb 2 Se 3 /CdS/ITO/Ag are constructed. By contrast, such engineering effort can remarkably mitigate the device V OC deficit, owing to the healed detrimental defects, the suppressed interface and space-charge region recombination, the prolonged carrier lifetime, and the enhanced charge transport. Accordingly, a minimum V OC deficit of 0.647 V contributes to a record V OC of 0.513 V, a champion device with highly interesting efficiency of 7.40% is also comparable to those state-of-the-art Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells, paving a bright avenue to broaden its scope of photovoltaic applications.},

Electrocatalysts are indispensable elements for large-scale water electrolysis, which can efficiently accelerate electrochemical reactions occurring at both ends. Benefitting from high specific surface area, well-defined void space, and tunable chemical compositions, hollow nanostructures can be applied as promising candidates of direct electrocatalysts or supports for loading internal or external electrocatalysts. Herein, some recent progress in the structural design of micro-/nanostructured hollow materials as advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting is summarized. First, the design principles and corresponding strategies toward highly effective hollow electrocatalysts for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions are highlighted. Afterward, an overview of current reports about hollow electrocatalysts with diverse architectural designs and functionalities is given, including direct hollow electrocatalysts with single-shelled, multi-shelled, or open features and heterostructured electrocatalysts based on hollow hosts.

  abstract     = {The distorted lead iodide octahedra of all-inorganic perovskite based on triple halide-mixed CsPb(I 2.85 Br 0.149 Cl 0.001 ) framework have made a tremendous breakthrough in its black phase stability and photovoltaic efficiency. However, their performance still suffers from severe ion migration, trap-induced nonradiative recombination, and black phase instability due to lower tolerance factor and high total energy. Here, a combinational passivation strategy to suppress ion migration and reduce traps both on the surface and in the bulk of the CsPhTh 3 perovskite film is developed, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) to as high as 19.37%. The involvement of guanidinium (GA) into the CsPhTh 3 perovskite bulk film and glycocyamine (GCA) passivation on the perovskite surface and grain boundary synergistically enlarge the tolerance factor and suppress the trap state density. In addition, the acetate anion as a nucleating agent significantly improves the thermodynamic stability of GA-doped CsPbTh 3 film through the slight distortion of PbI 6 octahedra. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a high fill factor of 82.1% and open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.17 V. Furthermore, bare CsPbTh 3 perovskite solar cells without any encapsulation retain 80% of its initial PCE value after being stored for one month under ambient conditions.},

  abstract     = {A self-powered artificial mechanoreceptor module is demonstrated with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a pressure sensor with sustainable energy harvesting and a biristor as a neuron. By mimicking a biological mechanoreceptor, it simultaneously detects the pressure and encodes spike signals to act as an input neuron of a spiking neural network (SNN). A self-powered neuromorphic tactile system composed of artificial mechanoreceptor modules with an energy harvester can greatly reduce the power consumption compared to the conventional tactile system based on von Neumann computing, as the artificial mechanoreceptor module itself does not demand an external energy source and information is transmitted with spikes in a SNN. In addition, the system can detect low pressures near 3 kPa due to the high output range of the TENG. It therefore can be advantageously applied to robotics, prosthetics, and medical and healthcare devices, which demand low energy consumption and low-pressure detection levels. For practical applications of the neuromorphic tactile system, classification of handwritten digits is demonstrated with a software-based simulation. Furthermore, a fully hardware-based breath-monitoring system is implemented using artificial mechanoreceptor modules capable of detecting wind pressure of exhalation in the case of pulmonary respiration and bending pressure in the case of abdominal breathing.},

The preparation of stable Cu catalysts supported by SiO 2 with strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) has thus aroused great interest due to the high abundance, low toxicity, feasible processability, and low cost of SiO 2 . The challenge in the construction of such SMSI remains to be the inertness of SiO 2 . Herein, a simple and scalable method is developed to prepare 2D silica (2DSiO 2 ) supported Cu catalysts with SMSI by carefully manipulating the topological exfoliation of CaSi 2 with CuCl 2 and thereafter calcination. The prepared Cu-2DSiO 2 catalysts with the unique encapsulated Cu nanoparticles exhibit excellent activity and long-term stability in high-temperature CO 2 hydrogenation reactions. This feasible and low-cost solution for stabilizing Cu catalysts might shed light on their realistic applications.},

Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop Ir catalysts with nanostructures that reduce Ir consumption by maximizing the surface-to-volume ratio without limiting the mass transport of reactants and products of reactions. Ir OER catalysts on a template that consisted of porous nanotubes (PNTs) based on Ni are fabricated. The Ir/Ni PNTs offer multiple benefits, including high catalytic performance (potential of 1.500 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at an operating current density of 10 mA cm −2 and Tafel slope of 44.34 mV decade −1 ), minimal use of Ir (mass activity of 3273 A g −1 at 1.53 V vs RHE), and facile mass transport through the NT-sidewall pores (stable operation for more than 10 h). The Ir/Ni PNTs are also applied to a tandem device, consisting of a Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 -based photocathode and halide perovskite photovoltaic cell, for unassisted water splitting. A solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency that exceeded 10% is also demonstrated, which is nearly 1% point greater than when a planar Ir film is used as the anode instead of Ir/Ni PNTs.},

However, the commercialization of Li metal anodes (LMAs) is significantly compromised by non-uniform Li deposition and inferior electrolyte–anode interfaces, particularly at high currents and capacities. Herein, a hierarchical three-dimentional structure with CoSe 2 -nanoparticle-anchored nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflake arrays is developed on a carbon fiber cloth (CoSe 2 –NC@CFC) to regulate the Li nucleation/plating process and stabilize the electrolyte–anode interface. Owing to the enhanced lithiophilicity endowed by CoSe 2 –NC, in situ-formed Li 2 Se and Co nanoparticles during initial Li nucleation, and large void space, CoSe 2 –NC@CFC can induce homogeneous Li nucleation/plating, optimize the solid electrolyte interface, and mitigate volume change. Consequently, the CoSe 2 –NC@CFC can accommodate Li with a high areal capacity of up to 40 mAh cm –2 . Moreover, the Li/CoSe 2 –NC@CFC anodes possess outstanding cycling stability and lifespan in symmetric cells, particularly under ultrahigh currents and capacities (1600 h at 10 mA cm −2 /10 mAh cm −2 and 5 mA cm −2 /20 mAh cm −2 ).

  abstract     = {It has been previously shown that (never in mitosis gene A)-related kinase 2 ( NEK2 ) is upregulated in multiple myeloma (MM) and contributes to drug resistance. However, the mechanisms behind this upregulation remain poorly understood. In this study, it is found that amplification of NEK2 and hypermethylation of distal CpG islands in its promoter correlate strongly with increased NEK2 expression. Patients with NEK2 amplification have a poor rate of survival and often exhibit TP53 deletion, which is an independent prognostic factor in MM. This combination of TP53 knockout and NEK2 overexpression induces asymmetric mitosis, proliferation, drug resistance, and tumorigenic behaviors in MM in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, delivery of wild type p53 and suppression of NEK2 in TP53 −/− MM cell lines inhibit tumor formation and enhance the effect of Bortezomib against MM. It is also discovered that inactivating p53 elevates NEK2 expression genetically by inducing NEK2 amplification, transcriptionally by increased activity of cell cycle-related genes like E2F8 and epigenetically by upregulating DNA methyltransferases. Dual defects of TP53 and NEK2 may define patients with the poorest outcomes in MM with p53 inactivation, and NEK2 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in aggressive MM with p53 abnormalities.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale screening of molecules heavily relies on phenotyping of small living organisms during preclinical development. However, deep profiling candidate therapeutics on whole animals typically requires laborious manipulations and anesthetic treatment using traditional techniques or automated tools. Here, a novel fish capsule system that combines automated zebrafish encapsulating technology and droplet microarray strategy for in vivo functional screening of mono/polytherapies is described. This platform enables automated, rapid zebrafish orientation and immobilization in agarose to generate large-scale fish capsules by using a microfluidic device. Based on the effect of discontinuous dewetting, the prompt trapping of fish capsules in the aqueous arrays is successfully demonstrate. This system provides the capability to integrate pharmaceutical treatments with real-time multispectral microscopic imaging in a simple, pipetting-free and highly parallel manner. Coupling with machine learning algorithms, a small library of compounds is screened and analyzed, and clues about how to exploit compound combinations as therapeutic candidates are obtained. It is believed that this proposed strategy can be readily applied to multiple fields and is especially useful in the exploration of combinatorial drugs with limited amounts of samples and resources to accelerate the identification of novel therapeutics for precision medicines.},

  abstract     = {Acquisition, processing, and manipulation of biological signals require transistor circuits capable of ion to electron conversion. However, use of this class of transistors in integrated sensors or circuits is limited due to difficulty in patterning biocompatible electrolytes for independent operation of transistors. It is hypothesized that it would be possible to eliminate the need for electrolyte patterning by enabling directional ion conduction as a property of the material serving as electrolyte. Here, the anisotropic ion conductor (AIC) is developed as a soft, biocompatible composite material comprised of ion-conducting particles and an insulating polymer. AIC displays strongly anisotropic ion conduction with vertical conduction comparable to isotropic electrolytes over extended time periods. AIC allows effective hydration of conducting polymers to establish volumetric capacitance, which is critical for the operation of electrochemical transistors. AIC enables dense patterning of transistors with minimal leakage using simple solution-based deposition techniques. Lastly, AIC can be utilized as a dry, anisotropic interface with human skin that is capable of non-invasive acquisition of individual motor action potentials. The properties of AIC position it to enable implementation of a wide range of large-scale organic bioelectronics and enhance their translation to human health applications.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic acoustic wavefront control is essential for many acoustic applications, including biomedical imaging and particle manipulation. Conventional methods are either static or in the case of phased transducer arrays are limited to a few elements and hence limited control. Here, a dynamic acoustic wavefront control method based on light patterns that locally trigger the generation of microbubbles is introduced. As a small gas bubble can effectively stop ultrasound transmission in a liquid, the optical images are used to drive a short electrolysis and form microbubble patterns. The generation of microbubbles is controlled by structured light projection at a low intensity of 65 mW cm –2 and only requires about 100 ms. The bubble pattern is thus able to modify the wavefront of acoustic waves from a single transducer. The method is employed to realize an acoustic projector that can generate various acoustic images and patterns, including multiple foci and acoustic phase gradients. Hydrophone scans show that the acoustic field after the modulation by the microbubble pattern forms according to the prediction. It is believed that combining a versatile optical projector to realize an ultrasound projector is a general scheme, which can benefit a multitude of applications based on dynamic acoustic fields.},

Here, a special group of Tregs that potentially inhibit abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) progression are identified and functionally characterized. Aortic Tregs gradually increase during the process of AAA and are mainly recruited from peripheral circulation. Single-cell TCR sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing demonstrate their unique phenotype and highly expressed trefoil factor 1 (Tff1). Foxp3 cre/cre Tff1 flox/flox mice are used to clarify the role of Tff1 in AAA, suggesting that aortic Tregs secrete Tff1 to regulate smooth muscle cell (SMC) survival. In vitro experiments confirm that Tff1 inhibits SMC apoptosis through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway. The findings reveal a tissue-specific phenotype and function of aortic Tregs and may provide a promising and novel approach for the prevention of AAA.},

However, the efficacy has not been well anticipated, partly due to the lack of microvascular system that supplies nutrients and oxygen. Here, spheroids of early vascular cells (EVCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), rather than single-cell forms, as transplant “seeds” for reconstructing microvascular networks, are proposed. Firstly, EVCs containing CD34 + vascular progenitor cells are identified, which effectively differentiate into endothelial cells in situ and form vascular networks in extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel. Secondly, cardiac microtissues and cardiac patches with well-organized microvasculature are fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) co-culture or bioprinting with EVCs and cardiomyocytes in hydrogel. Notably, in 3D-bioprinted myocardial models, self-assembly vascularization of EVC spheroids is found to be significantly superior to EVC single cells. EVC spheroids are also injected into ischemic region of MI mouse models to explore its therapeutic potential. These findings uncover hESCs-derived EVC spheroids rather than single cells are more accessible for complex vasculature engineering, which is of great potential for cardiac tissue vascular engineering and MI treatment by cell therapy.},

Amino acid metabolism regulates immune responses and cancer; however, a druggable amino acid metabolite to enhance antitumor immunosurveillance and improve leukemia targeting-therapy efficacy remains unexplored. Here, an L -phenylalanine polymer, Metabolic Reprogramming Immunosurveillance Activation Nanomedicine (MRIAN), is invented to effectively target bone marrow (BM) and activate the immune surveillance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) by inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in T-ALL murine model. Stable-isotope tracer and in vivo drug distribution experiments show that T-ALL cells and MDSCs have enhanced cellular uptake of L -phenylalanine and MRIANs than normal hematopoietic cells and progenitors. Therefore, MRIAN assembled Doxorubicin (MRIAN-Dox) specifically targets T-ALL cells and MDSCs but spare normal hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with enhanced leukemic elimination efficiency. Consequently, MRIAN-Dox has reduced cardiotoxicity and myeloablation side effects in treating T-ALL mice. Mechanistically, MRIAN degrades into L -phenylalanine, which inhibits PKM2 activity and reduces ROS levels in MDSCs to disturb their immunosuppressive function and increase their differentiation toward normal myeloid cells. Overall, a novel amino acid metabolite nanomedicine is invented to treat T-ALL through the combination of leukemic cell targeting and immunosurveillance stimulation.},

Existing on-chip super-resolution methods exclusively focus on either fluorescent or nonfluorescent imaging, and, as such, there is an urgent requirement for a more general technique that is capable of both modes of imaging. In this study, to realize labeled and label-free super-resolution imaging on a single scalable photonic chip, a universal super-resolution imaging method based on the tunable virtual-wavevector spatial frequency shift (TVSFS) principle is introduced. Using this principle, imaging resolution can be improved more than threefold over the diffraction limit of a linear optical system. Here, diffractive units are fabricated on the chip&#39;s surface to provide wavevector-variable evanescent wave illumination, enabling tunable spatial frequency shifts in the Fourier space. A large FOV and resolutions of λ /4.7 and λ /7.1 were achieved for label-free and fluorescently labeled samples using a gallium phosphide (GaP) chip. With its large FOV, compatibility with different imaging modes, and monolithic integration, the proposed TVSFS chip may advance fields such as cell engineering, precision industry inspection, and chemical research.},

However, dysfunction of T cells, including exhaustion, is an inevitable obstacle for persistent curative effects. Here, the authors initially found that calcium signaling is hyperactivated via sustained tonic signaling in CAR-T cells. Next, it is revealed that the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) inhibitor BTP-2, but not the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, markedly diminishes CAR-T cell exhaustion and terminal differentiation of CAR-T cells in both tonic signaling and tumor antigen exposure models. Furthermore, BTP-2 pretreated CAR-T cells show improved antitumor potency and prolonged survival in vivo. Mechanistically, transcriptome and metabolite analyses reveal that treatment with BTP-2 significantly downregulate SOCE-calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and glycolysis pathways. Together, the results indicate that modulating the SOCE-calcineurin-NFAT pathway in CAR-T cells renders them resistant to exhaustion, thereby yielding CAR products with enhanced antitumor potency.},

However, their real applications are limited by their photo-detecting wavelength ranges, which are restricted by their fundamental optical bandgaps. Recently, intercalation has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy to modulate the optical bandgaps of 2D semiconductors. Here, the authors report the self-driven oxygen (O 2 ) intercalation induced bandgap reduction from 1.75 to 1.19 eV in gallium telluride (GaTe) in air. This bandgap shrinkage provides the long-wavelength detection threshold above ≈1100 nm for O 2 intercalated GaTe (referred to as GaTe  O 2 ), well beyond the cut-off wavelength at ≈708 nm for pristine GaTe. The GaTe  O 2 photodetectors have a high photoresponsivity, and highly anisotropic photodetection behavior to even sub-waveband radiation. The dichroic ratio ( I max /I min ) of photocurrent is about 1.39 and 2.9 for 600 nm and 1100 nm, respectively. This findings demonstrates a broadband photodetector utilizing GaTe after breaking through its bandgap limitation by self-driven O 2 intercalation in air and further reveal its photoconductivity anisotropic nature. This provides design strategies of 2D materials-based high-performance broadband photodetectors for the exploration of polarized state information.},

Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that PI3KC2 α synthetizes a pool of PI(3,4)P2 at focal adhesions that lowers their stability and directs breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. PI(3,4)P2 locally produced by PI3KC2 α at focal adhesions recruits the Ras GTPase activating protein 3 (RASA3), which inactivates R-RAS, leading to increased focal adhesion turnover, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Proof-of-concept is eventually provided that inhibiting PI3KC2 α or lowering RASA3 activity at focal adhesions significantly reduces the metastatic burden in PI3KC2 α -overexpressing breast cancer, thereby suggesting a novel strategy for anti-breast cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the most abundant cell types in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies observed complicated “cross-talks” between cancer cells and macrophages in TME. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly elucidated. Here, PD-L1 levels are very low in CRC cells but highly abundant in TAMs, and a specific PD-L1 + CD206 + macrophage subpopulation are identified, which is induced by tumor cells and associated with a poor prognosis. Mechanistic investigations reveal that CRC cells can secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) taken up by macrophages that induce M2 like polarization and PD-L1 expression, resulting in increased PD-L1 + CD206 + macrophage abundance and decreased T cell activity in CRC TME. sEV-derived miR-21-5p and miR-200a are identified as key signaling molecules mediating the regulatory effects of CRC on macrophages. Further studies reveal that CRC-derived miR-21-5p and miR-200a synergistically induces macrophage M2 like polarization and PD-L1 expression by regulating the PTEN/AKT and SCOS1/STAT1 pathways, resulting in decreased CD8 + T cell activity and increased tumor growth. This study suggests that inhibiting the secretion of specific sEV-miRNAs from CRC and targeting PD-L1 in TAMs may serve as novel methods for CRC treatment as well as a sensitization method for anti-PD-L1 therapy in CRC.},

  abstract     = {Photobleaching is the permanent loss of fluorescence after extended exposure to light and is a major limiting factor in super-resolution microscopy (SRM) that restricts spatiotemporal resolution and observation time. Strategies for preventing or overcoming photobleaching in SRM are reviewed developing new probes and chemical environments. Photostabilization strategies are introduced first, which are borrowed from conventional fluorescence microscopy, that are employed in SRM. SRM-specific strategies are then highlighted that exploit the on–off transitions of fluorescence, which is the key mechanism for achieving super-resolution, which are becoming new routes to address photobleaching in SRM. Off states can serve as a shelter from excitation by light or an exit to release a damaged probe and replace it with a fresh one. Such efforts in overcoming the photobleaching limits are anticipated to enhance resolution to molecular scales and to extend the observation time to physiological lifespans.},

  abstract     = {Eliminating primary tumor (“roots”) and inhibiting associated-circulating tumor cells (associated-CTCs, “seeds”) are vital issues that need to be urgently addressed in cancer therapy. Associated-CTCs, which include single CTCs, CTC clusters, and CTC–neutrophil clusters, are essential executors in metastasis and the cause of metastasis-related death in cancer patients. Herein, a “roots and seeds” multipoint costriking nanodevice (GV-Lipo/sorafenib (SF)/digitoxin (DT)) is developed to eliminate primary tumors and inhibit the spread of associated-CTCs for enhancing metastasis inhibition and the therapeutic effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). GV-Lipo/SF/DT eliminates primary tumor cells by the action of SF, thus reducing CTC production at the roots and improving the therapeutic effect on HCC. GV-Lipo/SF/DT inhibits associated-CTCs effectively via the enhanced identification and capture effects of glypican-3 and/or vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) targeting, dissociating CTC clusters using DT, blocking the formation of CTC–neutrophil clusters using anti-VCAM1 monoclonal antibody, and killing CTCs with SF. It is successfully verified that GV-Lipo/SF/DT increases the CTC elimination efficiency in vivo, thus effectively preventing metastasis, and shows enhanced antitumor efficacy in both an H22-bearing tumor model and orthotopic HCC models. Overall, the “roots and seeds” multipoint costriking strategy may open a new cancer treatment model for the clinic.},

  abstract     = {PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are abundantly expressed in heart. However, their functions and molecular mechanisms during myocardial infarction remain unknown. Here, a heart-apoptosis-associated piRNA (HAAPIR), which regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10)-mediated N4-acetylcytidine (ac 4 C) acetylation of transcription factor EC (Tfec) mRNA transcript, is identified. HAAPIR deletion attenuates ischemia/reperfusion induced myocardial infarction and ameliorate cardiac function compared to WT mice. Mechanistically, HAAPIR directly interacts with NAT10 and enhances ac 4 C acetylation of Tfec mRNA transcript, which increases Tfec expression. TFEC can further upregulate the transcription of BCL2-interacting killer (Bik), a pro-apoptotic factor, which results in the accumulation of Bik and progression of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The findings reveal that piRNA-mediated ac 4 C acetylation mechanism is involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. HAAPIR-NAT10-TFEC-BIK signaling axis can be potential target for the reduction of myocardial injury caused by cardiomyocyte apoptosis in ischemia heart diseases.},

Through pressureless crystallization from the designed aluminosilicate glasses, here broadband Near-infrared (NIR) emitting translucent ceramics are developed with high EQE (59.5%) and excellent thermal stability (&lt;10% intensity loss and negligible variation of emission profile at 150 °C) to serve as all-inorganic visible-to-NIR converters. A high-performance NIR phosphor-converted light emitting diodes is further demonstrated with a record NIR photoelectric efficiency (output power) of 21.2% (62.6 mW) at 100 mA and a luminescence saturation threshold up to 184 W cm −2 .

In comparison with the electron donor and acceptor materials progress, the development of cathode interlayers lags.

Herein, a hybrid cathode interlayer composed of PNDIT-F3N and PDIN is adopted to investigate the interaction between the photoexcited acceptor and cathode interlayer. The state of art acceptor Y6 is chosen and blended with PM6 as the active layer. The device with hybrid interlayer, PNDIT-F3N:PDIN (0.6:0.4, in wt%), attains a power conversion efficiency of 17.4%, outperforming devices with other cathode interlayer such as NDI-M, PDINO, and Phen-DPO. It is resulted from enhanced exciton dissociation, reduced trap-assisted recombination, and smaller transfer resistance. Therefore, the hybrid interlayer strategy is demonstrated as an efficient approach to improve device performance, shedding light on the selection and engineering of cathode interlayers for pairing the increasing number of fused ring electron acceptors.},

In situ XRP allows to follow textural changes of a dried gel Ni/Al 2 O 3 sample as a function of temperature during calcination, activation and CO 2 methanation reaction. Complementary PXCT studies on dried gel particles of Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 provide quantitative information on pore structure, size distribution, and shape with 3D spatial resolution approaching 50 nm, while identical particles are imaged ex situ before and after calcination. The X-ray imaging results are correlated with N 2 -sorption, Hg porosimetry and He pycnometry pore characterization. Hard X-ray nanotomography is highlighted to derive fine structural details including tortuosity, branching nodes, and closed pores, which are relevant in understanding transport phenomena during chemical reactions.

  abstract     = {The high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs) tend to choose the polymers with high molecular weight as donors, which easily produce good crystallinity to facilitate intermolecular charge transfer. However, these polymers usually accompanied by the low solubility and synthetic difficulty, increasing batch-to-batch variations. The proposal of conjugated mesopolymers (molar mass ( M n ) in 1–10 kDa) can overcome these problems. Herein, a new mesopolymer, MePBDFCl H as donor material is designed and synthesized, and firstly applied in OSCs. As a comparison, other lower molecular weight mesopolymer of MePBDFCl L and higher molecular weight polymer of PBDFCl with same structure are also prepared and investigated. Because of its appropriate phase separation and miscibility in the blend film, the MePBDFCl H exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.06% among the three materials. Meanwhile, the champion PCE is a new record for benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-based photovoltaic materials. Importantly, comparing to the pronounced PCE decrease of polymer PBDFCl by about 12%, a slightly PCE difference for mespolymer MePBDFCl L is only less than 5%, reducing the batch-to-batch variation. This work not only suggests that the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran unit is a promising electron-donating core but also shows that the mesopolymers have great potentials to produce the low-differentiated and high-performance organic photovoltaic materials.},

  abstract     = {The kinetic body motions have guided the core-shell fabrics of wearable bioelectronics to be elastoplastic. However, the polymeric electrodes follow the trade-off relationship between toughness and stretchability. To this end, the stress dissipation encoded silk fibroin electrode is proposed as the core electrode of wearable bioelectronics. Significantly, the high degree of intrinsic stress dissipation is realized via an amino acid crosslink. The canonical phenolic amino acid (i.e., tyrosine) of silk fibroin is engineered to bridge the secondary structures. A sufficient crosslink network is constructed when tyrosine is exposed near the amorphous strand. The stress dissipative tyrosine crosslink affords 12.5-fold increments of toughness (4.72 to 58.9 MJ m −3 ) and implements the elastoplastic silk fibroin. The harmony of elastoplastic core electrodes with shell fabrics enables the wearable bioelectronics to employ mechanical performance (elastoplasticity of 750 MJ m −3 ) and stable electrical response. The proposed wearable is capable of assisting the effective workouts via triboelectricity. In principle, active mobility with suggested wearables potentially relieves muscular fatigues and severe injuries during daily fitness.},

  abstract     = {The development of autonomous materials with desired performance and built-in visualizable sensing units is of great academic and industrial significance. Although a wide range of damage indication methods have been reported, the “turn-on” sensing mechanism by damaging events based on microcapsule systems, especially those relying on chemical reactions to elicit a chromogenic response, are still very limited. Herein, a facile and metal-free polymerization route with an interesting reaction-induced coloration effect is demonstrated. Under the catalysis of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), the polymerizations of difunctional or trifunctional activated alkynes proceed very quickly at 0 °C in air. A series of polymers composed of stereoregular enyne structure (major unit) and divinyl ether structure (minor unit) are obtained. Both the catalyst and monomers are colorless while the polymerized products are deep-colored. This process can be applied for the damage visualization of polymers using the microencapsulation technique. Microcapsules containing the reactive alkyne monomer are prepared and mixed in a DABCO-dispersed polymer film. Both the external and internal damage regions of this composite film can be readily visualized once the reaction is initiated from the ruptured microcapsules. Moreover, the newly formed polymer automatically seals the cracks with an additional protection function.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectrochemical devices integrate the processes of light absorption, charge separation, and catalysis for chemical synthesis. The monolithic design is interesting for space applications, where weight and volume constraints predominate. Hindered gas bubble desorption and the lack of macroconvection processes in reduced gravitation, however, limit its application in space. Physico-chemical modifications of the electrode surface are required to induce gas bubble desorption and ensure continuous device operation. A detailed investigation of the electrocatalyst nanostructure design for light-assisted hydrogen production in microgravity environment is described. p-InP coated with a rhodium (Rh) electrocatalyst layer fabricated by shadow nanosphere lithography is used as a model device. Rh is deposited via physical vapor deposition (PVD) or photoelectrodeposition through a mask of polystyrene (PS) particles. It is observed that the PS sphere size and electrocatalyst deposition technique alter the electrode surface wettability significantly, controlling hydrogen gas bubble detachment and photocurrent–voltage characteristics. The highest, most stable current density of 37.8 mA cm −2 is achieved by depositing Rh via PVD through 784 nm sized PS particles. The increased hydrophilicity of the photoelectrode results in small gas bubble contact angles and weak frictional forces at the solid–gas interface which cause enhanced gas bubble detachment and enhanced device efficiency.},

Natural haloperoxidases that utilize hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to catalytically convert halide into strong biocidal hypohalous acid hold great promise for thwarting biofouling, while their practical application remains highly questionable as instability of natural enzymes and inadequate H 2 O 2 . Herein a semiconducting nanozyme consisting of chromium single atoms coordinated on carbon nitride (Cr-SA-CN) that performs bifunctional roles of nonsacrificial H 2 O 2 photosynthesis and haloperoxidase-mimicking activity for antibiofouling is constructed. Such nanozyme is capable of generating H 2 O 2 from water and O 2 upon visible-light illumination, and then sustainably self-supplying H 2 O 2 for haloperoxidase-mimicking reaction in a sequential manner. This dual-activity Cr-SA-CN overcomes H 2 O 2 dilemma and yields hypobromous acid continuously, inducing remarkable bactericidal capability. When used as an eco-friendly coating additive, it is successfully demonstrated that Cr-SA-CN enables an inert surface against marine biofouling. Thereby, this study not only illustrates an attractive strategy for antibiofouling but also opens an avenue to construct valuable nanoplatform with multifunctionality for future applications.},

The prepared electrocatalyst of PtNDs@CoS 2 -NrGO is effectively used as anodic catalyst for alcohol oxidation in direct liquid alcohol fuel cells.

The electro-oxidation durability of PtNDs@CoS 2 -NrGO is investigated through cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry tests, which demonstrate excellent stability of the electrocatalyst toward various alcohols. Furthermore, the surface and adsorption energies of PtNDs and CoS 2 are calculated using density functional theory along with the detailed bonding analysis. Overall, the obtained results emphasize the advances in effective precious material utilization and fabricating techniques of active electrocatalysts for direct alcohol oxidation fuel cell applications.},

In addition to high power conversion efficiency, stability under various environmental stresses is crucial for the application of ultrathin OPVs. In this study, the authors realize highly air-stable and ultrathin (≈3 µm) OPVs that possess high efficiency (15.8%) and an outstanding power-per-weight ratio of 33.8 W g −1 . Dynamic secondary-ion mass spectrometry is used to identify Zn diffusion from the electron transport layer zinc oxide (ZnO) to the interface of photoactive layer; this diffusion results in the degradation of the ultrathin OPVs in air. The suppression of the Zn diffusion by a chelating strategy results in stable ultrathin OPVs that maintain 89.6% of their initial efficiency after storage for 1574 h in air at room temperature under dark conditions and 92.4% of their initial efficiency after annealing for 172 h at 85 °C in air under dark conditions. The lightweight and stable OPVs also possess excellent deformability with 87.3% retention of the initial performance after 5000 cycles of a compressing–stretching test with 33% compression.},

Knee osteoarthritis, one of the most common age-associated diseases, can be effectively treated via total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, patients are suffering from the recovery process due to inconvenience in post-hospital treatment. Here, a portable, modular, and wearable brace for self-assessment of TKA patients’ rehabilitation is reported. This system mainly consists of a force transducer for isometric muscle strength measurement and an active angle sensor for knee bending detection. Clinical experiments on TKA patients demonstrate the feasibility and significance of the system. Specifically, via brace-based personalized healthcare, the TKA patients’ rehabilitation process is quantified in terms of myodynamia, and a definite rehabilitation enhancement is obtained. Additionally, new indicators, that is, isometric muscle test score, for evaluating TKA rehabilitation are proposed. It is anticipated that, as the cloud database is employed and more rehabilitation data are collected in the near future, the brace system can not only facilitate rehabilitations of TKA patients, but also improve life quality for geriatric patients and open a new space for remote artificial intelligence medical engineering.},

Vertical PEDOT:PSS-based OECTs (vOECTs) further enhance signal amplification and device density but have not been characterized in biological applications. An electronic board with individually tuneable transistor biases overcomes fabrication induced heterogeneity in device metrics and allows quantitative biological experiments. Careful exploration of vOECT electric parameters defines voltage biases compatible with reliable transistor function in biological experiments and provides useful maximal transconductance values without influencing cellular signal generation or propagation. This permits successful application in monitoring micro-organs of prime importance in diabetes, the endocrine pancreatic islets, which are known for their far smaller signal amplitudes as compared to neurons or heart cells. Moreover, vOECTs capture their single-cell action potentials and multicellular slow potentials reflecting micro-organ organizations as well as their modulation by the physiological stimulator glucose. This opens the possibility to use OECTs in new biomedical fields well beyond their classical applications.},

Up to now, the most feasible way to achieve 2D single crystal growth is the epitaxy: growth of 2D materials of one or more specific orientations with single-crystal substrate. Only when the 2D domains have the same orientation, they can stitch together seamlessly and single-crystal 2D films can be obtained. In this view, four different epitaxy modes of 2D materials on various substrates are presented, including van der Waals epitaxy, edge epitaxy, step-guided epitaxy, and in-plane epitaxy focusing on the growth of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC). The lattice symmetry relation and the interaction between 2D materials and the substrate are the key factors determining the epitaxy behaviors and thus are systematically discussed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges about the epitaxy of 2D single crystals in the future are summarized.},

In this work, a series of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based block copolymers (BCPs) with different coil segments, including polystyrene, poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(2-vinylnaphthalene), and poly(butyl acrylate), are utilized in photosynaptic transistor to emulate paired-pulse facilitation, spike time/rate-dependent plasticity, short/long-term neuroplasticity, and learning−forgetting−relearning processes. P3HT serves as a carrier transport channel and a photogate, while the insulating coils with electrophilic groups are for charge trapping and preservation. Three main factors are unveiled to govern the properties of these P3HT-based BCPs: i) rigidity of the insulating coil, ii) energy levels between the constituent polymers, and iii) electrophilicity of the insulating coil. Accordingly, P3HT- b -P2VP-based photosynaptic transistor with a sought-after BCP combination demonstrates long-term memory behavior with current contrast up to 10 5 , short-term memory behavior with high paired-pulse facilitation ratio of 1.38, and an ultralow energy consumption of 0.56 fJ at an operating voltage of −0.0003 V.

TFAM is covalently fused to Listeria monocytogenes phospholipase C (PLC), an enzyme that lyses lipid membranes under acidic conditions, to enable endosomal escape and human vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1), which is intended to protect the DNA from cytoplasmic defense mechanisms. The TFAM/DNA complexes (TFAMoplexes) are stabilized by cysteine point mutations introduced rationally in the TFAM homodimerization site, resulting in particles, which show maximal activity when formed in 80% serum and transfect HeLa cells in vitro after 30 min of incubation under challenging cell culture conditions. The herein developed TFAM-based DNA scaffolds combine interesting characteristics in an easy-to-use system and can be readily expanded with further protein factors. This makes the TFAMoplex a promising tool in protein-based gene delivery.},

  abstract     = {Despite its importance for the establishment of a carbon-neutral society, the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to value-added products has not been commercialized yet because of its sluggish kinetics and low selectivity. The present work reports the fabrication of a low-crystalline trimetallic (AuCuIn) CO 2 electroreduction catalyst and demonstrates its high performance in a gaseous CO 2 electrolyzer. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO formation observed at a low overpotential in a half-cell test is ascribed to the controlled crystallinity and composition of this catalyst as well as to its faster charge transfer, downshifted d-band center, and low oxophilicity. The gaseous CO 2 electrolyzer with the optimal catalyst as the cathode exhibits superior cell performance with a high CO FE and production rate, outperforming state-of-the-art analogs. Thus, the obtained results pave the way to the commercialization of CO 2 electrolyzers and promote the establishment of a greener society.},

  abstract     = {Evolving cost-effective transition metal phosphides (TMPs) using general approaches for energy storage is pivotal but challenging. Besides, the absence of noble metals and high electrocatalytic activity of TMPs allow their applicability as catalysts in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, CoNiP‒CoP 2 (CNP‒CP) composite is in situ deposited on carbon fabric by a one-step hydrothermal technique. The CNP‒CP reveals hybrid nanoarchitecture (3D-on-1D HNA), i.e., cashew fruit-like nanostructures and nanocones. The CNP‒CP HNA electrode delivers higher areal capacity (82.8 μAh cm –2 ) than the other electrodes. Furthermore, a hybrid cell assembled with CNP‒CP HNA shows maximum energy and power densities of 31 μWh cm –2 and 10.9 mW cm –2 , respectively. Exclusively, the hybrid cell demonstrates remarkable durability over 30 000 cycles. In situ/operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis confirms the reversible changes in valency of Co and Ni elements in CNP‒CP material during real-time electrochemical reactions.  Besides, a quasi-solid-state device unveils its practicability by powering electronic components. Meanwhile, the CNP‒CP HNA verifies its higher OER activity than the other catalysts by revealing lower overpotential (230 mV). Also, it exhibits relatively small Tafel slope (38 mV dec –1 ) and stable OER activity over 24 h. This preparation strategy may initiate the design of advanced TMP-based materials for multifunctional applications.},

  abstract     = {Due to the aggregation-caused quenching effect and near-infrared I poor penetration capabilities of common fluorescent molecules, their applications in visualized imaging and photoactivated treatment are limited. Therefore, new near-infrared II (NIR-II) molecule (named TST), which had the abilities of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and photothermal therapy are synthesized. Moreover, in order to further improve its fluorescent yield and therapeutic effect, camptothecin prodrug (CPT-S-PEG) and novel immune checkpoint inhibitor AZD4635 are used to co-assemble with TST into nanoparticles for drug delivery. On account of the strong interaction of camptothecin and TST, the intramolecular rotation of TST is limited, thereby inhibiting non-radiation attenuation and promoting fluorescence generation when the nanoparticles are intact. As nanoparticles uptake by cancer cells, redox sensitive CPT-S-PEG is degraded and the nanoparticles disintegrate. The released TST enhances non-radiative attenuation and expedites photothermal conversion because of the removal of the constraint of camptothecin. Furthermore, photothermal therapy induces immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and releases abundant ATP into the tumor microenvironment to recruit immune cells. However, superfluous ATP is converted into immunosuppressive adenosine through the CD39-CD73-A2AR pathway. The AZD4635 released by photothermal disintegration of the nanoparticles just blocks this pathway timely, achieving favorable synergistic effect of photothermal therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Passive radiative cooling (RC) enables the cooling of objects below ambient temperature during daytime without consuming energy, promising to be a game changer in terms of energy savings and CO 2 reduction. However, so far most RC surfaces are obtained by energy-intensive nanofabrication processes or make use of unsustainable materials. These limitations are overcome by developing cellulose films with unprecedentedly low absorption of solar irradiance and strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) emittance. In particular, a cellulose-derivative (cellulose acetate) is exploited to produce porous scattering films of two different thicknesses, L ≈ 30 µm (thin) and L ≈ 300 µm (thick), making them adaptable to above and below-ambient cooling applications. The thin and thick films absorb only ≈ 5 % ${\approx}5\%$ of the solar irradiance, which represents a net cooling power gain of at least 17 W m −2 , compared to state-of-the-art cellulose-based radiative-cooling materials. Field tests show that the films can reach up to ≈5 °C below ambient temperature, when solar absorption and conductive/convective losses are minimized. Under dryer conditions (water column = 1 mm), it is estimated that the films can reach average minimum temperatures of ≈7–8 °C below the ambient. The work presents an alternative cellulose-based material for efficient radiative cooling that is simple to fabricate, cost-efficient and avoids the use of polluting materials.},

However, accurately identifying and rationally tuning the local structures in Cu-CeO 2 have remained challenging, especially for nanomaterials with inherent structural complexities involving surfaces, interfaces, and defects. Here, a nanocrystal-based atom-trapping strategy to access atomically precise Cu-CeO 2 nanostructures for enhanced catalysis is reported. Driven by the interfacial interactions between the presynthesized Cu and CeO 2 nanocrystals, Cu atoms migrate and redisperse onto the CeO 2 surface via a solid–solid route. This interfacial restructuring behavior facilitates tuning of the copper dispersion and the associated creation of surface oxygen defects on CeO 2 , which gives rise to enhanced activities and stabilities catalyzing water–gas shift reaction. Combining soft and solid-state chemistry of colloidal nanocrystals provide a well-defined platform to understand, elucidate, and harness metal–support interactions. The dynamic behavior of the supported metal species can be further exploited to realize exquisite control and rational design of multicomponent nanocatalysts.},

However, the conventional starvation approaches such as glucose oxidase (Gox)-induced glucose depletion and nanomedicine-enabled vascular embolism usually suffer from aggravated tumor hypoxia, systemic toxicity, and unpredictable metabolic syndrome. Herein, a novel “valve-closing” starvation strategy is developed to amplify the chemotherapy effects via closing the “valve” of glucose transported into tumor cells, which is accomplished by a glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1, valve of glucose uptake) inhibitor (Genistein, Gen) and chemotherapeutic agent (Curcumin, Cur) coloaded hybrid organosilica-micelles nanomedicine (designated as (Gen + Cur)@FOS) with controllable stability. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that (Gen + Cur)@FOS can effectively reduce glucose/adenosine triphosphate levels in tumor cells by inhibiting GLUT1 expression (i.e., “valve-closing”) to induce the starvation of tumor cells, thus weakening the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis caused by chemotherapy, and consequently contributing to the remarkably improved antitumor efficiency and minimized side effects based on the stress sensitization effect mediated by GLUT1 inhibition-induced starvation. This “valve-closing” starvation strategy provides a promising paradigm for the development of novel nanotherapeutics with amplified chemotherapy effect.},

Surface acoustic waves (SAW) (phonons) of 5–35 GHz frequency launched into the substrate cause the magnetizations of the nanomagnets to precess at the frequency of the wave, giving rise to confined spin-wave modes (magnons) within the nanomagnets. The spin waves, in turn, radiate electromagnetic waves (photons) into the surrounding space at the SAW frequency. Here, the phonons couple into magnons, which then couple into photons. This tripartite phonon-magnon-photon coupling is thus exploited to implement an extreme sub-wavelength electromagnetic antenna whose measured radiation efficiency and antenna gain exceed the approximate theoretical limits for traditional antennas of the same dimensions by more than two orders of magnitude at some frequencies. Micro-magnetic simulations are in excellent agreement with experimental observations and provide insight into the spin-wave modes that couple into radiating electromagnetic modes to implement the antenna.},

However, there is no effective clinical treatment for EC patients with diabetes (patient EC+/dia+ ). To explore new therapeutic targets, Ishikawa is cultured with high glucose (Ishikawa HG ) mimicking hyperglycemia in patient EC+/dia+ . Subsequently, it is discovered that Ishikawa HG exhibits glucose metabolic reprogramming characterized by increased glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. Further, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) is identified to promote glycolysis of Ishikawa HG by proteomics. Most importantly, JX06, a novel PDK1 inhibitor combined metformin (Met) significantly inhibits Ishikawa HG proliferation though Ishikawa HG is resistant to Met. Furthermore, a reduction-sensitive biodegradable polymer is adopted to encapsulate JX06 to form nanoparticles (JX06-NPs) for drug delivery. It is found that in vitro JX06-NPs have better inhibitory effect on the growth of Ishikawa HG as well as patient-derived EC cells (PDC) than JX06. Additionally, it is found that JX06-NPs can accumulate to the tumor of EC-bearing mouse with diabetes (mice EC+/dia+ ) after intravenous injection, and JX06-NPs combined Met can significantly inhibit tumor growth of mice EC+/dia+ . Taken together, the study demonstrates that the combination of JX06-NPs and Met can target the cancer metabolism plasticity, which significantly inhibits the growth of EC, thereby provides a new adjuvant therapy for patients EC+/dia+ .},

  abstract     = {The fundamental Boltzmann limitation dictates the ultimate limit of subthreshold swing (SS) to be 60 mV dec −1 , which prevents the continued scaling of supply voltage. With atomically thin body, 2D semiconductors provide new possibilities for advanced low-power electronics. Herein, ultra-steep-slope MoS 2 resistive-gate field-effect transistors (RG-FETs) by integrating atomic-scale-resistive filamentary with conventional MoS 2 transistors, demonstrating an ultra-low SS below 1 mV dec −1 at room temperature are reported. The abrupt resistance transition of the nanoscale-resistive filamentary ensures dramatic change in gate potential, and switches the device on and off, leading to ultra-steep SS. Simultaneously, RG-FETs demonstrate a high on/off ratio of 2.76 × 10 7 with superior reproducibility and reliability. With the ultra-steep SS, the RG-FETs can be readily employed to construct logic inverter with an ultra-high gain ≈2000, indicating exciting potential for future low-power electronics and monolithic integration.},

  abstract     = {Li metal is considered as one of the most promising candidates for constructing advanced high-energy energy storage due to its ultrahigh theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential. However, its practical commercialization is seriously hindered by the challenges of Li dendrite growth, low Coulombic efficiency, and huge volumetric variation. Herein, an efficient in situ generated Li 2 S-rich interface layer joint with preplanted Sb nano active sites in hosted Li metal anode is easily achieved with the nanosized Sb 2 S 3 decorated carbonaceous network. The yielded CC@Sb 2 S 3 @Li anode demonstrates uniform Li deposition, high Coulombic efficiency, and alleviated volumetric variation. Therefore, the Li symmetric cells show ultralong lifespan stable cycling over 3200 cycles with a very low voltage hysteresis (≈18 mV) at 5 mA cm −2 . Impressively, the Li|LiFePO 4 full cell delivers an exceptionally prolonged cycling over 180 cycles with a superior capacity retention as high as ≈90% even under the harsh condition of an extremely low negative to positive capacity ratio of ≈0.44 with lean electrolyte (4.4 µL mAh −1 ). Moreover, the Li|LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 full cell also maintains an excellent cycling performance under the more realistic harsh conditions. This work provides a new avenue and significant step paving the Li metal toward the practical application.},

WBC100 targets the nuclear localization signal 1 (NLS1)–Basic–nuclear localization signal 2 (NLS2) region of c-Myc and induces c-Myc protein degradation through ubiquitin E3 ligase CHIP mediated 26S proteasome pathway, leading to apoptosis of cancer cells. In vivo, WBC100 potently regresses multiple lethal c-Myc overexpressing tumors such as acute myeloid leukemia, pancreatic, and gastric cancers with good tolerability in multiple xenograft mouse models.

  abstract     = {DNA repair confers the resistance of tumor cells to DNA-damaging anticancer therapies, while how reprogrammed metabolism in tumor cells contributes to such process remains poorly understood. Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and regulates the last rate-limiting step of glycolysis. Here it is shown that the glycolytic metabolite pyruvate enhances DNA damage repair by facilitating chromatin loading of γ H2AX, thereby promoting the radiation resistance of glioma cells. Mechanistically, PKM2 is phosphorylated at serine (S) 222 upon DNA damage and interacts with FACT complex, a histone chaperone comprising SPT16 and SSRP1 subunit. The pyruvate produced by PKM2 directly binds to SSRP1, which increases the association of FACT complex with γ H2AX and subsequently facilitates FACT-mediated chromatin loading of γ H2AX, ultimately promoting DNA repair and tumor cell survival. Intriguingly, the supplementation of exogenous pyruvate can also sufficiently enhance FACT-mediated chromatin loading of γ H2AX and promotes tumor cell survival upon DNA damage. The levels of PKM2 S222 phosphorylation correlate with the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma. The finding demonstrates a novel mechanism by which PKM2-produced pyruvate promotes DNA repair by regulating γ H2AX loading to chromatin and establishes a critical role of this mechanism in glioblastoma radiation resistance.},

Fiber lasers are on the verge in the development of such sources, yet widespan spectral tunability of femtosecond pulses remains a pivotal challenge. Dispersive wave generation, also known as Cherenkov radiation, offers untapped potentials to serve these demands. In this work, the concept of quasi-phase matching for multi-order dispersive wave formation with record-high spectral fidelity and femtosecond durations is exploited in selected, partially conventionally unreachable spectral regions. Versatile patterned sputtering is utilized to realize height-modulated high-index nano-films on exposed fiber cores to alter fiber dispersion to an unprecedented degree through spatially localized, induced resonances. Nonlinear optical experiments and simulations, as well as phase-mismatching considerations based on an effective dispersion, confirm the conversion process and reveal unique emission features, such as almost power-independent wavelength stability and femtosecond duration. This resonance-empowered approach is applicable to both fiber and on-chip photonic systems and paves the way to instrumentalize dispersive wave generation as a unique tool for efficient, coherent femtosecond multi-frequency conversion for applications in areas such as bioanalytics, life science, quantum technology, or metrology.},

This study screens the expression profile of circRNAs in HCC and identifies circVAMP3 as a significantly downregulated circRNA in HCC tissues. HCC patients with low circVAMP3 expression present poor prognosis. circVAMP3 negatively regulates the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo by driving phase separation of CAPRIN1 and promoting stress granule formation in cells, which can downregulate the protein level of Myc proto-oncogene protein by inhibiting c-Myc translation. Furthermore, circVAMP3 is widely expressed in many human tissues and is downregulated in related cancers. Therefore, circVAMP3 is a potential prognostic indicator for HCC and may serve as a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.},

Recently, 2D polymer nanosheets, originated from the regular and periodic covalent connection of the building units in 2D plane, have emerged as promising candidates for preparing ultrafast and highly selective membranes owing to their inherently tunable and ordered pore structure, light weight, and high specific surface. In this review, the synthetic methodologies (including top–down and bottom–up methods) of 2D polymer nanosheets are first introduced, followed by the summary of 2D polymer nanosheets-based membrane fabrication as well as membrane applications in the fields of gas separation, water purification, organic solvent separation, and ion exchange/transport in fuel cells and lithium-sulfur batteries. Finally, based on their current achievements, the authors’ personal insights are put forward into the existing challenges and future research directions of 2D polymer nanosheets for membrane separation.

  abstract     = {Phase-change material (PCM) devices are one of the most mature nonvolatile memories. However, their high power consumption remains a bottleneck problem limiting the data storage density. One may drastically reduce the programming power by patterning the PCM volume down to nanometer scale, but that route incurs a stiff penalty from the tremendous cost associated with the complex nanofabrication protocols required. Instead, here a materials solution to resolve this dilemma is offered. The authors work with memory cells of conventional dimensions, but design/exploit a PCM alloy that decomposes into a heterogeneous network of nanoscale crystalline domains intermixed with amorphous ones. The idea is to confine the subsequent phase-change switching in the interface region of the crystalline nanodomain with its amorphous surrounding, forming/breaking “nano-bridges” that link up the crystalline domains into a conductive path. This conductive-bridge switching mechanism thus only involves nanometer-scale volume in programming, despite of the large areas in contact with the electrodes. The pore-like devices based on spontaneously phase-separated Ge 13 Sb 71 O 16 alloy enable a record-low programming energy, down to a few tens of femtojoule. The new PCM/fabrication is fully compatible with the current 3D integration technology, adding no expenses or difficulty in processing.},

Despite the high potential of nitric oxide (NO) in anti-cancer therapy owing to its biocompatibility and tumor cell-specific cytotoxicity, the poor stability and lack of target specificity of present NO donors and delivery systems have limited its clinical applications. Herein, a redox-triggered self-immolative NO prodrug that can be readily conjugated to various materials containing free thiol groups such as albumin, is reported. The prodrug and its conjugates demonstrate smart release of NO donor via intramolecular cyclization under reductive conditions, followed by spontaneously generating NO in physiological conditions. The albumin-prodrug conjugate inhibits tumor metastasis by inducing cytotoxicity preferentially on tumor cells after efficiently draining into lymph nodes. This novel prodrug can contribute to the development of on-demand NO delivery systems for anti-metastatic therapy and other treatments.},

Flora analysis and mass spectrometry (MS) and metabonomics combined tests demonstrate that the synergistic microbiota regulations can alter the abundance, diversity of intratumoral microbiome, and disrupt metabolic pathways of microbiome and tumor microenvironment, wherein the differential singling pathways and biosynthetic necessities or metabolites that can affect tumor progression are identified. As well, anti-TNF α is introduced to unite with bacterial regulation to synergistically mitigate bacterial-induced inflammation, which, along with the metabolism disruptions of intratumoral microbiota and tumor microenvironment, unfreezes tumor resistance and harvests significantly-intensified phototherapy-based anti-tumor outcomes against 4T1 and CT26 tumors. The clear underlying principles of microbiome-regulated tumorigenesis and the established microbiome metabolism regulation method provide distinctive insights into tumor therapy, and can be also extended to other gut microbiome-associated lesions interference.},

Herein, the authors designed an inflammation-triggered disassembly (ITD) nanoplatform by a supramolecular assembly method, which controls the decomposition and drug release through changes in cytokine concentrations and redox potentials during the onset of arthritis, and its dual-targeted synergistic effect on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats resulted in higher cell death rate and immunosuppressive rate. Meanwhile, they propose the local dynamic dependent imaging (LDDI) technology to diagnose the disease status, which may produce corresponding changes with the fluctuation of inflammatory activity and improve the accuracy of dual-target therapy by monitoring the synovial changes through in situ photoactivation of the second near infrared light (NIR-II). Very importantly, histological analysis shows that ITD strategy relieved joint destruction and cartilage degeneration and its clinical score is similar to that of the healthy group. Their work provides an effective strategy for the early diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic inflammation diseases, which can interfere to abnormal immune activation, rather than affecting the normal function of immune system.},

However, for such devices, significant gain and low dark currents are often mutually excluded since large operation voltages often induce high shot noise. Here, a fully vacuum-processed PM-OPD is demonstrated using trap-assisted electron injection in BDP-OMe:C 60 material system. By applying only −1 V, compared with the self-powered working condition, the responsivity is increased by one order of magnitude, resulting in an outstanding specific detectivity of ≈10 13 Jones. Remarkably, the superior detectivity in the near-infrared region is stable and almost voltage-independent up to −10 V. Compared with two photovoltaic-type photodetectors, these PM-OPDs exhibit the great potential to be easily integrated with state-of-the-art readout electronics in terms of their high responsivity, fast response speed, and bias-independent specific detectivity. The employed vacuum fabrication process and the easy-to-adapt PM-OPD concept enable seamless upscaling of production, paving the way to a commercially relevant photodetector technology.},

The porous structure of these substrates can not only improve device performance but also enable new functions, but due to their wide variety, choosing the right porous substrate is crucial for preparing high-performance electronics for specific applications. Herein, the properties of different flexible porous substrates are summarized and their basic principles of design, manufacture, and use are highlighted. Subsequently, various functionalization methods of these porous substrates are briefly introduced and compared.

Extracellular acidosis caused by metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is a reliable marker for tumor infiltrative regions.

Here, an intelligent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) navigation system delineating glioma acidic margins without administration of exogenous probes is reported. With assistance of this system, the metabolites at the tumor cutting edges can be nondestructively transferred within a water droplet to a SERS chip with pH sensitivity. Homemade deep learning model automatically processes the Raman spectra collected from the SERS chip and delineates the pH map of tumor resection bed with increased speed. Acidity correlated cancer cell density and proliferation level are demonstrated in tumor cutting edges of animal models and excised tissues from glioma patients. The overall survival of animal models post the SERS system guided surgery is significantly increased in comparison to the conventional strategy used in clinical practice. This SERS system holds the promise in accelerating clinical transition of acidic margin-guided surgery for solid tumors with infiltrative nature.},

  abstract     = {Acidified water electrolysis with fast kinetics is widely regarded as a promising option for producing H 2 . The main challenge of this technique is the difficulty in realizing sustainable H 2 production (SHP) because of the poor stability of most electrode catalysts, especially on the anode side, under strongly acidic and highly polarized electrochemical environments, which leads to surface corrosion and performance degradation. Research efforts focused on tuning the atomic/nano structures of catalysts have been made to address this stability issue, with only limited effectiveness because of inevitable catalyst degradation. A systems approach considering reaction types and system configurations/operations may provide innovative viewpoints and strategies for SHP, although these aspects have been overlooked thus far. This review provides an overview of acidified water electrolysis for systematic investigations of these aspects to achieve SHP. First, the fundamental principles of SHP are discussed. Then, recent advances on design of stable electrode materials are examined, and several new strategies for SHP are proposed, including fabrication of symmetrical heterogeneous electrolysis system and fluid homogeneous electrolysis system, as well as decoupling/hybrid-governed sustainability. Finally, remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities are outlined to stimulate endeavors toward the development of advanced acidified water electrolysis techniques for SHP.},

Herein, by directly etching Ni 3 S 2 nanosheets through potassium ferricyanide, a novel self-sacrificing template strategy is proposed to realize the in situ growth of NiFe-based Prussian blue analogs (NiFe PBA) on Ni 3 S 2 in an interfacial redox reaction. The well-designed Ni 3 S 2 @NiFe PBA composite as precursor displays a unique spherical magic cube architecture composed of nanocubes, which even maintains after a phosphating treatment to obtain the derived Ni 3 S 2 /Fe-NiP x on nickel foam. Specifically, in alkaline seawater, the Ni 3 S 2 /Fe-NiP x as OER precatalyst marvelously realizes the ultralow overpotentials of 336 and 351 mV at large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm –2 , respectively, with remarkable durability for over 225 h, outperforming most reported advanced OER electrocatalysts. Experimentally, a series of characterization results confirm the reconstruction behavior in the Ni 3 S 2 /Fe-NiP x surface, leading to the in situ formation of Ni(OH) 2 /Ni(Fe)OOH with abundant oxygen vacancies and grain boundaries, which constructs the Ni 3 S 2 /Fe-NiP x reconstruction system responsible for the remarkable OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculation results further verify the enhanced OER activity for Ni 3 S 2 /Fe-NiP x reconstruction system, and unveil that the Fe-Ni 2 P/FeOOH as active origin contributes to the central OER activity.},

  abstract     = {Zinc (Zn) metal anode has been widely evaluated in aqueous Zn batteries. Nevertheless, the dendrite formation issue and consecutive side reactions severely impede the practical applications of Zn metal at high current densities. Herein, it is reported that engineering the gel electrolyte with multifunctional charged groups by incorporating a zwitterionic gel poly(3-(1-vinyl-3-imidazolio) propanesulfonate) (PVIPS) can effectively address the abovementioned issues. The charged groups of sulfonate and imidazole in the gel electrolyte can texture the Zn 2+ nucleation and deposition plane to (002), which possesses a high activation energy to resist side reactions and induce uniform growth of Zn metal for a dendrite-free structure. In addition, the Zn 2+ solvation structure can be manipulated by the charged groups to further eliminate side reactions for high rate performance Zn batteries. Consequently, the polyzwitterionic gel electrolyte enables a stable cycling with a cumulative capacity of 3000 mA h cm −2 at high density of 7.5 mA cm −2 for the symmetrical Zn battery, and a long-term cycling life for more than 1000 cycles at 5 C of Zn/MnO 2 full battery. It is envisioned that the design of the gel electrolyte will provide promising feasibility on safe, flexible, and wearable energy storage devices.},

This method entails the compression of imine-based COF-aerogels, which undergo a morphological change from an elastic to plastic material. The COF-membranes fabricated upon compression show good performances for the separation of gas mixtures of industrial interest, N 2 /CO 2 and CH 4 /CO 2 .

  abstract     = {Magnesium–Sulfur batteries are one of most appealing options among the post-lithium battery systems due to its potentially high energy density, safe and sustainable electrode materials. The major practical challenges are originated from the soluble magnesium polysulfide intermediates and their shuttling between the electrodes, which cause high overpotentials, low sulfur utilization, and poor Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a functional Mo 6 S 8 modified separator is designed to effectively address these issues. Both the experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that the electrochemically active Mo 6 S 8 layer has a superior adsorption capability of polysulfides and simultaneously acts as a mediator to accelerate the polysulfide conversion kinetics. Remarkably, the magnesium–sulfur cell assembled with the functional separator delivers a high specific energy density (942.9 mA h g −1 in the 1st cycle) and can be cycled at 0.2 C for 200 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 96%. This work demonstrates a new design concept toward high-performance metal–sulfur batteries.},

Herein, the authors compare the stability of inverted PM6:NFA solar cells using ITIC, IT-4F, Y6, and N3 as the NFA, and a decay rate order of IT-4F &gt; Y6 ≈ N3 &gt; ITIC is measured. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that fluorine substitution weakens the C═C bond and enhances the interaction between NFA and ZnO, whereas the β -alkyl chains on the thiophene unit next to the C═C linker blocks the attacking of hydroxyl radicals onto the C═C bonds. Knowing this, the authors choose a bulky alkyl side chain containing molecule (named L8-BO) as the acceptor, which shows slower photo bleaching and performance decay rates. A combination of ZnO surface passivation with phenylethanethiol (PET) yields a high efficiency of 17% and an estimated long T 80 and T s 80 of 5140 and 6170 h, respectively. The results indicate functionalization of the β -position of the thiophene unit is an effective way to improve device stability of the NFA.},

So far there are no MOFs reported for NIR-II imaging in vivo due to their poor NIR-II emission efficiency. Herein, a strategy is proposed to prepare MOFs with strong NIR-II emission, by integrating NIR dye IR-3C and Ln 3+ (Ln = Yb, Nd, and Er) into a same framework. IR-3C with high photon-absorption ability harvests the excitation photons and transfers energy to Ln 3+ via a resonance energy transfer pathway, significantly enhancing the NIR-II emission of Ln 3+ . The as-obtained Er-BTC-IR exhibits excellent NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) emission efficiency in aqueous phase and good biocompatibility after surface modification, which provides advanced bioimaging performance in vivo. It is able to clearly delineate the vessels, spine, and lymph of mice, and also to differentiate the vessels with acute vascular inflammation. This strategy paves the way to the preparation of NIR-II emissive MOFs and will promote their bioapplication.},

By contrast, SUMOylation can eliminate viral infection by regulating host antiviral immune components.

Augmented fear is a defining characteristic of PTSD, and the amygdala is considered the main brain region to process fear. The mechanism by which the amygdala is involved in fear conditioning after TBI is still unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), transcriptional changes in cells in the amygdala after TBI are investigated. In total, 72 328 nuclei are obtained from the sham and TBI groups. 7 cell types, and analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reveals widespread transcriptional changes in each cell type after TBI are identified. In in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that Decorin (Dcn) expression in the excitatory neurons of the amygdala significantly increased after TBI, and Dcn knockout in the amygdala mitigates TBI-associated fear conditioning. Of note, this effect is caused by a Dcn-mediated decrease in the expression of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which affect the glutamate- γ -aminobutyric acid balance in the amygdala. Finally, the results suggest that Dcn functions by interacting with collagen VI α 3 (Col6a3). Consequently, the findings reveal transcriptional changes in different cell types of the amygdala after TBI and provide direct evidence that Dcn relieves fear conditioning by regulating PNNs.},

  abstract     = {Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare but the most malignant type of biliary tract tumor. It is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and conventional treatments are unsatisfactory. As a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (BTZ) exhibits excellent antitumor ability in GBC. However, the long-term treatment efficacy is limited by its resistance, poor stability, and high toxicity. Herein, BTZ-encapsulated pH-responsive copolymeric nanoparticles with estrone (ES-NP (BTZ; Ce6) ) for GBC-specific targeted therapy is reported. Due to the high estrogen receptor expression in GBC, ES-NP (BTZ; Ce6) can rapidly enter the cells and accumulate near the nucleus via ES-mediated endocytosis. Under acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) and 808 nm laser irradiation, BTZ is released and ROS is generated by Ce6 to destroy the “bounce-back” response pathway proteins, such as DDI2 and p97, which can effectively inhibit proteasomes and increase apoptosis. Compared to the traditional treatment using BTZ monotherapy, ES-NP (BTZ; Ce6) can significantly impede disease progression at lower BTZ concentrations and improve its resistance. Moreover, ES-NP (BTZ; Ce6) demonstrates similar antitumor abilities in patient-derived xenograft animal models and five other types of solid tumor cells, revealing its potential as a broad-spectrum antitumor formulation.},

Three endothelial-specific functions are assessed: in vivo quantification of adherent leukocytes after systemic injection of - G2 CNN AAV9 encoding 1) an artificial adhesion molecule (S1FG) in wildtype mice (day 10) or 2) anti-inflammatory Annexin A1 (Anxa1) in ApoE −/− mice (day 28). Moreover, 3) in Cas9-transgenic mice, blood pressure is monitored till day 56 after systemic application of G2 CNN AAV9-gRNAs, targeting exons 6–10 of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a vasodilatory enzyme. G2 CNN AAV9-Cre transduces microvascular endothelial cells in mTmG-mice or mTmG-pigs. Functionally, G2 CNN AAV9-S1FG mediates S1FG-leukocyte adhesion, whereas G2 CNN AAV9-Anxa1-application reduces long-term leukocyte recruitment. Moreover, blood pressure increases in Cas9-expressing mice subjected to G2 CNN AAV9-gRNA eNOS . Therefore, G2 CNN AAV9 may enable gene transfer in vascular and atherosclerosis models.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic microrobots can be miniaturized to a nanometric scale owing to their wireless actuation, thereby rendering them ideal for numerous biomedical applications. As a result, nowadays, there exist several mechano-electromagnetic systems for their actuation. However, magnetic actuation is not sufficient for implementation in biomedical applications, and further functionalities such as imaging and heating are required. This study proposes a multimodal electromagnetic system comprised of three pairs of Helmholtz coils, a pair of Maxwell coils, and a high-frequency solenoid to realize multimodal locomotion and heating control of magnetic microrobots. The system produces different configurations of magnetic fields that can generate magnetic forces and torques for the multimodal locomotion of magnetic microrobots, as well as generate magnetic traps that can control the locomotion of magnetic swarms. Furthermore, these magnetic fields are employed to control the magnetization of magnetic nanoparticles, affecting their magnetic relaxation mechanisms and diminishing their thermal properties. Thus, the system enables the control of the temperature increase of soft-magnetic materials and selective heating of magnetic microrobots at different positions, while suppressing the heating properties of magnetic nanoparticles located at undesired areas.},

Herein, a novel metallic sodium/sodium–tin alloy foil anode (Na/NaSn) with 3D interpenetrated network and porous structure is prepared through facile alloy reaction. The strong sodiophilic properties of sodium–tin alloy can lower the nucleation energy, resulting in smaller depositing potential and strong adsorption of Na + , while synergistic effect of porous skeleton and additional potential difference (≈0.1 V) between Na and Na–Sn alloy (Na 15 Sn 4 ) can alleviate volume expansion, redistribute the Na-ion flux and regulate electronic field, which favors and improves homogeneous Na deposition.

Previous studies show PICH deficiency-induced embryonic lethality in mice. However, the function of PICH that is required to suppress embryonic lethality in PICH-deficient mammals remains to be determined. Previous clinical studies suggest a link between PICH deficiency and the onset of acquired aplastic anemia. Here, using Pich knock-out (KO) mouse models, the authors provide evidence for a mechanistic link between PICH deficiency and defective hematopoiesis. Fetal livers from Pich -KO embryos exhibit a significantly elevated number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); however, these HSCs display a higher level of apoptosis and a much-reduced ability to reconstitute a functional hematopoietic system when transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Moreover, these HSCs show an elevated cytoplasmic dsDNA expression and an activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in excessive production of type I interferons (IFN). Importantly, deletion of Ifnar1 or cGAS reverses the defective hematopoiesis. The authors conclude that loss of PICH results in defective hematopoiesis via cGAS-STING-mediated type I IFN production.},

In this study, a cotton-yarn-based SAB (CYSAB) with a segmental structure is developed, in which carbon-black-modified, pristine yarn and Zn foil-wrapped segments are prepared to serve as the cathode, salt bridge, and anode, respectively. Upon electrolyte absorption, the CYSAB can be rapidly activated. Its performance is closely related to the ion concentration, infiltrated electrolyte volume, and evaporation rate. The CYSAB can tolerate repeated bending and washing without any significant influence on its power output. Moreover, the CYSABs can be woven into fabrics and connected in series and parallel configurations to produce an energy supplying headband, which can be activated by the sweat secreted from a volunteer during a cycling exercise to power light-emitting diode headlights. The developed CYSAB can also be integrated with yarn-based strain sensors to achieve a smart textile for the self-powered sensing of human motion and breathing. This weavable, washable, and scalable CYSAB is expected to contribute to the manufacturing of self-powered smart textiles for future applications in wearable healthcare monitoring.},

Herein, a unique strategy via Cu + doping to achieve efficient STE emission in the alloyed lead-free Cs 2 (Ag/Na)InCl 6 DPs is reported. A small amount (1.0 mol%) of Cu + doping results in boosted STE emission in the crystals, with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield increasing from 19.0% to 62.6% and excitation band shifting from 310 to 365 nm. Temperature-dependent PL and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopies reveal that the remarkable PL enhancement originates from the increased radiative recombination rate and density of STEs, as a result of symmetry breakdown of the STE wavefunction at the octahedral Ag + site. These findings provide deep insights into the STE dynamics in Cu + -doped Cs 2 (Ag/Na)InCl 6 , thereby laying a foundation for the future design of new lead-free DPs with efficient STE emission.},

  abstract     = {Few intravenously administered mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) engraft to the injured myocardium, thereby limiting their therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of ischemic heart injury. Here, it is found that irisin pretreatment increases the cardiac homing of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADSCs) administered by single and multiple intravenous injections to mice with MI/R by more than fivefold, which subsequently increases their antiapoptotic, proangiogenic, and antifibrotic effects in rats and mice that underwent MI/R. RNA sequencing, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway analysis, and loss-of-function studies identified CSF2RB as a cytokine receptor that facilitates the chemotaxis of irisin-treated ADSCs in the presence of CSF2, a chemokine that is significantly upregulated in the ischemic heart. Cardiac-specific CSF2 knockdown blocked the cardiac homing and cardioprotection abilities of intravenously injected irisin-treated ADSCs in mice subjected to MI/R. Moreover, irisin pretreatment reduced the apoptosis of hydrogen peroxide-induced ADSCs and increased the paracrine proangiogenic effect of ADSCs. ERK1/2-SOD2, and ERK1/2-ANGPTL4 are responsible for the antiapoptotic and paracrine angiogenic effects of irisin-treated ADSCs, respectively. Integrin α V/ β 5 is identified as the irisin receptor in ADSCs. These results provide compelling evidence that irisin pretreatment can be an effective means to optimize intravenously delivered MSCs as therapy for ischemic heart injury.},

Herein, the authors report a facile and effective approach to fabricate anisotropic polymer composites by biotemplate ceramization technology and subsequent vacuum impregnation of epoxy resin. The hierarchical microstructure of wood is perfectly replicated in the cellular biomass derived SiC (bioSiC) framework by carbothermal reduction. Owing to the anisotropic architecture of bioSiC, the epoxy composite with vertically aligned dense SiC microchannels shows interesting properties, including a high TC (10.27 W m −1 K −1 ), a significant enhancement efficiency (259 per 1 vol% loading), an outstanding anisotropic TC ratio (5.77), an extremely low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (12.23 ppm K −1 ), a high flexural strength (222 MPa), and an excellent flame resistance.

Here, it is shown that the simple infusion of a textured sphere with a smooth, slippery liquid layer can more easily create and sustain a stable gas cavity in a liquid at lower impact velocities compared to a dry solid sphere with the same contact angle. With a key parameter of curvature ratio, the early lamella dynamics during water entry of spheres and drops impact on planes are first unified. With the perspective of wetting transition, the unforeseen phenomenon of prone to cavity formation are successfully explained, which is the preferential lamella detachment from a slippery surface due to the higher viscosity of the lubricant relative to air.

  abstract     = {Despite the promise of tumor starvation therapies, they are often associated with nonspecific and incomplete energy blockade. Here, a novel paradigm of starvation therapy is proposed to synergize the “Zn 2+ interference”-mediated glycolysis inhibition and Zn 2+ -activating GLUT1 (Glucose transporter 1) tumor specific depletion for systematic energy exhaustion. It is discovered that ZIF-8 (zinc imidazolate metal–organic frameworks ) can induce abrupt intracellular Zn 2+ elevation preferentially in melanoma cells, and then achieve effective glycolysis blockade through “Zn 2+ interference”-triggered decrease of NAD + and inactivation of GAPDH, making it a powerful tumor energy nanoinhibitor. Meanwhile, Zn 2+ -activating DNAzymes for specifically cleaving GLUT1 mRNA is designed. This DNAzyme can only be activated under intracellular Zn 2+ overloading, and then directionally cut off glucose supply, which further restrains the adaptive up-regulation of glycolytic flux after glycolysis inhibition in tumors. Afterward, DNAzymes are loaded in ZIF-8 concurrently tethered by hyaluronic acid (HA), constructing a “nanoenabled energy interrupter ”. Such a rational design presents a preferential accumulation tendency to tumor sites due to the active CD44-targeting mechanisms, specifically achieves remarkable systematic energy exhaustion in melanoma cells, and affords 80.8% in tumor growth suppression without systemic toxicity in vivo. This work verifies a fascinating therapeutic platform enabling ion interference-inductive starvation strategy for effective tumor therapy.},

  abstract     = {Tyrosinase-mediated melanin synthesis is an essential biological process that can protect skin from UV radiation and radical species. This work reports on in situ biosynthesis of artificial melanin in native skin using photoactivatable tyrosinase (PaTy). The I41Y mutant of Streptomyces avermitilis tyrosinase (SaTy) shows enzymatic activity comparable to that of wild-type SaTy. This Y41 is replaced with photocleavable o -nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONBY) using the introduction of amber codon and ONBY-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs. The ONBY efficiently blocks the active site and tyrosinase activity is rapidly recovered by the photo-cleavage of ONBY. The activated PaTy successfully oxidizes L-tyrosine and tyramine-conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA_T) to synthesize melanin particles and hydrogel, respectively. To produce artificial melanin in living tissues, PaTy is encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles as an artificial melanosome. Using liposomes containing PaTy (PaTy_Lip), PaTy is transdermally delivered into ex vivo porcine skin and in vivo mouse skin tissues, thus achieving the in situ biosynthesis of artificial melanin for skin tissue protection under UV irradiation. The results of this study demonstrate that this biomimetic system can recapitulate the biosynthetic analogs of naturally occurring melanin. It should therefore be considered to be a promising strategy for producing protective biological molecules within living systems for tissue protection.},

  abstract     = {The retina, the most crucial unit of the human visual perception system, combines sensing with wavelength selectivity and signal preprocessing. Incorporating energy conversion into these superior neurobiological features to generate core visual signals directly from incoming light under various conditions is essential for artificial optoelectronic synapses to emulate biological processing in the real retina. Herein, self-powered optoelectronic synapses that can selectively detect and preprocess the ultraviolet (UV) light are presented, which benefit from high-quality organic asymmetric heterojunctions with ultrathin molecular semiconducting crystalline films, intrinsic heterogeneous interfaces, and typical photovoltaic properties. These devices exhibit diverse synaptic behaviors, such as excitatory postsynaptic current, paired-pulse facilitation, and high-pass filtering characteristics, which successfully reproduce the unique connectivity among sensory neurons. These zero-power optical-sensing synaptic operations further facilitate a demonstration of image sharpening. Additionally, the charge transfer at the heterojunction interface can be modulated by tuning the gate voltage to achieve multispectral sensing ranging from the UV to near-infrared region. Therefore, this work sheds new light on more advanced retinomorphic visual systems in the post-Moore era.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic foot ulcers infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria form a severe complication of diabetes. Antimicrobial-loaded hydrogels are used as a dressing for infected wounds, but the ongoing rise in the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections necessitates new, nonantibiotic based designs. Here, a guanosine-quadruplex (G 4 )-hydrogel composed of guanosine, 2-formylphenylboronic acid, and putrescine is designed and used as a cascade-reaction container. The G 4 -hydrogel is loaded with glucose-oxidase and hemin. The first cascade-reaction, initiated by glucose-oxidase, transforms glucose and O 2 into gluconic acid and H 2 O 2 . In vitro, this reaction is most influential on killing Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in suspension, but showed limited killing of bacteria in biofilm-modes of growth. The second cascade-reaction, however, transforming H 2 O 2 into reactive-oxygen-species (ROS), also enhances killing of biofilm bacteria due to hemin penetration into biofilms and interaction with eDNA G-quadruplexes in the biofilm matrix. Therewith, the second cascade-reaction generates ROS close to the target bacteria, facilitating killing despite the short life-time of ROS. Healing of infected wounds in diabetic mice proceeds faster upon coverage by these G 4 -hydrogels than by clinically common ciprofloxacin irrigation. Moreover, local glucose concentrations around infected wounds decrease. Concluding, a G 4 -hydrogel loaded with glucose-oxidase and hemin is a good candidate for infected wound dressings, particularly in diabetic patients.},

  abstract     = {Engineering of phonons, that is, collective lattice vibrations in crystals, is essential for manipulating physical properties of materials such as thermal transport, electron-phonon interaction, confinement of lattice vibration, and optical polarization. Most approaches to phonon-engineering have been largely limited to the high-quality heterostructures of III–V compound semiconductors. Yet, artificial engineering of phonons in a variety of materials with functional properties, such as complex oxides, will yield unprecedented applications of coherent tunable phonons in future quantum acoustic devices. In this study, artificial engineering of phonons in the atomic-scale SrRuO 3 /SrTiO 3 superlattices is demonstrated, wherein tunable phonon modes are observed via confocal Raman spectroscopy. In particular, the coherent superlattices led to the backfolding of acoustic phonon dispersion, resulting in zone-folded acoustic phonons in the THz frequency domain. The frequencies can be largely tuned from 1 to 2 THz via atomic-scale precision thickness control. In addition, a polar optical phonon originating from the local inversion symmetry breaking in the artificial oxide superlattices is observed, exhibiting emergent functionality. The approach of atomic-scale heterostructuring of complex oxides will vastly expand material systems for quantum acoustic devices, especially with the viability of functionality integration.},

  abstract     = {Netrin-1 is a chemotropic cue mediating axon growth and neural migration in neuronal development, and its receptors deletion in colorectal cancer and UNC5s act as dependence receptors regulating neuronal apoptosis. Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is an age-dependent protease that cuts human alpha-synuclein ( α -Syn) at N103 and triggers its aggregation and neurotoxicity. In the current study, it is reported that UNC5C receptor is cleaved by AEP in Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) and facilitates dopaminergic neuronal loss. UNC5C is truncated by active AEP in human α -SNCA transgenic mice in an age-dependent manner or induced by neurotoxin rotenone. Moreover, UNC5C is fragmented by AEP in PD brains, inversely correlated with reduced netrin-1 levels. Netrin-1 deprivation in primary cultures induces AEP and caspase-3 activation, triggering UNC5C proteolytic fragmentation and enhancing neuronal loss. Noticeably, blocking UNC5C cleavage by AEP attenuates netrin-1 deprivation-elicited neuronal death and motor disorders in netrin flox/flox mice. Overexpression of AEP-truncated UNC5C intracellular fragment strongly elicits α -Syn aggregation and dopaminergic loss, locomotor deficits in α -SNCA transgenic mice. Hence, the findings demonstrate that netrin-1 reduction and UNC5C truncation by AEP contribute to PD pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms cause chronic, antibiotic tolerant infections in wounds and lungs. Numerous recent studies demonstrate that bacteria can detect human communication compounds through specific sensor/receptor tools that modulate bacterial physiology. Consequently, interfering with these mechanisms offers an exciting opportunity to directly affect the infection process. It is shown that the human hormone Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (hANP) both prevents the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms and strongly disperses established P. aeruginosa biofilms. This hANP action is dose-dependent with a strong effect at low nanomolar concentrations and takes effect in 30–120 min. Furthermore, although hANP has no antimicrobial effect, it acts as an antibiotic adjuvant. hANP enhances the antibiofilm action of antibiotics with diverse modes of action, allowing almost full biofilm eradication. The hANP effect requires the presence of the P. aeruginosa sensor AmiC and the AmiR antiterminator regulator, indicating a specific mode of action. These data establish the activation of the ami pathway as a potential mechanism for P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersion. hANP appears to be devoid of toxicity, does not enhance bacterial pathogenicity, and acts synergistically with antibiotics. These data show that hANP is a promising powerful antibiofilm weapon against established P. aeruginosa biofilms in chronic infections.},

  abstract     = {Conventional antiplatelet agents indiscriminately inhibit both thrombosis and hemostasis, and the increased bleeding risk thus hampers their use at more aggressive dosages to achieve adequate effect. Blocking integrin α IIb β 3 outside-in signaling by separating the β 3/Src interaction, yet to be proven in vivo, may nonetheless resolve this dilemma. Identification of a specific druggable target for this strategy remains a fundamental challenge as Src SH3 is known to be responsible for binding to not only integrin β 3 but also the proteins containing the PXXP motif. In vitro and in vivo mutational analyses show that the residues, especially E97, in the RT loop of Src SH3 are critical for interacting with β 3. DCDBS84, a small molecule resulting from structure-based virtual screening, is structurally validated to be directed toward the projected target. It specifically disrupts β 3/Src interaction without affecting canonical PXXP binding and thus inhibits the outside-in signaling-regulated platelet functions. Treatment of mice with DCDBS84 causes a profound inhibition of thrombosis, equivalent to that induced by extremely high doses of α IIb β 3 antagonist, but does not compromise primary hemostasis. Specific targets are revealed for a preferential inhibition of thrombosis that may lead to new classes of potent antithrombotics without hemorrhagic side effects.},

  abstract     = {Smad4 , a key mediator of the transforming growth factor- β signaling, is mutated or deleted in 20% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancers and significantly affects cancer development. However, the effect of Smad4 loss on the immunogenicity and tumor immune microenvironment of PDAC is still unclear. Here, a surprising function of Smad4 in suppressing mouse PDAC tumor immunogenicity is identified. Although Smad4 deletion in tumor cells enhances proliferation in vitro, the in vivo growth of Smad4 -deficient PDAC tumor is significantly inhibited on immunocompetent C57BL/6 (B6) mice, but not on immunodeficient mice or CD8 + cell-depleted B6 mice. Mechanistically, Smad4 deficiency significantly increases tumor cell immunogenicity by promoting spontaneous DNA damage and stimulating STING-mediated type I interferon signaling,which contributes to the activation of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) and subsequent CD8 + T cells for tumor control. Furthermore, retarded tumor growth of Smad4-deficient PDAC cells on B6 mice is largely reversed when Sting is codeleted, or when the cells are implanted into interferon-alpha receptor-deficientmice or cDC1-deficientmice. Accordingly, Smad4 deficiency promotes PDAC immunogenicity by inducing tumor-intrinsic DNA damage-elicited type I interferon signaling.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) results from selective loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic (SNc DA) neurons, and is primarily caused by excessive activity-related Ca 2+ oscillations. Although L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers (CCBs) selectively inhibiting Ca v 1.3 are considered promising candidates for PD treatment, drug discovery is hampered by the lack of high-throughput screening technologies permitting isoform-specific assessment of Cav-antagonistic activities. Here, a synthetic-biology-inspired drug-discovery platform enables identification of PD-relevant drug candidates. By deflecting Cav-dependent activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)-signaling to repression of reporter gene translation, they engineered a cell-based assay where reporter gene expression is activated by putative CCBs. By using this platform in combination with in silico virtual screening and a trained deep-learning neural network, sclareol is identified from a essential oils library as a structurally distinctive compound that can be used for PD pharmacotherapy. In vitro studies, biochemical assays and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings confirmed that sclareol inhibits Ca v 1.3 more strongly than Ca v 1.2 and decreases firing responses of SNc DA neurons. In a mouse model of PD, sclareol treatment reduced DA neuronal loss and protected striatal network dynamics as well as motor performance. Thus, sclareol appears to be a promising drug candidate for neuroprotection in PD patients.},

Accumulative evidence has revealed the crucial role of transcellular transport route (entry into one cell, exocytosis, and re-entry into another) in this process. While NP endocytosis and subcellular transport are intensively characterized, the exocytosis and re-entry steps are poorly understood, which becomes a barrier for NP delivery into complex tissues. Here, the authors term the exocytosis and re-entry steps together as intercellular exchange. A collagen-based three-dimension assay is developed to specifically quantify the intercellular exchange of NPs, and distinguish the contributions of several potential mechanisms. The authors show that NPs can be exocytosed freely or enclosed inside extracellular vesicles (EVs) for re-entry, while direct cell–cell contact is hardly involved. EVs account for a significant fraction of NP intercellular exchange, and its importance in NP transport is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. While freely released NPs engage with the same receptors for re-entry, EV-enclosed ones bypass this dependence. These studies provide an easy and precise system to investigate the intercellular exchange stage of NP delivery, and shed the first light in the importance of EVs in NP transport between cells and into complex tissues.},

The underlying mechanisms between LC3 and macrophages are aimed to be investigated, and explore further ways to enhance immunotherapy in treating residual tumors. In mice models and patients, macrophages demonstrate increased infiltration into residual tumors, especially surrounding the ablated zone.

Herein, a 3D porous MoS 2 /MXene hybrid aerogel architecture with conformal heterogeneous interface has been built by atomic layer deposition (ALD) based on specific porous templates to optimize the microwave absorption (MA) performance comprehensively. The original porous structure of pristine Ti 3 C 2 T x aerogel used as templates can be preserved well during ALD fabrication, which prolongs the reflection and scattering path and ameliorates the dielectric loss. Meanwhile, plenty of heterointerfaces between MoS 2 and Ti 3 C 2 T x have been fabricated based on conformally ALD-deposited MoS 2 with controlled thickness on the porous surfaces of the templates, which can effectively optimize the impedance matching and transform its response to EM waves from shielding into absorbing. Moreover, the interaction between the attenuation capability and impedance matching can also be modulated by the number of ALD cycle in MoS 2 fabrication. After optimization, MoS 2 /MXene hybrid aerogel obtained under 300 ALD cycles shows a minimum reflection loss of −61.65 dB at the thickness of 4.53 mm. In addition, its preferable lightweight, high surface area, mechanical, and hydrophobicity properties will also be conducive to further practical applications.},

Traditional smart windows can only regulate solar transmission, while all the solar energy on the window is wasted. Here, for the first time, the authors demonstrate an energy saving and energy generation integrated smart window (ESEG smart window) in a simple way by combining louver structure solar cell, thermotropic hydrogel, and indium tin oxides (ITO) glass. The ESEG smart window can achieve excellent optical properties with ≈90% luminous transmission and ≈54% solar modulation, which endows excellent energy saving performance. The outstanding photoelectric conversion efficiency (18.24%) of silicon solar cells with louver structure gives the smart window excellent energy generation ability, which is more than 100% higher than previously reported energy generation smart window. In addition, the solar cell can provide electricity to for ITO glass to turn the transmittance of hydrogel actively, as well as the effect of antifreezing. This work offers an insight into the design and preparation together with a disruptive strategy of easy fabrication, good uniformity, and scalability, which opens a new avenue to realize energy storage, energy saving, active control, and antifreezing integration in one device.},

However, the carrier mobility of such materials is still beyond requirements due to limited π -conjugation. In this study, a series of new polyarylether-based COFs are rationally synthesized via a direct reaction between hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (electron acceptor) and octahydroxyphthalocyanine (electron donor). These COFs have typical crystalline layered structures, narrow band gaps as low as ≈0.65 eV and ultra-low resistance (1.31 × 10 −6 S cm −1 ). Such COFs can be composed of two different metal-sites and contribute improved carrier mobility via layer-altered staking mode according to density functional theory calculation. Due to the narrow pore size of 1.4 nm and promising conductivity, such COFs and electrochemically exfoliated graphene based free-standing films are fabricated for in-plane micro-supercapacitors, which demonstrate excellent volumetric capacitances (28.1 F cm −3 ) and excellent stability of 10 000 charge–discharge cycling in acidic electrolyte.

  abstract     = {The application of prestresses is a valuable strategy for enhancing the overall mechanical performances of structural materials. Residual stresses, acting as prestresses, exist naturally in biological structural materials, such as the nacre with the 3D “brick-and-mortar” arrangement. Although regulation of the tablets sliding has recently been demonstrated to be vital to improve toughness in synthetic nacre-like structures, the effects of prestresses on the tablets-sliding mechanism in these nacre-like structures remain unclear. Here, by a combination of simulation, additive manufacturing, and drop tower testing the authors reveal that, at a critical prestress, synergistic effects between the prestress-enhanced tablets sliding and prestress-weakened structural integrality result in optimized impact resistance of nacre-like structures. Furthermore, the prestressing strategy is easily implemented to a designed nacre-inspired separator to enhance the impact resistance of lithium batteries. The findings demonstrate that the prestressing strategy combined with bioinspired architectures can be exploited for enhancing the impact resistance of engineering structural materials and energy storage devices.},

However, the uncontrolled dendrite growth on Zn metal anodes and the side hydrogen evolution reaction, which has not yet been well considered, hinder the practical application of these batteries. Herein, a uniform and robust metallic Sb protective layer is designed based on the theoretic calculation and decorated on Zn plate via in situ replacement reaction. Compared with the bare Zn plate, the as-prepared Zn@Sb electrode provides abundant zincophilic sites for Zn nucleation, and homogenizes the electric field around the Zn anode surface, both of which promote the uniform Zn deposition to achieve a dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy (∆ G H ) calculation and in situ characterization demonstrate that hydrogen evolution reaction can be effectively suppressed by the Sb layer. Consequently, Sb-modified Zn anodes exhibit an ultralow voltage hysteresis of 34 mV and achieve excellent cycling stability over 1000 h with hydrogen- and dendrite-free behaviors. This work provides a facile and effective strategy to suppress both hydrogen evolution reaction and dendrite growth.},

  abstract     = {A key behavior observed during morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer invasion is that of collective and coordinated cellular motion. Hence, understanding the different aspects of such coordinated migration is fundamental for describing and treating cancer and other pathological defects. In general, individual cells exert forces on their environment in order to move, and collective motion is coordinated by cell–cell adhesion-based forces. However, this notion ignores other mechanisms that encourage cellular movement, such as pressure differences. Here, using model tumors, it is found that increased pressure drove coordinated cellular motion independent of cell–cell adhesion by triggering cell swelling in a soft extracellular matrix (ECM). In the resulting phenotype, a rapid burst-like stream of cervical cancer cells emerged from 3D aggregates embedded in soft collagen matrices (0.5 mg mL −1 ). This fluid-like pushing mechanism, recorded within 8 h after embedding, shows high cell velocities and super-diffusive motion. Because the swelling in this model system critically depends on integrin-mediated cell–ECM adhesions and cellular contractility, the swelling is likely triggered by unsustained mechanotransduction, providing new evidence that pressure-driven effects must be considered to more completely understand the mechanical forces involved in cell and tissue movement as well as invasion.},

This supramolecular system shows excellent photochromic properties, including extremely rapid response time, high conversion rate, and product-stereoselectivity, etc. More importantly, the kinetics of the photoreaction can be modulated by simply varying the host–guest ratios in aqueous or quasi-solid phase, providing the material with finely tunable time-dependent features, which cannot only be employed in data processing with more extended information, but also construct confidential materials by time-resolved multidimensional encryption and dynamic anticounterfeiting. The strategic design of kinetics-tunable supramolecular photochromic materials may provide valuable guidance for the development of more advanced materials for information security.},

  abstract     = {Genome-wide association studies have identified 3p21.1 as a robust risk locus for schizophrenia. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here a functional regulatory variant (rs2535629) is identified that disrupts CTCF binding at 3p21.1. It is confirmed that rs2535629 is also significantly associated with schizophrenia in Chinese population and the regulatory effect of rs2535629 is validated. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis indicates that rs2535629 is associated with the expression of three distal genes ( GLT8D1 , SFMBT1 , and NEK4 ) in the human brain, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing confirmed the regulatory effect of rs2535629 on GLT8D1 , SFMBT1 , and NEK4 . Interestingly, differential expression analysis of GLT8D1 , SFMBT1 , and NEK4 suggested that rs2535629 may confer schizophrenia risk by regulating SFMBT1 expression. It is further demonstrated that Sfmbt1 regulates neurodevelopment and dendritic spine density, two key pathological characteristics of schizophrenia. Transcriptome analysis also support the potential role of Sfmbt1 in schizophrenia pathogenesis. The study identifies rs2535629 as a plausibly causal regulatory variant at the 3p21.1 risk locus and demonstrates the regulatory mechanism and biological effect of this functional variant, indicating that this functional variant confers schizophrenia risk by altering CTCF binding and regulating expression of SFMBT1 , a distal gene which plays important roles in neurodevelopment and synaptic morphogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Inexpensive and efficient catalysts are crucial to industrial adoption of the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to produce hydrogen. Although two-dimensional (2D) MoS 2 materials have large specific surface areas, the catalytic efficiency is normally low. In this work, Ag and other dopants are plasma-implanted into MoS 2 to tailor the surface and interface to enhance the HER activity. The HER activty increases initially and then decreases with increasing dopant concentrations and implantation of Ag is observed to produce better results than Ti, Zr, Cr, N, and C. At a current density of 400 mA cm −2 , the overpotential of Ag500-MoS 2 @Ni 3 S 2 /NF is 150 mV and the Tafel slope is 41.7 mV dec −1 . First-principles calculation and experimental results reveal that Ag has higher hydrogen adsorption activity than the other dopants and the recovered S sites on the basal plane caused by plasma doping facilitate water splitting. In the two-electrode overall water splitting system with Ag500-MoS 2 @Ni 3 S 2 /NF, a small cell voltage of 1.47 V yields 10 mA cm −2 and very little degradation is observed after operation for 70 hours. The results reveal a flexible and controllable strategy to optimize the surface and interface of MoS 2 boding well for hydrogen production by commercial water splitting.},

  abstract     = {Y6 and its derivatives have greatly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Further developing high-performance Y6 derivative acceptor materials through the relationship between the chemical structures and properties of these materials will help accelerate the development of OPV. Here, machine learning and quantum chemistry are used to understand the structure–property relationships and develop new OPV acceptor materials. By encoding the molecules with an improved one-hot code, the trained machine learning model shows good predictive performance, and 22 new acceptors with predicted PCE values greater than 17% within the virtual chemical space are screened out. Trends associated with the discovered high-performing molecules suggest that Y6 derivatives with medium-length side chains have higher performance. Further quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the end acceptor units mainly affect the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and the electrostatic potential on molecular surface, which in turn influence the performance of OPV devices. A series of promising Y6 derivative candidates is screened out and a rational design guide for developing high-performance OPV acceptors is provided. The approach in this work can be extended to other material systems for rapid materials discovery and can provide a framework for designing novel and promising OPV materials.},

  abstract     = {Free-standing and foldable electrodes with high energy density and long lifespan have recently elicited attention on the development of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for flexible electronic devices. However, both low energy density and slow kinetics in cycling impede their practical applications. In this work, a free-standing and binder-free N, O-codoped 3D vertical graphene carbon nanofibers electrode with ultra-high silicon content (VGAs@Si@CNFs) is developed via electrospinning, subsequent thermal treatment, and chemical vapor deposition processes. The as-prepared VGAs@Si@CNFs electrode exhibits excellent conductivity and flexibility because of the high graphitized carbon nanofiber network and abundant vertical graphene arrays. Such 3D all-carbon architecture can be fabulous for providing a conductive and mechanically robust network, further improving the kinetics and restraining the volume expansion of Si NPs, especially with an ultra-high Si content (&gt;90 wt%). As a result, the VGAs@Si@CNFs composite demonstrates a superior specific capacity (3619.5 mAh g −1 at 0.05 A g −1 ), ultralong lifespan, and outstanding rate capability (1093.1 mAh g −1 after 1500 cycles at 8 A g −1 ) as a free-standing anode for LIBs. It is believed that this work offers an exciting method for developing free-standing and high-energy-density electrodes for other energy storage devices.},

  abstract     = {Exploration of optoelectronic memristors with the capability to combine sensing and processing functions is required to promote development of efficient neuromorphic vision. In this work, the authors develop a plasmonic optoelectronic memristor that relies on the effects of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and optical excitation in an Ag–TiO 2 nanocomposite film. Fully light-induced synaptic plasticity (e.g., potentiation and depression) under visible and ultraviolet light stimulations is demonstrated, which enables the functional combination of visual sensing and low-level image pre-processing (including contrast enhancement and noise reduction) in a single device. Furthermore, the light-gated and electrically-driven synaptic plasticity can be performed in the same device, in which the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning functions can be reversibly modulated by visible and ultraviolet light illuminations. Thereby, the high-level image processing function, i.e., image recognition, can also be performed in this memristor, whose recognition rate and accuracy are obviously enhanced as a result of image pre-processing and light-gated STDP enhancement. Experimental analysis shows that the memristive switching mechanism under optical stimulation can be attributed to the oxidation/reduction of Ag nanoparticles due to the effects of LSPR and optical excitation. The authors&#39; work proposes a new type of plasmonic optoelectronic memristor with fully light-modulated capability that may promote the future development of efficient neuromorphic vision.},

  abstract     = {The donor/acceptor interaction in non-fullerene organic photovoltaics leads to the mixing domain that dictates the morphology and electronic structure of the blended thin film. Initiative effort is paid to understand how these domain properties affect the device performances on high-efficiency PM6:Y6 blends. Different fullerenes acceptors are used to manipulate the feature of mixing domain. It is seen that a tight packing in the mixing region is critical, which could effectively enhance the hole transfer and lead to the enlarged and narrow electron density of state (DOS). As a result, short-circuit current ( J SC ) and fill factor (FF) are improved. The distribution of DOS and energy levels strongly influences open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). The raised filling state of electron Fermi level is seen to be key in determining device V OC . Energy disorder is found to be a key factor to energy loss, which is highly correlated with the intermolecular distance in the mixing region. A 17.53% efficiency is obtained for optimized ternary devices, which is the highest value for similar systems. The current results indicate that a delicate optimization of the mixing domain property is an effective route to improve the V OC , J SC , and FF simultaneously, which provides new guidelines for morphology control toward high-performance organic solar cells.},

Photothermal therapy (PTT) and antibacterial enzyme-based therapy are promising nonresistant strategies for efficiently killing drug-resistant bacteria. However, the poor thermostability of enzymes in PTT hinders their synergistic therapy. Herein, antibacterial glucose oxidase (GOx) is embedded in a Ag graphitic nanocapsule (Ag@G) arrayed silk film to fabricate a GOx-synergistic PTT system (named silk-GOx-Ag@G, SGA). The SGA system can stabilize GOx by a vitrification process through the restriction of hydrogen bond and rigid β -sheet, and keep the antibacterial activity in the hyperthermal PTT environment. Moreover, the arrayed Ag@G possesses excellent chemical stability due to the protection of graphitic shell, providing stable plasmonic effect for integrating PTT and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analysis even in the GOx-produced H 2 O 2 environment. With in situ SERS identification of bacterial intrinsic signals in the mouse wound model, such SGA realizes superior synergistic antibacterial effect on the infected Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in vivo, while without causing significant biotoxicity. This system provides a therapeutic method with low resistance and in situ diagnosis capability for efficiently eliminating bacteria.},

However, the difficulty in fabrication of ZrB 2 limits its industrial applications. In this study, fully dense and grain-refined ZrB 2 is prepared under ultra-high pressure of 15 GPa at low temperature of 1450 °C. The as-prepared ZrB 2 exhibits excellent mechanical and oxidation-resistant properties. Compared with raw powder, the grain size decreases 56%. Compared with high-temperature sintered control specimen beyond 2000 °C, the hardness and fracture toughness increase about 46% and 69%, respectively, the dislocation density increase 3 orders of magnitude, while the grain size considerably decrease 96%. According to work hardening, Hall–Petch and Taylor dislocation hardening effects, the refined grains, substructures, and high dislocation density caused by plastic deformation during sintering can enhance the mechanical properties. The unique structure contributes to a threshold oxidation temperature increase of ≈250 °C relative to the high-temperature sintered ZrB 2 , achieving one of the highest values (1100 °C) among the reported monolithic ultra-high temperature ceramics. A developed densification mechanism of dislocation multiplication with grain refining is proposed and proved to dominate the sintering, which is responsible for simultaneous improvements in mechanical and oxidation-resistant properties.},

  abstract     = {Implementing fast-charging lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is severely hindered by the issues of Li plating and poor rate capability for conventional graphite anode. Wadsley–Roth phase TiNb 2 O 7 is regarded as a promising anode candidate to satisfy the requirements of fast-charging LIBs. However, the unsatisfactory electrochemical kinetics resulting from sluggish ion and electron transfer still limit its wide applications. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed to synchronously improve the ion and electron transfer of TiNb 2 O 7 by incorporation of oxygen vacancy and N-doped graphene matrix (TNO − x @N-G), which is designed by combination of solution-combustion and electrostatic self-assembly approach. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Li + intercalation gives rise to the semi-metallic characteristics of lithiated phases (Li y TNO − x ), leading to the self-accelerated electron transport. Moreover, in situ X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements reveal the highly reversible structural evolution of the TNO − x @N-G during cycling. Consequently, the TNO − x @N-G delivers a higher reversible capacity of 199.0 mAh g −1 and a higher capacity retention of 86.5% than those of pristine TNO (155.8 mAh g −1 , 59.4%) at 10 C after 2000 cycles. Importantly, various electrochemical devices including lithium-ion full battery and hybrid lithium-ion capacitor by using the TNO − x @N-G anode exhibit excellent rate capability and cycling stability, verifying its potential in practical applications.},

The branched and hollow structure, as well as the heterointerface between CoSe 2 and CoNi LDH guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites.

Tremendous progress has been made in the past decade on the fabrication of MOF-based sensors with elevated sensitivity and selectivity toward various analytes due to their preconcentrating and molecule-sieving effects. Although several reviews have recently summarized different aspects of this field, a comprehensive review focusing on MOF-based gas sensors is absent. In this review, the latest advance of MOF-based gas sensors relying on different transduction mechanisms, for example, chemiresistive, capacitive/impedimetric, field-effect transistor or Kelvin probe-based, mass-sensitive, and optical ones are comprehensively summarized.

However, the radioresistance of tumor severely discounts the radiotherapy outcomes. Here, an innovative supramolecular radiotherapy strategy, based on the complexation of a hypoxia-responsive macrocycle with small-molecule radiosensitizer, is reported. To exemplify this tactic, a carboxylated azocalix[4]arene (CAC4A) is devised as molecular container to quantitatively package tumor sensitizer banoxantrone dihydrochloride (AQ4N) through reversible host–guest interaction. Benefited from the selective reduction of azo functional groups under hypoxic microenvironment, the supramolecular prodrug CAC4A•AQ4N exhibits high tumor accumulation and efficient cellular internalization, thereby significantly amplifying radiation-mediated tumor destruction without appreciable systemic toxicity. More importantly, this supramolecular radiotherapy strategy achieves an ultrahigh sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) value of 2.349, which is the supreme among currently reported noncovalent-based radiosensitization approach. Further development by applying different radiosensitizing drugs can make this supramolecular strategy become a general platform for boosting therapeutic effect in cancer radiotherapies, tremendously promising for clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {Fluorinated motifs are promising for the engineering of repellent coatings, however, a fundamental understanding of how to effectively bind these motifs to various substrates is required to improve their stability in different use scenarios. Herein, the binding of fluorinated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) using a cyanoacrylate glue (binder) is computationally and experimentally evaluated. The composite POSS–binder coatings display ultralow surface energy (≈10 mJ m −2 ), while still having large surface adhesions to substrates (300–400 nN), highlighting that super-repellent coatings (contact angles &gt;150°) can be readily generated with this composite approach. Importantly, the coatings show super-repellency to both corrosive liquids (e.g., 98 wt% H 2 SO 4 ) and ultralow surface tension liquids (e.g., alcohols), with ultralow roll-off angles (&lt;5°), and tunable resistance to liquid penetration. Additionally, these coatings demonstrate the potential in effective cargo loading and robust self-cleaning properties, where experimental datasets are correlated with both relevant theoretical predictions and systematic all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the repellent coatings. This work not only holds promise for chemical shielding, heat transfer, and liquid manipulations but offers a facile yet robust pathway for engineering advanced coatings by effectively combining components for their mutually desired properties.},

  abstract     = {Astrocytes play crucial and diverse roles in brain health and disease. The ability to selectively control astrocytes provides a valuable tool for understanding their function and has the therapeutic potential to correct dysfunction. Existing technologies such as optogenetics and chemogenetics require the introduction of foreign proteins, which adds a layer of complication and hinders their clinical translation. A novel technique, magnetomechanical stimulation (MMS), that enables remote and selective control of astrocytes without genetic modification is described here. MMS exploits the mechanosensitivity of astrocytes and triggers mechanogated Ca 2+ and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signaling by applying a magnetic field to antibody-functionalized magnetic particles that are targeted to astrocytes. Using purpose-built magnetic devices, the mechanosensory threshold of astrocytes is determined, a sub-micrometer particle for effective MMS is identified, the in vivo fate of the particles is established, and cardiovascular responses are induced in rats after particles are delivered to specific brainstem astrocytes. By eliminating the need for device implantation and genetic modification, MMS is a method for controlling astroglial activity with an improved prospect for clinical application than existing technologies.},

Herein, it is demonstrated that the local lithium ion concentration at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte exerts significant influence on the electrochemical performance of LMAs. The local ion concentration is multiplied by introducing pseudocapacitive nanocarbons (PNCs) containing numerous heteroatoms, because PNCs can store large numbers of lithium ions in a pseudocapacitive manner, and promote the formation of an electrochemical double layer. The high interfacial lithium ion concentration induces the formation of lithium-rich inorganic solid–electrolyte–interface layers with high ionic conductivities, and facilitates sustainable and stable supplies of lithium ion charge carriers on the overall active surfaces of the PNCs. Accordingly, the PNC-induced LMA exhibits high Coulombic efficiencies, high rate capabilities, and stable cycling performance.},

  abstract     = {Oxide semiconductors are key materials in many technologies from flat-panel displays，solar cells to transparent electronics. However, many potential applications are hindered by the lack of high mobility p-type oxide semiconductors due to the localized O-2p derived valence band (VB) structure. In this work, the VB structure modulation is reported for perovskite Ba 2 Bi M O 6 ( M = Bi, Nb, Ta) via the Bi 6s 2 lone pair state to achieve p-type oxide semiconductors with high hole mobility up to 21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , and optical bandgaps widely varying from 1.5 to 3.2 eV. Pulsed laser deposition is used to grow high quality epitaxial thin films. Synergistic combination of hard x-ray photoemission, x-ray absorption spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations are used to gain insight into the electronic structure of Ba 2 Bi M O 6 . The high mobility is attributed to the highly dispersive VB edges contributed from the strong coupling of Bi 6s with O 2p at the top of VB that lead to low hole effective masses (0.4–0.7 m e ). Large variation in bandgaps results from the change in the energy positions of unoccupied Bi 6s orbital or Nb/Ta d orbitals that form the bottom of conduction band. P–N junction diode constructed with p-type Ba 2 BiTaO 6 and n-type Nb doped SrTiO 3 exhibits high rectifying ratio of 1.3 × 10 4 at ±3 V, showing great potential in fabricating high-quality devices. This work provides deep insight into the electronic structure of Bi 3+ based perovskites and guides the development of new p-type oxide semiconductors.},

Herein, a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNC) that synergistically enhances tumor penetration and alleviates tumor hypoxia is reported for sonodynamic therapy of large solid tumors. SPNC comprises a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as a sonodynamic converter coated with a poly (ethylene glycol) corona. An oxygen-modulating enzyme, catalase, is efficiently conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles via the coupling reaction. Superior to its counterpart SPNCs (SPNC2 (84 nm) and SPNC3 (134 nm)), SPNC with the smallest size (SPNC1 (35 nm)) can efficiently penetrate throughout the tumor interstitium to alleviate whole tumor hypoxia in a large solid tumor model. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, SPNC1 can remotely generate sufficient singlet oxygen to eradicate tumor cells at a deep-tissue depth. Such a single treatment of SPNC1-medicated sonodynamic therapy effectively inhibits tumor growth in a large solid tumor mouse model. Therefore, this study provides a generalized strategy to synergistically overcome both poor penetration and hypoxia of large tumors for enhanced cancer treatment.},

  abstract     = {Various smart windows with dynamic modulation of the light transmittance have been developed rapidly in recent years. However, current design of the smart windows can only modulate the indoor solar irradiation instead of effectively utilize them. Here, a solar water-heating (SWH) smart window is proposed by the integration of the traditional electrochromic window and the water flow system, which can not only provide dynamic daylight modulation but also harvest the solar energy and store them by heating water. In the SWH window, the reversible metal electrodeposition (RME) not only provides daylight modulation but also provides metal layer working as a flat-plate solar collector for energy harvesting. Compared with traditional electrochromic windows, the SWH window with a water flow system can more effectively modulate the indoor temperature, owing to the significantly enhanced tunability of the thermal irradiation from the window. Compared with water-flow windows, the RME provide a metallic layer for efficient light harvesting, up to 42% solar energy can be effectively harvested and stored as hot water. Such an SWH smart window is promising to reduce the heating, lighting, and air conditioning energy consumption, which may bring new insights in the design of the next-generation green buildings.},

Herein phosphorene is sandwiched with self-assembled iron porphyrin monolayers on both sides (I-Phene) to significantly enhance stability. Iron porphyrin has strong interaction with phosphorene through formation of P  Fe bonds. The sandwich structure offers excellent stability of phosphorene by both-sided monolayer protections for an intact phosphorene structure more than 40 days under ambient conditions. Meanwhile, the electron transfer between iron porphyrin and phosphorene result in a high oxidation state of Fe, making I-Phene biomimetic sensitivity toward oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) for 2.5 and 4.0 times higher than phosphorene and iron-porphyrin alone, respectively. Moreover, I-Phene exhibits excellent selectivity, a wide detection range, and a low detection limit at a low oxidation potential of 0.82 V, which is comparable with the reported noble metal based biomimetic sensors while ranking the best among all non-noble biomimetic ones. I-Phene is further used for real-time monitoring NO released from cells.

However, several fundamental aspects of chiral spin texture phenomenology remain to be elucidated, including their domain wall (DW) structure, thermodynamic stability, and morphological transitions. Here the evolution of these textural characteristics are unveiled on a tunable multilayer platform—wherein chiral interactions governing spin texture energetics can be widely varied—using a combination of full-field electron and soft X-ray microscopies with numerical simulations. With increasing chiral interactions, the emergence of Néel helicity, followed by a marked reduction in domain compressibility, and finally a transformation in the skyrmion formation mechanism are demonstrated. Together with an analytical model, these experiments establish a comprehensive microscopic framework for investigating and tailoring chiral spin texture character in multilayer films.},

Herein, a stable artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is constructed on the MXene surface by using insulating g-C 3 N 4 layer to regulate homogeneous Li plating/stripping.

Thus, the Ti 3 C 2 T x /g-C 3 N 4 electrode enables conformal Li deposition, enhanced average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.4%, and longer cycle lifespan over 400 cycles with an areal capacity of 1.0 mAh cm −2 at 0.5 mA cm −2 . Full cells paired with LiFePO 4 (LFP) cathode also achieve enhanced rate capacity and cycling stability with higher capacity retention of 85.5% after 320 cycles at 0.5C.

After being coated on the etched tooth enamel, these LCPSs facilitate the growth of HAP to generate new enamel layers comparable to the natural layers and mitigate the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans .

  abstract     = {Recently, three-terminal synaptic devices, which separate read and write terminals, have attracted significant attention because they enable nondestructive read-out and parallel-access for updating synaptic weights. However, owing to their structural features, it is difficult to address the relatively high device density compared with two-terminal synaptic devices. In this study, a vertical synaptic device featuring remotely controllable weight updates via e-field-dependent movement of mobile ions in the ion-gel layer is developed. This synaptic device successfully demonstrates all essential synaptic characteristics, such as excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic current (E/IPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and long-term potentiation/depression (LTP/D) by electrical measurements, and exhibits competitive LTP/D characteristics with a dynamic range ( G max / G min ) of 31.3, and asymmetry (AS) of 8.56. The stability of the LTP/D characteristics is also verified through repeated measurements over 50 cycles; the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of G max / G min and AS are calculated as 1.65% and 0.25%, respectively. These excellent synaptic properties enable a recognition rate of ≈99% in the training and inference tasks for acoustic and emotional information patterns. This study is expected to be an important foundation for the realization of future parallel computing networks for energy-efficient and high-speed data processing.},

  abstract     = {Microplastics are an emergent yet critical issue for the environment because of high degradation resistance and bioaccumulation. Unfortunately, the current technologies to remove, recycle, or degrade microplastics are insufficient for complete elimination. In addition, the fragmentation and degradation of mismanaged plastic wastes in environment have recently been identified as a significant source of microplastics. Thus, the developments of effective microplastics removal methods, as well as, plastics recycling strategies are crucial to build a microplastics-free environment. Herein, this review comprehensively summarizes the current technologies for eliminating microplastics from the environment and highlights two key aspects to achieve this goal: 1) Catalytic degradation of microplastics into environmentally friendly organics (carbon dioxide and water); 2) catalytic recycling and upcycling plastic wastes into monomers, fuels, and valorized chemicals. The mechanisms, catalysts, feasibility, and challenges of these methods are also discussed. Novel catalytic methods such as, photocatalysis, advanced oxidation process, and biotechnology are promising and eco-friendly candidates to transform microplastics and plastic wastes into environmentally benign and valuable products. In the future, more effort is encouraged to develop eco-friendly methods for the catalytic conversion of plastics into valuable products with high efficiency, high product selectivity, and low cost under mild conditions.},

Here, a naturally anion-selective composite membrane is reported, that is, NiAl-Layered double hydroxide (LDH) coated anodic aluminum oxide (LDH@AAO), using a simple precipitant-free in situ growth technique. Positively charged LDH plates growing in channels of AAO function as screening layers for anions. Both experiments and theoretical simulations are enforced to certify the vital role of LDH growth in ion distribution and salinity gradient energy conversion. The composite membrane achieves high output performance and long-term stability. Furthermore, novel applications of nanofluidic channels are explored in hydroponic production and design a real-time detecting system based on LDH@AAO composite membranes for nutrient solution.

  abstract     = {N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) mRNA modification represents the most widespread form of internal modifications in eukaryotic mRNAs. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , those known methyltransferases mainly deposit m 6 A at their target transcripts near the stop codon or in the 3′ untranslated region. Here, it is reported that FIONA1 (FIO1), a human METTL16 ortholog, acts as a hitherto unknown m 6 A methyltransferase that determines m 6 A modifications at over 2000 Arabidopsis transcripts predominantly in the coding region. Mutants of FIO1 show a decrease in global m 6 A mRNA methylation levels and an early-flowering phenotype. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reveals that FIO1 is required for establishing appropriate levels of m 6 A preferentially in the coding sequences of a subset of protein-coding transcripts, which is associated with changes in transcript abundance and alternative polyadenylation. It is further demonstrated that FIO1-mediated m 6 A methylation determines the mRNA abundance of a central flowering integrator SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 ( SOC1 ) and its upstream regulators, thus preventing premature flowering. The findings reveal that FIO1 acts as a unique m 6 A methyltransferase that mainly modifies the coding regions of transcripts, which underlies the key developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in plants.},

In this paper, a magnetophoretic device consisting of a trampoline micromagnet and active elements that enable the control of individual selective jumping motion and positioning of a micro-object is proposed. Based on a numerical simulation under various conditions, automatic separation or selective clustering of micro-objects according to their sizes is performed by parallel control and programmable manipulation. This method provides efficient control of the physical variables of cells and grouping of cells with the desired size and number, which can be a milestone for a better understanding of the intercellular dynamics between clustered cells at the single-cell level for future cell-on-chip applications.},

Here, bladder-resident ILCs are comprehensively explored and identified their unique phenotypic and developmental characteristics. Notably, bladder-resident ILCs rapidly respond to uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection. It is found that ILC3 is necessary for early protection against UPEC infection in the bladder. Mechanistically, UPEC infection leads to interleukin (IL)-1 β production in the bladder via a MyD88-dependent pathway, which promotes ILC3 activation. ILC3-expressed IL-17A further recruits neutrophils and controls UPEC infection in the bladder. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for bladder ILCs in the host defense against UPEC infection.},

Nevertheless, development of effective devitalization strategies that preserves extracellular matrix (ECM) is still challenging. The aim of this study is to investigate EBR induced by devitalized, soft callus-mimetic spheroids. To challenge the translatability of this approach, the constructs are generated using an allogeneic cell source. Neo-bone formation is evaluated in an immunocompetent rat model, subcutaneously and in a critical size femur defect. Living spheroids are used as controls. Also, the effect of spheroid maturation towards hypertrophy is evaluated. The devitalization procedure successfully induces cell death without affecting ECM composition or bioactivity. In vivo, a larger amount of neo-bone formation is observed for the devitalized chondrogenic group both ectopically and orthotopically. In the femur defect, accelerated bone regeneration is observed in the devitalized chondrogenic group, where defect bridging is observed 4 weeks post-implantation. The authors&#39; results show, for the first time, a dramatic increase in the rate of bone formation induced by devitalized soft callus-mimetics. These findings pave the way for the development of a new generation of allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” products for EBR, which are suitable for the treatment of every patient.},

Using the BRE-AB sensor, the ultrasensitive detection of luteinizing hormone (LH) with the detection limit of 10 × 10 −12 m is demonstrated. Molecular Dynamics simulations are utilized to explore the binding mechanism of aptamer and target LH. Moreover, it is confirmed that the BRE-AB sensor has excellent sensing performance in whole blood and undiluted plasma. Using the BRE-AB sensor, the LH concentrations in 40 clinical samples are successfully quantified and it is found that LH is higher expressed in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the sensor enables simple, low-cost, and easy to regenerate and reuse, indicating potentially applicable for point-of-care biological macromolecules diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is directly related to the risk of breast cancer (BC) occurrence and worsened BC prognosis. Currently, there are no specific treatments for diabetes-associated BC. This paper aims to understand the fundamental mechanisms of diabetes-induced BC progression and to develop personalized treatments. It reports a metabolic reprogramming strategy (MRS) that pharmaceutical induction of glucose import and glycolysis with metformin and NF- κ B inhibitor (NF- κ Bi) while blocking the export of excessive lactate via inhibiting monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) leads to a metabolic crisis within the cancer cells. It demonstrates that the MRS shifts the metabolism of BC cells toward higher production of lactate, blocks lactate secretion, prompts intracellular acidification and induces significant cytotoxicity. Moreover, a novel MCT4 inhibitor CB-2 has been identified by structure-based virtual screening. A triple combination of metformin, CB-2, and trabectedin, a drug that impedes NF- κ B signaling, strongly inhibits BC cells. Compared to normal glucose condition, MRS elicits more potent cancer cell-killing effects under high glucose condition. Animal model studies show that diabetic conditions promote the proliferation and progression of BC xenografts in nude mice and that MRS treatment significantly inhibits HG-induced BC progression. Therefore, inhibition of MCT4 combined with metformin/NF- κ Bi is a promising cancer therapy, especially for diabetes-associated BC.},

The substance transport of interstitial streams follows mesoscopic fluid behavior dynamics, which is intimately associated with material transfer in nanoconfined spaces and a unique signal transmission. Accordingly, the evaluation of interstitial stream transport behavior at the mesoscopic scale is essential. In this review, recent advances in physical and chemical properties, the substance transport model, and the characterization methods of interstitial streams at the mesoscopic scale, as well as the relationships between interstitial streams and disease are summarized. Interstitial stream transport can be used as a basis to fully mine hierarchal behavior in images to expand imaging behavior into an omics field. By starting from the perspective of soft matter, a new understanding can be gained of health and disease and quantitative physical markers for research, clinical diagnosis, and treatment can be provided, as well as prognosis evaluation in complex diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.

Here, partially reduced TiNb 24 O 62 (PR-TNO) are reported that demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in a broad temperature range, notably at low temperatures. Its crystal structure is similar to that of Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 upon partial reduction in H 2 . The titanium and niobium ions in PR-TNO enable multielectron transfer, safe operation, and high Coulombic efficiencies. Benefiting from the increased electronic conductivity of the partially reduced phase and its robust crystal structure with a large interlayer spacing, PR-TNO shows fast electron and Li + transport, small volume change associated with Li + storage, and notable capacitive behavior, resulting in good electrochemical performance even at very low temperatures. At −20 °C, a large reversible capacity of 313 mAh g −1 is obtained at 0.1C, reaching 83.3% of that at 25 °C. At 5C, high rate capability (58.3% of that at 0.5C) is achieved, only slightly lower than that at 25 °C (60.7%). Furthermore, PR-TNO demonstrates excellent cyclic stability with 99.2% of the initial capacity after 1680 cycles, confirming its excellent suitability for low-temperature LIBs.},

However, most synthesized graphene films are substrate-dependent, and usually fragile for practical application. Herein, a freestanding graphene film is prepared based on the CVD route. By using the etchable fabric substrate, a large-scale papyraceous freestanding graphene fabric film (FS-GFF) is obtained. The electrical conductivity of FS-GFF can be modulated from 50 to 2800 Ω sq −1 by tailoring the graphene layer thickness. Moreover, the FS-GFF can be further attached to various shaped objects by a simple rewetting manipulation with negligible changes of electric conductivity. Based on the advanced fabric structure, excellent electrical property, and high infrared emissivity, the FS-GFF is thus assembled into a flexible device with tunable infrared emissivity, which can achieve the adaptive camouflage ability in complicated backgrounds. This work provides an infusive insight into the fabrication of large-scale freestanding graphene fabric films, while promoting the exploration on the flexible infrared camouflage textiles.},

  abstract     = {Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are plausible candidates for practical p-type semiconductors. However, in thin film transistor (TFT) applications, both 2D PEA 2 SnI 4 and 3D FASnI 3 MHPs have different drawbacks. In 2D MHP, the TFT mobility is seriously reduced by grain-boundary issues, whereas 3D MHP has an uncontrollably high hole density, which results in quite a large threshold voltage ( V th ). To overcome these problems, a new concept based on a 2D–3D core–shell structure is herein proposed. In the proposed structure, a 3D MHP core is fully isolated by a 2D MHP, providing two desirable effects as follows. (i) V th can be independently controlled by the 2D component, and (ii) the grain-boundary resistance is significantly improved by the 2D/3D interface. Moreover, SnF 2 additives are used, and they facilitate the formation of the 2D/3D core–shell structure. Consequently, a high-performance p-type Sn-based MHP TFT with a field-effect mobility of ≈25 cm 2 V −1 s −1 is obtained. The voltage gain of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) inverter comprising an n-channel InGaZnO x TFT and a p-channel Sn-MHP TFT is ≈200 V/V at V DD = 20 V. Overall, the proposed 2D/3D core–shell structure is expected to provide a new route for obtaining high-performance MHP TFTs.},

But understanding their conduction mechanisms and predicting current–voltage relations is rather difficult due to countless combinations of materials and device factors. Here, it is shown that they could be understood within the same physical picture, i.e., charge transport from gated to nongated semiconductors. One proposes an indicator based on material and device factors for characterizing the transport and derives a unified and simplified solution for describing the current–voltage relations, current saturation, channel potentials, and drift field. It is verified by simulations and experiments of different types of devices with varied materials and device factors, employing organic, oxide, nanomaterial semiconductors in transistors or hybrid integrations. The concise and unified solution provides general rules for quick understanding and designing of these complex, innovative devices.},

  abstract     = {Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have been considered as potential alternatives for lithium-ion batteries since there is a demand for better anode with superior energy, excellent rate capability, and long cyclability. The high-capacity zinc selenide (ZnSe) anode, which combines the merits of conversion and alloying reactions, is promising for PIBs but suffers from poor cyclability and low electronic conductivity. To effectively boost electrochemical performance of ZnSe, a “dual-carbon-confined” structure is constructed, in which an inner N-doped microporous carbon (NMC)-coated ZnSe wrapped by outer-rGO (ZnSe@i-NMC@o-rGO) is synthesized. Combining finite element simulation, dynamic analysis, and density functional theory calculations, the respective roles of inner- and outer-carbon in boosting performance are revealed. The inner-NMC increased the reactivity of ZnSe with K + and alleviated the volume expansion of ZnSe, while outer-rGO further stabilized the structure and promoted the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of dual-carbon, ZnSe@i-NMC@o-rGO exhibited a high specific capacity 233.4 mAh g −1 after 1500 cycles at 2.0 A g −1 . Coupled with activated carbon, a potassium-ion hybrid capacitor displayed a high energy density of 176.6 Wh kg −1 at 1800 W kg −1 and a superior capacity retention of 82.51% at 2.0 A g −1 after 11000 cycles.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have aroused extensive interest in the field of energy storage owing to the ultrahigh anode capacity. However, strong solvation of Li + and slow interfacial ion transfer associated with conventional electrolytes limit their long-cycle and high-rate capabilities. Herein an electrolyte system based on fluoroalkyl ether 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl-1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl ether (THE) and ether electrolytes is designed to effectively upgrade the long-cycle and high-rate performances of LMBs. THE owns large adsorption energy with ether-based solvents, thus reducing Li + interaction and solvation in ether electrolytes. With THE rich in fluoroalkyl groups adjacent to oxygen atoms, the electrolyte owns ultrahigh polarity, enabling solvation-free Li + transfer with a substantially decreased energy barrier and ten times enhancement in Li + transference at the electrolyte/anode interface. In addition, the uniform adsorption of fluorine-rich THE on the anode and subsequent LiF formation suppress dendrite formation and stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase layer. With the electrolyte, the lithium metal battery with a LiFePO 4 cathode delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with only 0.0012% capacity loss per cycle over 5000 cycles at 10 C. Such enhancement is consistently observed for LMBs with other mainstream electrodes including LiCoO 2 and LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.3 Co 0.2 O 2 , suggesting the generality of the electrolyte design for battery applications.},

Herein, by replacing dialkylated amino donors with an N -methylpyrrole group to enhance TICT, a simple and general method to engineer highly environmentally sensitive fluorescent probes is reported. This method yields a platter of colorful fluorescent probes that demonstrates outstanding polarity and viscosity sensitivity with large turn-on ratios (up to 191 times for polarity and 14 times for viscosity), as well as distinct aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The utilities of these probes in both wash-free bioimaging and protein detections are also successfully demonstrated.

However, most chiral perovskites have been based on low-dimensional structures that confine chiroptical responses to the ultraviolet (UV) or short-wavelength visible region and limit photocurrent due to their wide bandgap and poor charge transport. Here, chiroptical properties of 3D Cs 0.05 FA 0.5 MA 0.45 Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 polycrystalline films are achieved by incorporating chiral plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into the mixed Pb  Sn perovskite, without sacrificing its original optoelectronic properties. CPL detectors fabricated using chiral AuNP-embedded perovskite films can operate without external power input; they exhibit remarkable chirality in the near-infrared (NIR) region with a high anisotropy factor of responsivity ( g res ) of 0.55, via giant plasmon resonance shift of chiral plasmonic AuNPs. In addition, a CPL detector array fabricated on a plastic substrate demonstrates highly sensitive self-powered NIR detection with superior flexibility and durability.},

  abstract     = {Development of pure organic molecular materials with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and their applications for white emitters have received significant attentions recently. Herein, a D– π –A molecule (DMACPPY) which can realize white emitting under ambient conditions both in the crystal state and the doped-film state by combining RTP with two fluorescent emissions is reported. The white emission from the crystalline sample of DMACPPY consists fluorescence from S 2 (the second excited singlet state) and S 1 (the first excited singlet state) along with RTP from T 1 (the first excited triplet state), namely, SST-type white light. While, the white emission from the poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) film doped with DMACPPY contains fluorescences from S 2 and S 1 , and RTP from T 2 (the second excited triplet state) rather than T 1 (STS type). DMACPPY cannot exhibit white spectrum within alternative crystalline state since inferior RTP intensity despite similar ternary emissions. The results demonstrate that the emissive properties for excited states of DMACPPY can be tuned by changing the aggregate state from crystalline to dispersion state in PMMA film. This new RTP emitter fulfills the talent for white emitting and achieves dual-mode white emissions, invisibly, expands the application range for pure organic and heavy atom-free RTP materials.},

However, harmonic and Raman microscopy offers throughput without redox information to reveal metabolic differentiation, and fluorescence lifetime microscopy lacks the vibrational response of molecules to visualize specific molecular constituents such as lipid. Here, a flexible, robust simultaneous multi-nonlinear imaging and cross-modality system that combines complementary imaging contrast mechanisms is demonstrated. This system, utilizing multiplexed ultrashort pulses, ingeniously integrates typical nonlinear processes, and high-dimension lifetime extension in a single setup to enhance the imaging dimensions and quality. Using this system, the authors perform label-free comprehensive evaluation of clinicopathological tissues of ovarian carcinoma due to its statistical complexity. The results show that the technology provides statistically rich, insightful information with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, in contrast to standard histopathology, and can potentially be a powerful tool for fundamental cancer research and clinical applications.},

Here, a very simple strategy, one-step solvent-free catalytic assistant strategy, which is low cost, facile, environment-friendly, and high throughput, is put forward. Hydrogen bond is used to manipulate nanostructure of CDs, and the obtained carbon dots (M-CDs) show a series of attractive properties including matrix-free room-temperature phosphorescence, time-dependent fluorescence, and near-infrared emissive characteristics. Different from the traditional aggregation caused quenching or aggregation-induced emission fluorescent materials, M-CDs exhibit unprecedented and unique dispersion induced redshift fluorescence phenomenon, promoting the studies of fluorescence from static to dynamic. The causes of this phenomenon are further analyzed in detail. As a kind of intelligent fluorescent materials, this new designed CDs greatly enrich the basic recognition of CDs by illustrating the relationship between redshift fluorescence behaviors and the dispersion states, and may provide with an opportunity for solid-state fluorescent materials, anti-counterfeiting, cellular imaging, and hopefully many others.},

However, present perceptive actuating systems rely on the integration of multiple functional units with complex circuit design. Here, a new-type pressure-perceptive actuator is reported, which integrates functions of sensing, actuating, and decision making at material level without complex combination. The actuator is composed of an actuating unit and a pressure-sensing unit, both of which are fabricated by carbon nanotube (CNT), silk, and polymer composite. On the one hand, the actuating unit can be driven by low voltages (&lt;13 V), owing to a Joule-heating effect. On the other hand, the current passing the pressure-sensing unit can be controlled by tactile pressure. In the integrated actuator, it is able to control the deformation amplitude of actuating unit by applying different pressures on the pressure-sensing unit. A portable tactile-activated gripper is fabricated to operate an object through pressure control, demonstrating its application in tactile soft robots. Finally, three visual logic gates (AND, OR, and NOT) are proposed, which convert “tactile” inputs into “visible” deformation outputs, using the CNT-silk-based material for sensing and actuating in the decision-making process. This study provides a new path for intelligent soft robots and new-generation logic devices.},

This study proposes a ternary-state memristor device (simply a ternary memristor) for application to ternary stateful logic. The ternary-state implementable memristor device is developed with bilayered tantalum oxide by precisely controlling the oxygen content in each oxide layer. The device can operate 157 ternary logic gates in one operational clock, which allows an experimental demonstration of a functionally complete three-valued Łukasiewicz logic system. An optimized logic cascading strategy with possible ternary gates is ≈20% more efficient than conventional binary stateful logic, suggesting it can be beneficial for higher performance in-memory computing.},

Due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and enhanced highly efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), these electron-rich anion– π + AIE-PSs show boosted type I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability involving hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals, and up to 99% photodynamic killing efficacy is achieved for both Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli ) under a low dose white light irradiation (16 mW cm −2 ). In vivo experiments confirm that one of these AIE-PSs exhibit excellent therapeutic performance in curing MRSA or MDR E. coli -infected wounds with negligible side-effects. The study would thus provide useful guidance for the rational design of high-performance type I AIE-PSs to overcome antibiotic resistance.},

Herein, a bottom-up step-by-step strategy is developed using extrusion-based 3D printing technology to achieve a high-precision dental crown with multi-scale highly ordered HAp structure. In this study, hybrid resin-based composites (RBCs) with “supergravity +” HAp nanorods can be printed smoothly via direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing, induced by shear force through a custom-built nozzle with a gradually shrinking channel. The theoretical simulation results of finite element method are consistent with the experimental results. The HAp nanorods are first highly oriented along a programmable printing direction in a single printed fiber, then arranged in a layer by adjusting the printing path, and finally 3D printed into a highly ordered and complex crown structure. The printed samples with criss-crossed layers by interrupting crack propagation exhibit a flexural strength of 134.1 ± 3.9 MPa and a compressive strength of 361.6 ± 8.9 MPa, which are superior to the corresponding values of traditional molding counterparts. The HAp-monodispersed RBCs are successfully used to print strong and bioactive dental crowns with a printing accuracy of 95%.

For eliminating the specific inactivation of natural APXs and regulating the catalytic activity, single-atom nanozymes are considered as promising classes of alternatives with similar active sites and maximal atomic utilization efficiency to natural APXs. Herein, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) anchored with isolated single copper atoms (Cu SAs/CN) is designed as an efficient nanozyme with intrinsic APX mimetic behavior. The engineered Cu SAs/CN exhibits comparable specific activity and kinetics to the natural APXs. Based on the density functional theory (DFT), Cu-N 4 moieties in the active center of Cu SAs/CN are determined to exert such favorable APX catalytic performance, in which the electron transfer between Cu and coordinated N atoms facilitates the activation and cleavage of the adsorbed H 2 O 2 molecules and results in fast kinetics. The constructed Cu SAs/CN nanozyme with superior APX-like performance and high biocompatibility can be applied for effectively protecting the H 2 O 2 -treated cells against oxidative injury in vitro.

The photoluminescence imaging microscopy technique is introduced to in situ record the whole process. It is proposed that the type-I band alignment of segregated I-rich and Br-rich domains can enhance the emission of the I-rich domains by suppressing the nonradiative recombination channels. At the same time, the charge injection from Br-rich to I-rich domains drives the expulsion of iodide from the lattice, and thus triggers the reconstruction of MAPbBr 3 .

  abstract     = {Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) possess the remarkable ability to regenerate the whole blood system in response to ablated stress demands. Delineating the mechanisms that maintain HSPCs during regenerative stresses is increasingly important. Here, it is shown that Hemgn is significantly induced by hematopoietic stresses including irradiation and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Hemgn deficiency does not disturb steady-state hematopoiesis in young mice. Hemgn −/- HSPCs display defective engraftment activity during BMT with reduced homing and survival and increased apoptosis. Transcriptome profiling analysis reveals that upregulated genes in transplanted Hemgn −/− HSPCs are enriched for gene sets related to interferon gamma (IFN- γ ) signaling. Hemgn −/− HSPCs show enhanced responses to IFN- γ treatment and increased aging over time. Blocking IFN- γ signaling in irradiated recipients either pharmacologically or genetically rescues Hemgn −/- HSPCs engraftment defect. Mechanistical studies reveal that Hemgn deficiency sustain nuclear Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation via suppressing T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase TC45 activity. Spermidine, a selective activator of TC45, rescues exacerbated phenotype of HSPCs in IFN- γ -treated Hemgn −/− mice. Collectively, these results identify that Hemgn is a critical regulator for successful engraftment and reconstitution of HSPCs in mice through negatively regulating IFN- γ signaling. Targeted Hemgn may be used to improve conditioning regimens and engraftment during HSPCs transplantation.},

  abstract     = {The use of nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver small inhibiting microRNAs (miRNAs) has shown great promise for treating cancer. However, constructing a miRNA delivery system that targets brain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), remains technically challenging due to the existence of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). In this work, a novel targeted antisense miRNA-21 oligonucleotide (ATMO-21) delivery system is developed for GBM treatment. Bradykinin ligand agonist-decorated spermine-modified acetalated dextran NPs (SpAcDex NPs) could temporarily open the BTB by activating G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed in tumor blood vessels and tumor cells, which increase transportation to and accumulation in tumor sites. ATMO-21 achieves high loading in the SpAcDex NPs (over 90%) and undergoes gradual controlled release with the degradation of the NPs in acidic lysosomal compartments. This allows for cell apoptosis and inhibition of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by downregulating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1 α ) protein. An in vivo orthotopic U87MG glioma model confirms that the released ATMO-21 shows significant therapeutic efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth and angiogenesis, demonstrating that agonist-modified SpAcDex NPs represent a promising strategy for GBM treatment combining targeted gene therapy and antiangiogenic therapy.},

  abstract     = {Vigorous development of electric vehicles is one way to achieve global carbon reduction goals. However, fires caused by thermal runaway of the power battery has seriously hindered large-scale development. Adding thermal runaway retardants (TRRs) to electrolytes is an effective way to improve battery safety, but it often reduces electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is difficult to apply in practice. TRR encapsulation is inspired by the core–shell structures such as cells, seeds, eggs, and fruits in nature. In these natural products, the shell isolates the core from the outside, and has to break as needed to expose the core, such as in seed germination, chicken hatching, etc. Similarly, TRR encapsulation avoids direct contact between the TRR and the electrolyte, so it does not affect the electrochemical performance of the battery during normal operation. When lithium-ion battery (LIB) thermal runaway occurs, the capsules release TRRs to slow down and even prevent further thermal runaway. This review aims to summarize the fundamentals of bioinspired TRR capsules and highlight recent key progress in LIBs with TRR capsules to improve LIB safety. It is anticipated that this review will inspire further improvement in battery safety, especially for emerging LIBs with high-electrochemical performance.},

  abstract     = {Direct ethanol fuel cells are among the most efficient and environmentally friendly energy-conversion devices and have been widely focused. The ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is a multielectron process with slow kinetics. The large amount of by-product generated by incomplete oxidation greatly reduces the efficiency of energy conversion through the EOR. In this study, a novel type of trimetallene called porous PdWM (M = Nb, Mo and Ta) is synthesized by a facile method. The mass activity (15.6 A mg Pd −1 ) and C1 selectivity (55.5%) of Pd 50 W 27 Nb 23 /C trimetallene, obtained after optimizing the compositions and proportions of porous PdWM, outperform those of commercial Pt/C (1.3 A mg Pt −1 , 5.9%), Pd/C (5.0 A mg Pd −1 , 7.2%), and Pd 97 W 3 /C bimetallene (9.5 A mg Pd −1 , 14.1%). The mechanism by which Pd 50 W 27 Nb 23 /C enhances the EOR performance is evaluated by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. It is found that W and Nb enhance the adsorption of CH 3 CH 2 OH and oxophilic high-valence Nb accelerates the subsequent oxidation of CO and  CH x species. Moreover, Nb promotes the cleavage of C  C bonds and increases the C1 selectivity. Pd 60 W 28 Mo 12 /C and Pd 64 W 27 Ta 9 /C trimetallene synthesized by the same method also exhibit excellent EOR performance.},

  abstract     = {Although deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic coding for the very essence of life, these macromolecules or components thereof are not necessarily lost after a cell dies. There appears to be a link between extracellular DNA and biomineralization. Here the authors demonstrate that extracellular DNA functions as an initiator of collagen intrafibrillar mineralization. This is confirmed with in vitro and in vivo biological mineralization models. Because of their polyanionic property, extracellular DNA molecules are capable of stabilizing supersaturated calcium phosphate solution and mineralizing 2D and 3D collagen matrices completely as early as 24 h. The effectiveness of extracellular DNA in biomineralization of collagen is attributed to the relatively stable formation of amorphous liquid droplets triggered by attraction of DNA to the collagen fibrils via hydrogen bonding. These findings suggest that extracellular DNA is biomimetically significant for fabricating inorganic–organic hybrid materials for tissue engineering. DNA-induced collagen intrafibrillar mineralization provides a clue to the pathogenesis of ectopic mineralization in different body tissues. The use of DNase for targeting extracellular DNA at destined tissue sites provides a potential solution for treatment of diseases associated with ectopic mineralization.},

Unfortunately, this prerequisite continues to suffer from coarse positioning accuracy, low throughput, and process complexity. Here, it is reported on direct, on-demand electrohydrodynamic printing of nanodiamonds containing NV centers with high precision control over quantity and position. After thorough characterizations of the printing conditions, it is shown that the number of printed nanodiamonds can be controlled at will, attaining the single-particle level precision. This printing approach, therefore, enables positioning NV center arrays with a controlled number directly on the universal substrate without any lithographic process. The approach is expected to pave the way toward new horizons not only for experimental quantum physics but also for the practical implementation of such quantum systems.},

However, the unsatisfied performance of n-type Bi 2 Te 3 flexible thin films significantly limits their wide application. In this study, a novel thermal diffusion method is employed to fabricate n-type Te-embedded Bi 2 Te 3 flexible thin films on flexible polyimide substrates, where Te embeddings can be achieved by tuning the thermal diffusion temperature and correspondingly result in an energy filtering effect at the Bi 2 Te 3 /Te interfaces. The energy filtering effect can lead to a high Seebeck coefficient ≈160 µV K −1 as well as high carrier mobility of ≈200 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room-temperature. Consequently, an ultrahigh room-temperature power factor of 14.65 µW cm −1 K −2 can be observed in the Te-embedded Bi 2 Te 3 flexible thin films prepared at the diffusion temperature of 623 K. A thermoelectric sensor is also assembled through integrating the n-type Bi 2 Te 3 flexible thin films with p-type Sb 2 Te 3 counterparts, which can fast reflect finger-touch status and demonstrate the applicability of as-prepared Te-embedded Bi 2 Te 3 flexible thin films.

  abstract     = {Neutrophils constitute abundant cellular components in human gastric cancer (GC) tissues, but their protumorigenic subset in pathogenesis of GC progression is unclear. Here, it is found that patients with GC show significantly higher neutrophil infiltration in tumors that is regulated by CXCL12-CXCR4 chemotaxis. These tumor-infiltrating neutrophils express high level immunosuppressive molecules FasL and PD-L2, and this FasL + PD-L2 + neutrophil subset with a unique phenotype constitutes at least 20% of all neutrophils in advanced GC and predicts poor patient survival. Tumor induces neutrophils to express FasL and PD-L2 proteins with similar phenotype to those in GC tumors in both time-dependent and dose-dependent manners. Mechanistically, Th17 cell-derived IL-17A and tumor cell-derived G-CSF can significantly induce neutrophil FasL and PD-L2 expression via activating ERK-NF- κ B and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, respectively. Importantly, upon over-expressing FasL and PD-L2, neutrophils acquire immunosuppressive functions on tumor-specific CD8 + T-cells and promote the growth and progression of human GC tumors in vitro and in vivo, which can be reversed by blocking FasL and PD-L2 on these neutrophils. Thus, the work identifies a novel protumorigenic FasL + PD-L2 + neutrophil subset in GC and provides new insights for human cancer immunosuppression and anti-cancer therapies targeting these pathogenic cells.},

  abstract     = {Free radical-based anticancer modality has been widely applied to cancer therapies. However, it still faces challenges of low delivery efficiency and poor selectivity of free radical generation specifically toward tumors. Herein, a virus-mimicking hollow mesoporous disulfide-bridged organosilica is designed to encapsulate •C precursor 2, 2&#39;-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH), which is then enclosed by tannic acid (TA)/Fe III photothermal assembly and further cloaked by natural killer (NK) cell membrane to achieve synergistic thermodynamic–chemodynamic therapy. The nanogenerator can first evade immune surveillance via NK cell membrane “cloaking” mechanism to strongly accumulate in tumors. Interestingly, the NIR laser-induced heat can trigger NK cell membrane rupture for “shape reversal” to expose a virus-like surface to amplify the cellular uptake, and simultaneously break the azo bonds of AIPH for in situ controlled •C generation. Then upon glutathione (GSH) triggering, the nanogenerator disintegrates via disulfide–thiol exchange and efficiently generates •OH by lysosomal pH-initiated TA-Fe III reaction; notably, the consumption of GSH can amplify oxidative stress to enhance free radical therapy by weakening the self-defense mechanism of tumor cells. It is envisioned that the NK cell membrane-cloaked virus-mimicking and NIR/GSH sequentially activated •C/•OH radical nanogenerator can provide a promising strategy for oxidative stress-based anticancer therapy.},

The increasing incidence of T2DM reflects an urgent need for the development of in vitro human-relevant models for disease study and drug therapy. Here, a new microfluidic multi-organoid system is developed that recapitulates the human liver-pancreatic islet axis in normal and disease states. The system contains two compartmentalized regions connected by a microchannel network, enabling 3D co-culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived liver and islet organoids for up to 30 days under circulatory perfusion conditions. The co-cultured liver and islet organoids exhibit favorable growth and improved tissue-specific functions. Transcriptional analyses reveal the activation of metabolically relevant signaling pathways in the co-cultured organoids. Notably, the co-culture system facilitates sensitive glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islet organoids and increased glucose utilization in liver organoids by glucose tolerance tests. Both liver and islet organoids display mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased glucose transport capacity under high glucose conditions, which can be alleviated by metformin treatment. This novel multi-organoid system can recapitulate human-relevant liver-islet axis under both physiological and pathological conditions, providing a unique platform for future T2DM research and drug development.},

These results reveal that thermoplasticizing has altered the dispersion states and micro-environment of RTP molecules in matrix, and the cohesion of elastic polymer itself can also greatly restrict non-radiative relaxations to boost both blue mono-molecular and yellow micro-crystalline RTP.

  abstract     = {Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) stands as one of the main difficulties in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) as it causes the development of resistant clones and leads to heterogeneous drug responses. Here, 12 sets of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and cell lines (PDCs) isolated from multiple regions of single tumors from 12 patients, capturing ITH by multiregion sampling of individual tumors, are presented. Whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of the 12 sets are performed. The PDOs and PDCs of the 12 sets are also analyzed with a clinically relevant 24-compound library to assess their drug responses. The results reveal unexpectedly widespread subregional heterogeneity among PDOs and PDCs isolated from a single tumor, which is manifested by genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and strong variance in drug responses, while each PDO still recapitulates the major histologic, genomic, and transcriptomic characteristics of the primary tumor. The data suggest an imminent drawback of single biopsy-originated PDO-based clinical diagnosis in evaluating CRC patient responses. Instead, the results indicate the importance of targeting common somatic driver mutations positioned in the trunk of all tumor subregional clones in parallel with a comprehensive understanding of the molecular ITH of each tumor.},

  abstract     = {Despite their potent antitumor activity, clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been significantly limited by their poor response rates (&lt;30%) in cancer patients, primarily due to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. As a representative immune escape mechanism, cancer-derived exosomes have recently been demonstrated to exhaust CD8 + cytotoxic T cells. Here, it is reported that sulfisoxazole, a sulfonamide antibacterial, significantly decreases the exosomal PD-L1 level in blood when orally administered to the tumor-bearing mice. Consequently, sulfisoxazole effectively reinvigorates exhausted T cells, thereby eliciting robust antitumor effects in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody. Overall, sulfisoxazole regulates immunosuppression through the inhibition of exosomal PD-L1, implying its potential to improve the response rate of anti-PD-1 antibodies.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs), with their large exciton binding energy, narrow photoluminescence (PL), and absence of dielectric screening for photons emitted normal to the NPL surface, could be expected to become the fastest luminophores amongst all colloidal nanostructures. However, super-fast emission is suppressed by a dark (optically passive) exciton ground state, substantially split from a higher-lying bright (optically active) state. Here, the exciton fine structure in 2–8 monolayer (ML) thick Cs n − 1 Pb n Br 3 n + 1 NPLs is revealed by merging temperature-resolved PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay with an effective mass model taking quantum confinement and dielectric confinement anisotropy into account. This approach exposes a thickness-dependent bright–dark exciton splitting reaching 32.3 meV for the 2 ML NPLs. The model also reveals a 5–16 meV splitting of the bright exciton states with transition dipoles polarized parallel and perpendicular to the NPL surfaces, the order of which is reversed for the thinnest NPLs, as confirmed by TR-PL measurements. Accordingly, the individual bright states must be taken into account, while the dark exciton state strongly affects the optical properties of the thinnest NPLs even at room temperature. Significantly, the derived model can be generalized for any isotropically or anisotropically confined nanostructure.},

PARP1 and/or its activity are dysregulated in the immune and central nervous system of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and animal models. Pharmacological PARP1 inhibition is shown to be protective against immune activation and disease severity in MS animal models while genetic PARP1 deficiency studies reported discrepant results. The inconsistency suggests that the function of PARP1 and PARP1-mediated PARylation may be complex and context-dependent. The article reviews PARP1 functions, discusses experimental findings and possible interpretations of PARP1 in inflammation, neuronal/axonal degeneration, and oligodendrogliopathy, three major pathological components cooperatively determining MS disease course and neurological progression, and points out future research directions. Cell type specific PARP1 manipulations are necessary for revisiting the role of PARP1 in the three pathological components prior to moving PARP1 inhibition into clinical trials for MS therapy.},

  abstract     = {Protein-based hydrogels have attracted great attention due to their excellent biocompatible properties, but often suffer from weak mechanical strength. Conventional strengthening strategies for protein-based hydrogels are to introduce nanoparticles or synthetic polymers for improving their mechanical strength, but often compromise their biocompatibility. Here, a new, general, protein unfolding-chemical coupling (PNC) strategy is developed to fabricate pure protein hydrogels without any additives to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent cell biocompatibility. This PNC strategy combines thermal-induced protein unfolding/gelation to form a physically-crosslinked network and a -NH2/-COOH coupling reaction to generate a chemicallycrosslinked network. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a globular protein, PNC-BSA hydrogels show macroscopic transparency, high stability, high mechanical properties (compressive/tensile strength of 115/0.43 MPa), fast stiffness/toughness recovery of 85%/91% at room temperature, good fatigue resistance, and low cell cytotoxicity and red blood cell hemolysis. More importantly, the PNC strategy can be not only generally applied to silk fibroin, ovalbumin, and milk albumin protein to form different, high strength protein hydrogels, but also modified with PEDOT/PSS nanoparticles as strain sensors and fluorescent fillers as color sensors. This work demonstrates a new, universal, PNC method to prepare high strength, multi-functional, pure protein hydrogels beyond a few available today.},

  abstract     = {A van der Waals material, MoTe 2 with a monoclinic 1 T ′ crystal structure is a candidate for 3D second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) hosting gapless hinge states and insulating surface states. However, due to the temperature-induced structural phase transition, the monoclinic 1 T ′ structure of MoTe 2 is transformed into the orthorhombic T d structure as the temperature is lowered, which hinders the experimental verification and electronic applications of the predicted SOTI state at low temperatures. Here, systematic Raman spectroscopy studies of the exfoliated MoTe 2 thin flakes with variable thicknesses at different temperatures, are presented. As a spectroscopic signature of the orthorhombic T d structure of MoTe 2 , the out-of-plane vibration mode D at ≈ 125 cm –1 is always visible below a certain temperature in the multilayer flakes thicker than ≈ 27.7 nm, but vanishes in the temperature range from 80 to 320 K when the flake thickness becomes lower than ≈ 19.5 nm. The absence of the out-of-plane vibration mode D in the Raman spectra here demonstrates not only the disappearance of the monoclinic-to-orthorhombic phase transition but also the persistence of the monoclinic 1 T ′ structure in the MoTe 2 thin flakes thinner than ≈ 19.5 nm at low temperatures down to 80 K, which may be caused by the high enough density of the holes introduced during the gold-enhanced exfoliation process and exposure to air. The MoTe 2 thin flakes with the low-temperature monoclinic 1 T ′ structure provide a material platform for realizing SOTI states in van der Waals materials at low temperatures, which paves the way for developing a new generation of electronic devices based on SOTIs.},

They recognize five types of PAMs: NNGRRT, NNGRRR, NNGRC, NNGA, and NNGR. Importantly, SchCas9 recognizes the simple NNGR PAM, representing the most relaxed PAM preference of compact Cas9s to date. It is further demonstrated that SchCas9 enables efficient genome editing in multiple human cell lines.

Deletion of this miRNA cluster in mice results in obesity, while increasing the pool of early adipocyte progenitors and hypertrophied adipocytes. Complementary loss and gain of function experiments and RNA sequencing demonstrate that miR-424(322)/503 regulates a conserved genetic program involved in the differentiation and commitment of white adipocytes. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that miR-424(322)/503 targets γ -Synuclein (SNCG), a factor that mediates this program rearrangement by controlling metabolic functions in fat cells, allowing adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue enlargement. Accordingly, diminished miR-424(322) in mice and obese humans co-segregate with increased SNCG in fat and peripheral blood as mutually exclusive features of obesity, being normalized upon weight loss. The data unveil a previously unknown regulatory mechanism of fat mass expansion tightly controlled by the miR-424(322)/503 through SNCG.},

  abstract     = {Polarization of ionic and electronic defects in response to high electric fields plays an essential role in determining properties of materials in applications such as memristive devices. However, isolating the polarization response of individual defects has been challenging for both models and measurements. Here the authors quantify the nonlinear dielectric response of neutral oxygen vacancies, comprised of strongly localized electrons at an oxygen vacancy site, in perovskite oxides of the form AB O 3 . Their approach implements a computationally efficient local Hubbard U correction in density functional theory simulations. These calculations indicate that the electric dipole moment of this defect is correlated positively with the lattice volume, which they varied by elastic strain and by A-site cation species. In addition, the dipole of the neutral oxygen vacancy under electric field increases with increasing reducibility of the B-site cation. The predicted relationship among point defect polarization, mechanical strain, and transition metal chemistry provides insights for the properties of memristive materials and devices under high electric fields.},

However, sustainable and affordable sources of amyloidogenic proteins remain the bottleneck for large-scale applications, and to date, interest remains essentially limited to fundamental studies. Plant-derived proteins would be an ideal source due to their natural abundance and low environmental impact. Hereby oat globulin, the primary protein of oat plant ( Avena sativa ), is utilized to yield high-quality amyloid fibrils and functional materials based thereof. These fibrils show a rich multistranded ribbon-like polymorphism and a fibrillization process with both irreversible and reversible pathways. The authors furthermore fabricate oat-amyloid aerogels, films, and membranes for possible use in water purification, sensors, and patterned electrodes. The sustainability footprint of oat-amyloids against other protein sources is demonstrated, anticipating an environmentally-efficient platform for advanced materials and technologies.},

Samples synthesized from a system with high basicity (at 100 °C), a system with moderate basicity (at 150 °C), and a fluoride-containing system in neutral medium (at 170 °C) are compared. Well-crystallized materials with sizes ≈0.1, 1–10, and 30–40 µm are obtained. The samples are analyzed by complementary methods providing information on the short- and long-range order in the zeolite framework. A strong correlation between the number of point defects in the zeolite framework and preparation conditions is established. Silicalite-1 synthesized under mild synthesis conditions from a highly basic system exhibits a larger number of framework defects and thus low hydrophobicity. Further, the calcined samples are subjected to aluminum and silicon incorporation by postsynthesis treatment. The Al/Si incorporation in the zeolite framework and its impact on the physicochemical properties is studied by XRD, TEM/SEM, solid-state NMR, FTIR, and thermogravimetric analyses. The defects healing as a function of the number of point defects in the initial material and zeolite crystal size is evaluated. The results of this study will serve for fine-tuning zeolite properties by in situ and postsynthesis methods.},

  abstract     = {The “shuttle effect” of soluble polysulfides and slow reaction kinetics hinder the practical application of Li–S batteries. Transition metal oxides are promising mediators to alleviate these problems, but the poor electrical conductivity limits their further development. Herein, the homogeneous CoNiO 2 /Co 4 N nanowires have been fabricated and employed as additive of graphene based sulfur cathode. Through optimizing the nitriding degree, the continuous heterostructure interface can be obtained, accompanied by effective adjustment of energy band structure. By combining the strong adsorptive and catalytic properties of CoNiO 2 and electrical conductivity of Co 4 N, the in situ formed CoNiO 2 /Co 4 N heterostructure reveals a synergistic enhancement effect. Theoretical calculation and experimental design show that it can not only significantly inhibit “shuttle effect” through chemisorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, but also improve the transport rate of ions and electrons. Thus, the graphene composite sulfur cathode supported by these CoNiO 2 /Co 4 N nanowires exhibits improved sulfur species reaction kinetics. The corresponding cell provides a high rate capacity of 688 mAh g −1 at 4 C with an ultralow decaying rate of ≈0.07% per cycle over 600 cycles. The design of heterostructure nanowires and graphene composite structure provides an advanced strategy for the rapid capture–diffusion–conversion process of polysulfides.},

Herein, a simple droplet microfluidics for continuously and directly generating porous particles by introducing bubble-propelled nanomotors into the system is presented. As the nanomotors can continuously generate gas bubbles in the unsolidified droplet templates, the desirable porous microparticles can be obtained after droplet polymerization. It is demonstrated that the generation process is highly controlled and the resultant microparticles show excellent porosity and monodispersity. In addition, the obtained porous microparticles can serve as microcarriers for 3D cell culture, because of their characteristic porous structures and favorable biocompatibility. Moreover, owing to the existence of oxygen in these microparticles, they can be used to improve the healing effects of wounds in the type I diabetes rat models. These remarkable features of the generation strategy and the porous microparticles point to their potential values in various biomedical fields.},

Currently, conventional thrombolytic treatments are challenged by the low utilization, inferior thrombus penetration, and high off-target bleeding risks of most thrombolytic drugs, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment outcomes. Herein, it is proposed that these challenges can be overcome by precisely integrating the conventional thrombolytic strategy with photothermal therapy. After co-assembly engineering optimization, a fibrin-targeting peptide-decorated nanoassembly of DiR (a photothermal probe) and ticagrelor (TGL, an antiplatelet drug) is prepared for thrombus-homing delivery, abbreviated as FT-DT NPs. The elaborately engineered nanoassembly shows multiple advantages, including simple preparation with high drug co-loading capacity, synchronous delivery of two drugs with long systemic circulation, thrombus-targeted accumulation with self-indicating function, as well as photothermal-potentiated thrombus penetration and thrombolysis with high therapeutic efficacy. As expected, FT-DT NPs not only show bright fluorescence signals in the embolized vessels, but also perform photothermal/antiplatelet synergistic thrombolysis in vivo. This study offers a simple and versatile co-delivery nanoplatform for imaging-guided photothermal/antiplatelet dual-modality thrombolysis.},

These organelles, called biomolecular condensates, have traditionally been classified as liquids, gels, or solids with limited subclasses. Here, the authors show that a thermal trigger can lead to formation of at least two distinct liquid condensed phases of the fused in sarcoma low complexity (FUS LC) domain. Forming FUS LC condensates directly at low temperature leads to formation of metastable, kinetically trapped condensates that show arrested coalescence, escape from which to untrapped condensates can be achieved via thermal annealing. Using experimental and computational approaches, the authors find that molecular structure of interfacial FUS LC in kinetically trapped condensates is distinct (more β -sheet like) compared to untrapped FUS LC condensates. Moreover, molecular motion within kinetically trapped condensates is substantially slower compared to that in untrapped condensates thereby demonstrating two unique liquid FUS condensates. Controlling condensate thermodynamic state, stability, and structure with a simple thermal switch may contribute to pathological protein aggregate stability and provides a facile method to trigger condensate mixing for biotechnology applications.},

Impressively, as an integrated electrode, it exhibits a superior ammonia yield rate of 76.15 µg mg cat −1 h −1 (9859 µg μmol Bi −1 h −1 ) at −0.8 V versus RHE and a high FE of 24.60% at −0.5 V versus RHE in 0.1 m Na 2 SO 4 solution, which can retain stable performance in 10 h continuous operation, surpassing the overwhelming majority of reported Bi-based NRR catalysts. Coupling various characterizations with theory calculations, it is disclosed that the unique monolithic core-shell configuration with porous structure endows abundant accessible active sites, outstanding charge-transfer property, and good stability, while the cooperation effect of Bi SAs and TiN can simultaneously promote the hydrogenation of N 2 into NH 3 * on the TiN surface and the desorption of NH 3 * to release NH 3 on the Bi SA sites.

An experimental setup is developed that combines rheological measurements with simultaneous time-domain 1 H NMR relaxometry (TD-NMR) techniques, which are used to study molecular motion (&lt;10 nm) in soft matter. This so-called low-field RheoNMR setup is used to study the impact of varying degrees of crosslinking ( DC ) on the gelation kinetics of acrylic acid (AAc) and N , N ′-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) free radical crosslinking copolymerization. A stretched exponential function describes the T 2 relaxation curves throughout the gelation process. The stretching exponent β decreases from 0.90 to 0.67 as a function of increasing DC , suggesting an increase in network heterogeneity with a broad T 2 distribution at higher DC . The inverse correlation of the elastic modulus G ′ with T 2 relaxation times reveals a pronounced molecular rigidity for higher DC at early gelation times, indicating the formation of inelastic, rigid domains such as crosslinking clusters. The authors further correlate G ′ with the polymer concentration during gelation using a T 1 filter for solvent suppression. A characteristic scaling exponent of 2.3 is found, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions of G ′ based on the confining tube model in semi-dilute entangled polymer solutions.},

However, the weak thermal stability has inhibited the successful incorporation of MXene into the inorganic MACs matrix so far. Herein, an ultralow temperature sintering strategy to fabricate a hierarchical aluminosilicate glass composite is demonstrated by using EMT zeolite as starting powder, which can not only endow the composites with high sinterability, but also facilitate the alignment of MXene in the glass matrix. Accordingly, the highly oriented MXene and mesoporous structure can effectively reduce the conduction loss in the out-of-plane direction while maintaining its large polarization loss. Meanwhile, the in situ formed Ni nanoparticles via ion exchange serve as a synergistic modulator to further improve the attenuation capability and impedance matching of composite, resulting in a low reflection loss of −59.5 dB in X band and general values below −20 dB with a low fitting thickness from 4 to 18 GHz. More attractively, such a delicate structure also gives the composite a remarkable fracture strength and contact-damage-resistance, which qualifies the mesoporous glass composite as a structural MACs with a superior comprehensive performance.},

Zn- and Pb-based catalysts have improved formate selectivity, but they suffer from relatively low current activities considering the competitive CO selectivity on Zn. Here, lead-doped zinc (Zn(Pb)) electrocatalyst is optimized to efficiently reduce CO 2 to formate, while CO evolution selectivity is largely controlled. Selective formate is detected with Faradaic efficiency (FE HCOOH ) of ≈95% at an outstanding partial current density of 47 mA cm –2 in a conventional H-Cell. Zn(Pb) is further investigated in an electrolyte-fed device achieving a superior conversion rate of ≈100 mA cm –2 representing a step closer to practical electrocatalysis. The in situ analysis demonstrates that the Pb incorporation plays a crucial role in CO suppression stem from the generation of the Pb–O–C–O–Zn structure rather than the CO-boosted Pb–O–C–Zn.

  abstract     = {As a noninvasive therapeutic technique, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted numerous research interests for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the residual photosensitizers (PSs) still produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage normal cells under sunlight after PDT, which limits their practical application in clinic. Herein, the authors propose a self-degradable type-I PS based on conjugated polymer, which is composed of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and imidazole units. Due to the effective conjugated skeleton and unique AIE properties, thus-obtained polymers can effectively generate superoxide radical (O 2 −• ) through the type-I process under light irradiation, which is ideal for hypoxic tumors treatment. Intriguingly, under light irradiation, O 2 −• produced by the conjugated polymers can further lead to the self-degradation of the polymer to form nontoxic micro-molecules. It not only helps to resolve the potential phototoxicity problems of residual PSs, but also can accelerate the metabolism of the conjugated polymers to avoid the potential biotoxicity of drug accumulation. This work develops a self-degradable type-I PS, which can turn off the generation of ROS in time after PDT, providing a novel strategy to balance the PDT effect and postoperative safety.},

Silk fibroin (SF) from B. mori silkworm fibers can be reconstructed/functionalized at the mesoscopic scale during refolding from the solution state into fibers. This facilitates the mesoscopic functionalization by engaging functional seeds in the refolding of unfolded SF molecules. In particular, SF solutions can be self-assembled into regenerated fiber devices by artificial spinning technologies, such as wet spinning, dry spinning, microfluidic spinning, electrospinning, and direct writing. Meso-functionalization manipulates the SF property from the mesoscopic scale, transforming the original silk fibers into smart fiber devices with smart functionalities, such as sensors, actuators, optical fibers, luminous fibers, and energy harvesters. In this review, the progress of mesoscopic structural construction from SF materials to fiber electronics/photonics is comprehensively summarized, along with the spinning technologies and fiber structure characterization methods.

Nevertheless, the high mobility of RMs leads to serious redox shuttling, which induces an undesired lithium-metal degeneration and RM decomposition during trade-off catalysis against the sustainable operation of batteries. Here, a novel carbon family of graphdiyne matrix is first proposed to decouple the charge-carrying redox property of ferrocene and the shuttle effects. It is demonstrated that a ferrocene-anchored graphdiyne framework can function as stationary RM, not only preserving the redox-mediating capability of ferrocene, but also promoting the local orientated three-dimensional (3D) growth of Li 2 O 2 . As a result, the RM-assisted catalysis in lithium–oxygen battery remains of remarkable efficiency and stability without the depletion of oxidized RMs or lithium degradation, resulting in a significantly enhanced electrochemical performance.},

Herein, a new strategy is creatively proposed based on charge traps from mutual coupling effects, generated from g-C 3 N 4 /MXene-Au composites, to further promote the output performance of triboelectric nanogenerator. It is found that photon-generated carriers coupling surface plasmon effect enables composites filled into tribo-material with visible light is an excellent value in boosting performance.

Thus, it is essential to design the ECs that can store as much energy as possible within a limited space. As the most critical component in ECs, “porous and yet dense” electrodes with large ion-accessible surface area and optimal packing density are crucial to realize desired high volumetric performance, which have demonstrated to be rather challenging. In this review, the principles and fundamentals of ECs are first observed, focusing on the key understandings of the different charge storage mechanisms in porous electrodes. The recent and latest advances in high-volumetric-performance ECs, developed by the rational design and fabrication of “porous and yet dense” electrodes are then examined. Particular emphasis of discussions then concentrates on the key factors impacting the volumetric performance of porous carbon-based electrodes. Finally, the currently faced challenges, further perspectives and opportunities on those purposely engineered porous electrodes for high-volumetric-performance EC are presented, aiming at providing a set of guidelines for further design of the next-generation energy storage devices.},

Despite strict limits (e.g., 50 parts per billion (ppb) in the European Union), routine monitoring of benzene is rarely done since low-cost sensors lack accuracy. This work presents a compact, battery-driven device that detects benzene in gas mixtures with unprecedented selectivity (&gt;200) over inorganics, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and even challenging toluene and xylene. This can be attributed to strong Lewis acid sites on a packed bed of catalytic WO 3 nanoparticles that prescreen a chemoresistive Pd/SnO 2 sensor. That way, benzene is detected down to 13 ppb with superior robustness to relative humidity (RH, 10–80%), fulfilling the strictest legal limits. As proof of concept, benzene is quantified in indoor air in good agreement ( R 2 ≥ 0.94) with mass spectrometry. This device is readily applicable for personal exposure assessment and can assist the implementation of low-emission zones for sustainable environments.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction in tissue-specific mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) plays a critical role in cell fate and the morbidity of chronic inflammation-associated bone diseases, such as periodontitis and osteoarthritis. However, there is still no effective method to cure chronic inflammation-associated bone diseases by physiologically restoring the function of mitochondria and MSCs. Herein, it is first found that chronic inflammation leads to excess Ca 2+ transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria, which causes mitochondrial calcium overload and further damage to mitochondria. Furthermore, damaged mitochondria continuously accumulate in MSCs due to the inhibition of mitophagy by activating the Wnt/ β -catenin pathway under chronic inflammatory conditions, impairing the differentiation of MSCs. Based on the mechanistic discovery, intracellular microenvironment (esterase and low pH)-responsive nanoparticles are fabricated to capture Ca 2+ around mitochondria in MSCs to regulate MSC mitochondrial calcium flux against mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the same nanoparticles are able to deliver siRNA to MSCs to inhibit the Wnt/ β -catenin pathway and regulate mitophagy of the originally dysfunctional mitochondria. These precision-engineered nanoparticles, referred to as “nanorepairers,” physiologically restore the function of mitochondria and MSCs, resulting in effective therapy for periodontitis and osteoarthritis. The concept can potentially be expanded to the treatment of other diseases via mitochondrial quality control intervention.},

  abstract     = {Eliminating the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrite inside solid electrolytes is a critical tactic for the performance improvement of all-solid-state Li batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a strategy to swallow and anchor Li dendrites by filling Si nanoparticles into the solid electrolytes by the lithiation effect with Li dendrites is proposed. It is found that Si nanoparticles can lithiate with the adjacent Li dendrites which have a strong electron transport ability. Such effect can inhibit the formation of Li dendrites at the interface of Li anode, and also swallow the tip Li inside the solid electrolytes, and thus inhibiting its longitudinal growth and avoiding the solid electrolyte puncturing. As a proof of concept, a novel sandwich-structure solid electrolyte of Li 6.7 La 3 Zr 2 Al 0.1 O 12 (LLZA)-PEO/Si-PEO electrolyte/ (LLZA)-PEO with asymmetrical structure is first constructed and demonstrated stable Li plating/stripping over 1800 h and remarkably improved cycling stability in Li/LiFePO 4 cells with a reversible capacity of 111.9 mAh g −1 at 1 C after 150 cycles. The proof of lithiation of Si-PEO electrolyte in the interlayer is also verified. Furthermore, the pouch cell thus prepared exhibits comparable cyclic stability and is allowable for folding and cutting, suggesting its promising application in ASSLBs by this simple and efficient strategy.},

Herein, a novel lithium–oxygen full cell coupling a lithium anode protected by a composite layer of polyethylene oxide (PEO)/lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (LATP)/wax to a LiOH-based cathode is constructed. The protected lithium is stable in air and water, and permits reversible, dendrite-free lithium stripping/plating in a wet nonaqueous electrolyte under ambient air. The LiOH-based full cell reaction is immune to moisture (up to 99% humidity) in air and exhibits a much better resistance to CO 2 contamination than Li 2 O 2 , resulting in a more consistent electrochemistry in the long term.

In this work, an ultrathin 2D/2D Ti 3 C 2 T x /ZnIn 2 S 4 heterostructure is rationally designed by coupling the ultrathin ZnIn 2 S 4 with few-layered Ti 3 C 2 T x via the electrostatic self-assembly strategy. The 2D/2D Ti 3 C 2 T x /ZnIn 2 S 4 heterostructure possesses larger contact area and strong electronic interaction to promote the charge carrier transfer at the interface, and the sulfur vacancy on the ZnIn 2 S 4 acting as the electron trap further enhances the separation of the photoinduced electrons and holes. As a consequence, the optimal 2D/2D Ti 3 C 2 T x /ZnIn 2 S 4 composite exhibits a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 148.4 µmol h −1 , which is 3.6 times and 9.2 times higher than that of ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheet and flower-like ZnIn 2 S 4 , respectively. Moreover, the stability of the ZnIn 2 S 4 is significantly improved after coupling with the few-layered Ti 3 C 2 T x . The characterizations and density functional theory calculation demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the sulfur vacancy and Ti 3 C 2 T x cocatalyst can greatly promote the electrons transfer from ZnIn 2 S 4 to Ti 3 C 2 T x and the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, thus enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water.},

Herein, the authors present wearable TENG-based devices for gait analysis and waist motion capture to enhance the intelligence and performance of the lower-limb and waist rehabilitation. Four triboelectric sensors are equidistantly sewed onto a fabric belt to recognize the waist motion, enabling the real-time robotic manipulation and virtual game for immersion-enhanced waist training. The insole equipped with two TENG sensors is designed for walking status detection and a 98.4% identification accuracy for five different humans aiming at rehabilitation plan selection is achieved by leveraging machine learning technology to further analyze the signals.

RNAP and σ 70 form a holoenzyme that recognizes -35 and -10 promoter DNA consensus sites. Many activators bind upstream from the holoenzyme and can be broadly divided into two classes. RamA acts as a class I activator on acrA and class II activator on micF , respectively. The authors present biochemical and structural data on RamA in complex with RNAP- σ 70 at the two promoters and the data reveal the molecular basis for how RamA assembles and interacts with core RNAP and activates transcription that contributes to antibiotic resistance.

However, its safety and stability are challenged by lithium dendrites and the leakage of liquid electrolyte. Here, a self-enhancing gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is created by in situ polymerizing 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) in the nanofibrous skeleton for enabling safe LMB. The nanofiber membrane possesses a better affinity with poly-DOL (PDOL) than commercial separator for constructing homogeneous GPE with enhanced ion conductivity. Furthermore, polydopamine is introduced on nanofiber membrane to form hydrogen bonding with PDOL and bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide anion, dramatically improving the mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and transference number of GPE. Besides, molecular dynamic simulation is used to reveal the intrinsic factors of high ionic conductivity and reinforcing effect in the meantime. Consequently, the LiFePO 4 //Li batteries using self-enhancing GPE show extraordinary cyclic stability over 800 cycles under high current density of 2 C, with a capacity decay of 0.021% per cycle, effectively suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites. This ingenious strategy is expected to manufacture advanced performance and high safety LMBs and compatible with the current battery production.},

Importantly, they feature high Seebeck coefficient ( S ) that are desirable in room-temperature wearable application scenarios under small temperature gradients. In this work, the authors have systematically investigated a series of D−A semiconducting copolymers possessing various electron-deficient A-units (e.g., BDD, TT, DPP) towards efficient OTEs. Upon p-type ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ) doping, the relationship between the thermoelectric characteristics and the electron-withdrawing ability of A-unit is largely elucidated. It is revealed that a strong D−A nature tends to induce an energetic disorder along the π -backbone, leading to an enlarged separation of the transport and Fermi levels, and consequently an increase of S . Meanwhile, the highly electron-deficient A-unit would impair electron transfer from D-unit to p-type dopants, thus decreasing the doping efficiency and electrical conductivity (σ). Ultimately, the peak power factor (PF) at room-temperature is obtained as high as 105.5 µW m −1 K −2 with an outstanding S of 247 µV K −1 in a paradigm OPV donor PBDB-T, which holds great potential in wearable electronics driven by a small temperature gradient.},

This review critically introduces the biomedical use of T7 phage, ranging from the detection of serological biomarkers and bacterial pathogens, recognition of cells or tissues with high affinity, design of gene vectors or vaccines, to targeted therapy of different challenging diseases (e.g., bacterial infection, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, inflammatory disease, and foot–mouth disease). It also discusses perspectives and challenges in exploring T7 phage, including the understanding of its interactions with human body, assembly into scaffolds for tissue regeneration, integration with genome editing, and theranostic use in clinics.

In this study, the protective effect of GA is tested in different ischemia models, i.e., in commonly used stroke models in mice and swine. The results show that GA, given during reperfusion, strongly protects against ischemic damage and improves functional outcome. Evidence that GA exerts its effect by counteracting the glutamate-dependent increase in intracellular calcium during excitotoxicity is provided. These results suggest that GA treatment has the potential to reduce mortality and disability in stroke patients.},

  abstract     = {The active stages of intestinal inflammation and the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis are associated with superficial mucosal damage and intermittent wounding that leads to epithelial barrier defects and increased permeability. The standard therapeutic interventions for colitis have focused mainly on maintaining the remission levels of the disease. Nonetheless, such treatment strategies (using anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory agents) do not address colitis&#39; root cause, especially the mucosal damage and dysregulated intestinal barrier functions. Restoration of barrier functionality by mucosal healing or physical barrier protecting strategies shall be considered as an initial event in the disease suppression and progression. Herein, a biphasic hyaluronan (HA) enema suspension, naïve-HA systems that protect the dysregulated gut epithelium by decreasing the inflammation, permeability, and helping in maintaining the epithelial barrier integrity in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mice model is reported. Furthermore, HA-based system modulates intestinal epithelial junctional proteins and regulatory signaling pathways, resulting in attenuation of inflammation and mucosal protection. The results suggest that HA-based system can be delivered as an enema to act as a barrier protecting system for managing distal colonic inflammatory diseases, including colitis.},

  abstract     = {The multivalent binding effect has been the subject of extensive studies to modulate adhesion behaviors of various biological and engineered systems. However, precise control over the strong avidity-based binding remains a significant challenge. Here, a set of engineering strategies are developed and tested to systematically enhance the multivalent binding of peptides in a stepwise manner. Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are employed to increase local peptide densities on a substrate, resulting in hierarchically multivalent architectures (HMAs) that display multivalent dendrimer–peptide conjugates (DPCs) with various configurations. To control binding behaviors, effects of the three major components of the HMAs are investigated: i) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) linkers as spacers between conjugated peptides; ii) multiple peptides on the DPCs; and iii) various surface arrangements of HMAs (i.e., a mixture of DPCs each containing different peptides vs DPCs cofunctionalized with multiple peptides). The optimized HMA configuration enables significantly enhanced target cell binding with high selectivity compared to the control surfaces directly conjugated with peptides. The engineering approaches presented herein can be applied individually or in combination, providing guidelines for the effective utilization of biomolecular multivalent interactions using DPC-based HMAs.},

Graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, black phosphorus, MXenes, and other 2D materials (metal oxides and degenerate semiconductors) have unique optical properties and play a unique role in the detection of different biomolecules. Through the modification of 2D materials, optical biosensor has the advantages that traditional sensors (such as electrical sensing) do not have, and the sensitivity and detection limit are greatly improved. Here, optical biosensors based on different 2D materials are reviewed. First, various detection methods of biomolecules, including surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and evanescent wave and properties, preparation and integration strategies of 2D material, are introduced in detail. Second, various biosensors based on 2D materials are summarized. Furthermore, the applications of these optical biosensors in biological imaging, food safety, pollution prevention/control, and biological medicine are discussed. Finally, the future development of optical biosensors is prospected. It is believed that with their in-depth research in the laboratory, optical biosensors will gradually become commercialized and improve people&#39;s quality of life in many aspects.},

  abstract     = {Liposomes can efficiently deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) into cells. When mRNA cocktails encoding different proteins are needed, a considerable challenge is to efficiently deliver all mRNAs into the cytosol of each individual cell. In this work, two methods are explored to co-deliver varying ratiometric doses of mRNA encoding red (R) or green (G) fluorescent proteins and it is found that packaging mRNAs into the same lipoplexes (mingle-lipoplexes) is crucial to efficiently deliver multiple mRNA types into the cytosol of individual cells according to the pre-defined ratio. A mixture of lipoplexes containing only one mRNA type (single-lipoplexes), however, seem to follow the “first come – first serve” principle, resulting in a large variation of R/G uptake and expression levels for individual cells leading to ratiometric dosing only on the population level, but rarely on the single-cell level. These experimental observations are quantitatively explained by a theoretical framework based on the stochasticity of mRNA uptake in cells and endosomal escape of mingle- and single-lipoplexes, respectively. Furthermore, the findings are confirmed in 3D retinal organoids and zebrafish embryos, where mingle-lipoplexes outperformed single-lipoplexes to reliably bring both mRNA types into single cells. This benefits applications that require a strict control of protein expression in individual cells.},

Herein, by introducing benzoyl to dibenzo[ a , c ]phenazine acceptor, a stronger electron acceptor, dibenzo[ a , c ]phenazin-11-yl(phenyl)methanone, is created and employed for constructing orange–red delayed fluorescence molecules with various acridine-based electron donors. The incorporation of benzoyl leads to red-shifted photoluminescence with accelerated RISC, reduced delayed lifetimes, and increased Φ PL s, and the adoption of spiro-structured acridine donors promotes horizontal dipole orientation and thus renders high Φ out s. Consequently, the state-of-the-art orange–red organic light-emitting diodes are achieved, providing record-high electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies of 33.5%, 95.3 cd A −1 , and 93.5 lm W ‒1 . By referring the control molecule without benzoyl, it is demonstrated that the presence of benzoyl can exert significant positive effect over improving delayed fluorescence and enhancing EL efficiencies, which can be a feasible design for robust organic luminescent materials.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur batteries possess high theoretical energy density but suffer from rapid capacity fade due to the shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides. Aiming at these problems, a biomimetic design of cofactor-assisted artificial enzyme catalyst, melamine (MM) crosslinked hemin on carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (i.e., [CNTs–MM–hemin]), is presented to efficiently convert polysulfides. The MM cofactors bind with the hemin artificial enzymes and CNT conductive substrates through FeN 5 coordination and/or covalent amide bonds to provide high and durable catalytic activity for polysulfide conversions, while π – π conjugations between hemin and CNTs and multiple Li-bond networks offered by MM endow the cathode with good electronic/Li + transmission ability. This synergistic mechanism enables rapid sulfur reaction kinetics, alleviated polysulfide shuttling, and an ultralow (&lt;1.3%) loss of hemin active sites in electrolyte, which is ≈60 times lower than those of noncovalent crosslinked samples. As a result, the Li–S battery using [CNTs–MM–hemin] cathode retains a capacity of 571 mAh g −1 after 900 cycles at 1C with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle. Even under raising sulfur loadings up to 7.5 mg cm −2 , the cathode still can steadily run 110 cycles with a capacity retention of 83%.},

  abstract     = {Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation in macrophages plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). While TLR inhibition is a promising strategy to control the overwhelming inflammation in ALI, there still lacks effective TLR inhibitors for clinical uses to date. A unique class of peptide-coated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) is previously discovered, which effectively inhibited TLR signaling and protected mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. To fast translate such a discovery into potential clinical applicable nanotherapeutics, herein an elegant strategy of “nano-enabled drug repurposing” with “nano-targeting” is introduced to empower the existing drugs for new uses. Combining transcriptome sequencing with Connectivity Map analysis, it is identified that the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) share similar mechanisms of action to the discovered GNP-based TLR inhibitor. It is confirmed that PPIs (including omeprazole) do inhibit endosomal TLR signaling and inflammatory responses in macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in an LPS-induced ALI mouse model. The omeprazole is then formulated into a nanoform with liposomes to enhance its macrophage targeting ability and the therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This research provides a new translational strategy of nano-enabled drug repurposing to translate bioactive nanoparticles into clinically used drugs and targeted nano-therapeutics for ALI.},

  abstract     = {Organic phosphorescence, originating from triplet excitons, has potential for the development of new generation of organic optoelectronic materials. Herein, two heavy-atom-free room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) electron acceptors with inherent long lifetime triplet exctions are first reported. These two 3D-fully conjugated rigid perylene imide (PDI) multimers, as the best nonfullerene wide-bandgap electron acceptors, exhibit a significantly elevated T 1 of ≈2.1 eV with a room-temperature phosphorescent emission ( τ = 66 µs) and a minimized singlet–triplet splitting as low as ≈0.13 eV. The huge spatial congestion between adjacent PDI skeleton endows them with significantly modified electronic characteristics of S 1 and T 1 . This feature, plus with the fully-conjugated rigid molecular configuration, balances the intersystem crossing rate and fluorescence/phosphorescence rates, and therefore, elevating E T1 to ≈2.1 from 1.2 eV for PDI monomer. Meanwhile, the highly delocalized feature enables the triplet charge-transfer excitons at donor–acceptor interface effectively dissociate into free charges, endowing the RTP electron acceptor based organic solar cells (OSCs) with a high internal quantum efficiency of 84% and excellent charge collection capability of 94%. This study introduces an alternative strategy for designing PDI derivatives with high-triplet state-energy and provides revelatory insights into the fundamental electronic characteristics, photophysical mechanism, and photo-to-current generation pathway.},

With the sharp shrinking size of large plasmonic metal nanoparticles (PMNPs), the contributions from the surface characteristics increase significantly, which brings both opportunities and challenges in the application-driven surface engineering of ULMNPs toward advanced biological applications. Here, the systematic advancements in the biological applications of ULMNPs from bioimaging to theranostics are summarized with emphasis on the versatile surface engineering strategies in the regulation of biological targeting and imaging performance. The efforts in the surface functionalization strategies of ULMNPs for enhanced disease targeting abilities are first discussed. Thereafter, self-assembly strategies of ULMNPs for fabricating multifunctional nanostructures for multimodal imaging and nanomedicine are discussed. Further, surface engineering strategies of ratiometric ULMNPs to enhance the imaging stability to address the imaging challenges in complicated bioenvironments are summarized. Finally, the phototoxicity of ULMNPs and future perspectives are also reviewed, which are expected to provide a fundamental understanding of the physicochemical properties and biological behaviors of ULMNPs to accelerate their future clinical applications in healthcare.},

In this work, the authors develop a facile and versatile plasma-induced nitrogen-doped Zn (N-Zn) foil for dendrite-free Zn metal anode. Benefitting from the uniform nucleation sites and enhanced surface kinetics, the N-Zn anode exhibits exceptionally low overpotential (around 23 mV) at 1 mA cm −2 and can be cycled for over 3000 h under 1 mA cm −2 because of the enhanced interface behavior. The potential application of N-Zn anode is also confirmed by introducing a full Zn/MnO 2 battery with outstanding capacity stability for 2000 cycles at 1 A g –1 . Overall, this work offers new fundamental insights into homogenizing Zn electrodeposition processes by pre-introduced active nucleation sites and provides a novel direction of interface design engineering for ultra-stable Zn metal anode.},

Solar energy is a clean and sustainable energy resource, potentially driving energy conversion and environmental remediation reactions. Thus, solar-driven chemistry is an attractive way to solve the two problems. Photothermal chemistry (PTC) is developed to achieve full-spectral utilization of the solar radiation and drive chemical reactions more efficiently under relatively mild conditions. In this review, the mechanisms of PTC are summarized from the aspects of thermal and non-thermal effects, and then the interaction and synergy between these two effects are sorted out. In this paper, distinguishing and quantifying these two effects is discussed to understand PTC processes better and to design PTC catalysts more methodically. However, PTC is still a little far away from practical. Herein, several key points, which must be considered when pushing ahead with the engineering application of PTC, are proposed, along with some workable suggestions on the practical application. This review provides a unique perspective on PTC, focusing on the synergistic effects and pointing out a possible direction for practical application.},

  abstract     = {Ultralong room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is highly useful for information encryption, organic electronics, bioelectronics, etc. However, the preparation of related metal-free materials with multiple colors across the full spectrum remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile method is developed to fabricate boron-doped carbon dot (B-CD) composites with full-color long lifetime RTP continuously tailorable in the range of 466–638 nm simply by pyrolysis of the citric acid and boric acid precursors with various mass ratios at different temperatures. This leads to the formation of luminescent B-CD centers in a rigid polycrystalline B 2 O 3 matrix, which effectively stabilizes the triplet excited states of B-CDs. Thus, the composites become phosphorescent over a relatively long period (5–12 s) after the removal of the irradiation source. Meanwhile, the increased particle size and oxidation degree of B-CDs obtained at larger citric acid feeding or higher pyrolysis temperature continuously shift the phosphorescence from blue to red. Due to the formation of multiple luminescence centers, the RTP can also be finely modulated by the excitation wavelength. The resulting B-CD composites with highly tunable long lifetime RTP further allow a variety of distinctive applications in multidimensional encryption handily utilizing space, time, and color variations.},

Here, the realization of multilayer heterstructures of the van der Waals semiconductors SnS and GeS with lateral interfaces spanning up to several hundred individual layers is demonstrated. Structural and chemical imaging identifies {110} interfaces that are perpendicular to the (001) layer plane and are laterally localized and sharp on a 10 nm scale across the entire thickness.

However, the constituent electrocatalysts and the sulfur reactants have vastly different molecular sizes, which ultimately restrict electrocatalysis efficiency and hamper device performance. Herein, the authors report that aggregates of cobalt single-atom catalysts (SACs) attached to graphene via porphyrins can overcome the challenges associated with the catalyst/reactant size mismatch. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the Co atoms present in the SAC aggregates exist as single atoms with spatially resolved dimensions that are commensurate the sulfur species found in sulfur cathodes and thus fully accessible to enable 100% atomic utilization efficiency in electrocatalysis. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the Co SAC aggregates can interact with the sulfur species in a synergistic manner that enhances the electrocatalytic effect and promote the performance of sulfur cathodes. For example, Li–S cells prepared from the Co SAC aggregates exhibit outstanding capacity retention (i.e., 505 mA h g –1 at 0.5 C after 600 cycles) and excellent rate capability (i.e., 648 mA h g −1 at 6 C). An ultrahigh area specific capacity of 12.52 mA h cm −2 is achieved at a high sulfur loading of 11.8 mg cm –2 .},

Here, mimicking the microstructures of both cuit cocoon possessing super-flexible property and Mimosa leaf featuring reversible scatheless folding, super-foldable C-web/FeOOH-nanocone (SFCFe) conductive nanocomposites are prepared, which display cone-arrays on fiber structures similar to Mimosa leaf, as well as non-crosslinked junctions, slidable nanofibers, separable layers, and compressible network like cuit cocoon. Remarkably, the SFCFe can undergo over 100 000 times of repeated true-folding without structural damage or electrical conductivity degradation. The mechanism underlying this super-foldable performance is further investigated by real-time scanning electron microscopy folding characterization and finite-element simulations. The results indicate its self-adaptive stress-dispersion mechanism originating from multilevel biomimetic structures. Notably, the SFCFe demonstrates its prospect as a super-foldable anode electrode for aqueous batteries, which shows not only high capacities and satisfactory cycling stability, but also completely coincident cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge curves throughout the 100 000 times of true-folding.

The potential functional differences among NPC subpopulations are analyzed. Predictive transcripts, transcriptional factors, and signal pathways with respect to degeneration grades are explored. It is reported that fibroNPCs is the subpopulation for end-stage degeneration. CD90+NPCs are observed to be progenitor cells in degenerative NP tissues. NP-infiltrating immune cells comprise a previously unrecognized diversity of cell types, including granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs). Integrin α M (CD11b) and oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1) as surface markers of NP-derived G-MDSCs are uncovered. The G-MDSCs are found to be enriched in mildly degenerated (grade II and III) NP tissues compared to severely degenerated (grade IV and V) NP tissues. Their immunosuppressive function and alleviation effects on NPCs’ matrix degradation are revealed in vitro.

  abstract     = {Formation of blood clots, particularly the fibrin network and fibrin network-mediated early inflammatory responses, plays a critical role in determining the eventual tissue repair or regeneration following an injury. Owing to the potential role of fibrin network in mediating clot-immune responses, it is of great importance to determine whether clot-immune responses can be regulated via modulating the parameters of fibrin network. Since the diameter of D-terminal of a fibrinogen molecule is 9 nm, four different pore sizes (2, 8, 14, and 20 nm) are rationally selected to design mesoporous silica to control the fibrinogen adsorption and modulate the subsequent fibrin formation process. The fiber becomes thinner and the contact area with macrophages decreases when the pore diameters of mesoporous silica are greater than 9 nm. Importantly, these thinner fibers grown in pores with diameters larger than 9 nm inhibit the M1-polorazation of macrophages and reduce the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by macrophages. These thinner fibers reduce inflammation of macrophages through a potential signaling pathway of cell adhesion-cytoskeleton assembly-inflammatory responses. Thus, the successful regulation of the clot-immune responses via tuning of the mesoporous pore sizes indicates the feasibility of developing advanced clot-immune regulatory materials.},

Herein, the authors develop a new type of reconfigurable fluoride (such as CoF 2 ) pre-catalysts, with ultra-fast and in-depth self-reconstruction, substantially promoting HER activity. By experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the unique surface structure of fluorides, alkaline electrolyte and bias voltage are identified as key factors for complete reconstruction during HER. The enrichment of F atoms on surface of fluorides provides the feasibility of spontaneous and continuous reconstruction. The alkaline electrolyte triggers rapid F − leaching and supplies an immediate complement of OH − to form amorphous α -Co(OH) 2 which rapidly transforms into β -Co(OH) 2 . The bias voltage promotes amorphous crystallization and accelerates the reconstruction process. These endow the generation of mono-component and crystalline β -Co(OH) 2 with a loose and defective structure, leading to an ultra-low overpotential of 54 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and super long-term stability exceeding that of Pt/C. Moreover, DFT calculations confirm that F − leaching optimizes hydrogen and water adsorption energies, boosting HER kinetics. Impressively, the self-reconstruction is also applicable to other non-noble transition metal fluorides. The work builds the fundamental comprehension of complete self-reconstruction during HER and provides a new perspective to conceive advanced catalysts.},

  abstract     = {3D printing of fiber-reinforced composites is expected to be the forefront technology for the next-generation high-strength, high-toughness, and lightweight structural materials. The intrinsic architecture of 3D-printed composites closely represents biomimetic micro/macrofibril-like hierarchical structure composed of intermediate filament assembly among the micron-sized reinforcing fibers, and thus contributes to a novel mechanism to simultaneously improve mechanical properties and structural features. Notably, it is found that an interfacial heterogeneity between numerous inner interfaces in the hierarchical structure enables an exceptional increase in the toughness of composites. The strong interfacial adhesion between the fibers and matrix, with accompanying the inherently weak interfacial adhesion between intermediate filaments and the resultant interfacial voids, provide a close representation of the toughness behavior of natural architectures relying on the localized heterogeneity. Given the critical embedment length of fiber reinforcement, extraordinary improvement has been attained not only in the strength but also in toughness taking advantage of the synergy effect from the aforementioned nature-inspired features. Indeed, the addition of a small amount of short fiber to the brittle bio-filaments results in a noticeable increase of more than 200% in the tensile strength and modulus with further elongation increment. This article highlights the inherent structural hierarchy of 3D-printed composites and the relevant sophisticated mechanism for anomalous mechanical reinforcement.},

  abstract     = {The use of engineered scaffolds or stem cells is investigated widely in the repair of injured musculoskeletal tissue. However, the combined regeneration of hierarchical osteochondral tissue remains a challenge due to delamination between cartilage and subchondral bone or difficulty in spatial control over differentiation of transplanted stem cells. Here, two types of composite spheroids are prepared using adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and nanofibers coated with either transforming growth factor- β 3 or bone morphogenetic growth factor-2 for chondrogenesis or osteogenesis, respectively. Each type of spheroid is then cultured within a 3D-printed microchamber in a spatially arranged manner to recapitulate the bilayer structure of osteochondral tissue. The presence of inductive factors regionally modulates in vitro chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs within the biphasic construct without dedifferentiation. Furthermore, hADSCs from each spheroid proliferate and sprout and successfully connect the two layers mimicking the osteochondral interface without apertures. In vivo transplantation of the biphasic construct onto a femoral trochlear groove defect in rabbit knee joint results in 21.2 ± 2.8% subchondral bone volume/total volume and a cartilage score of 25.0 ± 3.7. The present approach can be an effective therapeutic platform to engineer complex tissue.},

In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and in situ transmission electron microscope observations are applied to gain deep insight into the intermediate Li 3+ x VO 4 and Li 3+ y VO 4 phases during the lithiation/delithiation mechanism. The first-principle calculations show that lithium ions migrate into the nanosphere wall rapidly along the (100) plane. Furthermore, the Li 3 VO 4 hollow nanospheres deliver an outstanding reversible capacity (299.6 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles) and excellent cycling stability (a capacity retention of 99.0% after 500 cycles) at 200 mA g −1 .

  abstract     = {Carbon-based nanomaterials have been regarded as promising non-noble metal catalysts for renewable energy conversion system (e.g., fuel cells and metal–air batteries). In general, graphitic skeleton and porous structure are both critical for the performances of carbon-based catalysts. However, the pursuit of high surface area while maintaining high graphitization degree remains an arduous challenge because of the trade-off relationship between these two key characteristics. Herein, a simple yet efficient approach is demonstrated to fabricate a class of 2D N-doped graphitized porous carbon nanosheets (GPCNSs) featuring both high crystallinity and high specific surface area by utilizing amine aromatic organoalkoxysilane as an all-in-one precursor and FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O as an active salt template. The highly porous structure of the as-obtained GPCNSs is mainly attributed to the alkoxysilane-derived SiO x nanodomains that function as micro/mesopore templates; meanwhile, the highly crystalline graphitic skeleton is synergistically contributed by the aromatic nucleus of the precursor and FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O. The unusual integration of graphitic skeleton with porous structure endows GPCNSs with superior catalytic activity and long-term stability when used as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and Zn–air batteries. These findings will shed new light on the facile fabrication of highly porous carbon materials with desired graphitic structure for numerous applications.},

Toward this end, in addition to physicochemical characteristics essential for printing, bioinks need to possess proregenerative attributes, while enabling printing of stable structures with a defined biological function that survives implantation and evolves in vivo into functional tissue. With a focus on bioinks for extrusion-based bioprinting, this perspective review advocates a rigorous biology-based approach to engineering bioinks, emphasizing efficiency, reproducibility, and a streamlined translation process that places the clinical endpoint front and center.

As the NO-loadable copper-benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (HKUST-1) MOF is encapsulated with graphene oxide (GO), the resultant NO@HKUST-1@GO microparticles (NHGs) are imparted with the feature of near-infrared ray (NIR) photothermal response, which facilitate the controlled release of NO molecules. When these NHGs are embedded in a porous PEGDA-MN, the porous structure, larger specific surface area, and sufficient mechanical strength of the integrated MN could promote a more accurate and deeper delivery of NO molecules into the wound site. By applying the resultant NHG-MN to the wound of a type I diabetic rat model, the authors demonstrate that it is capable of accelerating vascularization, tissue regeneration, and collagen deposition, indicating its bright prospect applied in wound healing and other therapeutic scenarios.},

Herein, noble metal-free and ultrathin ZnIn 2 S 4 (ZIS) is reported as an effective photocatalyst for visible light-driven reductive deuteration of carbonyls to produce deuterated alcohols using heavy water (D 2 O) as the sole deuterium source. Defective two-dimensional ZIS nanosheets (D-ZIS) are prepared in a surfactant assisted bottom-up route exhibited much enhanced performance than the pristine ZIS counterpart. A systematic study is carried out to elucidate the contributing factors and it is found that the in situ surfactant modification enabled D-ZIS to expose more defect sites for charge carrier separation and active D-species generation, as well as high specific surface area, all of which are beneficial for the desirable deuteration reaction. This work highlights the great potential in developing low-cost semiconductor-based photocatalysts for organic deuteration in D 2 O, circumventing expensive deuterium reagents and harsh conditions.},

The high RNA input requirement is attributed to significant sample loss associated with library preparation using solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads. A novel solid-phase catalysis strategy for RNA library preparation to circumvent the need for SPRI bead purification to remove enzymes is reported here. This new approach leverages concurrent processing of non-polyadenylated transcripts with immobilized poly(A) polymerase and T4 DNA ligase, followed by directly loading the prepared library onto a flow cell. Whole transcriptome sequencing, using a human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes as a model, demonstrates this new method displays little sample loss, takes much less time, and generates higher sequencing throughput correlated with reduced nanopore fouling compared to the current library preparation for 500 ng input. Consequently, this approach enables Nanopore low-input direct RNA-seq, improving pathogen detection and transcript identification in a microbial community standard with spike-in transcript controls. Besides, as evident in the bioinformatic analysis, the new method provides accurate RNA consensus with high fidelity and identifies higher numbers of expressed genes for both high and low input RNA amounts.},

Substantial periosteal bone formation is generated by external mechanical stimuli, yet its mechanism is poorly understood. Here, it is shown that myeloid-lineage cells differentiate into subgroups and regulate periosteal bone formation in response to mechanical loading. Mechanical loading on tibiae significantly increases the number of periosteal myeloid-lineage cells and the levels of active transforming growth factor β (TGF- β ), resulting in cortical bone formation. Knockout of Tgfb1 in myeloid-lineage cells attenuates mechanical loading-induced periosteal bone formation in mice. Moreover, CD68 + F4/80 + macrophages, a subtype of myeloid-lineage cells, express and activate TGF- β 1 for recruitment of osteoprogenitors. Particularly, mechanical loading induces the differentiation of periosteal CD68 + F4/80 − myeloid-lineage cells to the CD68 + F4/80 + macrophages via signaling of piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1) for TGF- β 1 secretion. Importantly, CD68 + F4/80 + macrophages activate TGF- β 1 by expression and secretion of thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1). Administration of Thbs1 inhibitor significantly impairs loading-induced TGF- β activation and recruitment of osteoprogenitors in the periosteum. The results suggest that periosteal myeloid-lineage cells respond to mechanical forces and consequently produce and activate TGF- β 1 for periosteal bone formation.},

Raman spectra collected on two British variant sub-types found in Japan (QK002 and QHN001) are compared with that of the original Japanese isolate (JPN/TY/WK-521), and found bold vibrational differences. These included: i) fractions of sulfur-containing amino acid rotamers, ii) hydrophobic interactions of tyrosine phenol ring, iii) apparent fractions of RNA purines and pyrimidines, and iv) protein secondary structures. Building upon molecular scale results and their statistical validations, the authors propose to represent virus variants with a barcode specially tailored on Raman spectrum.

  abstract     = {COVID-19 is infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can cause severe multiple organ injury and death. Kidney is one of major target organs of COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, mechanisms through which COVID-19 causes AKI remain largely unknown and treatment remains unspecific and ineffective. Here, the authors report that normal kidney-specifically overexpressing SARS-CoV-2 N develops AKI, which worsens in mice under ischemic condition. Mechanistically, it is uncovered that SARS-CoV-2 N-induced AKI is Smad3-dependent as SARS-CoV-2 N protein can interact with Smad3 and enhance TGF- β /Smad3 signaling to cause tubular epithelial cell death and AKI via the G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism. This is further confirmed in Smad3 knockout mice and cells in which deletion of Smad3 protects against SARS-CoV-2 N protein-induced cell death and AKI in vivo and in vitro. Most significantly, it is also found that targeting Smad3 with a Smad3 pharmacological inhibitor is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 N-induced AKI. In conclusion, the authors identify that SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a key mediator for AKI and induces AKI via the Smad3-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism. Targeting Smad3 may represent as a novel therapy for COVID-19-asscoaited AKI.},

  abstract     = {H 2 O 2 plays a significant role in a range of physiological processes where it performs vital tasks in redox signaling. The sensitivity of many biological pathways to H 2 O 2 opens up a unique direction in the development of bioelectronics devices to control levels of reactive-oxygen species (ROS). Here a microfabricated ROS modulation device that relies on controlled faradaic reactions is presented. A concentric pixel arrangement of a peroxide-evolving cathode surrounded by an anode ring which decomposes the peroxide, resulting in localized peroxide delivery is reported. The conducting polymer (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), is exploited as the cathode. PEDOT selectively catalyzes the oxygen reduction reaction resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Using electrochemical and optical assays, combined with modeling, the performance of the devices is benchmarked. The concentric pixels generate tunable gradients of peroxide and oxygen concentrations. The faradaic devices are prototyped by modulating human H 2 O 2 -sensitive Kv7.2/7.3 (M-type) channels expressed in a single-cell model ( Xenopus laevis oocytes). The Kv7 ion channel family is responsible for regulating neuronal excitability in the heart, brain, and smooth muscles, making it an ideal platform for faradaic ROS stimulation. The results demonstrate the potential of PEDOT to act as an H 2 O 2 delivery system, paving the way to ROS-based organic bioelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a mental disorder affecting more than 300 million people in the world. Abnormalities in white matter are associated with the development of depression. Here, the authors show that mice with oligodendrocyte-specific deletion of Nerve injury-induced protein 2 （Ninj2) exhibit depressive-like behaviors. Loss of Ninj2 in oligodendrocytes inhibits oligodendrocyte development and myelination, and impairs neuronal structure and activities. Ninj2 competitively inhibits TNF α /TNFR1 signaling pathway by directly binding to TNFR1 in oligodendrocytes. Loss of Ninj2 activates TNF α -induced necroptosis, and increases C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (Ccl2) production, which might mediate the signal transduction from oligodendrocyte to neurons. Inhibition of necroptosis by Nec-1s administration synchronously restores oligodendrocyte development, improves neuronal excitability, and alleviates depressive-like behaviors. This study thus illustrates the role of Ninj2 in the development of depression and myelination, reveals the relationship between oligodendrocytes and neurons, and provides a potential therapeutic target for depression.},

  abstract     = {Peripheral nerves carry sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) signals between the central nervous system and other parts of the body. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is therefore rich in targets for therapeutic neuromodulation, bioelectronic medicine, and neuroprosthetics. Peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs) generally suffer from a tradeoff between selectivity and invasiveness. This work describes the fabrication, evaluation, and chronic implantation in zebra finches of a novel PNI that breaks this tradeoff by interfacing with small nerves. This PNI integrates a soft, stretchable microelectrode array with a 2-photon 3D printed microclip (μcPNI). The advantages of this μcPNI compared to other designs are: a) increased spatial resolution due to bi-layer wiring of the electrode leads, b) reduced mismatch in biomechanical properties with the nerve, c) reduced disturbance to the host tissue due to the small size, d) elimination of sutures or adhesives, e) high circumferential contact with small nerves, f) functionality under considerable strain, and g) graded neuromodulation in a low-threshold stimulation regime. Results demonstrate that the μcPNIs are electromechanically robust, and are capable of reliably recording and stimulating neural activity in vivo in small nerves. The μcPNI may also inform the development of new optical, thermal, ultrasonic, or chemical PNIs as well.},

For cultivated meat to fully mimic conventional meat&#39;s organoleptic and nutritional properties, innovations in scaffolding technology are required. Many scaffolding technologies are already developed for use in biomedical tissue engineering. However, cultivated meat production comes with a unique set of constraints related to the scale and cost of production as well as the necessary attributes of the final product, such as texture and food safety. This review discusses the properties of vertebrate skeletal muscle that will need to be replicated in a successful product and the current state of scaffolding innovation within the cultivated meat industry, highlighting promising scaffold materials and techniques that can be applied to cultivated meat development. Recommendations are provided for future research into scaffolds capable of supporting the growth of high-quality meat while minimizing production costs. Although the development of appropriate scaffolds for cultivated meat is challenging, it is also tractable and provides novel opportunities to customize meat properties.},

In this study, an optical coherence tomography-based peripheral nerve imaging platform that employs a newly proposed depth of focus extension technique is reported. A point spread function with the finest transverse resolution of 1.27 µm enables the cellular-level volumetric visualization of the metal wire and microstructural changes in a rat sciatic nerve with the metal wire inserted in vivo. Further, the feasibility of applying the imaging platform to large animals for a preclinical study is confirmed through in vivo rabbit sciatic nerve imaging. It is expected that new possibilities for the successful chronic implantation of an intra-neural interface will open up by providing the 3D microstructural changes of nerves around the inserted electrode.},

As a result, in vitro model systems of liver epithelium are needed to further mechanistic insight of biliary tissue assembly. Here, primary human intrahepatic cholangiocytes as a candidate population for such a platform are systematically evaluated, and conditions that direct their branching morphogenesis are described. It is found that extracellular matrix presentation, coupled with mitogen stimulation, promotes biliary branching in a Notch-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the utility of using 3D scaffolds for mechanistic investigation of cholangiocyte branching and provide a gateway to integrate biliary architecture in additional in vitro models of liver tissue.},

Comprehensive sample analysis revealed dysregulation of FGL1/LAG-3 and PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoints in allogeneic heart transplantation mice and clinical kidney transplant patients. In order to enhance these two immunosuppressive signal axes, a bioengineering strategy is developed to simultaneously display FGL1/PD-L1 (FP) on the surface of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Among various cell sources, FP sEVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) not only enriches FGL1/PD-L1 expression but also maintain the immunomodulatory properties of unmodified MSC sEVs. Next, it is confirmed that FGL1 and PD-L1 on sEVs are specifically bound to their receptors, LAG-3 and PD-1 on target cells. Importantly, FP sEVs significantly inhibite T cell activation and proliferation in vitro and a heart allograft model. Furthermore, FP sEVs encapsulated with low-dose FK506 (FP sEVs@FK506) exert stronger effects on inhibiting T cell proliferation, reducing CD8 + T cell density and cytokine production in the spleens and heart grafts, inducing regulatory T cells in lymph nodes, and extending graft survival. Taken together, dual-targeting sEVs have the potential to boost the immune inhibitory signalings in synergy and slow down transplant rejection.},

In this study, humanized AC3 knock-in mice that are resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity are generated, and increases in the number and length of cilia in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) are shown. It is demonstrated that mice with specifically knocked down ciliary AC3 expression in the VMH show pronounced HFD-induced obesity. In addition, in vitro and in vivo analyses of the VMH show that ciliary AC3 regulates autophagy by binding an autophagy-related gene, gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Mice with GABARAP knockdown in the VMH exhibit exacerbated HFD-induced obesity. Overall, the findings may reveal a potential mechanism by which ciliary AC3 expression regulates body weight in the mouse VMH.},

However, the biological mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. In the present study, PM 2.5 -treated HBE cells-secreted extracellular vesicles (PM 2.5 -EVs) caused cytotoxicity in “horizontal” HBE cells and increased the contractility of “longitudinal” sensitive human bronchial smooth muscle cells (HBSMCs). RNA sequencing showed that let-7i-5p is significantly overexpressed in PM 2.5 -EVs and asthmatic plasma; additionally, its level is correlated with PM 2.5 exposure in children with asthma. The combination of EV-packaged let-7i-5p and the traditional clinical biomarker IgE exhibits the best diagnostic performance (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.855, 95% CI = 0.786–0.923). Mechanistically, let-7i-5p is packaged into PM 2.5 -EVs by interacting with ELAVL1 and internalized by both “horizontal” recipient HBE cells and “longitudinal” recipient-sensitive HBSMCs, with subsequent activation of the MAPK signaling pathway via suppression of its target DUSP1 . Furthermore, an injection of EV-packaged let-7i-5p into PM 2.5 -treated juvenile mice aggravated asthma symptoms. This comprehensive study deciphered the remodeling of the extracellular environment mediated by the secretion of let-7i-5p-enriched EVs during PM 2.5 -induced asthma attacks and identified plasma EV-packaged let-7i-5p as a novel predictor of childhood asthma.},

  abstract     = {Binding of different ligands to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) may induce different conformational changes and even trigger completely opposite biological functions. To understand the allosteric communication within the GR ligand binding domain, the folding pathway of helix 12 (H12) induced by the binding of the agonist dexamethasone (DEX), antagonist RU486, and modulator AZD9567 are explored by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state model analysis. The ligands can regulate the volume of the activation function-2 through the residues Phe737 and Gln738. Without ligand or with agonist binding, H12 swings from inward to outward to visit different folding positions. However, the binding of RU486 or AZD9567 perturbs the structural state, and the passive antagonist state appears more stable. Structure-based virtual screening and in vitro bioassays are used to discover novel GR ligands that bias the conformation equilibria toward the passive antagonist state. HP-19 exhibits the best anti-inflammatory activity (IC 50 = 0.041 ± 0.011 µ m ) in nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway, which is comparable to that of DEX. HP-19 also does not induce adverse effect-related transactivation functions of GR. The novel ligands discovered here may serve as promising starting points for the development of GR modulators.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable solutions on fabricating and using a face mask to block the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread during this coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) are required as society is directed by the World Health Organization (WHO) toward wearing it, resulting in an increasingly huge demand with over 4 000 000 000 masks used per day globally. Herein, various new mask technologies and advanced materials are reviewed to deal with critical shortages, cross-infection, and secondary transmission risk of masks. A number of countries have used cloth masks and 3D-printed masks as substitutes, whose filtration efficiencies can be improved by using nanofibers or mixing other polymers into them. Since 2020, researchers continue to improve the performance of masks by adding various functionalities, for example using metal nanoparticles and herbal extracts to inactivate pathogens, using graphene to make masks photothermal and superhydrophobic, and using triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to prolong mask lifetime. The recent advances in material technology have led to the development of antimicrobial coatings, which are introduced in this review. When incorporated into masks, these advanced materials and technologies can aid in the prevention of secondary transmission of the virus.},

  abstract     = {To utilize thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) technology for future displays, it is necessary to develop host materials which harness the full potential of blue TADF emitters. However, no publication has reported such hosts yet. Although the most popular host for blue TADF, bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]ether oxide (DPEPO) guarantees high-maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE max ) TADF devices, they exhibit very short operational lifetimes. In contrast, long-lifespan blue TADF devices employing stable hosts such as 3′,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-carbonitrile (mCBP-CN) exhibit much lower EQE max than the DPEPO-employed devices. Here, an elaborative approach for designing host molecules is suggested to achieve simultaneously stable and efficient blue TADF devices. The approach is based on engineering the molecular geometry, ground- and excited-state dipole moments of host molecules. The engineered hosts significantly enhance delayed fluorescence quantum yields of TADF emitters, as stabilizing the charge-transfer excited states of the TADF emitters and suppressing exciton quenching, and improve the charge balance. Moreover, they exhibit both photochemical and electrochemical stabilities. The best device employing one of the engineered hosts exhibits 79% increase in EQE max compared to the mCBP-CN-employed device, together with 140% and 92-fold increases in operational lifetime compared to the respective mCBP-CN- and the DPEPO-based devices.},

  abstract     = {The placenta has a lifelong impact on the health of both the mother and fetus. Despite its significance, human early placental development is poorly understood due to the limited models. The models that can reflect the key features of early human placental development, especially at early gestation, are still lacking. Here, the authors report the generation of trophoblast-like tissue model from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. hPSCs efficiently self-organize into blastocoel-like cavities under defined conditions, which produce different trophoblast subtypes, including cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs), and invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). The 3D cultures can exhibit microvilli structure and secrete human placenta-specific hormone. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis further identifies the presence of major cell types of trophoblast-like tissue as existing in vivo. The results reveal the feasibility to establish 3D trophoblast-like tissue model from hPSCs in vitro, which is not obtained by monolayer culture. This new model system can not only facilitate to dissect the underlying mechanisms of early human placental development, but also imply its potential for study in developmental biology and gestational disorders.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is identified as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems due to its ultra-high theoretical energy density up to 2600 Wh kg −1 . However, Li metal anode suffers from dramatic volume change during cycling, continuous corrosion by polysulfide electrolyte, and dendrite formation, rendering limited cycling lifespan. Considering Li metal anode as a double-edged sword that contributes to ultrahigh energy density as well as limited cycling lifespan, it is necessary to evaluate Li-based alloy as anode materials to substitute Li metal for high-performance Li–S batteries. In this contribution, the authors systematically evaluate the potential and feasibility of using Li metal or Li-based alloys to construct Li–S batteries with an actual energy density of 500 Wh kg −1 . A quantitative analysis method is proposed by evaluating the required amount of electrolyte for a targeted energy density. Based on a three-level (ideal material level, practical electrode level, and pouch cell level) analysis, highly lithiated lithium–magnesium (Li–Mg) alloy is capable to achieve 500 Wh kg −1 Li–S batteries besides Li metal. Accordingly, research on Li–Mg and other Li-based alloys are reviewed to inspire a promising pathway to realize high-energy-density and long-cycling Li–S batteries.},

However, their practical application has been impeded owing to the electronic insulation of sulfur and its intermediates, serious shuttle effect, large volume variation, and uncontrollable formation of lithium dendrites. Over the past decades, many pioneering strategies have been developed to address these issues via improving electrodes, electrolytes, separators and binders. Remarkably, polymers can be readily applied to all these aspects due to their structural designability, functional versatility, superior chemical stability and processability. Moreover, their lightweight and rich resource characteristics enable the production of LSBs with high-volume energy density at low cost. Surprisingly, there have been few reviews on development of polymers in LSBs. Herein, breakthroughs and future perspectives of emerging polymers in LSBs are scrutinized. Significant attention is centered on recent implementation of polymers in each component of LSBs with an emphasis on intrinsic mechanisms underlying their specific functions. The review offers a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art polymers for LSBs, provides in-depth insights into addressing key challenges, and affords important resources for researchers working on electrochemical energy systems.},

Although there are some progresses in the liquid unidirectional penetration using a variety of Janus membranes with anisotropic wettability, it still remains a great difficulty for single-layer Janus membranes with straight pore to balance spontaneous liquid penetration in positive direction and superior liquid resistance in the reverse direction. Herein, a liquid-assisted strategy for single-layer Janus membrane is developed, which can efficiently decrease the critical breakthrough pressure from superhydrophobic side to hydrophilic side and show little influence on that in the reverse direction. Consequently, unidirectional water penetration with high hydraulic pressure difference can be achieved. The Laplace pressure change along the thickness of the single-layer Janus membranes is further discussed, and the mechanism by which the auxiliary liquid decreases the critical breakthrough pressure is revealed. Furthermore, this Janus membrane with unidirectional water penetration “diode” performance can be used to prevent liquid backflow in intravenous transfusion. It is believed that this work can open an avenue for people to design single-layer Janus membrane with high pressure difference and find wide applications in unidirectional liquid transport.},

Ag 9 -AgTPyP eliminates over 99.99999% and 99.999% methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) within 2 h upon visible-light irradiation, which are superior to a majority of bacteria inactivation photocatalysts. The novel-established long-term charge-transfer states from AgTPyP to adjacent Ag 9 cluster that has preferential affinity to O 2 greatly promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) production efficiency; and its unique framework accelerates the ROS transportation. Personal protective equipment (masks and protective suits) incorporating Ag 9 -AgTPyP film also shows excellent performances against superbugs. This superbugs-killing efficiency is unprecedented among silver complexes and porphyrin derivatives. Utilizing efficient photogenerated electrons and holes between metal cluster and linkers can open up new interests of research in photocatalytic areas.},

  abstract     = {The 1T phase of MoS 2 has been widely reported to be highly active toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is expected to restrict the competitive nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). However, in this work, a prototype of active sites separation over 1T-MoS 2 is proposed by DFT calculations that the Mo-edge and S atoms on the basal plane exhibit different catalytic NRR and HER selectivity, and a new role-playing synergistic mechanism is also well enabled for the multistep NRR, which is further experimentally confirmed. More importantly, a self-sacrificial strategy using g-C 3 N 4 as templates is proposed to synthesize 1T-MoS 2 with an ultrahigh 1T content (75.44%, named as CNMS, representing the composition elements of C, N, Mo, and S), which yields excellent NRR performances with an ammonia formation rate of 71.07 µg h –1 mg –1 cat. at −0.5 V versus RHE and a Faradic efficiency of 21.01%. This work provides a promising new orientation of synchronizing the selectivity and activity for the multistep catalytic reactions.},

Herein, a multimodal multi-shank fluorescence neural probe that allows cell-type-specific electrophysiology from multiple deep-brain regions at a high spatiotemporal resolution is presented. A photodiode and an electrode-array pair are monolithically integrated on each tip of a minimal-form-factor silicon device. Both fluorescence and electrical signals are successfully measured simultaneously in GCaMP6f expressing mice, and the cell type from sorted neural spikes is identified. The probe&#39;s capability of combined electro-optical recordings for cell-type-specific electrophysiology at multiple brain regions within a neural circuit is demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ads) have gained great attention in cancer therapy because they cause direct cytolytic infection and indirectly induce antitumor immunity. However, their efficacy is compromised by host antiviral immune response, poor tumor delivery, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a natural killer (NK) cell-mediated Ad delivery system (Ad@NK) is generated by harnessing the merits of the two components for combinational immunotherapy and virotherapy of cancer. In this biohybrid system, NK cells with a tumor-homing tropism act as bioreactors and shelters for the loading, protection, replication, amplification, and release of Ads, thereby leading to a highly efficient systemic tumor-targeted delivery. As feedback, Ad infection offers NK cells an enhanced antitumor immunity by activating type I interferon signaling in a STAT4-granzyme B-dependent manner. Moreover, it is found that the Ad@NK system can relieve immunosuppression in the TME by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and the polarization of macrophages to M1 phenotype. Both in vitro and in vivo data indicate the excellent antitumor and antimetastatic functions of Ad@NKs by destroying tumor cells, inducing immunogenic cell death, and immunomodulating TME. This work provides a clinical basis for improved oncolytic virotherapy in combination with NK cell therapy based on the inter-supplementary biohybrid system.},

That is, a negative differential friction coefficient μ can be realized, which thus simultaneously breaking the classic Da Vinci–Amontons law.

  abstract     = {Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) show several limitations, such as high flammability and Li dendrite growth. All-solid-state LMBs (ASSLMBs) are promising alternatives to conventional liquid electrolyte (LE)-based LMBs. However, it is challenging to prepare a solid electrolyte with both high ionic conductivity and low electrode–electrolyte interfacial resistance. In this study, to overcome these problems, a solid composite electrolyte (SCE) consisting of Li 6.25 La 3 Zr 2 Al 0.25 O 12 and polyvinylidene fluoride- co -hexafluoropropylene is used, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years as a solid-state electrolyte. To operate LMBs without an LE, optimization of the electrode–solid-electrolyte interface is crucial. To achieve this, physical and chemical treatments are performed, i.e., direct growth of each layer by drop casting and thermal evaporation, and plasma treatment before the Li evaporation process, respectively. The optimized ASSLMB (amorphous V 2 O 5− x (1 µm)/SCE (30 µm)/Li film (10 µm)) has a high discharge capacity of 136.13 mAh g −1 (at 50 °C and 5 C), which is 90% of that of an LMB with an LE. It also shows good cycling performance (&gt;99%) over 1000 cycles. Thus, the proposed design minimizes the electrode–solid-electrolyte interfacial resistance, and is expected to be suitable for integration with existing commercial processes.},

A transdermal patch integrated directly with the microfluidics supports passive, sustained delivery of these species to the body throughout a period of wear. Comparisons of measurement results to those from traditional lab analysis methods demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this platform.

However, non-ideal comprehensive performance (such as color contrast and retention time cannot be combined, unsatisfactory repeatability, and non-automated coloring mode) significantly hinder their development toward high-end products. Herein, the development of LCM s that exhibit long retention time, good color contrast, repeatability, and the property of automatic coloring is reported. The realization of this goal stems from the adoption of a bio-inspired multi-component collaborative step-by-step coloring strategy. Under this strategy, a conventional one-step photochromic process is divided into a “light+heat” controlled multi-step process for the fabrication of the desired LCM s. The obtained LCM s can effectively resist the long-troubled ambient-light interference and avoid its inherent yellow background, thereby achieving the longest retention time and good repeatability. Multiple colors are generated and ultra-fast imaging compatible with the laser-printing technology is also realized. The application potential of the materials in short-term reusable identity cards, absorptive readers, billboards, and shelf labels is demonstrated. The results reported herein can potentially help in developing and designing various high-performance, switchable materials that can be used for the production of high-end products.},

Here the authors report a strategy incorporating neutralizing antibodies conjugated to the surface of a photothermal nanoparticle (NP) to capture and inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The NP is comprised of a semiconducting polymer core and a biocompatible polyethylene glycol surface decorated with high-affinity neutralizing antibodies. The multifunctional NP efficiently captures SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions and completely blocks viral infection to host cells in vitro through the surface neutralizing antibodies. In addition to virus capture and blocking function, the NP also possesses photothermal function to generate heat following irradiation for inactivation of virus. Importantly, the NPs described herein significantly outperform neutralizing antibodies at treating authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. This multifunctional NP provides a flexible platform that can be readily adapted to other SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and extended to novel therapeutic proteins, thus it is expected to provide a broad range of protection against original SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.},

In comparison with monolayer rGO/RuO 2 NS-based homologs, the 2D superlattice trilayer prGO/RuO 2 /prGO NS hybrids deliver better functionalities as a hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst and as a supercapacitor electrode, demonstrating the merits of hybridization with multilayer NSs. The advantages of using multilayer multicomponent conductive NSs as hybridization matrices arise from the enhancement of charge and mass transport through the layer flattening or defect suppression of the hybridized NSs and the increase in porosity, as evidenced by density functional theory calculations. Finally, the universal utility of multilayer NSs is confirmed by investigating the strong effect of the stacking order on the electrocatalytic functionality of MoS 2 /rGO/RuO 2 films fabricated through layer-by-layer deposition.},

Significantly, biaxial [3]pseudorotaxane displayed efficiently reversible RTP after binding with CB[8] and the phosphorescence quenching efficiency is calculated up to be 99%. Furthermore, the binary supramolecular assembly can coassemble with Cy5 to form ternary supramolecular assembly showing efficiently PRET, which is successfully applied in switchable near infrared (NIR) mitochondria-targeted cell imaging and photocontrolled data encryption.

However, it is often challenging to identify specific dominant mechanisms for a given process because of the complex pathways and ultrafast interactive dynamics of the photoelectrons. Here, using CO 2 reduction as an example, the underlying mechanisms of plasmon-driven catalysis at the single-molecule level using time-dependent density functional theory calculations is clearly probed. The CO 2 molecule adsorbed on two typical nanoclusters, Ag 20 and Ag 147 , is photoreduced by optically excited plasmon, accompanied by the excitation of asymmetric stretching and bending modes of CO 2 . A nonlinear relationship has been identified between laser intensity and reaction rate, demonstrating a synergic interplay and transition from indirect hot-electron transfer to direct charge transfer, enacted by strong localized surface plasmons. These findings offer new insights for CO 2 photoreduction and for the design of effective pathways toward highly efficient plasmon-mediated photocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {Adipose thermogenesis plays a pivotal role in whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Although transcriptional mechanisms that promote thermogenesis are extensively studied, the negative regulatory network is still poorly understood. Here, a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-containing zinc finger protein, ZFP961, as a potent repressor of the thermogenic program is identified. ZFP961 expression is induced by cold and β 3-adrenergic agonist in adipose tissue. ZFP961 represses brown fat-selective gene expression and mitochondrial respiration without any effect on general adipogenesis in cultured adipocytes. Adipose-specific knockdown and overexpression of ZFP961 produce remarkable and opposite phenotypes of white fat remodeling. ZFP961 knockout mice display robust inguinal white adipose tissue browning, which is abolished by reexpression of full-length ZFP961, but not by KRAB domain-deleted ZFP961 mutant. ZFP961-deficient mice are cold tolerant and resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis. ZFP961 suppresses thermogenic gene expression by directly interacting with PPAR α and blocking its transcriptional activity, which can be completely negated by the PPAR α agonist. The findings uncover ZFP961 as a critical physiological brake that limits adipose thermogenesis and provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms that maintain energy balance and tissue homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite-based optoelectronic devices have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent device performances and facile solution processing. However, the toxicity and intrinsic instability of lead-based perovskites have limited their commercial development. Moreover, the provision of an efficient white emission from a single perovskite layer is challenging. Here, novel electrically excited white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) based on lead-free double perovskite Cs 2 AgIn 0.9 Bi 0.1 Cl 6 quantum dots (QDs) without any phosphor are fabricated for the first time. Density functional theory calculations are carried out to clarify the mechanism of absorption and recombination in Cs 2 AgIn 0.9 Bi 0.1 Cl 6 with Bi-doping breaking the parity-forbidden transition of the direct bandgap. Microzone optical and electronic characterizations reveal that the broadband emission of Cs 2 AgIn 0.9 Bi 0.1 Cl 6 QDs originates from self-trapped excitons, and luminescent properties are unchanged after the film deposition. The QD-WLED exhibits excellent Commission Internationale de L&#39;Eclairage color coordinates, correlated color temperature and relatively high color rendering index of (0.32, 0.32), 6432 K, and 94.5, respectively. The maximum luminance of 158 cd m −2 is achieved by triphenylphosphine oxide passivation, and this lead-free QD-WLED exhibits a superior stability in ambient air with a long T 50 ≈48.53 min. Therefore, lead-free perovskite Cs 2 AgIn 0.9 Bi 0.1 Cl 6 QDs are promising candidates for use in WLEDs in the future.},

  abstract     = {Despite aggressive clinical treatment, recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is unavoidable, and the clinical outcome is still poor. A convincing explanation is the phenotypic transition of GBM cells upon aggressive treatment such as radiotherapy. However, the microenvironmental factors contributing to GBM recurrence after treatment remain unexplored. Here, it is shown that radiation-treated GBM cells produce soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) which stimulates the infiltration of macrophages, consequently enriching the tumor microenvironment with inflammatory macrophages. Acting as a paracrine factor, tumor-derived sICAM-1 induces macrophages to secrete wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A (WNT3A), which promotes a mesenchymal shift of GBM cells. In addition, blockade of either sICAM-1 or WNT3A diminishes the harmful effect of radiation on tumor progression. Collectively, the findings indicate that cellular crosstalk between GBM and macrophage through sICAM-1-WNT3A oncogenic route is involved in the mesenchymal shift of GBM cells after radiation, and suggest that radiotherapy combined with sICAM-1 targeted inhibition would improve the clinical outcome of GBM patients.},

Herein, a strategy is reported for achieving synchronous fluorescence and photostability on two coassemblies fabricated from carbazole-based energy donor hosts and a photostable energy acceptor. When a small number of the same energy acceptors are embedded into two carbazole-based energy donor hosts, the excitation energy of the donors can be efficiently harvested by the acceptors through long-range exciton migration and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to achieve synchronous fluorescence and photostability in both coassemblies. More intriguingly, the synchronous photostability substantially improves the multiple discrimination capacity (e.g., 10 times more discriminations of TNT in two coassemblies have been achieved compared to the sensor array comprising two individual donor assemblies) and the working lifetime of the sensor array. The concept of optical synchronization (i.e., emission and photostability) of sensor array members can be extended to other sensor arrays for the steady multiple detection of certain hazardous chemicals.},

Mammalian cartilaginous extracellular matrix (cECM) may not be optimally inductive for tracheal regeneration because of the granulomatous, instead of regenerative, responses in injured adult mammalian tracheas. Given the high regenerative capacity of gingiva, it is hypothesized human gingival mesenchymal stem cells derived EVs (gEVs) can induce mammalian tracheal epithelia regeneration. Coculturing chondrocytes with GMSCs produce abundant “matrix bound gEVs (gMVs)” in forming cartilaginous ECM, which are further preserved in acellular cECM (cACM) following mild, short-period decellularization. The results show that gMVs-cACM could be well anchored on polyglycerol sebacate microporous patch thus enforce the surgical suturability and mechanical strength. In rabbit tracheal defect, the gMVs-cACM patch induces rapid regeneration of vascularized ciliated columnar epithelium, which supports long-term survival of animals. gMVs-cACM treated groups exhibit proliferation of tracheal progenitors-basal epithelial cells, as well as, activation of JAK2/STAT1 pathway in reparative cells.

In the present study, a critical role for cholesterol homeostasis in terminal erythropoiesis is uncovered. The master transcriptional factor GATA1 binds to Sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) to downregulate cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to a gradual reduction in intracellular cholesterol levels. It is further shown that reduced cholesterol functions to block erythroid proliferation via the cholesterol/mTORC1/ribosome biogenesis axis, which coordinates cell cycle exit in the late stages of erythroid differentiation. The interaction of GATA1 and SREBP2 also provides a feedback loop for regulating globin expression through the transcriptional control of NFE2 by SREBP2. Importantly, it is shown that disrupting intracellular cholesterol hemostasis resulted in defect of terminal erythroid differentiation in vivo. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning of cholesterol homeostasis emerges as a key mechanism for regulating erythropoiesis.},

Here, a unique iontronic composite (silk protein/glycerol/Ca(II) ion) and supportive molecular mechanism are developed to simultaneously achieve high conductivity (around 6 kΩ at 50 kHz), self-healing (within minutes), strong stretchability (around 1000%), high strain sensitivity and transparency, and universal adhesiveness across a broad working temperature range (−40–120 °C). Those merits facilitate the development of iontronic sensing and the implementation of damage-resilient robotic manipulation. Combined with a machine learning algorithm and specified data collection methods, the system is able to classify 1024 types of human and robot hand gestures under challenging scenarios and to offer excellent object recognition with an accuracy of 99.7%.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Z-scheme, a tandem structure with two-step excitation process, has gained significant attention in energy production and environmental remediation. By effectively connecting and matching the band-gaps of two different photosystems, it is significant to utilize more photons for excellent photoactivity. Herein, a novel one-photon (same energy-two-photon) Z-scheme system is constructed between rGO modified boron-nitrogen co-doped-WO 3 , and coupled CdSe quantum dots-(QDs). The coctalyst-0.5%Rh x Cr 2 O 3 (0.5RCr) modified amount-optimized sample 6%CdSe/1%rGO3%BN-WO 3 revealed an unprecedented visible-light driven overall-water-splitting to produce ≈51 µmol h −1 g −1 H 2 and 25.5 µmol h −1 g −1 O 2 , and it remained unchanged for 5 runs in 30 h. This superior performance is ascribed to the one-photon Z-scheme, which simultaneously stimulates a two photocatalysts system, and enhanced charge separation as revealed by various spectroscopy techniques. The density-functional theory is further utilized to understand the origin of this performance enhancement. This work provides a feasible strategy for constructing an efficient one-photon Z-scheme for practical applications.},

To address the increasing application demands along with the concern on nuclear security, various strategies have been proposed to develop a next-generation scintillator with a high performance in past decades, among which the novel approach via structure control has received great interest recently due to its high feasibility and efficiency. Herein, the concept of “structure engineering” is proposed for the exploration of this type of scintillators. Via internal or external structure design with size ranging from micro size to macro size, this promising strategy cannot only improve scintillator performance, typically radiation stopping power and light yield, but also extend its functionality for specific applications such as radiation imaging and therapy, opening up a new range of material candidates. The research and development of various types of structured scintillators are reviewed. The current state-of-the-art progresses on structure design, fabrication techniques, and the corresponding applications are discussed. Furthermore, an outlook focusing on the current challenges and future development is proposed.},

A major problem of traditional tracers in SLN biopsy is the short surgery window due to the fast diffusion of tracers through the lymphatics, resulting in a misjudgment between SLN and second echelon lymph node (2 nd LN). Here, a nontoxic Raman nanoparticle tracer, termed gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs), for the accurate intraoperative positioning of SLNs with a sufficient surgical time window is designed. In white New Zealand rabbit models, GERTs enable precise identification of SLNs within 10 min, as well as provide the surgeon with a more than 4 h time window to differentiate SLN and 2 nd LN. In addition, the ultrahigh sensitivity of GERTs (detection limit is 0.5 × 10 −12 m ) allows detection of labeled SLNs before surgery, thereby providing preoperative positioning information for minimally invasive surgery. Comprehensive biosafety evaluations carried out in the context of the Food and Drug Administration and International Standard Organization demonstrate no significant toxicity of GERTs, which supports a promising clinical translation opportunity of GERTs for precise SLN identification in breast cancer.},

Herein, a universal method is developed to overcome this issue by incorporating halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) into perovskite polycrystalline films. CsPbBr 3 QDs are deposited on four types of halide perovskite films (CsPbBr 3 , CsPbIBr 2 , CsPbBrI 2 , and MAPbI 3 ) and the interactions are triggered by annealing. The ions in the CsPbBr 3 QDs are released into the thin films to passivate defects, and concurrently the hydrophobic ligands of QDs self-assemble on the film surfaces and grain boundaries to reduce the defect density and enhance the film stability. For all QD-treated films, PL emission intensity and carrier lifetime are significantly improved, and surface morphology and composition uniformity are also optimized. Furthermore, after the QD treatment, light-induced phase segregation and degradation in mixed-halide perovskite films are suppressed, and the efficiency of mixed-halide CsPbIBr 2 solar cells is remarkably improved to over 11% from 8.7%. Overall, this work provides a general approach to achieving high-quality halide perovskite films with suppressed phase segregation, reduced defects, and enhanced stability for optoelectronic applications.},

However, their practical utilization is impeded by the shuttle effect and slow redox process of polysulfide. To solve these problems, enormous creative approaches have been employed to engineer new electrocatalytic materials to relieve the shuttle effect and promote the catalytic kinetics of polysulfides. In this review, recent advances on designing principles and active centers for polysulfide catalytic materials are systematically summarized. At first, the currently reported chemistries and mechanisms for the catalytic conversion of polysulfides are presented in detail. Subsequently, the rational design of polysulfide catalytic materials from catalytic polymers and frameworks to active sites loaded carbons for polysulfide catalysis to accelerate the reaction kinetics is comprehensively discussed. Current breakthroughs are highlighted and directions to guide future primary challenges, perspectives, and innovations are identified. Computational methods serve an ever-increasing part in pushing forward the active center design. In summary, a cutting-edge understanding to engineer different polysulfide catalysts is provided, and both experimental and theoretical guidance for optimizing future M–S batteries and many related battery systems are offered.},

Here, high-speed digital holographic microscopy (kiloHertz order) is used to visualize the cellular membrane dynamics. It is shown that neuronal and fibroblast membranes deflect about 150 nm upon ultrasound stimulation. Next, a biomechanical model that predicts changes in membrane voltage after ultrasound exposure is developed. Finally, the model predictions are validated using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology on primary neurons. Collectively, it is shown that ultrasound stimulation directly defects the neuronal membrane leading to a change in membrane voltage and subsequent depolarization. The model is consistent with existing data and provides a mechanism for both ultrasound-evoked neurostimulation and sonogenetic control.},

However, the influence of the P3HT molecular weight on the mechanical stability of curved, thick X-ray detectors remains less well understood. Herein, high P3HT molecular weights (&gt;40 kDa) are identified to allow increased intermolecular bonding and chain entanglements, resulting in X-ray detectors that can be curved to a radius as low as 1.3 mm with low deviation in X-ray response under 100 repeated bending cycles while maintaining an industry-standard dark current of &lt;1 pA mm −2 and a sensitivity of ≈ 0.17 μ C Gy −1 cm −2 .

Electrochemical biosensors are commonly preferred due to their low-cost, high sensitivity, and low complexity. Metabolite detection, however, in cultured cells or sensitive tissue is rarely shown. Commonly, glucose sensing occurs indirectly by measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, which is a by-product of the conversion of glucose by glucose oxidase. However, continuous production of hydrogen peroxide in cell media with high glucose is toxic to adjacent cells or tissue. This challenge is overcome through a novel, stacked enzyme configuration. A primary enzyme is used to provide analyte sensitivity, along with a secondary enzyme which converts H 2 O 2 back to O 2 . The secondary enzyme is functionalized as the outermost layer of the device. Thus, production of H 2 O 2 remains local to the sensor and its concentration in the extracellular environment does not increase. This “biostack” is integrated with organic electrochemical transistors to demonstrate sensors that monitor glucose concentration in cell cultures in situ. The “biostack” renders the sensors nontoxic for cells and provides highly sensitive and stable detection of metabolites.},

By combining structural, transport, and photoelectrochemical characterizations with first-principle calculations, it is shown that the bi-domain III–V/Si materials are able within the same layer to absorb light efficiently, separate laterally the photo-generated carriers, transfer them to semimetal singularities, and ease extraction of both electrons and holes vertically, leading to efficient carrier collection. Besides, the original topological properties of the 2D semi-metallic inclusions are also discussed. This comb-like heterostructure not only merges the superior optical properties of semiconductors with good transport properties of metallic materials, but also combines the high efficiency and tunability afforded by III–V inorganic bulk materials with the flexible management of nano-scale charge carriers usually offered by blends of organic materials.

  abstract     = {Cardiac hypertrophy is a pivotal pathophysiological step of various cardiovascular diseases, which eventually leads to heart failure and death. Extracts of Rhodiola species (Ext.R), a class of commonly used medicinal herbs in Europe and East Asia, can attenuate cardiac hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo. Serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is identified as a potential target of Ext. R. By mass spectrometry-based kinase inhibitory assay, herbacetin (HBT) from Ext.R is identified as a novel SGK1 inhibitor with IC 50 of 752 nmol. Thermal shift assay, KINOMEscan in vitro assay combined with molecular docking proves a direct binding between HBT and SGK1. Site-specific mutation of Asp177 in SGK1 completely ablates the inhibitory activity of HBT. The presence of  OH groups at the C-3, C-8, C-4’ positions of flavonoids is suggested to be favorable for the inhibition of SGK1 activity. Finally, HBT significantly suppresses cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo, reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis and calcium accumulation. HBT decreases phosphorylation of SGK1 and regulates its downstream forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) signaling pathway. Taken together, the findings suggest that a panel of flavonoids structurally related to HBT may be novel leads for developing new therapeutics against cardiac hypertrophy.},

Through training, these machine learning (ML) models can build up the structure–property relationship and thus implement fast prediction of AIE/ACQ properties. To this end, a multi-modal approach is proposed, multiple prediction methods are compared and designed, and thus an ensemble strategy is developed. First, multiple molecular descriptors are considered at the same time, major features are extracted by dimensionality reduction, and multi-modal features are synthesized. Then, several state-of-the-art methods are designed and compared to analyze the advantages of the different methods. Finally, the ensemble strategy combines the advantages of the multiple methods to obtain the final prediction result. The reliability of this approach in an unknown molecular space is further verified by three newly designed molecules. Reasonable consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained. The result indicates that ML can be a powerful tool to predict molecular properties in the aggregated state, thus accelerating the development of solid-state optical materials.},

  abstract     = {There is a growing demand to attain organic materials with high electron mobility, μ e , as current reliable reported values are significantly lower than those exhibited by their hole mobility counterparts. Here, it is shown that a well-known nonfullerene-acceptor commonly used in organic solar cells, that is, BTP-4F (aka Y6), enables solution-processed organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) with a μ e as high as 2.4 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . This value is comparable to those of state-of-the-art n-type OTFTs, opening up a plethora of new possibilities for this class of materials in the field of organic electronics. Such efficient charge transport is linked to a readily achievable highly ordered crystalline phase, whose peculiar structural properties are thoroughly discussed. This work proves that structurally ordered nonfullerene acceptors can exhibit intrinsically high mobility and introduces a new approach in the quest of high μ e organic materials, as well as new guidelines for future materials design.},

Recently, substantial advances have been achieved in PEC systems by improving light absorption and charge separation/transfer in PEC devices. However, less attention is given to the atomic design of photoelectrocatalysts to facilitate the final catalytic reactions occurring at photoelectrode surface, which largely limits the overall photo-to-energy conversion of PEC system. Fundamental catalytic mechanisms and recent progress in atomic design of PEC materials are comprehensively reviewed by engineering of defect, dopant, facet, strain, and single atom to enhance the activity and selectivity.

Among various performances of SNMs, photothermal energy conversion is one of the most important ones because it can efficiently utilize the light energy. Herein, the SNMs with photothermal energy conversion behaviors and their applications are reviewed. First, a hydrothermal/solvothermal method for the synthesis of SNMs is systematically discussed, including the LaMer pathway and the cluster–nuclei coassembly pathway. Based on this synthetic strategy, many kinds of SNMs with different morphologies are successfully prepared, such as nanorings, nanowires, nanosheets, and nanobelts. These SNMs exhibit excellent photothermal performance under the laser or solar irradiation according to their different light absorption ranges. These enhanced absorption performances of SNMs are induced by the mechanism of plasmonic localized heating or nonradiative relaxation. Finally, the applications of the photothermal SNMs are illustrated. The SNMs with photothermal behaviors can be widely applied in the fields of solar vapor generation, biomedicine, and light-responsive composites construction. It is hoped that this review can provide new viewpoints and profound understanding to the SNMs in photothermal energy conversion.},

Among them, hollow structural materials possess cavities in their structures, which can slack off the escape rate of N 2 and reaction intermediates, prolong the residence time of N 2 , enrich the reaction intermediates’ concentration, and shorten electron transportation path, thereby further enhancing their NRR activity. Here, the basic synthetic strategies of hollow structural materials are introduced first. Then, the recent breakthroughs in hollow structural materials as NRR catalysts are reviewed from the perspective of intrinsic, mesoscopic, and microscopic regulations, aiming to discuss how structures affect and improve the catalytic performance.

  abstract     = {Diabetic ulcers, a difficult problem faced by clinicians, are strongly associated with an increase in cellular senescence. Few empirical studies have focused on exploring a targeted strategy to cure diabetic wounds by eliminating senescent fibroblasts (SFs) and reducing side effects. In this study, poly- l -lysine/sodium alginate (PLS) is modified with talabostat (PT100) and encapsulates a PARP1 plasmid (PARP1@PLS-PT100) for delivery to target the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and eliminate SFs. PARP1@PLS-PT100 releases encapsulated plasmids, displaying high selectivity for SFs over normal fibroblasts by targeting the DPP4 receptor, decreasing senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs), and stimulating the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, the increased apoptosis of SFs and the disappearance of cellular senescence alleviates SASPs, accelerates re-epithelialization and collagen deposition, and significantly induces macrophage M2 polarization, which mediates tissue repair and the inflammatory response. This innovative strategy has revealed the previously undefined role of PARP1@PLS-PT100 in promoting diabetic wound healing, suggesting its therapeutic potential in refractory wound repair.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical techniques have been recognized as an environmentally friendly and sustainable synthetic way to form organodisulfides. However, searching for optimum conditions which suffers from time/material-consuming caused by the uncertainty of reactant consumption has hindered its rapid and large-scale development. Inspired by advanced nonaqueous redox flow batteries (NARFBs) technology, it is proposed a smart flow electrosynthesis (SFE) method of organodisulfides that the voltage curve of NARFBs can be utilized as a precise indicator to reflect the desired information about reactants and distinguish the end point of reaction automatically. This electrochemical method also exhibits certain universality and scalability. Additionally, organodisulfides generated in electrolytes can be used as active species for NARFBs without further purification, and their electrochemical properties are easily adjusted by changing raw materials, which effectively alleviate the waste in complex synthesis steps for optimizing and designing active materials separately. An organodisulfide dervied from isopropyl alcohol and carbon disulfide shows excellent cycling life (1000 cycles) with low capacity fade rate (0.024% per cycle). Taking advantages of the inherent NARFBs, this work not only proves a SFE strategy, but also supplies a green and low-cost molecular engineering scheme for designing electroactive materials for energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Despite immunosuppression is critical for reducing immune overactivation, existing immunosuppressive agents are largely restricted by low inhibition efficiencies and unpredictable off-target toxicities. Here, the use of the dopaminergic system is reported to suppress hyperactive immune responses in local inflamed tissues. A polydopamine nanoparticular immunosuppressant (PDNI) is synthesized to stimulate regulatory T (Treg) cells and directly inhibit T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cells. Moreover, PDNI can inhibit the activation of dendritic cells to upregulate the ratio of Treg/Th17, which assists the reversion of inflammatory responses. The application of dopaminergic immunoregulation is further disclosed by combining with gut microbiota modulation for treating inflammations. The combination is implemented by coating living beneficial bacteria with PDNI. Following oral delivery, coated bacteria not only suppress the hyperactive immune responses but also positively modulate the gut microbiome in mice characterized with colitis. Strikingly, the combination demonstrates enhanced treatment efficacies in comparison with clinical aminosalicylic acid in two murine models of colitis. The use of the dopaminergic system opens a window to intervene immune responses and provides a versatile platform for the development of new therapeutics for treating inflammatory diseases.},

As sensors, ferroelectrics can directly convert the stimuli to signals without requiring external power supply in principle. As energy transducers, ferroelectrics can harvest multiple forms of energy with high reliability and durability.

Nonvolatile memories derived from ferroelectrics are able to realize digital processors and systems with ultralow power consumption, sustainable operation with intermittent power supply, and neuromorphic computing.

Furthermore, tumor-microenvironment (TME)-responsive nanomedicine has been demonstrated to achieve specific and localized amplification of the immune response in tumor tissue in a safe and effective manner, increasing patient response rates to immunotherapy and reducing the immune-related side effects simultaneously. Here, the recent progress of TME-responsive nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy is summarized, which responds to the signals in the TME, such as weak acidity, reductive environment, high-level reactive oxygen species, hypoxia, overexpressed enzymes, and high-level adenosine triphosphate. Moreover, the potential to combine nanomedicine-based therapy and immunotherapeutic strategies to overcome each step of the cancer-immunity cycle and to enhance antitumor effects is discussed.

  abstract     = {With the timely advent of the electric vehicle era, where battery stability has emerged as a major issue, all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) have attracted significant attention as the game changer owing to their high stability. However, despite the introduction of a densely packed solid electrolyte (SE) layer, when Li is used to increase the energy density of the cell, the short-circuit problem caused by Li protrusion is unavoidable. Furthermore, most strategies to control nonuniform Li growth are so complicated that they hinder the practical application of ASSBs. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an Ag-Li alloy anode via mass-producible roll pressing method. Unlike previous studies reporting solid-solution-based metal alloys containing a small amount of lithiophilic Ag, the in situ formed and Ag-enriched Ag-Li intermetallic layer mitigates uneven Li deposition and maintains a stable SE/Ag-Li interface, facilitating reversible Li operation. Contrary to Li cells showing frequent initial short-circuit, the cell incorporating the Ag-Li anode exhibits a better capacity retention of 94.3% for 140 cycles, as well as stable cycling even under 12 C. Through a facile approach enabling the fabrication of a large-area anode with controllable Li growth, this study provides practical insight for developing ASSBs with stable cyclabilities.},

This process manifests as a characteristic depression of the nonlinear signal dynamics when scanning the delay between the applied laser pulses. By theoretically describing the process within a local field model, an excellent agreement with the experiment is reached.

Widely used as staining and characterization reagents in cell biology and crucial for understanding the interactions in biological systems, lectins are a focal point of study in glycobiology. Yet the sheer breadth and depth of specificity for diverse oligosaccharide motifs has made studying lectins a largely piecemeal approach, with few options to generalize. Here, LectinOracle, a model combining transformer-based representations for proteins and graph convolutional neural networks for glycans to predict their interaction, is presented. Using a curated data set of 564,647 unique protein–glycan interactions, it is shown that LectinOracle predictions agree with literature-annotated specificities for a wide range of lectins. Using a range of specialized glycan arrays, it is shown that LectinOracle predictions generalize to new glycans and lectins, with qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental data. It is further demonstrated that LectinOracle can be used to improve lectin classification, accelerate lectin directed evolution, predict epidemiological outcomes in the context of influenza virus, and analyze whole lectomes in host–microbe interactions. It is envisioned that the herein presented platform will advance both the study of lectins and their role in (glyco)biology.},

Polyaniline (PANI)-based composites are usually prepared by blending and original growth methods. However, due to the strong rigidity and hydrogen bonding of PANI, the content of PANI composites is low and easy to agglomerate. Here, based on confined polymerization, it is reported that polyaniline /polyether ether ketone (PANI/PEEK) film with high PANI content is synthesized in situ by a one-step method. The micro-nano structure of the two polymers in the confined space is further explored and it is found that PANI grows in the free volume of the PEEK chain, making the arrangement of the PEEK chain more orderly. Under the best experimental conditions, the prepared 16 µm-PANI/PEEK film has a dielectric constant of 205.4 (dielectric loss 0.401), the 75 µm-PANI/PEEK film has a conductivity of 3.01×10 −4 S m −1 .

The missing key, therefore, hinders it from practical applications in biomedicine. This study reveals the key mechanism governing the frequency distributions of transverse modes in cellular lasers. Spatial information of cells including curvature can be interpreted through spectral information of transverse modes by means of hyperspectral imaging. Theoretical studies are conducted to explore the correlation between the cross-sectional morphology of a cell and lasing frequencies of transverse modes. Experimentally, the spectral characteristics of transverse modes are investigated in live and fixed cells with different morphological features. By extracting laser modes in frequency domain, the proposed concept is applied for studying cell adhesion process and cell classification from rat cortices. This study expands a new analytical dimension of cell lasers, opening an avenue for subcellular analysis in biophotonic applications.},

Here, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) route is reported to controllably synthesize high-quality PtSe 2 nanosheets with tunable thickness and explore their thickness-dependent electronic and magnetotransport properties. Raman spectroscopic studies demonstrate all E g , A 1 g , A 2 u , and E u modes are red shift in thicker nanosheets. Electrical measurements demonstrate the 1.7 nm thick nanosheet is a semiconductor with room temperature field-effect mobility of 66 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and on/off ratio of 10 6 . The 2.3–3.8 nm thick nanosheets show slightly gated modulation with high field-effect mobility up to 324 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room-temperature. When the thickness is over 3.8 nm, the nanosheets show metallic behavior with conductivity and breakdown current density up to 6.8 × 10 5 S m –1 and 6.9 × 10 7 A cm −2 , respectively. Interestingly, magnetoresistance (MR) studies reveal magnetic orders exist in this intrinsically non-magnetic material system, as manifested by the thickness-dependent Kondo effect, where both metal to insulator transition and negative MR appear upon cooling.

  abstract     = {Sluggish sulfur reduction and lithium sulfide (Li 2 S) oxidation prevent the widespread use of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, which are attractive alternatives to Li−ion batteries. The authors propose that a transition metal selenide heterojunction (CoSe–ZnSe) catalytically accelerates bidirectional sulfur conversion reactions. A combination of synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations show that a highly active heterointerface with charge redistribution and structure distortion effectively immobilizes sulfur species, facilitates Li ion diffusion, and decreases the sulfur reduction and Li 2 S oxidation energy barriers. The CoSe–ZnSe catalytic cathode exhibits high areal capacities, good rate capability, and superior cycling stability with capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle over 1700 cycles. Furthermore, CoSe–ZnSe heterojunctions anchored on graphene aerogels (CoSe–ZnSe@G) enhance ionic transport and catalytic activity under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. A high areal capacity of 8.0 mAh cm −2 is achieved at an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3 µL mg −1 . This study demonstrates the importance of bidirectional catalytic heterojunctions and structure engineering in boosting Li–S battery performances.},

  abstract     = {Micromotors have opened novel avenues for drug delivery due to their capacity for self-propelling. Attempts in this field trend towards ameliorating their functions to promote their clinical applications. In this paper, an ingenious suction-cup-inspired micromotor is presented with adhesive properties for drug delivery in the stomach. The micromotors are fabricated by using hydrogel replicating the structure of suction-cup-like microparticles, which derive from self-assembly of colloidal crystals under rapid solvent extraction, followed by loading magnesium (Mg) in the bottom spherical surface. The Mg-loaded micromotors can realize spontaneous movement due to the continual generation of hydrogen bubbles in gastric juice. The combination of unique suction-cup-like structure with excellent motion performance makes the micromotor an ideal carrier for drug delivery as they can efficiently adhere to the tissue. Moreover, benefiting from the porous structure, the hydrogel micromotors exhibit a high volume-surface ratio, which enables efficient drug loading. It is demonstrated that the suction-cup-inspired micromotors can adhere efficiently to the ulcer-region in the stomach and release drugs due to their distinctive architecture and spontaneous motion, exhibiting desirable curative effect of gastric ulcer. Thus, the suction-cup-inspired micromotors with adhesive properties are expected to advance the development of micromotor in clinical applications.},

In this study, a novel in situ defect engineering route to maximize electrocatalytic redox activity of inorganic nanosheet is developed by using holey nanostructured substrate with strong interfacial electronic coupling. Density functional theory calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm that efficient interfacial charge transfer takes place between holey TiN and Ni−Fe-layered double hydroxide (LDH), leading to the feedback formation of nitrogen vacancies and a maximization of cation redox activity. The holey TiN−LDH nanohybrid is found to exhibit a superior functionality as an oxygen electrocatalyst and electrode for Li−O 2 batteries compared to its non-holey homologues. The great impact of hybridization-driven vacancy introduction on the electrochemical performance originates from an efficient electrochemical activation of both Fe and Ni ions during electrocatalytic process, a reinforcement of interfacial electronic coupling, an increase in electrochemical active sites, and an improvement in electrocatalysis/charge-transfer kinetics.},

In both cases, there is a need to encapsulate the core with an elastic material. This imposes a limit to the volume of variable stiffness (VS) material and limits miniaturization. This paper proposes a new approach that relies on the use of thermosetting materials. The variable stiffness catheter (VSC) proposed in this work eliminates the necessity for an encapsulation layer and is made of a unique biocompatible thermoset polymer with an embedded heating system. This significantly reduces the final diameter, improves manufacturability, and increases safety in the event of complications. The device can be scaled to sub-millimeter dimensions, while maintaining a high stiffness change.

However, measured biomarker concentrations vary with sweat rates, which has a significant effect on the accuracy and reliability of sweat biosensors. Wearable sweat loss measuring devices (SLMDs) have recently been proposed to overcome the limitations of biomarker tracking and reduce inter- and intraindividual variability. In addition, they offer substantial potential for monitoring human body homeostasis, because sweat loss plays an indispensable role in thermoregulation and skin hydration. Previous studies have not carried out a comprehensive and systematic review of the principles, importance, and development of wearable SLMDs. This paper reviews wearable SLMDs with a new health perspective from the role of sweat loss to advanced mechanisms and designs. Two types of sweat and their measurement significance for practical applications are highlighted. Then, a comprehensive review of advances in different wearable SLMDs based on hygrometers, absorbent materials, and microfluidics is presented by describing their respective device architectures, present situations, and future directions.

In addition to the conventional fermionic cases, bosonic quasi-/particles also promise energy-efficient THz wave emission. Here, by utilizing a 2D ferromagnetic Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 crystal, first a phonon-related magneto-tunable monochromatic THz irradiation source is demonstrated. With a low-photonic-energy broadband THz pump, a strong THz irradiation with frequency ≈0.9 THz and bandwidth ≈0.25 THz can be generated and its conversion efficiency could even reach 2.1% at 160 K. Moreover, it is intriguing to find that such monochromatic THz irradiation can be efficiently modulated by external magnetic field below 160 K. According to both experimental and theoretical analyses, the emergent THz irradiation is identified as the emission from the phonon-polariton and its temperature and magnetic field dependent behaviors confirm the large spin-lattice coupling in this 2D ferromagnetic crystal. These observations provide a new route for the creation of tunable monochromatic THz source which may have great practical interests in future applications in photonic and spintronic devices.},

Herein, an ion–charge carrier interaction at an electrolyte–semiconductor interface is interrogated with an ion-dynamics-induced (ionovoltaic) energy transducer, controlled by interfacial self-assembled molecules. An electricity generating mechanism from interfacial ionic diffusion is elucidated in terms of the ion–charge carrier interaction, originated from a dipole potential effect of the self-assembled molecular layer (SAM). In addition, this effect is found to be modulated via chemical functionalization of the interfacial molecular layer and transition metal ion complexation therein. With the aiding of surface analytic techniques and a liquid-interfacing Hall measurement, electrical behaviors of the device depending on the magnitude of the ion-ligand complexation are interrogated, thereby demonstrating the ion–charge carrier interplays spanning at electrolyte–SAM-semiconductor interface. Hence, this system can be applied to study molecular interactions, including chemical and physical influences, occurring at the solid–liquid interfacial region.},

Nevertheless, the members of stoichiometric 2DLMs are relatively limited. This renders them incompetent to fulfill the multitudinous scenarios across the breadth of electronic and optoelectronic applications since the characteristics exhibited by a specific material are relatively monotonous and limited. Inspiringly, alloying of 2DLMs can markedly broaden the 2D family through composition modulation and it has ushered a whole new research domain: 2DLM alloy nano-electronics and nano-optoelectronics. This review begins with a comprehensive survey on synthetic technologies for the production of 2DLM alloys, which include chemical vapor transport, chemical vapor deposition, pulsed-laser deposition, and molecular beam epitaxy, spanning their development, as well as, advantages and disadvantages. Then, the up-to-date advances of 2DLM alloys in electronic devices are summarized. Subsequently, the up-to-date advances of 2DLM alloys in optoelectronic devices are summarized. In the end, the ongoing challenges of this emerging field are highlighted and the future opportunities are envisioned, which aim to navigate the coming exploration and fully exert the pivotal role of 2DLMs toward the next generation of electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

To accelerate rat femoral osteoporotic fracture healing which presents with decline of CGRP, soft electrodes are engineered and they are implanted at L3 and L4 dorsal root ganglions (DRGs). ES delivered at DRGs for the first two weeks after fracture increases CGRP expression in both DRGs and fracture callus. It is also identified that CGRP is indispensable for type-H vessel formation, a biological event coupling angiogenesis and osteogenesis, contributing to ES-enhanced osteoporotic fracture healing. This proof-of-concept study shows for the first time that ES at lumbar DRGs can effectively promote femoral fracture healing, offering an innovative strategy using bioelectronic device to enhance bone regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Active mechanical metamaterials (AMMs) (or smart mechanical metamaterials) that combine the configurations of mechanical metamaterials and the active control of stimuli-responsive materials have been widely investigated in recent decades. The elaborate artificial microstructures of mechanical metamaterials and the stimulus response characteristics of smart materials both contribute to AMMs, making them achieve excellent properties beyond the conventional metamaterials. The micro and macro structures of the AMMs are designed based on structural construction principles such as, phase transition, strain mismatch, and mechanical instability. Considering the controllability and efficiency of the stimuli-responsive materials, physical fields such as, the temperature, chemicals, light, electric current, magnetic field, and pressure have been adopted as the external stimuli in practice. In this paper, the frontier works and the latest progress in AMMs from the aspects of the mechanics and materials are reviewed. The functions and engineering applications of the AMMs are also discussed. Finally, existing issues and future perspectives in this field are briefly described. This review is expected to provide the basis and inspiration for the follow-up research on AMMs.},

Among the various properties of NPs are functionalities being related to thiol substructures. Numerous biological processes that are mediated by cysteine or cystine subunits of proteins representing the workhorses of the bodies can be transferred to NPs. This review focuses on the interface between thiol chemistry and NPs. Pros and cons of different techniques for thiolation of NPs are discussed. Furthermore, the various functionalities gained by thiolation are highlighted. These include overall bio- and mucoadhesive, cellular uptake enhancing, and permeation enhancing properties. Drugs being either covalently attached to thiolated NPs via disulfide bonds or being entrapped in thiolated polymeric NPs that are stabilized via inter- and intrachain crosslinking can be released at the diseased tissue or in target cells under reducing conditions. Moreover, drugs, targeting ligands, biological analytes, and enzymes bearing thiol substructures can be immobilized on noble metal NPs and quantum dots for therapeutic, theranostic, diagnostic, biosensing, and analytical reasons. Within this review a concise summary and analysis of the current knowledge, future directions, and potential clinical use of thiolated NPs are provided.},

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has prompted a wider application of this technology to meet the public health challenge of pandemic threats in the modern era. Herein, a combinatorial human antibody library constructed 20 years before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is used to discover three highly potent antibodies that selectively bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Compared to neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients with generally low somatic hypermutation (SHM), these three antibodies contain over 13–22 SHMs, many of which are involved in specific interactions in their crystal structures with SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. The identification of these somatically mutated antibodies in a pre-pandemic library raises intriguing questions about the origin and evolution of these antibodies with respect to their reactivity with SARS-CoV-2.},

With the aid of optical inspection, in situ and scalable monitoring of the properties of 2D materials can be implemented industrially to advance the development and progress of 2D material-based devices toward mass production. This review discusses the optical inspection techniques that are available to characterize various 2D materials, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), group-III monochalcogenides, black phosphorus (BP), and group-IV monochalcogenides. First, the authors provide an introduction to these 2D materials and the processes commonly used for their fabrication. Then they review several of the important structural properties of 2D materials, and discuss how to characterize them using appropriate optical inspection tools. The authors also describe the challenges and opportunities faced when applying optical inspection to recently developed 2D materials, from mechanically exfoliated to wafer-scale-grown 2D materials. Most importantly, the authors summarize the techniques available for largely and precisely enhancing the optical signals from 2D materials. This comprehensive review of the current status and perspective of future trends for optical inspection of the structural properties of 2D materials will facilitate the development of next-generation 2D material-based devices.},

For UV perception, electrical energy consumption down to 536 aJ per synaptic event is demonstrated, at least one order of magnitude lower than current UV-sensitive synaptic devices. For NIR- and vis-perception, switchable plasticity by alternating light sources is yielded for recognition and memory. The device emulates multiplexed neurochemical transition of different neurotransmitters such as dopamine and noradrenaline to form short-term and long-term responses. These facilitate the first realization of human-integrated motion state monitoring and processing using a synaptic hardware, which is then used for real-time heart monitoring of human movement. Motion state analysis with the 96% accuracy is then achieved by artificial neural network. This work provides important support to future biomedical electronics and neural prostheses.},

This platform, termed Acoustic-Electric Shear Orbiting Poration (AESOP), optimizes the delivery of intended cargo sizes with poration of the cell membranes via mechanical shear followed by the modulated expansion of these nanopores via electric field. Furthermore, AESOP utilizes acoustic microstreaming vortices wherein up to millions of cells are trapped and mixed uniformly with exogenous cargos, enabling the delivery of cargos into cells with targeted dosages. Intracellular delivery of a wide range of molecule sizes (&lt;1 kDa to 2 MDa) with high efficiency (&gt;90%), cell viability (&gt;80%), and uniform dosages (&lt;60% coefficient of variation (CV)) simultaneously into 1 million cells min −1 per single chip is demonstrated. AESOP is successfully applied to two gene editing applications that require the delivery of large plasmids: i) enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) plasmid (6.1 kbp) transfection, and ii) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated gene knockout using a 9.3 kbp plasmid DNA encoding Cas9 protein and single guide RNA (sgRNA). Compared to alternative platforms, this platform offers dosage-controlled intracellular delivery of large plasmids simultaneously to large populations of cells while maintaining cell viability at comparable delivery efficiencies.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic disorder is one of the hallmarks of cancers, and reprogramming of metabolism is becoming a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Citrate is a key metabolite and critical metabolic regulator linking glycolysis and lipid metabolism in cellular energy homeostasis. Here it is reported that citrate treatment (both sodium citrate and citric acid) significantly suppresses tumor cell proliferation and growth in various tumor types. Mechanistically, citrate promotes excessive lipid biosynthesis and induces disruption of lipid metabolism in tumor cells, resulting in tumor cell senescence and growth inhibition. Furthermore, ATM-associated DNA damage response cooperates with MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways to control citrate-induced tumor cell growth arrest and senescence. In vivo studies further demonstrate that citrate administration dramatically inhibits tumor growth and progression in a colon cancer xenograft model. Importantly, citrate administration combined with the conventional chemotherapy drugs exhibits synergistic antitumor effects in vivo in the colon cancer models. These results clearly indicate that citrate can reprogram lipid metabolism and cell fate in cancer cells, and targeting citrate can be a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor treatment.},

  abstract     = {Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging treatment that usually employs chemical agents to decompose hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) into hydroxyl radical (•OH) via Fenton or Fenton-like reactions, inducing cell apoptosis or necrosis by damaging biomacromolecules such as, lipids, proteins, and DNA. Generally, CDT shows high tumor-specificity and minimal-invasiveness in patients, thus it has attracted extensive research interests. However, the catalytic reaction efficiency of CDT is largely limited by the relatively high pH at the tumor sites. Herein, a 808 nm laser-potentiated peroxidase catalytic/mild-photothermal therapy of molybdenum diphosphide nanorods (MoP 2 NRs) is developed to improve CDT performance, and simultaneously achieve effective tumor eradication and anti-infection. In this system, MoP 2 NRs exhibit a favorable cytocompatibility due to their inherent excellent elemental biocompatibility. Upon irradiation with an 808 nm laser, MoP 2 NRs act as photosensitizers to efficiently capture the photo-excited band electrons and valance band holes, exhibiting enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic activity to sustainedly decompose tumor endogenous H 2 O 2 to •OH, which subsequently destroy the cellular biomacromolecules both in tumor cells and bacteria. As demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, this system exhibits a superior therapeutic efficiency with inappreciable toxicity. Hence, the work may provide a promising therapeutic technique for further clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are important in tumor microenvironment (TME) driven cancer progression. However, CAFs are heterogeneous and still largely underdefined, better understanding their origins will identify new therapeutic strategies for cancer. Here, the authors discovered a new role of macrophage-myofibroblast transition (MMT) in cancer for de novo generating protumoral CAFs by resolving the transcriptome dynamics of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with single-cell resolution. MMT cells (MMTs) are observed in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) associated with CAF abundance and patient mortality. By fate-mapping study, RNA velocity, and pseudotime analysis, existence of novel macrophage-lineage-derived CAF subset in the TME of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model is confirmed, which is directly transited via MMT from M2-TAM in vivo and bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in vitro. Adoptive transfer of BMDM-derived MMTs markedly promote CAF formation in LLC-bearing mice. Mechanistically, a Smad3-centric regulatory network is upregulated in the MMTs of NSCLC, where chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing(ChIP-seq) detects a significant enrichment of Smad3 binding on fibroblast differentiation genes in the macrophage-lineage cells in LLC-tumor. More importantly, macrophage-specific deletion and pharmaceutical inhibition of Smad3 effectively block MMT, therefore, suppressing the CAF formation and cancer progression in vivo. Thus, MMT may represent a novel therapeutic target of CAF for cancer immunotherapy.},
