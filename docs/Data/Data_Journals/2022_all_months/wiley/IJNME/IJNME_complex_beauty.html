  abstract     = {The power of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based methods in computational micromechanics critically depends on a seamless integration of discretization scheme and solution method. In contrast to solution methods, where options are available that are fast, robust and memory-efficient at the same time, choosing the underlying discretization scheme still requires the user to make compromises. Discretizations with trigonometric polynomials suffer from spurious oscillations in the solution fields and lead to ill-conditioned systems for complex porous materials, but come with rather accurate effective properties for finitely contrasted materials. The staggered grid discretization, a finite-volume scheme, is devoid of bulk artifacts in the solution fields and works robustly for porous materials, but does not handle anisotropic materials in a natural way. Fully integrated finite-element discretizations share the advantages of the staggered grid, but involve a higher memory footprint, require a higher computational effort due to the increased number of integration points and typically overestimate the effective properties. Most widely used is the rotated staggered grid discretization, which may also be viewed as an underintegrated trilinear finite element discretization, which does not impose restrictions on the constitutive law, has fewer artifacts than Fourier-type discretizations and leads to rather accurate effective properties. However, this discretization comes with two downsides. For a start, checkerboard artifacts are still present. Second, convergence problems occur for complex porous microstructures. The work at hand introduces FFT-based solution techniques for underintegrated trilinear finite elements with hourglass control. The latter approach permits to suppress local hourglass modes, which stabilizes the convergence behavior of the solvers for porous materials and removes the checkerboards from the local solution field. Moreover, the hourglass-control parameter can be adjusted to “soften” the material response compared to fully integrated elements, using only a single integration point for nonlinear analyses at the same time. To be effective, the introduced technology requires a displacement-based implementation. The article exposes an efficient way for doing so, providing minimal interfaces to the most commonly used solution techniques and the appropriate convergence criterion.},

  abstract     = {For the numerical simulation of short fiber-reinforced composites and the correct analysis of the deformation, information about the plastic behavior and its spatial distribution is essential. When using purely deterministic modeling approaches information of the probabilistic microstructure is not included in the simulation process. One possible approach for the integration of stochastic information is the use of random fields, which requires information about the correlation structure of all material input parameters. In this study the correlation structure for finite strain elasto-plastic material behavior of short fiber-reinforced composites is analyzed. This approach combines the use of already established procedures for linear-elastic material behavior with a homogenization method for plasticity. The obtained results reveal a complex correlation structure, which is approximated with triangle and exponential correlation functions influenced by the window size. Due to the dependence of the hyperelastic and plastic material parameters on the fiber mass fraction, the strain-energy density function coefficients are cross-correlated with the yield strength of the composite. With this knowledge at hand, in a subsequent work numerical simulations of tensile tests are conducted that cover the elastic and plastic domain and include spatially distributed material properties.},

  abstract     = {Mixed assumed stress finite elements (FEs) have shown good advantages over traditional displacement-based formulations in various contexts. However, their use in incremental elasto-plasticity is limited by the need for return mapping schemes which preserve the assumed stress interpolation. For elastic-perfectly plastic materials and small deformation problems, the integration of the constitutive equation furnishes a closest point projection (CPP) involving all the element stress parameters. In this work, a dual decomposition strategy is adopted to split this problem into a series of CPPs at the integration points level and in a nonlinear system of equations over the element, in order to simplify its solution. The strategy is tested with a four nodes mixed shell FE, named MISS-4, characterized by an equilibrated stress interpolation which improves the accuracy. Two decomposition strategies are tested to express the plastic admissibility either in terms of stress resultants or point-wise Cauchy stresses. The recovered elasto-plastic solution preserves all the advantages of MISS-4, namely it is accurate for coarse meshes in recovering the equilibrium path and evaluating the limit load showing a quadratic rate of convergence, as demonstrated by the numerical results.},

The algorithm exploits the evaluation time gradient in addition to the convergence gradient attempting to reach the same convergence precision following a more economical path. The particle&#39;s newly incorporated time information is usually in contradiction to the past memories of best function evaluations thus degrading convergence. A technique is proposed in order to modulate the new cognitive input that consists of progressive reducing of its weight in order to confer the algorithm the appropriate time-convergence balance. Results show that the proposed algorithm not only provides computational economy, but also unexpectedly improves convergence per se due to a better exploration in the initial stages of optimization. Its application in asymptotic homogenization of a cracked poroelastic medium confirms its superior performance compared to a series of alternative optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm improvement allows to extend the applicability of PSO and PSO-based algorithms to problems that were previously thought to be too computationally expensive for population-based approaches.},

The algorithm permits to generate microstructures with fibers that are significantly longer than the edge lengths of the underlying cell. Industrially processed short and long-fiber composites naturally feature a high volume fraction, which needs to be reflected by state-of-the-art microstructure generation tools. Nowadays, it is well understood that digital twins of the microstructure of composites are essential for reliable computational multiscale methods. The original SAM algorithm was shown to reliably generate microstructures for short and straight cylindrical fibers. Digital volume images reveal, however, that the fibers in such fiber-reinforced composites may show significant curvature, in particular for long fibers. The work at hand introduces an extension of the original SAM approach to curved fibers. More precisely, curved fibers are considered as sequences of straight fibers which are joined at their respective ends and whose level of bending is controlled by the angle between adjacent fiber segments. We discuss how to efficiently implement the novel method and how to select the crucial numerical parameters. We compare the introduced methodology to the original SAM algorithm for short fibers and demonstrate the superiority of the novel strategy for long fibers.},

This study proposes an improved locking-free SNS-PFEM to investigate the performance of the bubble function and selective integration scheme in circumventing volumetric locking. Three locking-free variants of SNS-PFEM: (1) SNS-PFEM with a cubic bubble function (bSNS-PFEM), (2) SNS-PFEM with a selective integration scheme (selective SNS-PFEM), and (3) SNS-PFEM with a cubic bubble function and selective integration scheme (selective bSNS-PFEM)—were gradually developed for comparison. The performance of these three approaches was first successively examined using two examples with elastic materials, that is, an infinite plate with a circular hole and Cook&#39;s membrane. The comparisons show that the cubic bubble function and selective integration scheme are both necessary as a locking-free approach for modeling nearly incompressible materials, and the proposed selective bSNS-PFEM performs best among the three variants in terms of accuracy and convergence. Two examples of slope stability analysis and footing penetration on elastoplastic materials were then conducted by SNS-PFEM and the proposed selective bSNS-PFEM. The results indicate that the proposed selective bSNS-PFEM is stable and accurate, even when accompanied by significant deformation. All obtained results indicate that the locking-free selective bSNS-PFEM is a powerful approach for modeling nearly incompressible materials with both material and geometric nonlinearity.},

We use the linearized Navier–Stokes equations for a Newtonian fluid and describe the linear elastic solid using the linearized balance of momentum. For coupling between fluid and solid, we develop a non-conforming finite element formulation, and propose an estimation for the necessary penalty factor by applying a scaling approach. The formulation is validated based on several test cases for various material combinations and shows good agreement with analytical solutions. Further, Nitsche-based and symmetrization-free formulations are compared, and spatial convergence is studied. Finally, we present an application example of a miniature Helmholtz resonator, which depicts a notable impact of the solid interaction on the viscous flow. In sum, our study indicates the potential for widespread use of the presented numerical approach in modeling FSI in miniature systems.},

The originality of this work consists also to use a beam model which taken into account the nonlinear term neglected in several works of the literature. This term makes it possible to have the buckling and bending problems by using the classical Timoshenko model and to handle the boundary conditions that several works could not to take into account. A strong form of nonlinear equations is established based on the first order shear deformation theory of beams with the von-Kármán kinematic hypothesis. Regarding functionally graded materials (FGM), two typical types are investigated: sandwich beam with FGM faces and ceramic core (Type-A), and sandwich beam with FGM core and uniform faces (Type-B). The accuracy and efficiency of the SCDQM-HOCM compared with finite element method coupled with high order continuation method (FEM-HOCM) are illustrated on numerical examples of the FGM beams and then the FG sandwich beams. Furthermore, a parametric study is led to carry out the influence of different skin-core-skin thickness ratios, span-to-height ratio, and volume fraction on the bending and buckling behavior of FG sandwich beams subjected to different loadings and various boundary conditions.},

To address this issue, this article presents a novel method to generate multiple normals on an arbitrary manifold. In the proposed method, we abstract the multiple normals displacement and topology connection calculation into a geometric problem on the unit sphere and prove that visible conditions can always be satisfied in finite multiple normals. After that, an engineering implementation is proposed, including an initial normal calculation using visual dependency graph analysis and spherical mesh optimization. The results show that our method can generate multiple normals at extremely complex corners where even advanced commercial software failed. The experiments of the industrial model proved the reliability and effectiveness of the first layer mesh generated by our method.},

Based on a partition of the domain by polytopal macro subregions, this is a strategy for efficient simulations of problems with strongly varying solutions. The flux approximations interacting with the skeleton (subregion boundaries) are strongly constrained by a given trace space. Whilst the dimension of the piecewise polynomial trace space is expected to be as low as possible, the small-scale features of the solution are supposed to be accurately resolved by completely independent local stable mixed solvers, the trace variable playing the role of Neumann boundary data. As the method already gives an equilibrated global H(div)-conforming flux approximation, the methodology for the error estimation only requires a potential reconstruction. In addition to usual residual errors and indicators associated with the potential reconstruction, the estimation also takes into account the effect of discretizations of practical nonhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Based on the proposed a posteriori error estimator, -adaptive algorithms are constructed to guide a proper choice of the trace space. The performance of the error estimator and the adaptive scheme is numerically investigated through a set of illustrating test problems.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian process modeling (GPM) is widely used to replace physical models for uncertainty quantification (UQ). The fidelity of training samples has a major impact on the prediction performance of the GPM, and the computational time of obtaining high-fidelity (HF) samples from simulations may be very prohibitively expensive. Therefore, this study proposes the use of the multi-fidelity GPM for UQ to make a trade-off between the computational cost and accuracy by combining a few HF samples with many computationally-cheaper low-fidelity (LF) ones. Currently, the co-Gaussian process model (co-GPM, also known as multi-fidelity GPM) requires that the LF and HF samples be nested. A generalized co-Gaussian process model (GC-GPM) is developed that can mix LF and HF samples under both nested and un-nested conditions. In addition, to further alleviate the computational cost, an adaptive sampling strategy is introduced into GC-GPM to reduce the number of training samples using a new infill criterion. Within the adaptive GC-GPM framework, the high dimensional integrals associated with the statistical moments (mean and variance) of structural response can be decomposed to single dimensional ones that are analytically tractable, which finally allows for analytical calculation of the mean and variance. Three full-scale structures are adopted to verify the reliability and efficiency of the proposed adaptive GC-GPM method, and traditional GC-GPM and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) are used for comparison purpose. The comparison results show that the UQ results of the adaptive GC-GPM match well with those of the MCS and compared to the traditional GC-GPM, the adaptive GC-GPM owns higher computational accuracy and efficiency.},

Considering the correlation of multiple output responses and the small failure probability involved in multi-output structural system, this article proposes a novel active learning Kriging (ALK) based reliability method for multi-output structural system by combining multiple response Gaussian process (MRGP) and importance sampling (IS). First, due to the Kriging model can only construct the surrogate model under the single-output variable, the MRGP model is introduced to substitute the Kriging model and thus the correlation in multiple output responses can be efficiently described by a correlation matrix in MRGP model. Second, for the case that the distance information of new iterated sample point is not considered by the commonly used learning functions (U-function, EFF-function and H-function) in ALK, three improved learning functions are correspondingly proposed. Finally, aiming at the problem that the small failure probability leads to the increasing of candidate sample pool and further results in low computational efficiency, the IS method is combined with the MRGP model to efficiently accomplish the reliability analysis for multi-output structural system. Several examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose and analyze a set of fully nonstationary Anderson acceleration (AA) algorithms with two window sizes and optimized damping. Although AA has been used for decades to speed up nonlinear solvers in many applications, most authors are simply using and analyzing the stationary version of AA (sAA) with fixed window size and a constant damping factor. The behavior and potential of the nonstationary version of AA methods remain an open question. Most efficient linear solvers however use composable algorithmic components. Similar ideas can be used for AA to solve nonlinear systems. Thus in the present work, to develop nonstationary AA algorithms, we first propose a systematic way to dynamically alternate the window size by the multiplicative composite combination, which means we apply sAA( ) in the outer loop and apply sAA( ) in the inner loop. By doing this, significant gains can be achieved. Second, to make AA to be a fully nonstationary algorithm, we need to combine these strategies with our recent work on the nonstationary AA algorithm with optimized damping (AAoptD), which is another important direction of producing nonstationary AA and nice performance gains have been observed. Moreover, we also investigate the rate of convergence of these nonstationary AA methods under suitable assumptions. Finally, our numerical results show that some of these proposed nonstationary AA algorithms converge faster than the stationary sAA method and they may significantly reduce the storage and time to find the solution in many cases.},

Recently, we have proposed an efficient reduction scheme for the node-to-node formulation [Manvelyan et al., Comput Mech 68, 1283–1295 (2021)] that leads to linear complementarity problems (LCPs). Here, we enhance the underlying contact problem to a node-to-segment formulation, which leads to quadratic inequalities as constraints. The adjoint system corresponds to a nonlinear complementarity problem that describes the Lagrange multiplier. The latter is solved by a Newton-type iteration based on a LCP solver in each time step. Since the maximal set of potential contact nodes is predefined, an additional substructuring by Craig–Bampton can be performed. This contact treatment turns out to be necessary and allows exclusion of the Lagrange multipliers and the nodal displacements at contact from reduction. The numerical solutions of the reduced contact problem achieve high accuracy and the dynamic contact carries over the behavior of the full order model. Moreover, if the contact area is small compared to the overall structure, the reduction scheme performs very efficiently. The performance of the resulting reduction method is assessed on two 2D computational examples from linear elasticity.},

In this article, we present a shape optimization scheme which uses a four-noded rectangular immersed-interface element circumventing the need for interface-fitted mesh for finite element analysis, and mesh morphing or re-meshing for shape optimization. The analysis problem is solved using a non-conformal, Petrov–Galerkin (ncPG) formulation. We use non-conformal trial functions with conformal test functions. A fixed structured grid with a linear approximation for the interface within each element is used. We perform a bi-material patch test to confirm the consistency and convergence of the immersed-interface finite element method (IIFEM). The convergence of the displacement and stress error norms are of the same or slightly better order compared to the interface-fitted FEM. Thus, IIFEM reduces the cost of meshing without compromising the accuracy of the solutions obtained. We then perform analytical design sensitivity analysis to obtain the gradient of the global stiffness matrix with respect to shape design variables. The sensitivities are used in the gradient-based optimization formulation of the shape design problem. We present several ways to parametrize the design space. Finally, verification and case studies are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and potential of the approach.},

Error estimates are developed using a Zhu-Zienkiewicz estimator coupled with the adjoint methodology to deliver goal-oriented results. A Bayesian probabilistic estimation framework is deployed for full field estimation. An adaptive, radial basis function based reduced order modeling strategy is implemented to reduce the cost of calculating the posterior. The Bayesian reconstruction approach, accelerated by the proposed model reduction technology, is shown to yield good probabilistic estimates of full error fields, with a computational complexity that is acceptable compared to the evaluation of the goal-oriented error estimates. The novelty of the work is that a set of computed error estimates are considered as partial observations of an underlying error field, which is to be recovered. Future improvements of the method include the optimal selection of goal-oriented error measures to be acquired prior to the error field reconstruction.},

This mixed variational principle takes the deformed configuration and sections from its cotangent bundle as the input arguments. The critical points of the proposed HW functional enforce compatibility of these sections with the configuration, in addition to mechanical equilibrium and constitutive relations. Using this variational principle we construct a mixed FE approximation that distinguishes a vector from a 1-form, a feature not commonly found in FE approximations for nonlinear elasticity. This distinction plays a pivotal role in identifying suitable FE spaces for approximating the 1-forms appearing in the variational principle. These discrete approximations are constructed using ideas borrowed from finite element exterior calculus, which are in turn used to construct a discrete approximation to our HW functional. The discrete equations describing mechanical equilibrium, compatibility, and constitutive rule, are obtained by seeking extremum of the discrete functional with respect to the respective degrees of freedom. The discrete extremum problem is then solved numerically; we use Newton&#39;s method for this purpose. This mixed FE technique is then applied to a few benchmark problems wherein conventional displacement based approximations encounter locking and checker boarding.

  abstract     = {A core issue in structural multiple bifurcations (MB) in computational engineering is to identify all existing branching paths emanating from the MB point in compound stability problems. The governing MB equations (MBEs) will commonly result in a set of three (or occasionally two) polynomial equations in asymptotic stability theory when the singular stiffness matrix is subject to a rank deficiency of two (i.e., two null eigenvalues). However, no general solution strategy has been established to solve MBEs so far. This study proposes innovative graphical solution ideas to intuitively visualize multiple path branching in 2D- and 3D-spaces of variables. Although the graphical skills display real solutions in specified search areas on a graphical monitor, it is not assured that “all” real roots are detected. The total number of identified real and complex roots of simultaneous equations must be generally consistent with that predicted algebraically to ensure that all real and complex roots are captured in MB. In computational algebra, Gröbner bases are employed to convert a set of polynomial equations into single recursively solvable equations and can be plugged into visualization steps. Therefore, Gröbner bases and graphical skills are complementary and can be applied to numerically solve a set of plate/shell structural MBEs.},

This study considers finite deformation for hyper-elastic materials, but it is assumed that the analytical solutions associated with hyper-elastic materials can be updated to hold approximately in each incremental step. Moreover, the deformation information required for stress computation is updated by using the incremental deformation gradient, which is constructed from the updated ATFs.

  abstract     = {This article presents a vertex-centered finite volume algorithm for the explicit dynamic analysis of large strain contact problems. The methodology exploits the use of a system of first order conservation equations written in terms of the linear momentum and a triplet of geometric deformation measures (comprising the deformation gradient tensor, its co-factor, and its Jacobian) together with their associated jump conditions. The latter can be used to derive several dynamic contact models ensuring the preservation of hyperbolic characteristic structure across solution discontinuities at the contact interface, a clear advantage over the standard quasi-static contact models where the influence of inertial effects at the contact interface is completely neglected. Taking advantage of the conservative nature of the formalism, both kinetic (traction) and kinematic (velocity) contact interface conditions are explicitly enforced at the fluxes through the use of appropriate jump conditions. Specifically, the kinetic condition is enforced in the usual linear momentum equation, whereas the kinematic condition can now be easily enforced in the geometric conservation equations without requiring a computationally demanding iterative algorithm. Additionally, a total variation diminishing shock capturing technique can be suitably incorporated in order to improve dramatically the performance of the algorithm at the vicinity of shocks. Moreover, and to guarantee stability from the spatial discretization standpoint, global entropy production is demonstrated through the satisfaction of semi-discrete version of the classical Coleman–Noll procedure expressed in terms of the time rate of the so-called Hamiltonian energy of the system. Finally, a series of numerical examples is examined in order to assess the performance and applicability of the algorithm suitably implemented in OpenFOAM. The knowledge of the potential contact loci between contact interfaces is assumed to be known a priori.},

Compared to classic topology optimization methods, aimed at obtaining the optimum design of a structure by considering its self-weight, building cost, or bearing capacity, DLO optimizes the failure pattern of the structure under specific loading conditions and constraints by minimizing the dissipation energy. In this work, we present a modified DLO algorithm that contains all of the advantages of DLO. It is referred to virtual displacement-based discontinuity layout optimization (VDLO). VDLO takes the stress state of a loaded structure as a snapshot and correspondingly provides the optimum failure pattern, which greatly extends the application potential of DLO. Numerical examples indicate the effectiveness and flexibility of VDLO. It is regarded as a highly promising supplemental tool for other numerical methods in element-/node-based frameworks.},

An XFEM (extended finite element method) model is used for the underlying matrix, which can then be meshed without considering internal boundaries. The inclusions are treated by conventional FEM (finite element method) model. The FEM-XFEM coupling is treated by the dual mortar method, which uses the XFEM side to carry the Lagrange multiplier for imposing inclusion-matrix contact constraints. The present method is first validated by contact patch tests as well as bending tests and then applied to simulate strong discontinuities arising from bolt-rock and pile-soil interactions. The numerical results indicate that the present method is capable of simulating the internal interface problems with high accuracy, computational efficiency as well as mesh convenience.},

In order to discover the optimal structure more efficiently and to avoid exhaustive search, genetic algorithm is incorporated into GMDH structure. It is found that the prediction results obtained by GMDH model agree well with measured values both for training and testing data. Moreover, the derived equation of motion is expressed as the product of parameter composed of Young&#39;s modulus and length scale and linear combination of displacements of material points in the horizon, which is in accordance with the original bond-based peridynamic formulation.

The surface and the shell theory are formulated within a curvilinear coordinate system, which allows the representation of general surfaces and deformations. The kinematics follow from Kirchhoff–Love theory and the discretization makes use of isogeometric shape functions. A multiplicative split of the surface deformation gradient is employed, such that an intermediate surface configuration is introduced. The surface metric and curvature of this intermediate configuration follow from the solution of nonlinear evolution laws—ordinary differential equations—that stem from a generalized viscoelastic solid model. The evolution laws are integrated numerically with the implicit Euler scheme and linearized within the Newton–Raphson scheme of the nonlinear finite element framework. The implementation of membrane and bending viscosity is verified with the help of analytical solutions and shows ideal convergence behavior. The chosen numerical examples capture large deformations and typical viscoelasticity behavior, such as creep, relaxation, and strain rate dependence. It is also shown that the proposed formulation can be straightforwardly applied to model boundary viscoelasticity of 3D bodies.},

  abstract     = {The recently introduced framework enabling model order reduction (MOR) for systems arising within the acoustic boundary element method (BEM), allows for fast frequency sweeps to obtain the detailed response of an acoustic system. Nevertheless, in many cases it is desirable to include additional parameters in the MOR scheme to facilitate iterations among different configurations of a specific design. In that context, this work proposes a multiparameter Krylov subspaces recycling scheme, based on the algorithms proposed in Reference 23 for a single parameter, aiming at the parametric MOR of acoustic BEM systems. The proposed scheme allows to include multiple parameters along with the non-affine wavenumber kernel dependency and thus facilitates the fast solution of parametric acoustic systems. The article distinguishes among three different parametrizations of BEM systems: (i) a right-hand side parametrization, (ii) an affine, and (iii) a non-affine parametrization of the system matrix. The two former cases allow for the construction of a cheap residual error estimator and thus facilitate the deployment of a greedy sampling strategy. This work proposes the employment of such a greedy strategy in the context of Krylov subspaces recycling, which combined with the automatic Krylov subspaces recycling (AKR) algorithm, enables the construction of a global reduction basis incorporating such parametric variations. On the contrary, since in case of non-affine parametrizations a cheap residual error estimator is not directly available, a multiparameter AKR algorithm is deployed to ensure the predefined residual level. The performance of the proposed methods is benchmarked against a reduced basis method-type approach, which follows the same assumptions as the AKR for the case of non-affine systems. The potential of the algorithms is demonstrated on academic BEM examples including source position, material, and shape parametrizations and significant reductions in the sampling required for the construction of the respective reduction bases are reported.},

These methods repeatedly sparsify the fill-in matrix blocks that arise in block Gaussian elimination, to compute an approximate factorization of the given matrix, assuming that the fill-in blocks are low-rank. The factorization is then used for preconditioning in a Krylov subspace method, such as the conjugate gradient method (CG), BiCGSTAB or GMRES. However, to achieve fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems, sparsifications can only introduce a small error, in which case they may inefficiently restore sparsity, and consequently the factorization can take a lot of time to compute. In the novel approach to sparsification, the 2-norm of the incurred error in the sparsification of a matrix block is squared compared to previous approaches, with no additional computations. We incorporate the new approach into the recent sparsified nested dissection algorithm and test it on a wide range of symmetric positive definite problems. The new approach halves the number of CG iterations needed for convergence, significantly improving the overall performance of the algorithm. Our approach can be incorporated into other solvers that exploit the low-rank property of matrix blocks.},

The linear combination of the average temperature and pressure drop was defined as the objective function. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to verify the physical fields of the optimized results. The optimized results indicated that, as the weighting factor ( w ) for the average temperature increased, the flow distribution was more reasonable and uniform, effectively decreasing the average temperature at the cost of higher pressure drops. In comparison with the optimization entirely based on GA, the hybrid optimization could yield a similar and efficient cooling performance with lower time-consuming. Moreover, the optimized results obtained under the suitable objective could achieve the better thermal performance at a lower pressure drop in comparison with the conventional serpentine-shaped channel layout. Finally, the hybrid optimization method used in this article was compared with the conventional density approach, and the former could obtain the clear and complex channel distribution with greatly reduced computational time.},

  abstract     = {The use of reduced-order models (ROMs) in physics-based modeling and simulation almost always involves the use of linear reduced basis (RB) methods such as the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). For some nonlinear problems, linear RB methods perform poorly, failing to provide an efficient subspace for the solution space. The use of nonlinear manifolds for ROMs has gained traction in recent years, showing increased performance for certain nonlinear problems over linear methods. Deep learning has been popular to this end through the use of autoencoders for providing a nonlinear trial manifold for the solution space. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ROM framework for steady-state parameterized partial differential equations that uses convolutional autoencoders to provide a nonlinear solution manifold and is augmented by Gaussian process regression (GPR) to approximate the expansion coefficients of the reduced model. When applied to a numerical example involving the steady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations solving a lid-driven cavity problem, it is shown that the proposed ROM offers greater performance in prediction of full-order states when compared to a popular method employing POD and GPR over a number of ROM dimensions.},

We present a thermodynamically consistent framework for the modeling of elastoplastic stress response, where dissipative effects are considered through a dissipation function instead of explicit flow rules. Along these lines, a mixed incremental principle, in which stresses are included as independent unknowns, is derived. We propose to employ tangential-displacement normal-normal-stress (TDNNS) elements for a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational problem. These elements were originally developed for linear elasticity, where it could be shown that they do not suffer from shear locking if the element&#39;s aspect ratio deteriorates.

It is suitable for modeling localization and size effects in multi-phase materials. The macroscopic deformation gradient and second gradient are enforced on a microstructural representative volume element (RVE). The coupling between the scales is defined by means of kinematical insertion and homogenization operators, carefully postulated to ensure kinematical conservation in the scale transition, according to the method of multi-scale virtual power. From the solution of the micro-scale equilibrium, the macroscopic stress tensors are derived based on the principle of multi-scale virtual power. The kinematical constraints at the RVE level are enforced with Lagrange multipliers. A mixed finite element approach is adopted for the numerical solution of the micro and macro second gradient equilibrium problems. It conveniently leads to a formulation where the Lagrange multipliers are the homogenized stresses, and the macroscopic consistent tangent operators for FE 2 simulations can be directly derived. The Newton–Raphson scheme is employed to solve the non-linear systems of equations. The numerical results demonstrate the predictive capability of the proposed model. A systematic analysis of the influence of RVE length and the micro-constituent size is performed.},

  abstract     = {The computation cost of matrix formation in isogeometric analysis can be drastically reduced by employing tensor decomposition, but the performance like accuracy and robustness still depends on the approach used to realize the low-rank approximation for the nonpolynomial integral kernels. In the buckling analysis of laminated shells with solid-shell model, the integral kernels are not smooth in the thickness direction due to their material and stress distribution and have a high complexity because the curvilinear coordinate systems are involved in the representation of anisotropic constitutive relations, which makes it more difficult to guarantee the decomposition accuracy. This paper proposes a robust high-fidelity tensor-decomposition based matrix formation method for stiffness matrix and geometric stiffness matrix of the isogeometric buckling analysis problem. The proposed method avoids using a spline approximation and employs the hierarchical block-wise decomposition approach (HBD) to obtain a determinate decomposition result, which saves more time without loss of accuracy and produces less canonical ranks with a reliable procedure. Besides, the matrix calculation is partly independent of the number of layers, showing a higher efficiency when the number of layers is larger. Finally, several experiments with various Gaussian curvatures are implemented to validate the proposed method.},

The resulting algorithmic setting is especially relevant for structural analyses of polycrystals and the multiscale evaluation of anisotropic microstructures in metallic materials. These techniques are exemplified with a constitutive model, which couples crystallographic slip and martensitic transformation deformation mechanisms with a viscous regularization. The model is characterized by a set of highly coupled equations expressed in a single system and solved by a monolithic solution procedure. The first technique employs a sub-stepping procedure to generate a better initial guess for the Newton–Raphson scheme used in the iterative solution of the equilibrium problem at the Gauss quadrature point. Then, a logarithmic discretization of the exponential parameter of the viscoplastic law is proposed to approximate the target value of the exponential parameter incrementally in the return mapping algorithm. A strategy to remove the strain-rate dependence and reduce the necessary viscoplastic parameters is also presented to help with the stiff equations that arise in the rate-independent limit. Finally, an efficient strategy is suggested to complete the transformation process when the full martensitic transformation is approached. These techniques can be easily used in any combination and dramatically improve the model&#39;s efficiency by enabling more significant incremental steps to be used within the monolithic solution procedure. A thorough assessment of their impact is shown in a series of ablation studies.},

Both explicit and implicit representations, such as geometric entities and level sets, are introduced to describe configurations of discontinuities. The geometric engine is designed in an object-oriented way and consists of several modules. For efficiency, a k -d tree data structure that partitions the background mesh is constructed for detecting cut elements whose neighbors are found by means of a dual graph structure. Moreover, the implementation for creating enriched nodes, integration elements, and physical groups is described in detail, and the corresponding pseudo-code is also provided. The complexity and efficiency of the geometric engine are investigated by solving 2-D and 3-D discontinuous models. The capability of the geometric engine is demonstrated on several numerical examples. Topology optimization and problems with intersecting discontinuities are handled with enriched FEMs, where enriched discretizations obtained from the geometric engine are used for the analysis. Furthermore, polycrystalline structures that overlap with an unfitted mesh are considered, where integration elements are created so they align with grain boundaries. Another example shows that the Stanford bunny, which is discretized by a surface mesh with triangular elements, can be fully immersed into a 3-D background mesh. Finally, we share a list of main findings and conclude that the proposed geometric engine is general, robust, and efficient.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a finite-deformation model for extrusion-based layered printing with cementitious materials. The evolution of mechanical properties as the printed material cures and stiffens results in nonphysical reduction in the magnitude of elastic strains when standard constitutive models are employed. This elastic recovery of the printing induced deformation contradicts the experimentally observed behavior of the printed cementitious materials that harden at a nearly-frozen deformed state. A thermodynamically motivated constraint on the evolution of elastic strains is imposed on the constitutive model to remedy the nonphysical bounce-back effect. An algorithm that is based on a strain-projection technique for the elastic part of deformation is developed that complements the inelastic response given by the Drucker–Prager model. It is then embedded in a finite strain finite element framework for the modeling and simulation of cure hardening and inelastic response of the early age cementitious materials. A ghost mesh method is proposed for continuous layer-wise printing of the material without the need for intermittent mesh generation technique or adaptive remeshing methods. The model is validated via comparison with experimental data and representative test cases are presented that investigate the mathematical and computational attributes of the proposed model.},

This recharacterization of D $$ \mathbf{\mathsf{D}} $$ is irrelevant for 1D modeling, but significantly clarifies 3D algorithms. The new 3D derivation starts with three damage parameters associated with three independent strength models for three components of crack traction. By postulating a traction failure surface dependent on current damage state and requiring that all traction components simultaneously decay to zero at failure, the three damage parameters naturally couple to a single parameter. Many prior methods assume evolving strength depends only on damage. In real materials, strength often depends on other variables such as temperature, pressure, strain rate, and so forth. This article proposes a new general theory that extends prior methods to properly account for such external variables. The general damage mechanics methods must account for extra variables during damage initiation, damage evolution, and elastic loading and unloading. Several examples focus on the new concepts for coupling damage parameters and for using general methods to model materials with pressure-dependent strength properties.},

Herein, we advance this method for the study of transient dynamic multiscale solid mechanics problems where information is exchanged back and forth between small and large scales. The extension to dynamics relies on the notion of a global time stepper. Within each global time step, the subdomains are coupled by the standard Schwarz iterative process. Remarkably, each subdomain can use its own time step or even its own time integrator to advance its solution in time, provided that they synchronize at each global time step. We study the performance of the Schwarz method on several examples designed for this purpose. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the method is capable of coupling regions with different mesh resolutions, different element types, and different time integration schemes (e.g., implicit and explicit), all without introducing any artifacts that afflict other coupling methods for transient dynamics. Finally, we apply the dynamic Schwarz alternating method to the simulation of a bolted joint subjected to dynamic loading, as a demonstration of the performance of the method in a realistic scenario.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a precise integral method (PIM) for the load identification of continuous structures based on the polynomial nonlinear hypothesis is presented. Essentially, load identification can be regarded as solving a dynamic equation in an inverse process. PIM is famous for its high precision in positive engineering problems. It has been already used in load reconstruction, but most cases are with discrete structures. In each time step, the dynamic responses of the measured points are used to identify the load without establishing a recursive chain, so PIM is not sensitive to the initial value and has no accumulated error. Legendrepolynomials (LPIM) is a computational scheme. The dynamic load is assumed to be a polynomial fitting nonlinear function in each integral time step with LPIM. Just with the first modal, LPIM can reliably identify the concentrated load. In addition, as uncertainty is getting more and more attention in engineer, it is also needed to be considered in load identification. In linear systems, interval vertex is a reliable method to obtain the load bounds in the virtue of multisource uncertainties. The results of identified load are too lumpy because of the polynomial fitting. To improve the precision, Savitsky–Golay (S–G) filters which fit the curves by polynomials in a frame length is introduced to smooth down the load in high fidelity. Eight numerical examples are investigated to demonstrated the efficiency and precision of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {The peridynamic bond-associated formulation has been shown to be effective in stabilizing the conventional correspondence model for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional, static, and dynamic problems. However, recent study revealed the persistence of material instability in the bond-associated formulation for one-dimensional problems for majority combinations of the bond associated horizon size and material point horizon size and two-dimensional problems when both the bond-associated horizon size and the material point horizon size are twice of mesh spacing. In addition, it was found that the bond-associated formulation has instability in dynamic problems when the bond-associated horizon size is close to the material point horizon size. In this article, a reformulation of the bond-associated correspondence formulation is presented. Distinct from the original formulation, the proposed reformulation derives the force density states of a bond as a volume weighted average of all bond-associated force density states whose bond-associated horizons include the material points of the bond. Similar to the original bond-associated formulation, the proposed reformulation recovers the conventional formulation when the bond-associated horizon size is at least twice as large as the material point horizon size. Detailed numerical study on wave dispersion relations, static deformation, and dynamic wave propagation problems are performed to investigate and compare the two bond-associated formulations. It is found that for all these three types of problems, the proposed reformulation significantly improves the model instability compared to the original bond-associated formulation, especially when the bond-associated horizon size is small relative to the material point horizon size. Based on numerical study, small bond-associated horizon is recommended for use in the proposed reformulation.},

In the current work, a free energy minimization method is employed in which atom positions in both the atomistic and continuum regions always occupy equilibrium positions. The effect of ghost forces at the interface of the atomistic and continuum regions is discussed for all three variants of hot-QC using two examples: a perfect cubic crystal and a Lomer dislocation dipole. Errors due to ghost forces and due to mesh entropy are considered and the efficacy of their correction terms are evaluated. It is shown that the proposed free energy minimization method has comparable accuracy to the other methods with significantly higher efficiency.},

An FFT-based Galerkin method of stress control type, the associated projection operator for zero divergence condition and the treatment of composite pixels/voxels are presented for solving the viscous flow in periodic porous material. Finally, numerical examples of viscous flows in 2D parallel fissured medium, 2D medium with regularly packed squares, 2D medium with regularly packed and rotated squares, 3D medium with regularly packed ellipsoids, and 3D medium with randomly packed ellipsoids are implemented.

The Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse using the truncated singular value decomposition is employed in the local approximation of supporting domain instead of the moving least squares method. The developed approach is a semi-analytical and local radial basis function collocation method using the non-singular general solution as the basis function. Like the traditional boundary knot method, the LKM is simple, accurate and easy-to-program in solving inverse Cauchy problems associated with Helmholtz equations. Unlike the boundary knot method, the new scheme can directly reconstruct the unknowns both inside the physical domain and along its boundary by solving a sparse linear system, and can achieve a satisfactory solution. Numerical experiments, involving the complicated geometry and the high noise level, confirm the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method for solving inverse Cauchy problems of Helmholtz equations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a methodology for improving the accuracy and efficiency of reduced order models (ROMs) constructed using the least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) projection method through the introduction of preconditioning. Unlike prior related work, which focuses on preconditioning the linear systems arising within the ROM numerical solution procedure to improve linear solver performance, our approach leverages a preconditioning matrix directly within the minimization problem underlying the LSPG formulation. Applying preconditioning in this way has the potential to improve ROM accuracy for several reasons. First, preconditioning the LSPG formulation changes the norm defining the residual minimization, which can improve the residual-based stability constant bounding the ROM solution&#39;s error. The incorporation of a preconditioner into the LSPG formulation can have the additional effect of scaling the components of the residual being minimized to make them roughly of the same magnitude, which can be beneficial when applying the LSPG method to problems with disparate scales (e.g., dimensional equations, multi-physics problems). Importantly, we demonstrate that an “ideal preconditioned” LSPG ROM (a ROM in which the preconditioner is the inverse of the Jacobian of its corresponding full order model) emulates projection of the full order model solution increment onto the reduced basis. This quantity defines a lower bound on the error of a ROM solution for a given reduced basis. By designing preconditioners that approximate the Jacobian inverse—as is common in designing preconditioners for solving linear systems—it is possible to obtain a ROM whose error approaches this lower bound. The proposed approach is evaluated on several mechanical and thermo-mechanical problems implemented within the Albany HPC code and run in the predictive regime, with prediction across material parameter space. We demonstrate numerically that the introduction of simple Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and ILU preconditioners into the proper orthogonal decomposition/LSPG formulation reduces significantly the ROM solution error, the reduced Jacobian condition number, the number of nonlinear iterations required to reach convergence, and the wall time (thereby improving efficiency). Moreover, our numerical results reveal that the introduction of preconditioning can deliver a robust and accurate solution for test cases in which the unpreconditioned LSPG method fails to converge.},

A convolutional autoencoder is employed to map the system response onto a low-dimensional representation and, in parallel, to model the reduced nonlinear trial manifold. The system dynamics on the manifold is described by means of a deep feedforward neural network that is trained together with the autoencoder. The strategy is benchmarked against high fidelity solutions on a clamped-clamped beam and on a real micromirror with softening response and multiplicity of solutions. By comparing the different computational costs, we discuss the impressive gain in performance and show that the DL-ROM truly represents a real-time tool which can be profitably and efficiently employed in complex system-level simulation procedures for design and optimization purposes.},

Theoretical results show that the discrete energy stability and maximum-principle hold, and the numerical results demonstrate that the time step rescaling issue can be resolved using the effective time step.

Low-quality FEs are common when meshing realistic complex components, and while tetrahedral meshing technology is generally robust, meshing algorithms cannot guarantee high-quality meshes for arbitrary geometries or for non-water-tight computer-aided design models. For reliable simulations on such meshes, we consider FE meshes with tetrahedral and prismatic elements that have badly shaped elements—tetrahedra with dihedral angles close to 0 ∘ $$ {0}^{\circ } $$ and 18 ⁢ 0 ∘ $$ 18{0}^{\circ } $$ , and slender prisms with triangular faces that have short edges—and agglomerate such “bad” elements with neighboring elements to form a larger polyhedral virtual element. On each element, the element-eigenvalue inequality is used to estimate the critical time step. For a suite of illustrative FE meshes with being a mesh-coordinate parameter that leads to poor mesh quality, we show that adopting VEM on the agglomerated polyhedra yield critical time steps that are insensitive as . The significant reduction in solution time on meshes with agglomerated virtual elements vis-à-vis tetrahedral meshes is demonstrated through explicit dynamics simulations on a tapered beam.},

  abstract     = {The identification of internal structural flaws is an important research topic in structural health monitoring. At present, structural safety inspections based on nondestructive testing procedures mainly focus on qualitative analysis; hence, it is difficult to identify the scale of flaws quantitatively. In this article, an inversion model that can realize quantitative detection is proposed by combing the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) with deep learning. First, the lamb wave propagation processes in thin structures containing flaws were simulated using the SBFEM, and the echo wave signal at an observation point was recorded and paired with the flaw information. Then, the paired SBFEM datasets were used to train the deep learning model employing a convolutional neural network. A flaw classification and identification model based on SBFEM datasets was established. For a thin structure with unknown flaw information, and by using the measured observation point signals, the established deep learning model can predict flaw information in real time. Finally, the model performance was verified using several numerical examples. The results show that the proposed model can accurately predict flaw information and is robust against noise; thus, it offers an advantage over existing nondestructive testing procedures and a development in the field of structural health monitoring.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a stabilized formulation for phase-field fracture of hyperelastic materials near the limit of incompressibility. At this limit, traditional mixed displacement and pressure formulations must satisfy the inf-sup condition for solution stability. The mixed formulation coupled with the damage field can lead to an inhibition of crack opening as volumetric changes are severely penalized effectively creating a pressure-bubble. To overcome this bottleneck, we utilize a mixed formulation with a perturbed Lagrangian formulation which enforces the incompressibility constraint in the undamaged material and reduces the pressure effect in the damaged material. A mesh-dependent stabilization technique based on the residuals of the Euler–Lagrange equations multiplied with a differential operator acting on the weight space is used, allowing for linear interpolation of all field variables of the elastic subproblem. This formulation was validated with three examples at finite deformations: a plane-stress pure-shear test, a two-dimensional geometry in plane-stress, and a three-dimensional notched sample. In the last example, we incorporate a hybrid formulation with an additive strain energy decomposition to account for different behaviors in tension and compression. The results show close agreement with analytical solutions for crack tip opening displacements and performs well at the limit of incompressibility.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a, possibly damage-enhanced, pressure-dependent-based incremental-secant mean-field homogenization (MFH) scheme for two-phase composites. The incremental-secant formulation consists on a fictitious unloading of the material up to a stress-free state, in which a residual stress is attained in its phases. Then the secant method is performed in order to compute the mean stress fields of each phase. One of the main advantages of this method is the natural isotropicity of the secant tensors that allows defining the linear-comparison-composite (LCC). In this work, we show that this isotropic nature is preserved for a non-associated pressure dependent plastic flow, making possible the direct definition of the LCC. This model is thus able to represent the physics of real polymeric composites. The MFH scheme is then verified by testing its prediction capabilities in several cases, including cyclic and nonproportional loading involving perfectly elastic phases, elasto-plastic and damage-enhanced elasto-plastic phases in random representative volume elements (RVE) of uni-directional (UD) composites and of composites reinforced with spherical inclusions.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an approach for the topology optimization of frame structures composed of nonlinear Timoshenko beam finite elements (FEs) under time-varying excitation. Material nonlinearity is considered with a nonlinear Timoshenko beam FE model that accounts for distributed plasticity and axial–shear–moment interactions through appropriate hysteretic interpolation functions and a yield/capacity function, respectively. Hysteretic variables for curvature, shear, and axial deformations represent the nonlinearities and evolve according to first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Owing to the first-order representation, the governing dynamic equilibrium equations, and hysteretic evolution equations can thus be concisely presented as a combined system of first-order nonlinear ODEs that can be solved using a general ODE solver. This avoids divergence due to an ill-conditioned stiffness matrix that can commonly occur with Newmark–Newton solution schemes that rely upon linearization. The approach is illustrated for a volume minimization design problem, subject to dynamic excitation where an approximation for the maximum displacement at specified nodes is constrained to a given limit, that is, a drift ratio. The maximum displacement is approximated using the p-norm, thus facilitating the derivation of the analytical sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. The proposed approach is demonstrated through several numerical examples for the design of structural frames subjected to sinusoidal base excitation.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a generalized coordinate smoothed particle hydrodynamics (GCSPH) method coupled with an overset method using the total Lagrangian formulation for solving large deformation and crack propagation problems. In GCSPH, the physical space is decomposed into multiple domains, each of which is mapped to a generalized space to avoid coordinate singularities as well as to flexibly change the spatial resolution. The SPH particles are then non-uniformly distributed in the physical space (e.g., typically in a boundary-conforming manner) and defined uniformly in each generalized space, similar to the standard SPH. The SPH particles in the generalized and physical spaces are numerically related by coordinate transformation matrices. The use of non-uniform particle distributions decreases the total number of particles, thus significantly reducing the simulation cost. Three numerical cases: three-dimensional brittle crack propagation, Taylor impact, and plugging failure, are presented to validate the proposed method. The numerical results are sufficiently accurate compared with the standard total Lagrangian SPH. Furthermore, these results also show the benefits of GCSPH, which not only effectively reduces the computational cost but also eliminates the effects of particle arrangement. These advantages allow GCSPH to perform high-resolution three-dimensional problems, which are otherwise costly to perform with the standard SPH.},

  abstract     = {Manufactured metallic components often contain nonuniformly distributed pores of complex morphologies. Since such porosity defects have a significant influence on material behaviors and affect the usage in high-performance applications, it is significant to understand the impact of porosity characteristics on the behaviors of components. In this work, a gradient-enhanced porosity defeaturing estimator, which allows for the modeling of pore geometry and spatial distribution, is proposed within a general elastostatic framework. In this approach, the first-order shape sensitivity is implemented to account for the change in the elastic quantity of interests to variations of pore sizes and shapes, which is then supplemented by a second-order shape sensitivity whose mixed partial derivative quantifies the interactions between pores in proximity. The efficacy of the proposed method comes from its posterior manner that it only relies on field solutions of reference models where pores are suppressed. In this context, meshing difficulty and solution convergence issues are avoided, which would otherwise arise in a direct finite element analysis on porous structures. The impact of porosity on structural elastic performance is approximated using a second-order Taylor expansion where the topological difference between the porous and reference domains is estimated by topological sensitivity; the field variables on pore boundaries are approximated as explicit functions of design variables using exterior formulations. Numerical results show that the elastic performances of components are influenced by the existence of pores. The pore-to-pore interactions are significant when pores are close by.},

Based on Melan&#39;s lower bound theorem, the gradient-based topology optimization framework synthesizing the shakedown analysis and sensitivity analysis is developed to maximize the shakedown multiplier. Path-independent sensitivity related to the specified density interpolation model is derived analytically for the first time in conjunction with the adjoint method. Besides, a primal-dual algorithm of shakedown analysis is implemented for computing the shakedown load limit of structures and corresponding adjoint variables needed in the sensitivity analysis. In addition to the density interpolation scheme of material Young&#39;s module, the yield strength is also interpolated to overcome numerical difficulties. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which indicates the shakedown load-carrying performance enhancements.},

Although adaptive model refinement can be employed for enhanced effectiveness, it is cumbersome for the traditional mesh-based methods to perform while modeling the evolving localizations. In this work, neural network-enhanced reproducing kernel particle method (NN-RKPM) is proposed, where the location, orientation, and shape of the solution transition near a localization is automatically captured by the NN approximation via a block-level neural network (NN) optimization. The weights and biases in the blocked parameterization network control the location and orientation of the localization. The designed basic four-kernel NN block is capable of capturing a triple junction or a quadruple junction topological pattern, while more complicated localization topological patters are captured by the superposition of multiple four-kernel NN blocks. The standard RK approximation is then utilized to approximate the smooth part of the solution, which permits a much coarser discretization than the high-resolution discretization needed to capture sharp solution transitions with the conventional methods. A regularization of the NN approximation is additionally introduced for discretization-independent material responses. The effectiveness of the proposed NN-RKPM is verified by a series of numerical verifications.},

It consists in a correlation between an image of interest and a virtual image based on a parameterized curve. It is shown that the method is exact in 1D, insensitive to contrast variation, and that the bias induced by brightness variation can be easily corrected. Optimal value of the virtual image width, the sole parameter of the method, and optimal numerical settings are established. An estimator is proposed to assess the relevance of the user-chosen parameterized curve family to match the contour. An analytical formula and a diagram are given for the measurement uncertainty in both cases of noiseless and noisy images.

  abstract     = {Thermal-mechanical coupling environments extensively exist for engineering structures. How to effectively reduce thermoelastic deformation is distinctly important. Cellular structures have superior performances in stiffness and multi-functionality with lightweight, and an excellent design can be expected by reasonably designing the microstructural topology and their distributions. However, existing studies are limited to designing homogenous cellular structures for thermoelastic response problems, although heterogeneous cellular structures have larger design spaces. This article intends to investigate the topology optimization problem for designing a special type of heterogeneous cellular structure, that is, quasi-periodic cellular structure, for thermoelastic responses. The quasi-periodic cellular structure is a composition of microstructures with similar but not the same topology across the macro domain, which ensures a good compromise between manufacturability and performance. By introducing the erode-dilate operators to describe quasi-periodic cellular structural topology, a simple single-loop topology optimization model for minimizing the deformation variance of specific lines with multi-material and multi-constraint is established. Three types of design variables are included, and their sensitivity analyses are derived for using the gradient-based optimization solver to obtain updates simultaneously. Designs with shape-preserving and required stiffness under thermoelastic loadings can be obtained. The examples presented show the capabilities of the proposed procedure and validate the effectiveness of the quasi-periodic cellular structures in improving structural performance for thermoelastic problems.},

We use them to generate a tetrahedral mesh, which our mesher then converts to a polyhedral mesh. The input mesh serves as geometrical support to generate the nodes of the discrete mesh. The desired shape is obtained with an assembly of convex polyhedral particles—without having to clip them. We show that this approach enables meshing convex or concave geometries with sharp edges, curved features, and more. Several three-dimensional geometries are presented to support this claim and illustrate the capabilities of the mesher. We provide a detailed analysis of its isotropy. The geometric isotropy is studied by analyzing the orientation of the generated beams. The mechanical isotropy is verified by assessing the properties of the elasticity tensor. Finally, we show that the new mesh retains its ability to be a good support for the generation of realistic cracking patterns.},

These ellipsoids are seeded by local maxima of the distance to the struts obtained from computer tomography images. This methodology is thus fully voxel-based and does not depend on any assumption about statistical distributions of the foam cells. Therefore, it is able to reproduce an accurate geometrical model of the foam&#39;s microstructure and its possible irregularities. Moreover, this procedure allows the processing of large 3D data sets that do not fit the random access memory (RAM) by slicing it into smaller independent chunks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by comparing it to FEM simulations for which meshes are obtained from a feature reconstruction approach. Both FEM simulations are then compared with experimental results of uniaxial compressions of an open foam.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a refinement of the finite strip method (FSM) based on the Carrera unified formulation (CUF) and is applied to free vibration analysis of variable stiffness composite laminated (VSCL) plates. VSCL plates considered here are composed of layers with curvilinear fibers in which their orientation angle changes linearly with respect to one of the in-plane coordinates. The FSM permits the plate to be divided into some finite strips connected along the so-called nodal lines. The conventional finite strip method involves an approximation of the solution of a plate problem by using continuously harmonic series in the longitudinal direction along the nodal lines and simple polynomial shape functions (the usual beam shape functions) in the transverse direction of the plate. However, refined finite strip model that presented in this paper allows one to express the unknown variables as a set of thickness functions that only depend on the thickness coordinate and the corresponding variable that depends on the in-plane coordinates which involve continuously harmonic series and polynomial shape functions. Thanks to this new finite strip model, the shape functions used in the transverse direction can be chosen as 1D bar shape functions, and also, all three components of the displacement field are considered in each nodal line. Moreover, based on this approach, three-dimensional displacement field is approximated in a compact form as a generic N -order expansion. Therefore, explicit expressions of fundamental nuclei of finite strip matrices are obtained in a compact form and presented here. The results obtained by the present formulation for VSCL plates are compared with those obtained from published data. The results show that this kind of strip is efficient and useful. Further, several numerical examples are presented, and the effect of the order of expansion, the number of strips, curvilinear fiber angle, and various boundary conditions are examined.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of stationary acoustic fields involving thin porous layers is addressed in the present article. Layer thickness is assumed to be relatively thin in comparison to the overall computational domain, but its non-negligible acoustic impact must be taken into consideration in the numerical model. Within the classical finite element method (FEM), meshes are compatible at material interfaces and the element distortions needs to be avoided. These requirements usually lead to an excessively costly spatial discretization for these problems of interest, as it forces mesh refinement surrounding the thin layer. This article provides a computational approach to relax this restriction. A generalized interface model derived from the plane wave transfer matrix Method (TMM) is established for modeling thin layers. We develop variationally consistent formulations to impose the interface conditions from models of thin layers for diverse coupling configurations, in which both acoustic fluid and poro-elastic media are taken into account. The computational domain is discretized using the extended finite element method (X-FEM) in order to introduce strong discontinuities in elements independently of the mesh. Implementation of the proposed formulations within X-FEM is verified to be capable of providing accurate and robust solutions. The efficiency and flexibility of the present approach for multi-layer and complex geometry problems are demonstrated compared to classical interface-fitted finite element models through different simulation scenarios.},

The model is given by a regularized nonlinear pairwise potential in a peridynamic formulation. The potential function is given by an explicit formula with an explicit first and second derivatives. This fact allows us to write the entries of the tangent stiffness matrix explicitly thereby saving computational costs during the assembly of the tangent stiffness matrix. We validate our approach against classical continuum mechanics for the linear elastic material behavior. In addition, we compare our approach to a state-based peridynamic model that uses standard numerical derivations to assemble the tangent stiffness matrix. The numerical experiments show that for elastic material behavior our approach agrees with both classical continuum mechanics and the state-based model. The fracture model is applied to produce a fracture simulation for a ASTM E8 like tension test. We conclude with an example of crack growth in a pre-cracked square plate. For the pre-cracked plate, we investigated load in force (soft loading) and load in displacement (hard loading). Our approach is novel in that only bond softening is used as opposed to bond breaking. For the fracture simulation we have shown that our approach works with and without initial damage for two common test problems.},

We propose a systematic topology optimization method to find the material distribution in PnCs for realizing a frequency-specified self-collimation within a wider incident wave angle range. To achieve the self-collimation effect, the weighted slope index of equi-frequency contours (EFCs) that effectively measures whether the wave propagation has a self-collimation effect is introduced as the objective function of the optimization model. The material-field series expansion (MFSE) technique is used to describe the complicated topologies of the unit cell with a low number of design variables. Then, the Kriging-based optimization algorithm with a self-adaptive strategy is adopted for solving the optimization problem. Numerical examples show that the optimized unit cell designs have flat EFCs within larger incident wave angle ranges and also demonstrate that the expected nondiffraction propagation characteristics can be achieved through optimization.},

The current work provides a novel framework, to efficiently and accurately solve the problem of spatially curved, twisted beam-like structures. The novelty of the method is two-fold. First, it uses the finite element framework to capture the geometry of curved, extruded slender members with any desired accuracy adaptively.

After solving the balance of linear momentum on the microscale, the effective stress is traditionally computed through volume averaging the microscopic stress field. In the work at hand, we exploit the idea that averaging the elastic energy may lead to much more accurate effective elastic properties than through stress averaging. We show that the accuracy is roughly doubled when using energy equivalence instead of strain equivalence for compatible iterates of iterative schemes. Thus, to achieve a prescribed accuracy, the necessary effort is roughly reduced by a factor of two. In addition to the theory, we provide a handbook for utilizing these ideas for modern solvers prominent in FFT-based micromechanics. We demonstrate the superiority of energy averaging through computational examples, discuss the peculiarities of polarization methods with their non-compatible iterates and expose a superaccuracy phenomenon occurring for the linear conjugate gradient method.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of fracture in thin-walled structures is decisive for a wide range of applications. Modeling methods such as the phase-field method usually consider cracks to be constant over the thickness which, especially in load cases involving bending, is an imperfect approximation. In this contribution, fracture phenomena along the thickness direction of structural elements (plates or shells) are addressed with a phase-field modeling approach. For this purpose, a new, so called “mixed-dimensional” model is introduced, which combines structural elements representing the displacement field in the two-dimensional shell midsurface with continuum elements describing a crack phase-field in the three-dimensional solid space. The proposed model uses two separate finite element discretizations, where the transfer of variables between the coupled two- and three-dimensional fields is performed at the integration points which in turn need to have corresponding geometric locations. The governing equations of the proposed mixed-dimensional model are deduced in a consistent manner from a total energy functional with them also being compared to existing standard models. The resulting model has the advantage of a reduced computational effort due to the structural elements while still being able to accurately model arbitrary through-thickness crack evolutions as well as partly along the thickness broken shells due to the continuum elements. Amongst others, the higher accuracy as well as the numerical efficiency of the proposed model are tested and validated by comparing simulation results of the new model to those obtained by standard models using numerous representative examples.},

Third, approximate explicit quadratic programming model is obtained by the sensitivity analysis and Taylor expansion. In the process of solving, the duality theory is used to establish the approximate dual model with less design variables. Finally, a series of topology optimization design problems for bi-disc systems are presented and discussed to illustrate the robustness and feasibility of the method. This study finds some new torsional bi-disc designs and can also provide some theoretical references for the lightweight topology optimization of a multicomponent system.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates two aspects of the generalized Broyden quasi-Newton method that have a major impact on its convergence: the initial approximation of the Jacobian and the presence of nonlinearities in the secant conditions. After reformulating the common representation of generalized Broyden, a straightforward interpretation is given. This leads to a natural extension of the method in which an application-dependent physics-based surrogate model is used as initial approximation of the (inverse) Jacobian. A carefully chosen surrogate has the potential to greatly reduce the required number of iterations. The behavior of generalized Broyden depends strongly on the parameter that determines how many secant conditions are satisfied by the Jacobian approximation. Respecting all secant conditions reduces it to Anderson acceleration; a single one to Broyden&#39;s original method. An analysis demonstrates that these two variants behave very differently when nonlinearities are present in the secant conditions: they are ignored by Broyden, but can destabilize Anderson. On the other hand, the analysis shows that Broyden tends to neglect small linear information, possibly reducing convergence speed. To mitigate stability problems with Anderson acceleration, a practical method to detect and remove nonlinear secant information is introduced next. Finally, we solve a steady free-surface-flow problem using several generalized Broyden variants, testing the influence of the surrogate, the nonlinearities and the combination thereof. The results agree with the theoretical predictions, showing large differences in convergence behavior. Furthermore, the proposed method effectively negates the problems related to nonlinearities in this case.},

  abstract     = {Buckling failure mainly occurs in slender rod structure under pressure, which incurs great concern and should be addressed in topology optimization (TO). However, due to the internal defects of material and the external environment interference of engineering system, the practical engineering structure inevitably produces many uncertain factors in the manufacturing and service stages. Therefore, a reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) model under buckling and compliance constraints is established to operate the structural lightweight design considering reliability and stability requirements. To reduce the number of probabilistic constraints, the Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser aggregation function is adopted for combining the multiple constraints into a single smooth and differentiable constraint. Then, a single-loop approach combining modified chaos control strategy is applied to guarantee the robustness, effectiveness, and computational efficiency of RBTO. In addition, the sensitivities of the probabilistic constraint with respect to design and random variables are deduced, and the accuracy of sensitivities is verified by finite difference method. Finally, the validity of the RBTO method is verified by comparing with deterministic TO, in which three numerical examples are employed to demonstrate the robustness and computational accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, new methods are proposed to replace the constitutive law and the entire tangent stiffness matrix in finite element analysis by artificial neural networks (ANNs). By combining the FEM with ANN, so-called intelligent elements are developed. First, as an extension to recent trends in model-based material law replacement, we introduce an additional loss term corresponding to the material stiffness. This training procedure is referred to as Sobolev training and ensures that the ANN learns both the function approximating the stress behavior and its first derivative (material stiffness). In a following step, we introduce three methods to replace the entire local stiffness matrix of an element by approximating its generalized force-displacement relations. These methods also adopt ANNs with Sobolev training procedure to predict the mentioned quantities. Since neural networks (NN) are universal function approximators, they are used to extract the stiffness information for elements undergoing plastic deformation. The focus of this work is to establish a neural network-based FEM framework (independent of NN topology) to introduce an enhanced-material law and in a consequent step also approximate stiffness information of truss, beam, and plate elements taking physical non-linear behavior into account.},

The inactive element, which is a finite element having zero stiffness, is used in several fields such as multi-pass welding analysis, additive manufacturing analysis, damage analysis, and topology optimization. For this sort of analysis, we adopted the one-time decomposition approach, in which the DD process is performed once at the beginning of the analysis. Based on this approach, we formulated the matrix–vector multiplication, the preconditioning and the vector operations in the algorithm of the conjugate gradient method, along with the inactive elements and floating degrees of freedom caused by the inactive elements. Consideration of the inactive elements is enabled by the slight modifications of matrices and vectors in the algorithm. Numerical examples confirmed the scalability of the BDD and BDD-DIAG preconditioners with the present implementation method.

To improve the accuracy of the elasticity tangent predictions originating from the learned stored free energy, a transfer learning technique is used to introduce additional tangential constraints from the data while necessary conditions (e.g., strong ellipticity, crystallographic symmetry) for the correctness of the model are either introduced as additional physical constraints or incorporated in the validation tests. Assessment of the neural networks is based on (1) the accuracy with which they reproduce the bottom-line constitutive responses predicted by MD, (2) the robustness of the models measured by detailed examination of their stability and uniqueness, and (3) the admissibility of the predicted responses with respect to mechanics principles in the finite-deformation regime. We compare the training efficiency of the neural networks under different Sobolev constraints and assess the accuracy and robustness of the models against MD benchmarks for -HMX.},

  abstract     = {A micromorphic filter is presented for the extraction of stress and deformation measures from underlying direct numerical simulation (DNS) of microstructural mechanical response. The filter is consistent with the micromorphic continuum theory of Eringen and Suhubi (1964), and allows the interrogation of a DNS to generate higher order constitutive models. The filter adopts aspects of the overlap coupling techniques for atomistic-continuum scale-bridging in order to update the nodal degrees of freedom of the finite-element-based filter. Two methods for the extraction of quantities of interest from the underlying DNS are presented. The first is a least squares fitting technique which is appropriate for finite-element-style macro-scale domains, and the second is a variationally based approach which generalizes the method to any macro-scale domain which has a variational form. No restrictions on the form of the micro-scale simulation are inherent to the approach, provided that the required quantities (stress, position, etc.) can be provided. The filter is applied to a simple homogeneous medium undergoing homogeneous deformation to demonstrate the recovery of a classical continuum response, what we call the null case. We then apply the framework to the same homogeneous medium with a central and edge penny-shaped crack to show micromorphic effects. We demonstrate that varying the size of the filter causes the micromorphic behaviors to arise and then dissipate as the filter becomes smaller than the crack&#39;s length scale. We also show the effect of filter size on a chiral element network along with a plate perforated with evenly spaced and perturbed holes through the thickness. The micromorphic effects are shown to be present for the chiral elements under any loading but become most pronounced when a single element is located within each averaging domain. Micromorphic effects become pronounced for the plate upon the onset of localization.},

The developed “touch-aware” contact model initiates the contact force calculation when contacting bodies are in touch, which leaves no gap between contacting bodies and provides a stiffer contact in an accurate and efficient way. It simulates frictional contact behaviors and damping between contacting bodies with irregular shapes. Different examples are given to verify the touch-aware contact model with theoretical solutions such as Hertz theory of contact, Hertz theory of impact, Coulomb&#39;s law and damping formulation. The model is also compared with conventional peridynamics contact model and the discrete element method. Finally, the touch-aware contact model is used to simulate condensation of an aggregate of irregularly shaped particles.

It can also be used for incompressible laminar/turbulent flows. The method is designed for nonorthogonal meshes, and oscillations caused by the advective terms are treated by a deferred correction technique. The chosen finite volume scheme is cell centered. The studied fluid is a single-phase multicomponent gas with Newtonian behavior. The focus is mainly on gas mixtures with predominance of N 2 $$ {}_2 $$ , since the chemical reaction of greatest interest is the combustion process in the air. The buoyancy is caused by the gradient of the specified mass, which is a function of the temperature and the composition of the gas mixture. The mathematical model uses an approximation for low Mach numbers, describing slightly compressible flows. The coupling between the fluid dynamic equations is given by the nonlinear Picard&#39;s method, with the pressure-velocity coupling treatment given by the SIMPLE algorithm (semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations). The complete mathematical model includes the sensitive enthalpy equation for the conservation of energy. The LES (large eddy simulation) model is used for modeling the turbulence. The chemical reactions are implemented using the EDC (eddy dissipation concept) and the EDM (eddy dissipation model) approaches. The parallel strategy is based on a subdomain-by-subdomain approach, and uses the MPI and OpenMP standards in a hybrid parallel scheme. Compressed data structures are used to store the matrix coefficients.},

The angular ROM is built over a partitioning of the space-angle phase-space, by generating independent, optimized angular basis function sets for each partition. The advantage is that each basis function set is optimized to represent the neutron flux distribution in a particular partition of space and angle, rather than being optimized for the entire domain. This serves to reduce the total number of basis functions required, and therefore the solve time. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the methods—a dog-leg duct problem, involving particle streaming, and the Watanabe–Maynard problem, which includes significant particle scattering. In both cases, it is shown that the method reduces the angular flux error, for a given basis size or solve time, by around an order of magnitude in comparison to other, similar ROM methods. An adaptive version of the method is also presented, whereby the number of basis functions within each space-angle partition can vary independently. It is shown to potentially provide further significant reductions in error.},

To achieve this, conventional methods usually consider multiloading problems or use spring elements. In this work, a method that only considers one load case and does not use spring elements was developed by introducing an objective function that combines evaluation functions that provide necessary features for the actuators. This way, a structure with the same deformation mode of real phenomena could be derived with a low computational cost and without spring elements. In addition, the stress constraints on the thermal stress, which have not been widely discussed so far, were applied to show the structure with the considered strength characteristics. The study subject is topology optimization of an isotropic thermo-elastic model considering a thermo-mechanical problem. Finally, numerical examples for multiple conditions were performed to show that the proposed method can derive the desired optimal structure.},

  abstract     = {Rock masses are 3D in nature. The contained complex fracture networks pose great difficulty to its computer-aided design (CAD) modeling and bring meshing burdens to classic finite element analysis (FEA). Considering the efficiency of digital images capturing complex geometries, as an extension of the previous 2D work, the 3D implementation of the image-based simulation is carried out in this work. Continuous-discontinuous deformations of complex rock masses are simulated in 3D with a simple structured mesh based on the numerical manifold method (NMM). Characteristics of the developed voxel crack model and its differences with discrete and smeared crack models are summarized. Based on this voxel crack model, the generating algorithm of 3D physical patches to construct the continuous-discontinuous trial function is introduced in detail. In the developed method, the three spatial resolutions, respectively of the image model, integration voxels, and mathematical elements, are independent. These resolutions can be chosen freely by trading off the accuracy need and the computational expenses. Numerical examples investigate the accuracy and convergence of this method. Its 3D simulation capability of complex rock masses is demonstrated by calculating the continuous-discontinuous deformation of El Capitan rock located in the Yosemite National Park with assumed complex fracture networks.},

This is to secure mathematically that the result will be a rigorous upper bound of the exact limit load multiplier. So far, only the linear and the quadratic displacement elements with straight sides, which result in constant and linear strains, respectively, satisfy this requirement. In this article, it is proven both theoretically and practically that there is a general class of strain-displacement triangular elements with straight sides which provide rigorous upper bounds. The interpolation scheme is based on the Bernstein polynomials, and there is no upper restriction of the polynomial order. Both continuous and discontinuous displacements can be considered. The efficiency is examined through plane strain and Kirchhoff plate examples. The generalization to 3D (i.e., tetrahedral elements with plane faces) and other structural conditions is straightforward.},

A coupling model of peridynamics (PD) and classical continuum mechanics (CCM) for beam fracture analysis in geometrically nonlinear deformations is developed in this study. Firstly, the formulations of virtually nonlinear strain energy density of each incremental step are obtained by using the updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation and von Karman beam theory, then the nonlinear PD beam parameters are established on the geometrically nonlinear micro-beam bonds via the principle of virtual work and homogenization. Secondly, the coupling model of PD and CCM for geometrically nonlinear beams is proposed, for which the morphing method is applied to create a balance between the stiffness of geometrically nonlinear CCM beam model and the weighted coefficients of geometrically nonlinear PD beam model. Thirdly, a new fracture criterion for PD beam models considering the effect of geometrical nonlinearity is adopted. Finally, the large deformation and fracture analysis of straight beam, spiral slender beam and complex frame subjected to different loading conditions illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed PD-CCM coupling model.},

The second advantage is that the convex decomposition of the conormal vector relies only on the locations of cell centers and reduces geometric restrictions on cell shapes to preserve positivity. The difficulties of constructing discrete normal fluxes across the material interface are overcome by introducing primary unknowns on the opposite side of the interface into the discrete stencil with some virtual adjustments on their positions, based on the continuity of normal flux and tangent gradients. Numerical tests demonstrate that our new scheme is second-order accurate, unconditionally monotone, and comparisons with some existing methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy are also given.},

The main idea is to replace the costly disciplinary solvers of the MDA by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Interpolation models. The main challenge we address is the high-dimensional coupling variables whose ranges are unknown. To overcome this issue, a training strategy is developed by uncoupling the disciplinary solvers from the MDA context. This new surrogate MDA called Disciplinary Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Interpolation is iteratively enriched to solve the analysis with an estimation of the error made by the surrogate models. The disciplinary surrogate model which has the most influence on this error is determined by a sensitivity analysis and thus enriched. This approach allows to uncouple the disciplinary solvers during the training and enrichment phases. The approach is applied to various aeroelastic problems of an aircraft wing and allows to reduce by a factor of 5 the mean number of disciplinary solver calls needed for the resolution of the MDA.},

  abstract     = {Many engineered materials display ordered or disordered microstructures. Such materials exhibit transport properties which are unmatched by their single-phase homogeneous counterparts. These properties are obtained by the mixture of two or more phases typically characterized by a large contrast in their properties. For the development of these materials, it is critical to develop a robust computational framework in order to provide a fundamental understanding of how microstructure affects performance. This hinges on predicting their macroscopic properties, given the constitutive laws and spatial distribution of their constituents. To this end, this work presents a computational framework based on formulating periodic conduction transport problems in terms of boundary integral equations whose kernel is expressed in terms of Weierstrass zeta-function. The components of the effective conductivity tensor are then sought in the form of power series expansions of a conductivity contrast parameter. To accelerate their convergence, these expansions are transformed into Padé approximants. Presently restricted to the case of two-dimensional, two-phase microstructures, this framework is shown to yield accurate results over the entire range of the contrast parameter. Representation of the kernel as a lattice sum allows the use the fast multipole method, thereby making computations significantly more efficient.},

A three-field Hu–Washizu functional, with displacement, displacement gradient and stress tensor considered as independent fields, is utilized to develop the formulation in spatial configuration. Certain constraints are imposed on displacement gradient and stress tensor so that they satisfy the required continuity conditions across the boundary of elements. From theoretical standpoint, simplex elements are best suited for the application of continuity constraints. The techniques that are proposed to implement the constraints facilitate their automatic imposition and, hence, they can be regarded as an important feature of the work. Since the exterior calculus provides the basis for the developments presented herein, the relevant topics are discussed within the context of the work. Various technical aspects of the formulation are described in detail. These aspects help to illuminate the mathematical formulation that might seem vague in the first place and, more importantly, they help to provide an efficient implementation for ensuing developments. The performance of the mixed finite element method is studied through benchmark numerical examples and it is compared with other similar elements. It is shown that the element has excellent convergence properties and it is numerically stable, especially for problems where classical first order elements demonstrate stiff or unstable behavior.},

Using this representation, GH, an out-of-sample extension technique, is employed to create a global map from the input parameter space to a Grassmannian diffusion manifold. GH is further employed to locally map points on the diffusion manifold onto the tangent space of a Grassmann manifold. The exponential map is then used to project the points in the tangent space onto the Grassmann manifold, where reconstruction of the full solution is performed. The performance of the proposed surrogate model is verified with three examples. The first problem is a toy example used to illustrate the technique. In the second example, errors associated with the various mappings are assessed by studying response predictions of the electric potential of a dielectric cylinder in a homogeneous electric field. The last example applies the method for uncertainty prediction in the strain field evolution in a model amorphous material using the shear transformation zone theory of plasticity.},

Since control points are not basically on the level set surface, a discrepancy between zero level of function that represents boundaries of the structure, and zero level of its control netis appeared. In this article, the idea is solving level set equation (LSE) over the parameter space of b-splines basis functions defined in the IGA model. Afterwards, the updated level set function is mapped into the physical space. The level set function is approximated over a grid defined in parameter space which is constantly a unit square. By doing so, control net of the IGA model and the grid for solving LSE are separated. Two well-known radial basis functions (RBF) and reaction–diffusion (RD) based methods are employed to solve the LSE. The proposed method is applied to minimize the mean compliance when certain amount of material is used and also for weight minimization subject to local stress constraints.

Our method relies on a nonlocal interface where the material subdomains overlap. Within this region, a kinematic coupling of the two constituents is enforced. The contact is purely geometrical as interaction forces act only between points of the same material. We provide a detailed description of the computational implementation within the framework of CPD, that is in principle applicable to all formulations of PD. A variety of numerical examples for modeling bimaterial interfaces illustrate the utility of the technique for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, including examples at large deformations. Our model approaches a local model when the nonlocality parameter, the horizon size, is decreased.

Due to the manufacturing processes of different types of struts and the growth processes of natural fibers, their mechanical response frequently fluctuates from strut to strut, as well as locally within each strut. In associated mechanical models each strut is often represented by a string of beam elements, since the use of conventional three-dimensional finite elements renders the simulations computationally inefficient. The parameter input fields of each string of beam elements are ideally such that the local fluctuations and fluctuations between individual strings of beam elements are accurately captured. The goal of this study is to capture these fluctuations in several intercorrelated bounded random fields. Two formulations to describe the intercorrelations between each random field, as well as the case without any intercorrelation, are investigated. As only a few sets of input fields are available (due to time constraints of the supposed experimental techniques), the identification of the random fields&#39; parameters involves substantial uncertainties. A probabilistic identification approach based on Bayes&#39; theorem is employed to treat the involved uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a parallel overlapping domain decomposition preconditioner is proposed to solve the linear system of equations arising from the extended finite element discretization of elastic crack problems. The algorithm partitions the computational mesh into two types of subdomains: the regular subdomains and the crack tip subdomains based on the observation that the crack tips have a significant impact on the convergence of the iterative method while the impact of the crack lines is not that different from those of regular mesh points. The tip subdomains consist of mesh points at crack tips and all neighboring points where the branch enrichment functions are applied. The regular subdomains consist of all other mesh points, including those on the crack lines. To overcome the mismatch between the number of subdomains and the number of processor cores, the proposed method is divided into two steps: solve the crack tip problem and then the regular subdomain problem during each iteration. The proposed method was used to develop a parallel XFEM package which is able to test different types of iterative methods. To achieve good parallel efficiency, additional methods were introduced to reduce communication and to maintain the load balance between processors. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of iterations and the total computation time compared to the classical methods. In addition, the method scales up to 8192 processor cores with over 70% parallel efficiency to solve problems with more than degrees of freedom.},

  abstract     = {A finite strain shear modified Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman (GTN) model based on multiplicative elastoplasticity, together with its implementation details, is presented. This GTN model which can simulate the loss of load-carrying capacity of porous metals through nucleation, growth, shearing, and coalescence of voids is incorporated in an optimization framework for designing structures with optimal plastic energy dissipation capacity while satisfying prescribed constraints on material usage and damage. An adjoint method-based analytical path-dependent sensitivity analysis is presented that can be used with gradient-based optimization algorithms. Using the proposed topology optimization formulations, the optimized designs exhibit well-constrained fracture at the design displacements. Ultimate performance analyses of the optimized designs demonstrate that the fracture-resistant designs can have higher ductility, ultimate strength as well as improved energy dissipation, as compared to the designs guided by von Mises plasticity where no fracture mechanisms are modeled. Moreover, due to finite deformations, a fracture can initiate at multiple locations and critical fracture locations can change during the loading process. In addition, different failure modes are revealed from different optimized designs under large deformations.},

  abstract     = {Moving contact components are common in mechanical systems, and they exhibit a large rigid motion with linear-elastic deflection under contact boundary conditions. The finite element method can capture local deformation and high gradient stresses, but finely meshed contact interfaces lead to numerous degrees of freedom. Model order reduction techniques for multibodies are effective, but moving contact interfaces also introduce multiple interface degrees of freedom. In the present method, the interface degrees of freedom are retained to ensure the accuracy of the local response induced by contacts, but the computational scale is not further enlarged. The motion of moving contact components is described by the floating frame of reference formulation. A free-interface component mode synthesis method is proposed for model order reduction. Kept free-interface normal modes represent global flexibility and residual modes accurately compensate for the local quasi-static responses of omitted modes induced by contacts. The contribution of residual modes is represented by interface load coordinates, which can be directly evaluated by contact forces. The contacts are calculated with the present contact algorithm. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are fully demonstrated through correlation with the finite element method in gear meshing simulations.},

  abstract     = {The direct incremental energy minimization in rate-independent plasticity does not account for the skew-symmetric part of the tangent stiffness matrix. In crystal plasticity, this corresponds to neglecting the asymmetry of the matrix of interaction moduli for active slip-systems. This limitation has been overcome in the recently proposed quasi-extremal energy principle (QEP) applicable to nonpotential problems. In the present article it is shown how to extend QEP to finite increments in the backward-Euler computational scheme. A related constitutive algorithm is proposed which enables automatic selection of active slip systems using an energetic criterion, along any path of large deformation of a rate-independent single crystal with a nonsymmetric slip-system interaction matrix. Numerical examples have been calculated for a fcc single crystal subjected to simple shear or uniaxial tension. The slip system activity predicted by using the QEP algorithm has been found to be more reliable in describing the actual plastic response of metal crystals than conventional rate-dependent modeling in cases where the selection of active slip-systems is essential.},

  abstract     = {For the reliability analysis of complex engineering structures, the estimation of the bounds of failure probability with interval distribution parameters is an important task when the perfect information of random variables is unavailable and the corresponding probability distributions are imprecise. The present work proposes an active learning Kriging-based method combining with adaptive radial based importance sampling to compute the bounds of failure probability. For computing the bounds, the classical double-loop optimization model is always investigated in the standard normal space. To decouple the computation, the inner-loop optimization is addressed with the monotonicity of the commonly used probability distributions. When suffering the high dimensional problem, the dimension reduction method is introduced in monotonic analysis. While for the outer-loop optimization, the normal space is decomposed with spheres, then the proposed method with an adaptive updated procedure is given. With this method, the bounds of failure probability can be estimated efficiently, especial for the rare event. Numerical examples are investigated to validate the rationality and superiority of the proposed method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the reliability analysis of turbine blade and aeronautical hydraulic pipeline system with interval distribution parameters.},

It enables the simulation of crystal-plasticity-like phenomena at finite strains. The unified framework of thermodynamically consistent constitutive equations is formulated such that it couples the crystallographic slip and martensitic transformation theories. The constitutive description for the slip plasticity evolution incorporates an anisotropic hyperelastic law with self and latent-hardening. The mechanically induced martensite formation kinematics is based on the crystallographic theory of martensitic transformations. The complete set of highly coupled equations is expressed in a single system of equations and solved by a monolithic solution procedure. It is based on the Newton–Raphson methodology and incorporates the complete linearisation leading to asymptotic quadratic rates of convergence. The quasi-static discretized evolution equations are integrated with a fully implicit scheme, except for the critical resolved slip stresses, which employ the generalized midpoint rule. The plastic flow is integrated with an implicit exponential integrator to exactly preserve the plastic incompressibility. Viscous regularizations for both deformation mechanisms are pursued to overcome numerical difficulties and model the behavior over a wide range of strain-rate sensitivities. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and predictive capability of the methodology.},

  abstract     = {Numerical stabilization is often used to eliminate (alleviate) the spurious oscillations generally produced by full order models (FOMs) in under-resolved or marginally-resolved simulations of convection-dominated flows. In this article, we investigate the role of numerical stabilization in reduced order models (ROMs) of marginally-resolved, convection-dominated incompressible flows. Specifically, we investigate the FOM–ROM consistency, that is, whether the numerical stabilization is beneficial both at the FOM and the ROM level. As a numerical stabilization strategy, we focus on the evolve-filter-relax (EFR) regularization algorithm, which centers around spatial filtering. To investigate the FOM-ROM consistency, we consider two ROM strategies: (i) the EFR-noEFR, in which the EFR stabilization is used at the FOM level, but not at the ROM level; and (ii) the EFR-EFR, in which the EFR stabilization is used both at the FOM and at the ROM level. We compare the EFR-noEFR with the EFR-EFR in the numerical simulation of a 2D incompressible flow past a circular cylinder in the convection-dominated, marginally-resolved regime. We also perform model reduction with respect to both time and Reynolds number. Our numerical investigation shows that the EFR-EFR is more accurate than the EFR-noEFR, which suggests that FOM-ROM consistency is beneficial in convection-dominated, marginally-resolved flows.},

These capabilities allow for the simulation of large sheets of heterogeneous and fibrous materials either with or without matrix, such as textiles, composites, and pantographic structures. The work is a computational extension of our earlier theoretical work that extends existing Kirchhoff-Love shell theory to incorporate the in-plane bending resistance of initially straight or curved fibers. The formulation requires only displacement degrees-of-freedom to capture all mentioned modes of deformation. To this end, isogeometric shape functions are used in order to satisfy the required -continuity for bending across element boundaries. The proposed formulation can admit a wide range of material models, such as surface hyperelasticity that does not require any explicit thickness integration. To deal with possible material instability due to fiber compression, a stabilization scheme is added. Several benchmark examples are used to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed computational formulation.},

Grain tracking and remapping schemes can eliminate artificial coalescence and increase the number of grains and crystallographic orientations that may be considered in a simulation, but previous tracking and remapping schemes may not efficiently capture the complex grain morphologies that form during additive manufacturing. A new recursive scheme is derived from a binary tree of axis-aligned bounding boxes that can efficiently represent columnar and irregularly shaped grains. We demonstrate the power of this approach by simulating microstructures with hundreds to thousands of grains and quantify the reduction in the number of order parameters required to represent the microstructure. The new scheme leads to orders of magnitude fewer computational resources as compared to the naïve paradigm of one grain per order parameter, and also offers a substantial improvement over algorithms derived from bounding spheres.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing techniques have grown significantly in recent years due to their ability to produce designs almost impossible to obtain with standard production technologies. This growth has in turn led to increased demand for numerical simulation of additive processes. Unfortunately, such simulations are difficult from the computational point of view, since additive problems are characterized by the presence of highly local nonlinearities requiring fine mesh resolutions on small portions of the domain. These difficulties are compounded by the fact that such regions of local high nonlinearities move in the domain with time, and further, by the fact that the physical domain itself evolves with time. Accordingly, the present article addresses these complex computational issues by employing a two-level technique. The two-level method provides a natural framework for the resolution of localized nonlinearities while avoiding the need for complex meshing operations, such as refinement-and-derefinement algorithms. The proposed approach is validated on a series of one- and two-dimensional problems to establish the viability of the introduced two-level method for additive manufacturing problems.},

  abstract     = {The growing number of scientific publications on topology optimization (TO) shows the great interest that this technique has generated in recent years. Among the different methodologies for TO, this article focuses on the well-known solid isotropic material penalization (SIMP) method, broadly used because of its simple formulation and efficiency. Even so, the SIMP method has certain drawbacks, namely: lack of precision in definition of the edges of the optimized geometry and final results strongly influenced by the discretization used for the finite element (FE) analyses. In this article, we propose a combination of techniques to limit the effect of these drawbacks and, thus, to improve the behavior of TO. All these techniques are based on the use of the Cartesian grid finite element method (cgFEM), an immersed boundary method whose Cartesian grid structure and hierarchical data structure makes it specially appropriate for TO. All the proposed techniques are framed under the concept of mesh refinement. First, we propose the use of two meshes, the FE analysis mesh, and a finer mesh for integration and evaluation of sensitivities, to improve the resolution of the final solution at a marginal computational cost. Then we propose two h -adaptive mesh refinement strategies. The first one will tend to refine the elements having intermediate density values and will have the effect of sharpening the definition of the edges of the optimized geometry. We will clearly show that if the accuracy of the FE analyses is not taken into account, stress constrained TO will generate solutions that, once manufactured, will not satisfy the constraints. Hence, we also propose an h -refinement strategy based on the estimation of the discretization error in energy norm.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an approach for characterizing and estimating statistical dependence between a large number of observables in a composite material system. Conditional regression is carried out using the estimated joint density function, permitting a systematic exploration of interdependence between fine scale and coarse observables that can be used for both prognosis and design of complex material systems. An example demonstrates the integration of experimental data with a computational database. The statistical approach is based on the probabilistic learning on manifolds recently developed by the authors. This approach leverages intrinsic structure detected through diffusion on graphs with projected stochastic differential equations to generate samples constrained to that structure.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes an approach that combines a library of component-based reduced-order models with Bayesian state estimation in order to create data-driven physics-based digital twins. Reduced-order modeling produces physics-based computational models that are reliable enough for predictive digital twins, while still being fast to evaluate. In contrast with traditional monolithic techniques for model reduction, the component-based approach scales efficiently to large complex systems, and provides a flexible and expressive framework for rapid model adaptation—both critical features in the digital twin context. Data-driven model adaptation and uncertainty quantification are formulated as a Bayesian state estimation problem, in which sensor data are used to infer which models in the model library are the best candidates for the digital twin. This approach is demonstrated through the development of a digital twin for a 12-ft wingspan unmanned aerial vehicle. Offline, we construct a library of pristine and damaged aircraft components. Online, we use structural sensor data to rapidly adapt a physics-based digital twin of the aircraft structure. The data-driven digital twin enables the aircraft to dynamically replan a safe mission in response to structural damage or degradation.},

The lattice material is made of a periodic cell, macroscopically modulated and oriented. The external boundary may be coated by a layer of pure material with a fixed prescribed thickness. The infill is optimized by the homogenization method while the macroscopic shape is geometrically optimized by the Hadamard method of shape sensitivity. A first original feature of the proposed approach is that the infill material follows the displacement on the exterior boundary during the geometric optimization step. A second key feature is the dehomogenization or projection step which build a smoothly varying lattice infill from the optimal homogenized properties. Several numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in 2-d, which is especially convenient when considering design-dependent loads.},

The governing equations are integrated in time using a wavelet decomposition which expands the time-dependent problem into several spectral problems. Displacements are discretized in each finite element and tractions are approximated on each essential element boundary (displacement model). The displacement approximation functions satisfy the governing equations of the media (Trefftz constraint) and are not linked to the nodes. Trefftz bases are derived solving the governing equations and are composed of four types of modes: two compression waves and two shear waves. The weak enforcement of the Navier equation and boundary conditions yields a solving system where the unknown are the weights of the approximation bases. Numerical tests have been carried out to assess the convergence of the models. The results of the simulations are satisfactory: the numerical tests converge to known analytical solutions and the simulation of a propagation of a vertical shock wave is consistent to the one obtained with a 2D plane simulation under the same conditions. The results of a bender element test simulation in three dimensions are also presented.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a scalable three-dimensional (3D) multiscale framework for continuum-discrete modeling of granular materials. The proposed framework features rigorous coupling of a continuum-based material point method (MPM) and a discrete approach discrete element method (DEM) to enable cross-scale modeling of boundary value problems pertaining to granular media. It employs MPM to solve the governing equations of a macroscopic continuum domain for a boundary value problem that may undergo large deformation. The required loading-path-dependent constitutive responses at each material point of the MPM are provided by a DEM solution based on grain-scale contact-based discrete simulations that receive macroscopic information at the specific material point as boundary conditions. This hierarchical coupling enables direct dialogs between the macro and micro scales of granular media while fully harnessing the predictive advantages of both MPM and DEM at the two scales. An effective, scalable parallel scheme is further developed, based on the flat message passing interface (MPI) model, to address the computational cost of the proposed framework for 3D large-scale simulations. We demonstrate that the proposed parallel scheme may offer up to 32X and 40X speedup in strong and weak scaling tests, respectively, significantly empowering the numerical performance and predictive capability of the proposed framework. The 3D parallelized multiscale framework is validated by an element test and a column collapse problem, before being applied to simulate the intrusion of a solid object. The multiscale simulation successfully captures the characteristic response of intrusion as postulated by the modified Archimedes&#39; law theory. The progressive development of the stagnant zone during the intrusion is further examined from a cross-scale perspective.},

The same governing equation for the solid phase applies on and off cracks. Crack formation in this framework is autonomous, requiring no prior estimates of crack topology. As a new contribution, an energy-based criterion for arbitrary crack formation is formulated using the peridynamic effective force state for unsaturated porous media. Unsaturated fluid flow in the fracture space is modeled in a simplified way in line with the nonlocal formulation of unsaturated fluid flow in the bulk. The formulated unsaturated fracturing periporomechanics is numerically implemented through an implicit fractional step algorithm in time and a two-phase mixed meshless method in space. The two-stage operator split converts the coupled periporomechanics problem into an undrained deformation and fracture problem and an unsaturated fluid flow in the deformed skeleton configuration. Numerical simulations of in-plane open and shear cracking are conducted to validate the accuracy and robustness of the fracturing unsaturated periporomechanics model. Then numerical examples of wing cracking and nonplanar cracking in unsaturated soil specimens are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multiphase periporomechanics paradigm for unguided cracking in unsaturated porous media.},

By extracting the morphological features of abrasive belt, the residual stress based on different geometrical characteristics of grains (pyramidal, hexahedral, spherical, and conical belts) were investigated, and the optimal grain geometry was determined to be a uniformly arranged positive quadrilateral cone. Accordingly, a grinding experiment with a pyramidal belt was conducted to obtain an experienced model of the grain wear height. A numerical simulation model of the grain wear evolution under four wear states (no abrasion, early abrasion, middle abrasion, and late abrasion) was developed. Additionally, more detailed progressive wear of the abrasive grains was also applied to grind the entire profile of the complex curved blade. The residual stress on the blade surface was mainly compressive, and the surface stress values were distributed between −385 and −117 MPa with the service life of the pyramidal abrasive belt.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft composite parts are commonly manufactured from resin-saturated thermoset pre-impregnated plies laid-up over a rigid tool and consolidated and cured in an autoclave. In many applications, autoclave consolidation alone is not sufficient to remove the air, or bulk, that has been entrapped within the laminate during layup. Entrapped bulk can lead to the formation of defects, including wrinkles and voids, which can significantly affect structural performance. Vacuum consolidation, or “debulking,” has been a standard practice extensively used by aircraft manufacturers to reduce the amount of bulk and mitigate defect formation. Yet, the underlying physical principles governing formation of defects during these early stages are not well understood. This work presents the development of a new finite element-based method for simulation of debulking with the objective to contribute to a better understanding of the key physics involved. The model includes pore-pressure cohesive elements inserted at ply interfaces for discrete representation of entrapped air pockets and modeling air flow during debulking; and cohesive contact between the plies for simulating the typical tacky behavior of uncured thermoset tape prepregs. The debulking of a two-ply laminate with an initial seeded wrinkle is considered for illustration of the approach and comparison with experimental results.},

Once built, the surrogates of the components are combined to form an integrated-surrogate that can be used to predict system-level quantities of interest at a fraction of the cost of the original model. The error in the integrated-surrogate is greedily minimized using an experimental design procedure that allocates the amount of training data, used to construct each component-surrogate, based on the contribution of those surrogates to the error of the integrated-surrogate. The multi-fidelity procedure presented is a generalization of multi-index stochastic collocation that can leverage ensembles of models of varying cost and accuracy, for one or more components, to reduce the computational cost of constructing the integrated-surrogate. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that, for a fixed computational budget, our algorithm is able to produce surrogates that are orders of magnitude more accurate than methods that treat the integrated system as a black-box.},

The approach features a robust and accurate method for training a regression-based model capable of capturing highly nonlinear strain–stress mappings, while preserving some fundamental principles of solid mechanics. In this sense, it is a structure-preserving approach for constructing a data-driven model featuring both the form-agnostic advantage of purely phenomenological data-driven regressions and the physical soundness of mechanistic models. The proposed methodology enforces desirable mathematical properties on the network architecture to guarantee the satisfaction of physical constraints such as objectivity, consistency (preservation of rigid body modes), dynamic stability, and material stability, which are important for successfully exploiting the resulting model in numerical simulations. Indeed, embedding such notions in a learning approach reduces a model&#39;s sensitivity to noise and promotes its robustness to inputs outside the training domain. The merits of the proposed learning approach are highlighted using several finite element analysis examples. Its potential for ensuring the computational tractability of multi-scale applications is demonstrated with the acceleration of the nonlinear, dynamic, multi-scale, fluid-structure simulation of the supersonic inflation dynamics of a parachute system with a canopy made of a woven fabric.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new additional test concept and numerical property of implicit time integration methods termed as “aliasing” of the external load which must be considered during the algorithm design process. Where most numerical properties of such algorithms discussed in the literature pertain to the homogeneous components, aliasing reflects the tendency of the nonhomogeneous components to introduce errors into the solution in the asymptotic high-frequency limit. An analytical technique is proposed to detect and quantify aliasing, defined in terms of the resulting representative solution. A theorem establishes whether a representative solution with aliasing can be bounded up to a constant by the external force values and thus treated as acceptable if the bound is sufficiently small. For the U0 family of algorithms within the GSSSS-II framework containing several traditional and closely related methods, this is not an issue. However, the numerically dissipative GSSSS-II V0 family of methods is shown to exhibit bounded aliasing with a constant roughly equal to 2, while the “structure-dependent” Chang Family Method is shown to exhibit unbounded aliasing, which is not acceptable for practical dynamic computations. Numerical verifications are performed with single-degree and multi-degree of freedom problems with a series of selected algorithms which exhibit either no aliasing, tightly bounded aliasing, unbounded aliasing, or large bounded aliasing, and practical recommendations are given for acceptable aliasing of the load with special emphasis on MDOF problems such as those arising from finite element discretizations.},

  abstract     = {An important property of implicit time integration algorithms for structural dynamics is their tendency to “overshoot” the exact solution in the first few steps of the computed response due to high-frequency components in the initial excitations. The typical analysis technique for overshooting involves the study of asymptotic response of the algorithm&#39;s first step in the limiting high frequency case. This article finds that the prior analysis of overshooting in much of the engineering literature is incomplete in that it neglects the effect of physical damping. With physical damping included, first-order overshooting components enter into several well-known time integration algorithms which were previously thought to exhibit zero-order overshooting in displacement. The Newmark method, Wilson- method, Bazzi- method, HHT- method, WBZ- method, and three parameter optimal/generalized- method are analyzed, as well as the generalized single-step single-solve (GSSSS) framework which encompasses all of the prior schemes and other new and optimal algorithms and designs based upon the issues under consideration. The additional overshooting component is eliminated in the novel amended GSSSS V0 family (which is noteworthy and cannot be derived by conventional means), while the numerically dissipative schemes in the GSSSS U0 family (encompassing traditional methods such as the HHT- method, WBZ- method, and three parameter optimal/generalized- method among other new algorithm designs) are shown to be irremediable as the additional overshooting component from physical damping enters into the second step of the response, which is a wholly new finding. Numerical verifications of the overshooting analysis are performed for SDOF and MDOF structures with and without physical damping, and practical recommendations are given for the solution of MDOF problems on the basis of algorithm design and selection for various initial conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel density interpolation scheme for topological optimization based on nodal density variables is presented. The method relies on the definition of an independent interpolation mesh for the description of the density field. This mesh is used for the interpolation of the density field at the Gauss points of the design domain mesh. Provided that the interpolation mesh is realized by linear elements, the proposed scheme is range restricted and assures physically meaningful values of the interpolated density. Explicit analytical sensitivity expressions can be derived. The utilization of an independent interpolation mesh allows for the utilization of any element type and geometry on the body for the computation of the displacements. It is also shown that the chosen interpolation scheme has interesting properties of volume and material volume conservation with respect to the mesh utilized on the body and the domain of the interpolation mesh can differ from the domain of the mesh for the displacements computation. This allows for the realization of very regular interpolation meshes even in case of very complex shapes of the domain of the body to be optimized. Examples are provided showing the performance of the proposed interpolation scheme.},

Here, OLTEM is extended to a much more general case of a system of PDEs for the 2-D time-independent elasticity equations on irregular domains. Compact 9-point uniform and nonuniform stencils (with the computational costs of linear finite elements) are used with OLTEM. The stencil coefficients are assumed to be unknown and are calculated by the minimization of the local truncation error. It is shown that the second order of accuracy is the maximum possible accuracy for 9-point stencils independent of the numerical technique used for their derivations. The special treatment of the Neumann boundary conditions has been developed that does not increase the size of the stencils. The numerical examples are in agreement with the theoretical findings. They also show that due to the minimization of the local truncation error, OLTEM is much more accurate than linear finite elements and than quadratic finite elements (up to engineering accuracy of 0.1%–1%) at the same numbers of degrees of freedom. Due to the computational efficiency and trivial unfitted Cartesian meshes that are independent of irregular domains, the proposed technique with no remeshing for the shape change of irregular domains will be effective for many engineering applications.},

These structures often undergo geometrically nonlinear deformation under its own weight. Computing the natural (undeformed) shape of a rod from the observed deformed configuration is a nonlinear inverse problem. Here we introduce a numerical method to solve this problem in case planar (2D) rods, that is, beams, under a clamped-free boundary condition. A simulation model is developed based on the discrete elastic rods (DER) algorithm to address the forward deformation process from natural to deformed shapes under gravity. Based on the internal mechanical link among the nodes on the discretized elastic rod, a bottom-up optimization method is proposed in this article for an efficient inverse solution. Associated with it, a global searching algorithm is developed to search for the optimal bending curvature along the arc length of the rod. The method is numerically validated for accuracy and sheds light on the inverse design of rod-like structures for various applications, for example, soft robots and tails of animated characters.},

  abstract     = {So far, the research on topology optimization against noise has mainly addressed frequency-domain problems, while time-domain analysis is also widely used in practical engineering. Nonetheless, the topology optimization work on the latter was rarely reported due to its complexity. This article presents a new topology optimization scheme of bi-material curved shell structure to reduce the time-domain noise generated by transient vibration. A finite element formulation for an eight-node curved shell element is presented. The Newmark integral method is employed to calculate transient responses, and the obtained results are input into the time-domain boundary element method to predict transient sound pressure. In the optimization model, the volumetric densities of material in a bi-material interpolation model constructed by the solid isotropic material with penalization model are chosen as the design variables; the time integral of the squared sound pressure on structural surfaces or prescribed reference points in acoustic medium over a specified time interval of interest is taken as the objective function; and the constraint on material volume is considered. A volume-preserving Heaviside penalization is introduced to suppress gray elements. Furthermore, the calculation of time-domain sound radiation sensitivity is transformed into the following two processes: (a) the derivation of transient response based on the Newmark integral method; (b) the derivation of transient sound pressure based on the discrete time-domain boundary integral equation. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity of the approach proposed in this article. The influences of volume-preserving Heaviside penalization, volume constraint, loading position and form, and selection of objective function on the optimal design are discussed.},

This concept is fully embodied into the present approach to quasi-brittle fracture, whereby progressive damage occurs in layers of finite thickness where the gradient of damage is bounded and a fully damaged region is understood as a fracture with no ambiguity. Key to the effective implementation of the model are the choice of two constitutive functions and the implicit tracking of regions in a state of progressive damage via Lagrange multipliers acting on internal constraints. The ideas are developed for a general Cauchy continuum and representative numerical simulations are included that demonstrate the model capabilities.},

The governing equations for the solid skeleton deformation, pore water flow, and pore air flow are derived based on the mixture theory. The coupled nonlinear global system is then solved by the standard Galerkin finite element method. The numerical implementation is verified against the numerical and analytical solutions previously reported in the literature. The proposed model is capable of capturing fluid transfer between the fracture and the host rock due to the pressure difference. The numerical examples demonstrate that the behavior of fracture propagation can be significantly influenced by the capillary pressure inside fracture and vice versa. Since the fracture is represented at the level of Gauss points, the proposed numerical model can be easily implemented on any standard finite element code base.},

The drilling degree of freedom is decoupled from the bending and twisting, and the undesirable user-selectable arbitrary stabilization is avoided.

Deep learning methods have recently shown that they could represent an alternative strategy to solve physics-based problems. In this article, we propose a solution to simulate hyper-elastic materials using a data-driven approach, where a neural network is trained to learn the nonlinear relationship between boundary conditions and the resulting displacement field. We also introduce a method to guarantee the validity of the solution. In total, we present three contributions: an optimized data set generation algorithm based on modal analysis, a physics-informed loss function, and a hybrid Newton–Raphson algorithm. The method is applied to two benchmarks: a cantilever beam and a propeller. The results show that our network architecture trained with a limited amount of data can predict the displacement field in less than a millisecond. The predictions on various geometries, topologies, mesh resolutions, and boundary conditions are accurate to a few micrometers for nonlinear deformations of several centimeters of amplitude.},

  abstract     = {Soft cellular mechanical metamaterials (CMMs) have gained increasing attention due to their unique mechanical properties, especially when under large deformation. However, the strong nonlinearities and complex instabilities brought by the large deformation field is a critical challenge for the rational design of soft CMMs. In this work, we propose a mapped shape optimization method as a computational framework for inverse designs of soft CMMs. The core of this method is to introduce a fixed referential configuration. The geometric changes of the cellular structures are reflected by altering a differentiable shape map; and the deformation of the corresponding structures are determined by mapping the finite element computations to the referential configuration. Such formulation avoids the need to alter the background mesh and more importantly, provides an efficient way to compute the gradient of the objective functions with respect to the design variables via the adjoint method. The proposed method is of general purpose, and three distinct yet representative numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method: optimizing unique overall mechanical properties, precise control of the onset of instability, and optimizing phononic band gaps. These examples cover a broad range of important engineering applications of soft CMMs.},

  abstract     = {A thermoelectric device is a useful device which directly converts thermal energy to electric energy and vice versa. Although this device has such energy conversion functions, the demands in the industries are limited because of the relatively low conversion performance. In order to enhance this performance, the thermal conductivity of thermoelectric material should be low. According to dramatic improvements of nano-processing accuracy in recent decades, many thermoelectric materials have been developed with low thermal conductivities by utilizing a unique phenomenon of a nanoscale heat conduction which is called “temperature jump.” However, few structural optimization methods have been proposed for nanoscale thermoelectric materials since a conventional analysis method cannot be applied to a heat conduction problem in a nanostructure. On behalf of the Poisson&#39;s equation, we need to introduce a Boltzmann transport equation for describing a nanoscale heat conduction problem with a discontinuity effect on a material interface. The level set method has a potential for dealing with such a boundary condition in structural optimization. That is, material interfaces can be expressed by the iso-surface of the level set function, and the boundary effects are imposed in the boundaries during the optimization procedures. In this paper, we propose a level-set-based shape optimization method for thermoelectric materials. First, an analysis method for a nanoscale heat conduction problem based on the Boltzmann transport equation is introduced. An objective functional is defined for obtaining a low thermal conductivity material. Then, based on an adjoint method, we derive the shape sensitivity, which enables us to consider the effects of the temperature jumps on the material interfaces. Next, a level-set-based shape optimization is applied to our optimization problem. Finally, as a validation of our proposed method, several numerical examples are computed.},

  abstract     = {The integration of generalized differential quadrature techniques and finite element (FE) methods has been developed during the past decade for engineering problems within classical continuum theories. Hence, the main objective of the present study is to propose a novel numerical strategy called the multi-patch variational differential quadrature (VDQ) method to model the structural behavior of plate structures obeying the shear deformation plate theory within the strain gradient elasticity theory. The idea is to divide the two-dimensional solution domain of the plate model into sub-domains, called patches, and then to apply the VDQ method along with the FE mapping technique for each patch. The formulation is presented in a weak form and due to the -continuity requirements the corresponding compatibility conditions are applied through the patch interfaces. The Lagrange multiplier technique and the penalty method are implemented to apply the higher-order compatibility conditions and boundary conditions, respectively. To show the efficiency of the proposed method, numerical results are provided for plate structures with both regular and irregular solution domains. The provided numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the method in predicting the bending and vibration behavior of plate structures following the higher-order plate model.},

In this work, a domain decomposition based scalable method is proposed for solving such problems. The mechanics problem and random fields are discretized using finite element (FE) bases and Karhunen–Loève expansion, respectively. The FE mesh is partitioned that offers (i) both spatial and stochastic dimensionality reduction and (ii) an inherent framework for parallelization. Then a stochastic collocation based surrogate model is built for each subdomain wherein at each collocation point a deterministic nonlinear problem is solved. The deterministic nonlinear problem is solved using Newton–Raphson method. The linear system of equations involving the Jacobian is solved using the dual-primal version of the FE tearing and interconnecting (FETI-DP) method, due to its demonstrated scalability for deterministic problems. Stochastic collocation and FETI-DP are inherently and independently parallelizable. Finally, at the post-processing stage, a statistical sampling from the surrogate model is performed by preserving the structure of the input random field. The proposed method is numerically tested for p -Laplace and plain-strain plasticity problems, and found to be computationally efficient and accurate. In parallel implementation, the method showed good scalability.},

The approach applies a monolithic solution strategy to a fully coupled and implicit approximation of hydro-mechanical systems in conjunction with simultaneous linear elastic propagation of multiple fractures. At the end of each time step, the process ensures that the weakest fracture tip is in an equilibrium propagation regime. Furthermore, the solution process provides an initialization procedure for the newly created fracture spaces and an a priori estimate of the stress intensity factor growth rate, improving simulation robustness, and efficiency. The solution process is validated using the Kristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk analytical solution under the toughness- and viscosity-dominated regimes. It is also extended to and demonstrated on problems with multiple fractures undergoing simultaneous propagation with stress shadow interactions. Numerical examples demonstrate that the solution process can reduce the required computational cost by one order of magnitude compared to other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The use of non-intrusive reduced order modeling (NIROM) to approximate high-fidelity computer models has been steadily increased over the past decade. Recently, local NIROM has been proposed to improve the model accuracy in highly nonlinear problems in which distinct characteristic regimes coexist. The core concept of local NIROM is the decomposition of the parameter domains into a subregime to create multiple models. However, the existing local NIROM not only partitions the individual models in a mutually exclusive manner, but also uses a single model for prediction. This results in the extrapolation of surrogate models and the generation of artificial discontinuities. To mitigate these problems, a local NIROM that allows flexible overlapping of individual NIROMs is developed. This method softly partitions and combines individual NIROMs using machine learning techniques, such as fuzzy c-means and multinomial logistic regression. Furthermore, a variance-based adaptive sampling technique that can consider both local exploitation and global exploration is applied to improve model accuracy. The proposed method is validated against the transonic flow and in-flight icing problem, and demonstrates superior performance relative to its local counterpart by up to 16.5% and 33.9% in terms of normalized root-mean-square error and exclusive OR error, respectively.},

Results indicate that the IDM is more robust than the FDM and in excellent agreement with the analytical solution, and more accurate than the FDM for most of the step-sizes investigated.

This article proposes a stabilized selective integration formulation of the cell-based smoothed FEM (CSFEM) for modeling non-Newtonian fluid–structure interaction (NNFSI) where that acute mesh distortion arises. The Carreau–Yasuda and Oldroyd-B fluids, respectively, interact with a geometrically nonlinear solid in NNFSI. The CSFEM is applied to discretize both the fluid and solid media in space. As the fluid mesh accounts for a substantial part of the discretized NNFSI system, seriously distorted Q4 elements are specified exclusively for the fluid field. In this case, each convex Q4 element is subdivided into four smoothing cells (SCs) whereas its concave counterpart is regarded as one single SC. In the meantime, the solid elements are treated as usual. To stabilize the one-SC integral in smoothed Galerkin weak form, an hourglass control is subsequently introduced into the fluid momentum equations as well as the viscoelastic constitutive equation. The transient non-Newtonian fluid equations are advanced with dual time steps of the characteristic-based split scheme in time to further enhance the numerical stability and accuracy. After discussing other aspects of computational NNFSI, two benchmark problems are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the developed methodology under the harsh environment.},

Such problems present strong physical couplings arising from material and geometrical nonlinearities. In this regard, the present study investigates the numerical performance of five biphasic solution algorithms within the context of soft biological tissues: monolithic, drained, undrained, fixed-strain , and fixed-stress scheme. To this end, two classical tests were studied within a finite element framework: confined and unconfined compression tests. Since these tests behave differently in terms of biphasic coupling, the sensitivity of different permeability values and time increments to the algorithms&#39; performance were assessed. The results highlight that iterative techniques perform well over the monolithic one for weak coupling cases but suffer from lack of convergence when the coupling strength increases. This means that, in contrast to what is recommended in the vast majority of geomechanics papers, the iteratively-coupled schemes are not always well-suited methods for problems related to soft biological tissues mechanics. The monolithic scheme thus emerges as the most reliable choice to solve biphasic problems in a biomechanics context, specifically when high coupling strength problems and small time increments take place.},

  abstract     = {The early detection of terrorist threat objects, such as guns and knives, through improved metal detection, has the potential to reduce the number of attacks and improve public safety and security. To achieve this, there is considerable potential to use the fields applied and measured by a metal detector to discriminate between different shapes and different metals since, hidden within the field perturbation, is object characterization information. The magnetic polarizability tensor (MPT) offers an economical characterization of metallic objects and its spectral signature provides additional object characterization information. The MPT spectral signature can be determined from measurements of the induced voltage over a range of frequencies in a metal signature for a hidden object. With classification in mind, it can also be computed in advance for different threat and non-threat objects. In this article, we evaluate the performance of probabilistic and non-probabilistic machine learning algorithms, trained using a dictionary of computed MPT spectral signatures, to classify objects for metal detection. We discuss the importance of using appropriate features and selecting an appropriate algorithm depending on the classification problem being solved, and we present numerical results for a range of practically motivated metal detection classification problems.},

  abstract     = {Fatigue failure plays an important role in engineering applications, especially when structural components experience significant cyclic thermal loading and complex force loading simultaneously. During the last decades, several post-processing techniques have been developed based on empirical investigations of experimental evidence to predict the fatigue life of materials. The work at hand postulates a conventional continuum damage theory for thermomechanical fatigue failure modeling. In particular, an implicit gradient-enhanced approach is employed to address the ill-posedness of the partial differential equation system when the damage onsets. An internal fatigue variable is phenomenologically defined based on the accumulation of viscoplasticity. In the sequel, a regularized fatigue variable is obtained to further yield the damage softening function, which straightforwardly applies to the stress, material tangent, and viscoplastic dissipation. A multi-field problem, consisting of the strain field, the temperature, and the non-local variable, is taken into consideration, leading to a fully coupled system. This numerical methodology is consistently derived and implemented into the context of the finite element method. Several representative and demonstrative examples are performed, which yield good numerical stability and agreement with experimental data. Conclusive findings and further perspectives close this article.},

  abstract     = {A new machine-learning based multiscale method, called k-means FE 2 , is introduced to solve general nonlinear multiscale problems with internal variables and loading history-dependent behaviors, without use of surrogate models. The macro scale problem is reduced by constructing clusters of Gauss points in a structure which are estimated to be in the same mechanical state. A k-means clustering—machine learning technique is employed to select the Gauss points based on their strain state and sets of internal variables. Then, for all Gauss points in a cluster, only one micro nonlinear problem is solved, and its response is transferred to all integration points of the cluster in terms of mechanical properties. The solution converges with respect to the number of clusters, which is weakly depends on the number of macro mesh elements. Accelerations of FE calculations up to a factor 50 are observed in typical applications. Arbitrary nonlinear behaviors including internal variables can be considered at the micro level. The method is applied to heterogeneous structures with local quasi-brittle and elastoplastic behaviors and, in particular, to a nuclear waste package structure subject to internal expansions.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization is widely used in industry to determine optimal load paths while satisfying stringent constraints. Recently, functionally graded lattice materials have been integrated into structural design for weight minimization, performance improvements, among others. One subject of interest is the long-lasting designs with high fatigue failure resistance. The focus of this article is twofold, namely, to present readers with a step-by step guide to derive sensitivities for various fatigue performances in gradient based topology optimization and to present and compare new and old methods for cumulative damage objectives. New formulations for cumulative damage assessment that modify local damage in topology optimizations by influencing local stress, yield strength or SN-curve intercept are presented. Effects of functionally graded materials are also investigated to measure potential improvements in damage resistance. Methods of gradient descent such as moving asymptotes and sequential quadratic programming are included to compare solutions of fatigue minimization problems. The analysis shows that traditional method of stress penalization is the most effective to obtain satisfactory load paths for fatigue minimization when compared to yield and SN-intercept penalization. Multiple benchmark tests provided results which showed slower convergence when yield strength penalization is activated which also required significantly more computation time than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Passive heat sinks cooled by natural convection are reliable, compact, and low-noise. They are widely used in telecommunication devices, LEDs, and so forth. This work builds upon the recent advancements in fluid topology optimization (TO) to present a case study of two- and three-dimensional optimum design and thermal modeling for the natural convection problems using a reaction–diffusion equation (RDE)-based level-set method. To this end, first, a high-fidelity thermal-fluid model is constructed where the full Navier–Stokes equations are strongly coupled with the energy equation through the Boussinesq approximation. We benchmark our simulation solver against the experimental analysis and other numerical analysis methods. Next, we carefully investigate the flow behavior under different Grashof numbers using a fully transient simulation solver. Then, we revisit the RDE-based level-set TO methodology and construct an open-source parallel TO framework. The main findings reveal that using the body-fitted mesh adaptation, the proposed methodology can capture the explicit fluid–solid boundary and we are free of the continuation approach to penalize the design variable to the binary structure. A moderately large-scale TO problem with DOFs can be solved in parallel on a standard multi-process platform. Our numerical implementation uses FreeFEM for finite element analysis, PETSc for distributed linear algebra, and Mmg for mesh adaptation. For comparison and for accessing our various techniques, a variety of 2D and 3D benchmarks are presented to support these remarkable features.},

The thermal load is treated as the independently unchanged load corresponding to the initial temperature field. The internal force space is expanded using the mechanical load, the thermal load, and the predefined perturbation loads. The thermal–mechanical reduced-order model is constructed using the first to fourth-order derivatives of strain energy with thermal effects in terms of the degrees of freedom (DOFs). An additional DOF related to the thermal load appears in the construction of reduced-order model based on the novel Koiter theory. The path-following scheme is proposed to make the method able to trace the entire geometrically nonlinear thermoelastic response. A much larger step size can be achieved benefiting from the favorable prediction of the reduced-order model, compared to the classical Newton-like methods. Both the temperature-independent and temperature-dependent material properties are considered.

To overcome this difficulty, the information-poor variables are modeled with interval models and the corresponding reliability analysis method for complex system is studied in this paper. First, we establish a multidisciplinary nonprobabilistic reliability model based on interval analysis, which is an optimization framework with an objective of nonprobabilistic reliability index and two constraints of interdisciplinary consistency equation and limit state equation. Second, two types of algorithms for the above model are studied. Based on typical methods of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO), the direct algorithms including RA-MDF and RA-IDF are developed. Then, a decoupled reliability analysis algorithm is proposed to realize parallel multidisciplinary reliability analysis, in which two methods of multidisciplinary interval uncertainty analysis are formulated to decouple the coupling relationship between disciplines. Finally, three examples are employed to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

In the first stage, the shape interpolation method is first employed to generate a series of connectable unit cells. Then the effective elasticity tensors are calculated by the numerical homogenization and XFEM. Besides, the worst-case analysis and stress correction factor are employed to predict the maximum microscopic stress of the unit cells under arbitrary loading conditions. Furthermore, reduced-order models for the stress correction factor and effective elasticity tensor are built to efficiently predict the mechanical properties of the unit cell with any specified volume fraction. In the second stage, stress-constrained topology optimization is employed to find the distribution of microstructures by using established reduced-order models. Except for applying approaches commonly used in the traditional stress-constrained topology optimization, the moving Heaviside function is also proposed to include the void material into optimization. Finally, a threshold projection scheme is performed to realize the design of multiscale structures. Two numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method. In addition, because the worst-case analysis overestimates the structural stress, an evolutionary discrete optimization is employed to further explore the potential of the multiscale structures.},

XIGA provides a definition of the discontinuity independent of the underlying mesh layout, which obviates the need of knowing the crack extension direction a priori. Unlike Lagrange shape functions used in the standard finite element approach, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) provide a higher-order interelement continuity which leads to a continuous fluid flow also at element boundaries, thereby satisfying the local mass balance. It also leads to an improved estimate of the crack path due to a smoother stress distribution. The NURBS basis functions are cast in finite element data structure using Bézier extraction. To model the discontinuity, the Heaviside sign function is utilized within the displacement and the pressure fields, complemented by the shifting and the blending techniques to enforce compatibility perpendicular and parallel to the crack path, respectively. Different aspects of the approach are assessed through examples comprising straight and curved crack paths for stationary and propagating discontinuities.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there are a lot of iterative algorithms which have been proposed for nonlinear problems of solid mechanics. The existing biggest drawback of iterative algorithms is the requirement of numerous iterations and computation to solve these problems. This can be found clearly when the large or complex problems with thousands or millions of degrees of freedom are solved. To overcome completely this difficulty, the novel one-iteration nonlinear solver (OINS) using time series prediction and the modified Riks method (M-R) is proposed in this paper. OINS is established upon the core idea as follows: (1) Firstly, we predict the load factor increment and the displacement vector increment and the convergent solution of the considering load step via the predictive networks which are trained by using the load factor and the displacement vector increments of the previous convergence steps and group method of data handling (GMDH); (2) Thanks to the predicted convergence solution of the load step is very close to or identical with the real one, the prediction phase used in any existing nonlinear solvers is eliminated completely in OINS. Next, the correction phase of the M-R is adopted and the OINS iteration is started at the predicted convergence point to reach the convergent solution. The training process and the applying process of GMDH are continuously conducted and repeated during the nonlinear analysis in order to predict the convergence point at the beginning of each load step. Through numerical investigations, we prove that OINS is powerful, highly accurate and only needs about one iteration per load step. Thus, OINS significantly saves number of iterations and a huge amount of computation compared with the conventional methods. Especially, OINS not only can detect limit, inflection, and other special points but also can predict exactly various types of instabilities of structures.},

This article proposes a new orthotropic model, which focuses on the cyclic, nonlinear behavior of brick masonry structures. The model adopts a total-strain based rotating crack approach. It describes tensile and compressive failure in the rotating principal directions, while including indirectly shear failure through an internal iterative algorithm. Two distinctions are made regarding the tensile postpeak and unloading/reloading behavior based on the crack orientation at crack initiation: a steep softening branch and secant unloading are adopted when the crack angle corresponds to in-plane flexural failure, and a softening branch and bilinear unloading are adopted when the crack angle corresponds to diagonal shear failure. Bilinear unloading/reloading is adopted in compression, resulting in a cyclic behavior resembling shear. The constitutive model was implemented in a finite element software and validated against experimental results. The numerical simulations reproduced well the experimental outcomes in terms of envelope load-displacement curve and hysteretic behavior, while simultaneously they resulted in localized damage, representative of the experimental crack patterns.},

  abstract     = {Notched components are commonly used in engineering structures, where stress concentration may easily lead to crack initiation and development. The main goal of this work is to develop a simple numerical method to predict the strength and crack-growth-path of U-notched specimens made of brittle materials. For this purpose, the Fragile Points Method (FPM), as previously proposed by the authors, has been augmented by an interface debonding model at the interfaces of the FPM domains, to simulate crack initiation and development. The formulations of FPM are based on a discontinuous Galerkin weak form where point-based piece-wise-continuous polynomial test and trial functions are used instead of element-based basis functions. In this work, the numerical fluxes introduced across interior interfaces between subdomains are postulated as the tractions acting on the interface derived from an interface debonding model. The interface damage is triggered when the numerical flux reaches the interface strength, and the process of crack-surface separation is governed by the fracture energy. In this way, arbitrary crack initiation and propagation can be naturally simulated without the need for knowing the fracture-patch before-hand. Additionally, a small penalty parameter is sufficient to enforce the weak-form continuity condition before damage initiation, without causing problems such as artificial compliance and numerical ill-conditioning. As validations, the proposed FPM method with the interface debonding model is used to predict fracture strength and crack-growth trajectories of U-notched structures made of brittle materials, which is useful but challenging in engineering structural design practices.},

The propagation method is designed to be simple to implement, only h ⁢ r -adaptivity is required, with the propagation step size independent of the initial mesh allowing users to obtain high fidelity crack path predictions for domains containing multiple cracks propagating at different rates. The proposed method also includes a crack path derefinement scheme, where elements away from the crack tip are derefined whilst elements close to the crack tip are small so capture the fidelity of the crack path. The result is that the propagation of cracks over an increasingly larger distances has negligible increased computational effort and effect on the propagation path prediction. The linear elastic problem is solved using the hp discontinuous Galerkin symmetric interior penalty finite element method, which is post-processed to obtain the configurational force at each tip to a user defined accuracy. Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and capability of the method. Due to the method&#39;s high accuracy crack path solutions of benchmark problems that are prolifically used in the literature are challenged.},

Interval is used to model and characterize the uncertainty, and the bounds of uncertain structural responses are only required. In each iterative step, the approximate deterministic inverse problem is constructed according to the interval analysis results, and then the identified intervals of inputs are updated by solving the approximate deterministic inverse problem. Therefore, the interval inverse problem is decoupled into a series of interval analyses and deterministic inverse problems that are alternately solved, which dramatically promotes the computational efficiency of the interval inverse problem. Besides, an iterative mechanism is proposed to ensure the convergence of the whole procedure. Finally, two numerical examples and an engineering application are investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The state equations for the linear elasticity and heat conduction are considered. Formulations involving minimum volume with compliance, stress and temperature limits under multiple thermal conditions are presented. The global stress and regional temperature metrics adopting the corrected aggregation function are used to evaluate the maximal stress and temperature, respectively. The stress stabilizing scheme is utilized to overcome the iteration oscillation stemming from highly nonlinear behavior of thermal stress constraints for multiple thermal conditions. To achieve clear optimized topologies under design-dependent loads, a continuation strategy for the relaxed Heaviside function is developed. Two 2D numerical examples are employed to illustrate the validity and practicability of the proposed approach. The results show that the optimized structures designed by a certain temperature may be damaged or have thermal deformations once the ambient temperature changes due to the thermal residual stress. The designs covering wide temperature range achieved by neglecting stiffness or strength constraints can result in stiffness reduction or strength failure. It is therefore imperative for the optimization to adopt a multi-physics model involving multi-constraints over a wide temperature range.},

This is particularly difficult with multiphysics problems involving legacy codes, where the costs of implementing and maintaining shape derivative capabilities are prohibitive. The volume and boundary methods are two approaches to computing shape derivatives. Each has a major drawback: the boundary method is less accurate, while the volume method is more invasive to the FEM code. We introduce the strip method , which computes shape derivatives on a strip adjacent to the boundary. The strip method makes code coupling simple. Like the boundary method, it queries the state and adjoint solutions at quadrature nodes, but requires no knowledge of the FEM code implementations. At the same time, it exhibits the higher accuracy of the volume method. As an added benefit, its computational complexity is comparable to that of the boundary method, that is, it is faster than the volume method. We illustrate the benefits of the strip method with numerical examples.},

A mesh containing concave element is said to be tangled , and tangling can occur, for example, during: mesh generation, mesh morphing, shape optimization, and/or large deformation simulation. The objective of this article is to introduce a tangled finite element method (TFEM) for handling concave elements in four-node quadrilateral meshes. TFEM extends standard FEM through two concepts. First, the ambiguity of the field in the tangled region is resolved through a careful definition, and this naturally leads to certain correction terms in the FEM stiffness matrix. Second, an equality condition is imposed on the field at re-entrant nodes of the concave elements. When the correction terms and equality conditions are included, we demonstrate that one can achieve accurate results, and optimal convergence, even over severely tangled meshes. The theoretical properties of the proposed TFEM are established, and the implementation, that requires minimal changes to standard FEM, is discussed in detail. Several numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the robustness of the proposed method.},

A significant challenge to ellipsoidal particle packing problem is particle-particle contact detection. We describe an algebraic intersection detection method for ellipsoidal particles and couple it with a heuristic constructive algorithm to generate densely packed microstructures with ellipsoidal fillers. The effective behavior of the generated microstructures is then numerically estimated using an efficient random-network model that is valid for high-contrast particulate composites in near percolation arrangement. Finally, the algorithms are applied to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of ellipsoidal particle filled composites used as thermal interface materials. Simulations of lognormally distributed particle systems with varying aspect ratios of ellipsoidal fillers are systematically carried out to draw conclusions on impact of particle shapes.},

The approach is applied to electrodes with high volume fractions of high aspect ratio fibers.

Significant computational intensity is involved in the calculations of the MPM due to its very fine mesh needed to achieve a sufficiently high accuracy. A new multiple-GPU parallel strategy is developed based on a single-root complex architecture of the computer purely within a CUDA environment. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication between the GPUs is performed to exchange the information of the crossing particles and ghost element nodes, which is faster than the heavy send/receive operations between different computers through the infiniBand network. Domain decomposition is performed to split the whole computational task over the GPUs with a number of subdomains. The computations within each subdomain are allocated on a corresponding GPU using an enhanced “Particle-List” scheme to tackle the data race during the interpolation from associated particles to common nodes. The acceleration effect of the parallelization is evaluated with two benchmarks cases, mini-slump test after a dam break and cone penetration test in clay, where the maximum speedups with 1 and 8 GPUs are 88 and 604, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In continuum mechanics, the prediction of defect harmfulness requires to solve approximately partial differential equations with given boundary conditions. In this contribution boundary conditions are learnt for tight local volumes (TLV) surrounding cracks in three-dimensional volumes. A nonparametric data-driven approach is used to define the space of defects, by considering defects observed via X-Ray computed tomography. The dimension of the ambient space for the observed images of defects is huge. A nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme is proposed in order to train a reduced latent space for both the morphology of defects and their local mechanical effects in the TLV. A multimodal autoencoder enables to mix morphological and mechanical data. It contains a single latent space, termed mechanical latent space. But this latent space is fed by two encoders. One is related to the images of defects and the other to mechanical fields in the TLV. The latent variables are input variables for a geometrical decoder and for a mechanical decoder. In this work, mechanical variables are displacement fields. The autoencoder on mechanical variables enables projection-based model order reduction as proposed in the study of Lee and Carlberg. The main novelty of this paper is a submodeling approach assisted by artificial intelligence. Here, for defect images in the test set, Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to TLV. These boundary conditions are forecasted by the mechanical decoder with a latent vector predicted by the morphological encoder. For that purpose, a mapping is trained to convert morphological latent variables into mechanical latent variables, denoted “direct mapping.” An “inverse mapping” is also trained for error estimation with respect to morphological predictions. Errors on mechanical predictions are close to 5% with simulation speed-up ranging for 3 to 120. We show that latent variables forecasted by the images of defects are prone to a better understanding of the predictions.},

  abstract     = {The extended/generalized finite element method has proven significant efficiency for handling crack propagation and internal boundaries. In certain conditions, however, one of the major drawbacks relates to the representation of unrealistic traction oscillations, particularly in stiff interfaces. To the authors&#39; best knowledge, the few remedies found in the literature depend on the type of underlying finite element, which in some aspects limits general applications. Since one of the major sources of oscillations is created by couplings within standard shape functions for certain crack arrangements, it is herein proposed a novel approach based on enrichment Laplace shape functions directly adapted to the underlying geometry of split subdomains. By doing so, all sources of oscillations are effectively removed, while enriched degrees of freedom are defined exclusively on one side of the domain. The performance is studied using both element and structural examples with highly stiff cracks. More importantly, further assessment in more complex crack propagation problems, including mixed-mode fracture of concrete beams and a peel test, shows excellent agreement with experimental/numerical data in terms of load-displacement curves and traction profiles. Results are shown to be objective with respect to the mesh for stiffness values virtually representing infinitely stiff interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Linear finite element harmonic vibration analysis is an important tool when investigating structural performance. In order to construct the requested frequency response functions by sweeping through the frequencies, the full finite element model is typically reduced by a Galerkin projection, using either the solution of a free vibration problem, or with load-dependent Ritz vectors. Here we construct an approximation of the model reduction matrix using an intermediate reduced-model stage based on the Coherent Nodal Clusters technique. Thus we arrive at a two-stage model-reduction procedure. Although there is an additional approximation the reduced models are obtained at a much lower cost than the one-stage models. In order to ameliorate the loss of accuracy involved in the additional approximation, we introduce enhancement of the reduced bases by inexpensive residual-minimizing iterations.},

Further to the recent success of 4-node quadrilateral and 4-node tetrahedral elements which employ only displacement and displacement gradient as the nodal dofs, this paper develops 8-node hexahedral elements for gradient elasticity analyses by the generalized discrete Kirchhoff and the relaxed hybrid-stress methods. Both methods require a C 0 displacement interpolation which is quadratic complete in the Cartesian coordinates. Starting from the 8-node hexahedron with only displacement and displacement gradient as the nodal dofs, it is noted that another 6 mid-face nodes and a condensable bubble node with displacement dofs are required for the quadratic completeness. The dofs of the mid-face node are then constrained to those of the corner nodes defining the same element face. The C 0 displacement of the resultant 8-node hexahedron is quadratic complete only when all element faces are flat. Though the quadratic completeness of the two 8-node elements has been partially compromised, the relaxed hybrid-stress element model is marginally more accurate than the previously devised 4-node tetrahedral elements.},

  abstract     = {Poroelastic materials are essential to engineers to improve the sound and vibration properties of a product. The most common mathematical model that describes the vibro-acoustics of these materials is the Biot theory, which considers the fully coupled behavior of a homogenized solid phase, based on the structural skeleton, and a homogenized fluid phase, describing the inter-penetrating fluid. This article focuses on an adaptive higher order finite element implementation to solve poroelastic models. Owing to the presence of several wave solutions, namely, two compressional wave types and one shear wave type, it is difficult to define clear meshing guidelines a priori for poroelastic material modeling and trial and error is required to ensure reliable results. Multiple scales may be present, and local resonance phenomena may significantly modify the resolution requirements in certain frequency bands. In order to remedy this, and to be able to deliver a (nearly) mesh-independent solution, a physics based adaptivity mechanism is developed which determines the distribution of (directional) element orders at each frequency prior to the calculation, to reach a user-defined target error. The resulting approach is verified for different element topologies and is further applied to relevant applications of poroelastic materials in vibro-acoustics.},

Although full Eulerian methods that use a Cartesian mesh are attractive for FSI problems that require large-scale computing and include complex geometries and the large deformation of the solid, they cannot avoid the numerical dissipation of the interfaces or internal variables of the solid caused by their advection. This computational problem has been a barrier to the industrial application of full Eulerian mesh methods. In the numerical examples, we confirmed that the proposed method retains sharp interfaces, such as the corners of a square solid, and yields more accurate numerical results for the deformation, energy, and incompressibility of a solid in fluid than our conventional Eulerian FSI method.},

Results are obtained with a newly established elasto-plasticity model which can automatically simulate both low and high cycle fatigue failure effects, with reference to neither damage-like variables nor ad hoc failure criteria. Novelties are incorporated in a few respects. First, multiaxial loading processes with arbitrarily changing principal stresses and axes can be treated in a broad sense beyond usually treated proportional loading cases. Second, by means of the commonly used J 2 -invariant of the deviatoric stress, multiaxial loading cases can be directly treated just as in the uniaxial loading case. Third, high cost in time consumption can be considerably reduced in evaluating both low and high cycle failure effects. Numerical examples are presented for simulating uniaxial and multiaxial fatigue failure effects and simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data. Results show that the computation speed with the new algorithms exceeds 600 times faster than usual integration algorithms.},

Then the computation of derivatives, integrals, and products of the element shape functions in the SBFEM can be significantly simplified by using the Bézier coefficients. Moreover, no mapping or coordinate transformation is required when using the spline elements as the surface elements. This paper gives two algorithms for the implementation of the SBFEM.

In this way, the boundary description of 3D solids in CAD can be directly utilized for the analysis in an isogeometric framework. The approximation of the solution on the boundary is based on bi-variate NURBS. We also approximate the interior of the solid with uni-variate B-splines to facilitate the solution of nonlinear problems. The nonlinear case is extended to three dimensions in this present work. The method is further extended to dynamic problems. The mass and damping matrices are derived using the same basis functions. The solution of the entire solid is obtained with the Galerkin method.

  abstract     = {Cohesive zone models suffer from the fundamental problem that potential crack paths must be determined beforehand. Phase-field models for (brittle) fracture, that have recently become immensely popular, are able to naturally handle essentially arbitrary crack patterns. However, due to their energetic nature, phase-field approaches have difficulties to predict, for example, crack nucleation in consequence of their lack of strength criteria which are naturally incorporated in the cohesive zone model. In this contribution, an alternative approach is presented that allows the embedding of established (cyclic) cohesive laws into phase-field modeling. Our work is conceptually in line with the ideas proposed by Verhoosel and de Borst in 2013. Since this novel approach to cohesive fracture is still in its infancy, many open challenges remain, of which the following are addressed in this article: (i) A strict separation between the description of the cohesive zone and the cohesive law itself is realized, (ii) the interplay between the different physical length-scales inherent to the formulation is carefully investigated in order to quantify the parameters introduced in the phase-field description, and (iii) an alternative finite element treatment is proposed, implemented, and tested that avoids spurious solutions for unstructured meshes. In this context, fatigue crack growth is simulated as a quantitative benchmark problem relevant to engineering applications.},

In polymer processing applications, the simulation of conjugate heat transfer phenomena is critical as rigorous temperature control is necessary to ensure that the produced parts meet the required specifications. In this article, a high-order accurate finite volume method is proposed to improve the numerical accuracy and the computational efficiency of conjugate heat transfer simulations with application in polymer processing. Anisotropic meshes are investigated to significantly reduce the number of unknowns in convection-dominated problems where the higher temperature variations occur perpendicularly to curved boundaries and interfaces. The reconstruction for off-site data method based on polynomial reconstructions is employed to fulfill the prescribed boundary and interface conditions solely using polygonal meshes to avoid the limitations of curved mesh approaches. A code verification benchmark based on manufactured solutions proves that the proposed method provides a fourth-order of convergence and is computationally more cost-effective than the classical second-order of convergence. Moreover, meshes with higher aspect ratios improve the calculation efficiency but suffer from a small accuracy penalty due to conditioning deterioration. Comparison with the classical finite volume discretization techniques, widely implemented in commercial and open-source software packages, is also provided. The applicability and performance of the proposed method are further supported with a practical case study for the sheet extrusion cooling stage.},

We aim to optimize the topology of a structure to have a minimal weight while guaranteeing a predefined load capacity, considering the softening behavior of quasi-brittle materials. Two different optimization strategies are presented: a fully nonlinear strategy and a simplified strategy. The fully nonlinear strategy relies on existing nonlinear damage models, which require iterative solution methods, for structural analysis and the computation of the corresponding sensitivities. The simplified strategy uses a simplified damage model, which computes a structure&#39;s damage distribution in only one step, greatly reducing computation time. The accuracy of the simplified damage model is controlled by occasional nonlinear simulations—without sensitivity analysis—to calibrate the results. Benchmark tests compare the simplified optimization strategy with the fully nonlinear optimization strategy. While the simplified damage model does not have the same accuracy as nonlinear damage models, results show similar optimized topologies and structural efficiency, with a significant improvement regarding computation time for the simplified optimization strategy.},

The coupling between the two zones is realized by using Lagrange multipliers. Static solutions of different fracture problems are provided by a sequential linear analysis.

It takes into account the involved complex effects, for example, heterogeneous solid structure, moving interface, and phase change. The fluid and solid phases are discretized by standard Cartesian and unstructured tetrahedron meshes, respectively. At each time step the moving fluid-solid interface is tracked with the level-set function. The non-iterative solution is achieved by formulating a linear system formed from the discretized interface elements, each of which, either triangular or quadrilateral, is assigned with a respective control volume constructed from adjacent grid points in both fluid and solid phases. The temperature gradient operator is treated by the node-based Green-Gauss formula for better robustness if the interface geometry (or mesh) is highly skewed. Numerical results demonstrate the second-order accuracy with satisfactory robustness even on highly skewed interfaces.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel approach to modeling beam elements that accommodate large displacements/rotations in the context of the material point method (MPM). The MPM is a hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian approach for solving solid mechanics problems involving extremely large deformations and rotations. A solid body is discretized into a set of Lagrangian material points, called particles in the MPM. The equations of motion are solved on a fixed Eulerian background grid. The beam particle developed herein consists of two end nodes, each possessing three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom (DOF) in 3D. The end nodes are tracked and define the evolving beam particle domain. As in the conventional MPM, the linear momentum is conserved on the background grid, but here we also use this grid to enforce C1 continuity between beam particles by mapping angular velocities and accelerations for the beam rotational DOF to/from the background grid. The contact interactions between the beam particles are treated using multiple velocity fields on the background grid. Spatial nodes representing the spatial extent of the beam particle are introduced, which allows for collision detection and associated frictional contact. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical examples. Beam structures subjected to large displacements and rotations are compared with analytical/numerical solutions, in which good agreement is obtained.},

To accommodate the size effects, the modified couple stress theory is employed as the theoretical basis. The element is constructed via two main innovations. First, the trial functions that can a priori satisfy related governing differential equations are adopted as the basic functions for formulating the element interpolations. Second, the generalized conforming theory and the penalty function method are employed to meet the C 1 continuity requirement in weak sense for ensuring the computation convergence property. Several benchmarks of shells with different geometries are tested to assess the new facet shell element&#39;s capability. The numerical results reveal that the element can effectively simulate the size-dependent mechanical behaviors of small-scale thin shells, exhibiting satisfactory numerical accuracy and low susceptibility to mesh distortion. Moreover, as the shell element uses only six degrees of freedom per node, it can be incorporated into the commonly available finite element programs very readily.},

  abstract     = {High-rate deformation processes of metals entail intense grain refinement and special attention needs to be paid to capture the evolution of microstructure. In this article, a new formulation for coupling Cosserat crystal plasticity and phase field is developed. A common approach is to penalize kinematic incompatibility between lattice orientation and displacement-based elastic rotation. However, this can lead to significant solution sensitivity to the penalty parameter, resulting in low accuracy and convergence rates. To address these issues, a duality-based formulation is developed which directly imposes the rotational kinematic compatibility. A weak inf-sup-based skew-symmetric stress projection is introduced to suppress instabilities present in the dual formulation. An additional least squares stabilization is introduced to suppress the spurious lattice rotation with a suitable parameter range derived analytically and validated numerically. The required high-order continuity is attained by the reproducing kernel approximation. It is observed that equal order displacement-rotation-phase field approximations are stable, which allows efficient employment of the same set of shape functions for all independent variables. The proposed formulation is shown to yield superior accuracy and convergence with marginal parameter sensitivity compared to the penalty-based approach and successfully captures the dominant rotational recrystallization mechanism including block dislocation structures and grain boundary migration.},

The formulation is derived for flexoelectricity, a high-order electromechanical coupling between strain gradient and electric field, mathematically modeled as a coupled system of fourth-order PDEs. The design of flexoelectric devices requires the solution of high-order boundary value problems on complex material architectures, including general multimaterial arrangements. This can be efficiently achieved with an immersed boundary B-splines approach. Furthermore, the design of flexoelectric metamaterials also involves the analysis of periodic unit cells with generalized periodicity conditions. Optimal high-order convergence rates are obtained with an unfitted B-spline approximation, confirming the reliability of the method. The numerical simulations illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach toward the design of functional electromechanical multimaterial devices and metamaterials harnessing the flexoelectric effect.},

In this article, we perform topology optimization analysis for the 2-dimensional static problem, the 3-dimensional static problem, and the 3-dimensional dynamic oscillation problem. Topology optimization for the 2-dimensional static problem is used to confirm the usefulness and reliability of the proposed method, and finally topology optimization for the 3-dimensional dynamic oscillation problem is performed. In the dynamic oscillation problem, in order to derive the self-adjoint, the strain energy is regarded as the work, and is formulated separately for when it takes positive and negative values. The results of topology optimization for the 2-dimensional static problem demonstrate that our proposed method does not depend on the setting of arbitrary parameters. In conclusion, this article shows that in the three problems, our proposed method can quickly produce clearer results than the conventional OC method.},

However, identifying the location of the crack tip is sometimes vital. The widely used scheme at present considers the forefront of a phase-field contour as the crack tip. Such a method, to our best knowledge, is inapplicable for branched cracks, which motivates us to develop a novel stepwise identification strategy for multi-branched crack tips termed si-MCT. Instead of searching for crack tips globally, the proposed si-MCT realizes this in the chosen deliberately local regions (searching regions), and then automatically updates these regions as the cracks propagate. For the robust implementation of si-MCT, a novel concept of active crack tip zone is also proposed to cope with the extreme circumstances where adjacent crack paths are too close to interfere with identifying the crack tip. Furthermore, the core algorithms and specific procedures of the proposed strategy are also elaborated. Moreover, several representative tests are studied, showing the bright prospect of si-MCT in dynamic multi-branch crack tracking and adaptive mesh algorithm.},

The heterogeneity incorporation is realized through the introduction of a linear transformation fractal coefficient (LTFC). By considering a mean value for all LTFCs of all spatial coordinates. For example, x, y, z, and using the relationship between fractal dimension D f and the Hurst exponent H . We present a fractal version of the bond-based PD method that the equation of motion is conformed to fractal space. Validation of the formulation is accomplished in two steps: first, the effect of irregular mass distribution is characterized by the fractal dimension of the fracture surface roughness through experimental results of a series of single-edge notched tensile tests of a ductile material. In the next step, the proposed formulation is calibrated with the fractal dimension obtained experimentally. The results are compared with the classical bond-based PD formulation and the finite element analysis results. The obtained results in this article indicate that the irregular mass distribution of material can be introduced into particle-based numerical methods using an adequate fractal exponent. The fractal version provides a good approximation of the fracture behavior of materials.},

Specifically, the maximum length scale control is achieved by constraining local material volumes below a threshold value, which is determined upon the allowed maximum length. The massive per-element volume constraints are aggregated by the p -norm global measure. The aggregated volume constraint is augmented to the conventional compliance design objective through a Lagrange multiplier. On the other hand, the minimum length scale control is achieved by a post-processing modification of local feature according to the skeleton detected from a preliminarily optimized topology. The sensitivity numbers of the local structural features that violate the minimum length scale constraint are compensated during the post-processing modification. Both 2D and 3D benchmark design results show that the proposed schemes are effective and efficient in controlling both the maximum and minimum structural length scales.},

  abstract     = {In the past few years, the development of inverse design and optimization methods has opened up new possibilities. The adjoint method is of great significance in that context, since it permits high fidelity to flow-physics at comparatively low computational costs. The present work focuses on adsorbed gas storage systems. Its contribution is the development of an alternative approach to the adjoint contour problem, which ensures that the latter is as well-posed as the physical problem, itself. This approach proves to be fully consistent with Cacuci&#39;s methodology for computing sensitivity derivatives, which enables us to extend their scope. It allows for the evaluation of sensitivities with respect to parameters other than those pertaining to geometry, that is, to those that control the system operation such as average mass flux, convective heat transfer, inlet and external temperature. The main goal of this work is to obtain and validate a basic structure of an optimization loop algorithm (OLA) based on adjoint method, applied to adsorption natural gas storage systems, with pressure and density of adsorption as objective functions.},

The transient dynamic response of the structure and corresponding sensitivities are computed via step-by-step numerical integration and mode reduction technique is also employed to enhance the computational efficiency. Compared with existing works, the numerical instabilities induced by localized vibration modes can be substantially alleviated and the computational effort for direct sensitivity analysis is significantly reduced in the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Knitting is an effective technique for producing complex three-dimensional surfaces owing to the inherent flexibility of interlooped yarns and recent advances in manufacturing, providing better control of local stitch patterns. Fully yarn-level modeling of large-scale knitted membranes is not feasible. Therefore, we use a two-scale homogenization approach and model the membrane as a Kirchhoff-Love shell on the macroscale and as Euler-Bernoulli rods on the microscale. The governing equations for both the shell and the rod are discretized with cubic B-spline basis functions. For homogenization, we consider only the in-plane response of the membrane. The solution of the nonlinear microscale problem requires a significant amount of time due to the large deformations and the enforcement of contact constraints, rendering conventional online computational homogenization approaches infeasible. To sidestep this problem, we use a pretrained statistical Gaussian process regression (GPR) model to map the macroscale deformations to macroscale stresses. During the offline learning phase, the GPR model is trained by solving the microscale problem for a sufficiently rich set of deformation states obtained by either uniform or Sobol sampling. The trained GPR model encodes the nonlinearities and anisotropies present in the microscale and serves as a material model for the membrane response of the macroscale shell. The bending response can be chosen in dependence of the mesh size to penalize the fine out-of-plane wrinkling of the membrane. After verifying and validating the different components of the proposed approach, we introduce several examples involving membranes subjected to tension and shear to demonstrate its versatility and good performance.},

  abstract     = {Lattice-skin structures composed of a thin-shell skin and a lattice infill are widespread in nature and large-scale engineering due to their efficiency and exceptional mechanical properties. Recent advances in additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, make it possible to create lattice-skin structures of almost any size with arbitrary shape and geometric complexity. We propose a novel gradient-based approach to optimizing both the shape and infill of lattice-skin structures to improve their efficiency further. The respective gradients are computed by fully considering the lattice-skin coupling while the lattice topology and shape optimization problems are solved in a sequential manner. The shell is modeled as a Kirchhoff–Love shell and analyzed using isogeometric subdivision surfaces, whereas the lattice is modeled as a pin-jointed truss. The lattice consists of many cells, possibly of different sizes, with each containing a small number of struts. We propose a penalization approach akin to the SIMP (solid isotropic material with penalization) method for topology optimization of the lattice. Furthermore, a corresponding sensitivity filter and a lattice extraction technique are introduced to ensure the stability of the optimization process and to eliminate scattered struts of small cross-sectional areas. The developed topology optimization technique is suitable for nonperiodic, nonuniform lattices. For shape optimization of both the shell and the lattice, the geometry of the lattice-skin structure is parameterized using the free-form deformation technique. The topology and shape optimization problems are solved in an iterative, sequential manner. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and the influence of different algorithmic parameters are demonstrated with several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Stress analysis is an all-pervasive practice in engineering design. With displacement-based finite element analysis, directly-calculated stress fields are obtained in a post-processing step by computing the gradient of the displacement field—therefore less accurate. In enriched finite element analysis (EFEA), which provides unprecedented versatility by decoupling the finite element mesh from material interfaces, cracks, and structural boundaries, stress recovery is further aggravated when such discontinuities get arbitrarily close to nodes of the mesh; the presence of small area integration elements often yields overestimated stresses, which could have a detrimental impact on nonlinear analyses ( e.g ., damage or plasticity) since stress concentrations are just a nonphysical numerical artifact. In this article, we propose a stress recovery procedure for enhancing the stress field in problems where the field gradient is discontinuous. The formulation is based on a stress improvement procedure (SIP) initially proposed for low-order standard finite elements. Although generally applicable to all EFEA, we investigate the technique with the Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method and compare the procedure to other post-processing smoothing techniques. We demonstrate that SIP for EFEA provides an enhanced stress field that is more accurate than directly-calculated stresses—even when compared with standard FEM with fitted meshes.},

The geometric flows are discretized by means of subdivision based IGA, where the finite element space is formulated by the limit form of the extended Loop subdivision for different initial control meshes. The basis functions, consisting of quartic box-splines corresponding to each subdivided control mesh, are utilized to represent the geometry exactly. For the cases of the evolution of open surfaces with any shape boundary, high-order continuous boundary conditions derived from the mixed variational forms of the geometric flows should be implemented to be consistent with the isogeometric concept. For time discretization, we adopt an adaptive semi-implicit Euler scheme. By several numerical experiments, we study the convergence behaviors of the proposed approach for solving the geometric flows with high-order boundary conditions. Moreover, the numerical results also show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials such as open- and closed-cell lattice structures, foams, composites, and so forth can often be parametrized in terms of their microstructural properties, for example, relative densities, aspect ratios, material, shape, or topological parameters. To model the effective constitutive behavior and facilitate efficient multiscale simulation, design, and optimization of such parametric metamaterials in the finite deformation regime, a machine learning-based constitutive model is presented in this work. The approach is demonstrated in application to elastic beam lattices with cubic anisotropy, which exhibit highly nonlinear effective behaviors due to microstructural instabilities and topology variations. Based on microstructure simulations, the relevant material and topology parameters of selected cubic lattice cells are determined and training data with homogenized stress-deformation responses is generated for varying parameters. Then, a parametric, hyperelastic, anisotropic constitutive model is formulated as an artificial neural network, extending a recent work of the author extending a recent work of the author, Comput Mech., 2021;67(2):653-677. The machine learning model is calibrated with the simulation data of the parametric unit cell. The authors offer public access to the simulation data through the GitHub repository https://github.com/CPShub/sim-data . For the calibration of the model, a dedicated sample weighting strategy is developed to equally consider compliant and stiff cells and deformation scenarios in the objective function. It is demonstrated that this machine learning model is able to represent and predict the effective constitutive behavior of parametric lattices well across several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the usability of the approach is showcased by two examples for material and topology optimization of the parametric lattice cell.},

The reduced model is based on a quadratic approximation of the full model using a few linear buckling modes and their second order corrections, followed by the projection of the equilibrium equations onto the modal subspace. In this article, the method is reformulated for geometrically nonlinear thermoelastic analyses of shell structures. The starting point is an isogeometric solid-shell discretization with an accurate modeling of thermal strains, temperature-dependent materials and general temperature distributions. The equilibrium path is defined as a displacement versus temperature amplifier curve, while mechanical loads are kept constant. The strain energy nonlinearity with respect to the temperature amplifier is the main obstacle in the definition of an accurate reduced model. This task is achieved by coherent asymptotic expansions in mixed form using independent stress variables at the integration points and accurate linear buckling modes obtained by a two-point mixed eigenvalue problem. Structures made of isotropic and multi-layered composite materials, including variable angle tow laminates, are considered to show the accuracy of the proposed method.},

When analyzing the stress distribution in a composite with the finite element method considering the variation of the fiber location, updating the mesh significantly is necessary; however, generating an appropriate mesh for a large geometrical variation is difficult. Therefore, we focused on the mesh superposition method, which can easily generate a numerical FE model, even if the internal structure is complex, because the matrix and inclusion can be expressed by the global mesh and local mesh independently. However, in the original mesh superposition method, the analysis accuracy may be degraded owing to the mesh overlap conditions. Therefore, an improved method was applied to the homogenization theory-based analysis. In this article, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was discussed by comparing the numerical results of this method with those of conventional mesh superposition method and standard finite element method.

We also study the adaptiveness of the mesh and its ability to detect the topology change of the design. An a posteriori error analysis is performed as well. Furthermore, we provide theoretical and numerical considerations on the reduction of the number of degrees of freedoms of the adaptive analysis mesh with respect to the uniform case. This translates into a faster solution of the analysis, as we show numerically.

  abstract     = {We propose a method for the description and simulation of the nonlinear dynamics of slender structures modeled as Cosserat rods. It is based on interpreting the strains and the generalized velocities of the cross sections as basic variables and elements of the special Euclidean algebra. This perspective emerges naturally from the evolution equations for strands, that are one-dimensional submanifolds, of the special Euclidean group. The discretization of the corresponding equations for the three-dimensional motion of a Cosserat rod is performed, in space, by using a staggered grid. The time evolution is then approximated with a semi-implicit method. Within this approach, we can easily include dissipative effects due to both the action of external forces and the presence of internal mechanical dissipation. The comparison with results obtained with different schemes shows the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to provide very good predictions of nonlinear dynamical effects and shows competitive computation times also as an energy-minimizing method to treat static problems.},

  abstract     = {Time-dependent parabolic and hyperbolic equations are widely encountered in practical engineering. Accurate and fast solution methods for such equations have always attracted attention. To reach this aim, this article proposes a strategy to construct highly precise and efficient time integration methods (TIMs) for linear heat conduction and structural dynamic systems. In the proposed strategy, an integrated amplification matrix of a TIM is created to precisely transfer the free responses of the previous step, and the Gauss–Legendre quadrature is employed to precisely compute the forced responses of the current step. To reduce computational cost and rounding error, a 2 m algorithm and a method of storing incremental matrix are applied in the construction of the integrated matrix. Moreover, the L-stable backward difference formula for heat conduction and the generalized trapezoidal rule for structural dynamics, which is A-stable and has controllable dissipation, are utilized to conduct this strategy. Numerical experiments validate that compared with some existing TIMs, the TIMs generated by the proposed strategy enjoy advantages both in precision and efficiency.},

However, only limited work has been done by the finite volume community toward the simulation of mechanical contact. In this article, we present a novel semi-implicit methodology for the solution of static force-loading contact problems with cell-centered finite volume codes. Starting from the similarities with multi-material problems, we derive an implicit discretization scheme for the normal contact stress with a straightforward inclusion of frictional forces and correction vectors for non-orthogonal boundaries. With the introduction of a sigmoid blending function interpolating between contact stresses and gap pressure, the proposed approach is extended to cases with partially closed gap. The contact procedure is designed around an arbitrary mesh mapping algorithm to allow for non-conformal meshes at the contact interface between the two bodies. Finally, we verify the contact methodology against five benchmarks cases.},

The model possesses the basic structure capable of describing the monotonic/cyclic loading behaviors at the general rate of deformations from the quasi-static to the impact loading. The experiments were conducted using the spheroidal graphite cast iron under the various loading conditions. It was verified that the experimental results can be simulated accurately by the subloading-overstress model. Further, the complete implicit stress integration algorithm based on the return-mapping projection is formulated for the present subloading-overstress model and implemented into Abaqus through UMAT. Then, the deformation analyses of the R -notched cylinder were performed by the present algorithm. Consequently, the performability of the present algorithm is verified by the analyses of the boundary-value problem under the cyclic loadings.},

However, the performance limit has been observed and explained for applications for which N is very small and for which the dimension of the diffusion-map basis is close to N . For these cases, we propose a novel extension based on the introduction of a partition in independent random vectors. We take advantage of this development to present improvements of the PLoM such as a simplified algorithm for constructing the diffusion-map basis and a new mathematical result for quantifying the concentration of the probability measure in terms of a probability upper bound.

Although time-dependent adaptive Kriging model (T-AK) combined with FS (T-AK-FS) was presented to reduce the number of calling performance function, a large FS CSP still makes training T-AK time-consuming. To improve its efficiency, an adaptive truncated FS (ATFS) with T-AK (T-AK-ATFS) is proposed by CSP size reduction approach. By T-AK-ATFS, the largest safety hypercube in fuzzy standard space is adaptively searched, in which the samples are in safety states and can be removed from the FS CSP. Moreover, T-AK is adaptively trained to search the largest safety hypercube and estimate TDFP simultaneously. In adaptively searching process, the FS CSP is divided into several sub-CSPs, on which training T-AK is more time-saving. Overall, strategies of T-AK-ATFS include proposing ATFS to reduce the FS CSP, adaptively searching the largest safety hypercube, estimating the TDFP with the same T-AK and training T-AK in the sub-CSPs sequentially. Verified by examples, these strategies make T-AK-ATFS more efficient than existing FS and T-AK-FS.},

This allows a subcell accurate representation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in their sharp interface formulation. The interface is described as the zero set of a signed-distance level-set function and discretized by a standard DG method. For the interface, resp. level-set, evolution an extension velocity field is used and a two-staged algorithm is presented for its construction on a narrow-band. On the cut-cells a monolithic elliptic extension velocity method is adapted and a fast-marching procedure on the neighboring cells. The spatial discretization is based on a symmetric interior penalty method and for the temporal discretization a moving interface approach is adapted. A cell agglomeration technique is utilized for handling small cut-cells and topology changes during the interface motion. The method is validated against a wide range of typical two-phase surface tension driven flow phenomena in a 2D setting including capillary waves, an oscillating droplet and the rising bubble benchmark.},

By allowing the time increment to change during the time step a constraint can be imposed, which is used to enforce the fracture to propagate a single element length per time step. This removes the effect of the (interface) element size on propagating fractures, and therefore allows smooth fracture propagation during the simulation. The benefits of the scheme are demonstrated for three cases: mode-I crack propagation in a double cantilever beam, a shear fracture including inertial and viscoplastic effects in the surrounding material, and a pressurized fracture inside a poroelastic material. These cases highlight the ability of this scheme to obtain more accurate and nonoscillatory results for the force–displacement relation, to remove numerically induced stepwise fracture propagation, and to allow for arbitrary propagation velocities. An added benefit is that plastic strains surrounding a fracture are no longer affected by the (interface) element size.},

Also, since it requires a large number of computation cost to solve the nonlinear multiscale problems by the traditional high-order homogenization methods, the novel reduced order multiscale model is constructed. Further, according to the reduced-order multiscale models and higher-order nonlinear formulas, an effective SORM algorithm is provided for studying the nonlinear shell structures. The main characteristics of the proposed algorithm are that the novel reduced forms established to investigate the nonlinear shell structures and an efficient higher-order homogenized solution evaluated by postprocessing that does not need higher-order continuities of the homogenization solutions.

A local area/volume coordinate frame is established so that the trial shape functions can be explicitly obtained. The key idea which avoids the matrix inversion is that the trial nodal shape functions are constructed by standard quadratic triangular/tetrahedral elements and then transformed in consistent with the quadrilateral/hexahedral elements.

  abstract     = {We present a framework for calibration of parameters in elastoplastic constitutive models that is based on the use of automatic differentiation (AD). The model calibration problem is posed as a partial differential equation-constrained optimization problem where a finite element (FE) model of the coupled equilibrium equation and constitutive model evolution equations serves as the constraint. The objective function quantifies the mismatch between the displacement predicted by the FE model and full-field digital image correlation data, and the optimization problem is solved using gradient-based optimization algorithms. Forward and adjoint sensitivities are used to compute the gradient at considerably less cost than its calculation from finite difference approximations. Through the use of AD, we need only to write the constraints in terms of AD objects, where all of the derivatives required for the forward and inverse problems are obtained by appropriately seeding and evaluating these quantities. We present three numerical examples that verify the correctness of the gradient, demonstrate the AD approach&#39;s parallel computation capabilities via application to a large-scale FE model, and highlight the formulation&#39;s ease of extensibility to other classes of constitutive models.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the stress-influence-function (SIF) approach is presented for stress constrained continuum topology optimization. The SIF approach provides an alternative for continuum topology optimization with stress constraints. However, the SIF approach is not good at controlling the maximum stress of the elements compared to the conventional approach. In the study, the stress-influence-function with adaptive strength feature (SIF-ASF) approach via small-loop sequential strategy is proposed to achieve better control on the maximum elemental stress. First, the stress constrained continuum topology optimization formulation is given and the SIF approach is briefly introduced. Then the SIF-ASF approach is proposed for stress constrained continuum topology optimization, in which the strength feature in the stress influence function is adjusted in each iterative step of the optimization process. The adjoint-vector based sensitivity analysis to the design variables is further discussed. Three numerical examples are given to illustrate the applicability and validity of the proposed SIF-ASF approach. It is shown that the proposed SIF-ASF approach can achieve better control on the maximum elemental stress than the SIF approach. Moreover, the proposed SIF-ASF approach may obtain a lighter structure than the conventional approach.},

  abstract     = {A complex elastoplastic model requires a robust integration procedure of the evolution equations. The performance of the finite element solution is directly affected by the convergence characteristics of the state-update procedure. Thereby, this study proposes a comprehensive numerical integration scheme to deal with generic multisurface plasticity models. This algorithm is based on the backward Euler method aiming at accuracy and stability, and on the Newton–Raphson method to solve the unconstrained optimization problem. In this scenario, a line search strategy is adopted to improve the convergence characteristics of the algorithm. The golden section method, an exact line search, is considered. Also, a substepping scheme is implemented to provide additional robustness to the state-update procedure. Therefore, this work contributes to computational plasticity presenting an adaptive substep size scheme and a consistent tangent modulus according to the substepping technique. Finally, some numerical problems are evaluated using the proposed algorithm. Single-surface and novel multisurface plasticity models are employed in these analyses. The results testify how the line search and substepping strategies can improve the robustness of the nonlinear analysis.},
