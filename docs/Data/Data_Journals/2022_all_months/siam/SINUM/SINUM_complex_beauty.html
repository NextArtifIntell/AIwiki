  abstract     = {Abstract. Spectral methods, thanks to their high accuracy and the possibility of using fast algorithms, represent an effective way to approximate collisional kinetic equations in kinetic theory. On the other hand, the loss of some local invariants can lead to the wrong long time behavior of the numerical solution. We introduce in this paper a novel Fourier–Galerkin spectral method that improves the classical spectral method by making it conservative on the moments of the approximated distribution, without sacrificing its spectral accuracy or the possibility of using fast algorithms. The method is derived directly using a constrained best approximation in the space of trigonometric polynomials and can be applied to a wide class of problems where preservation of moments is essential. We then apply the new spectral method to the evaluation of the Boltzmann collision term and prove the spectral consistency and stability of the resulting Fourier–Galerkin approximation scheme. Various numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) method is a method for the estimation of unknown parameters in the context of (Bayesian) inverse problems. The method approximates the underlying measure by an ensemble of particles and iteratively applies the ensemble Kalman update to evolve (the approximation of the) prior into the posterior measure. For the convergence analysis of the EKI it is common practice to derive a continuous version, replacing the iteration with a stochastic differential equation. In this paper we validate this approach by showing that the stochastic EKI iteration converges to paths of the continuous time stochastic differential equation by considering both the nonlinear and linear setting, and we prove convergence in probability for the former and convergence in moments for the latter. The methods employed do not rely on the specific structure of the ensemble Kalman method and can also be applied to the analysis of more general numerical schemes for stochastic differential equations.},

Therefore, memory requirements are minimal and, consequently, these methods are attractive for solving large-scale nonlinear systems. However, the convergence of these algorithms may be slow in critical cases; therefore, acceleration procedures are welcome. In this paper, we suggest employing a variation of the sequential secant method in order to accelerate sequential residual methods. The performance of the resulting algorithm is illustrated by applying it to the solution of very large problems coming from the discretization of partial differential equations.},

We design, analyze, and implement a new conservative discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the simulation of solitary wave solutions to the generalized Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation. The key feature of our method is the conservation, at the numerical level, of the mass, energy, and Hamiltonian that are conserved by exact solutions of all KdV equations. To our knowledge, this is the first DG method that conserves all these three quantities, a property critical for the accurate long-time evolution of solitary waves. To achieve the desired conservation properties, our novel idea is to introduce two stabilization parameters in the numerical fluxes as new unknowns, which then allow us to enforce the conservation of energy and Hamiltonian in the formulation of the numerical scheme. We prove the conservation properties of the scheme which are corroborated by numerical tests. This idea of achieving conservation properties by implicitly defining penalization parameters, which are traditionally specified a priori, can serve as a framework for designing physics-preserving numerical methods for other types of problems.},

The method is inspired by a quadrature-based finite difference method of Huang and Oberman, but is defined on unstructured grids in arbitrary dimensions with a more flexible domain for approximating singular integrals. The scale of the singular integral domain not only depends on the local grid size, but also on the distance to the boundary, since the Hölder coefficient of the solution deteriorates as it approaches the boundary. By using a discrete barrier function that also reflects the distance to the boundary, we show optimal pointwise convergence rates in terms of the Hölder regularity of the data on both quasi-uniform and graded grids. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the sharpness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Higher-order time integration methods that unconditionally preserve the positivity and linear invariants of the underlying differential equation system cannot belong to the class of general linear methods. This poses a major challenge for the stability analysis of such methods since the new iterate depends nonlinearly on the current iterate. Moreover, for linear systems, the existence of linear invariants is always associated with zero eigenvalues, so that steady states of the continuous problem become nonhyperbolic fixed points of the numerical time integration scheme. Altogether, the stability analysis of such methods requires the investigation of nonhyperbolic fixed points for general nonlinear iterations. Based on the center manifold theory for maps we present a theorem for the analysis of the stability of nonhyperbolic fixed points of time integration schemes applied to problems whose steady states form a subspace. This theorem provides sufficient conditions for both the stability of the method and the local convergence of the iterates to the steady state of the underlying initial value problem. This theorem is then used to prove the unconditional stability of the MPRK22-family of modified Patankar–Runge–Kutta schemes when applied to arbitrary positive and conservative linear systems of differential equations. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A class of evolution equations with nonlocal diffusion is considered in this work. These are integro-differential equations arising as models of propagation phenomena in continuum media with nonlocal interactions including neural tissue, porous media, peridynamics, and models with fractional diffusion, as well as continuum limits of interacting dynamical systems. The principal challenge of numerical integration of nonlocal systems stems from the lack of spatial regularity of the data and solutions intrinsic to nonlocal models. To overcome this problem we propose a semidiscrete numerical scheme based on the combination of sparse Monte Carlo and discontinuous Galerkin methods. Our method requires minimal assumptions on the regularity of the data. In particular, the kernel of the nonlocal diffusivity is assumed to be a square integrable function and may be singular or discontinuous. An important feature of our method is the use of sparsity. Sparse sampling of points in the Monte Carlo approximation of the nonlocal term allows us to use fewer discretization points without compromising the accuracy. For kernels with singularities, more points are selected automatically in the regions near the singularities. We prove convergence of the numerical method and estimate the rate of convergence. There are two principal ingredients in the error of the numerical method related to the use of Monte Calro and Galerkin approximations, respectively. We analyze both errors. Two representative examples of discontinuous kernels are presented. The first example features a kernel with a singularity, while the kernel in the second example experiences jump discontinuity. We show how the information about the singularity in the former case and the geometry of the discontinuity set in the latter translate into the rate of convergence of the numerical procedure. In addition, we illustrate the rate of convergence estimate with a numerical example of an initial value problem, for which an explicit analytic solution is available. Numerical results are consistent with analytical estimates.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the numerical solution of second-order semilinear differential equations for which the stiffness is induced by only a few components of the linear part. For such problems, the leapfrog scheme suffers from severe restrictions on the step size to ensure stability. We thus propose a general class of multirate leapfrog-type methods which allows one to use step sizes which are independent of the stiff part of the equation and also very efficient to implement. The methods are constructed by combining the leapfrog scheme with an explicit scheme with a larger stability region, an implicit scheme, or a trigonometric integrator. For spatially discretized partial differential equations, this class comprises local time-stepping schemes [J. Diaz and M. J. Grote, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 31 (2009), pp. 1985--2014], [M. Grote, S. Michel, and S. Sauter, Math. Comp., 90 (2021), pp. 2603--2643] but also locally implicit or locally trigonometric integrators. Our main contribution is a rigorous error and stability analysis for the whole class of methods. Special emphasis is taken for explicit multirate methods, which are based on stabilized leapfrog-Chebyshev polynomials introduced in [C. Carle, M. Hochbruck, and A. Sturm, SIAM J. Numer.

Preasymptotic error estimates are obtained for the FEM, where the logarithmic factors in $h$ required by the previous results for the NLH with impedance boundary condition are removed in the case of two dimensions. Moreover, local quadratic convergences of the Newton&#39;s methods are derived for both the NLH with PML and its FEM.

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to study the recovery of a spatially dependent potential in a (sub)diffusion equation from overposed final time data. We construct a monotone operator, one of whose fixed points is the unknown potential. The uniqueness of the identification is theoretically verified by using the monotonicity of the operator and a fixed point argument. Moreover, we show a conditional stability in Hilbert spaces under some suitable conditions on the problem data. Next, a completely discrete scheme is developed, by using a Galerkin finite element method in space and a finite difference method in time, and then a fixed point iteration is applied to reconstruct the potential. We prove the linear convergence of the iterative algorithm by the contraction mapping theorem and present a thorough error analysis for the reconstructed potential. Our derived a priori error estimate provides a guideline to choose discretization parameters according to the noise level. The analysis relies heavily on some suitable nonstandard error estimates for the direct problem as well as the aforementioned conditional stability. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate and complement our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In PDE-constrained optimization, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provides a surrogate model of a (potentially expensive) PDE discretization on which optimization iterations are executed. Because POD models usually provide good approximation quality only locally, they have to be updated during optimization. Updating the POD model is usually expensive, however, and therefore often impossible in a model-predictive control (MPC) context. Thus, reduced models of mediocre quality might be accepted. We take the view of a simplified Newton method for solving semilinear evolution equations to derive an algorithm that can serve as an offline phase to produce a POD model. Approaches that build the POD model with impulse response snapshots can be regarded as the first Newton step in this context. In particular, POD models that are based on impulse response snapshots are extended by adding a second simplified Newton step. This procedure improves the approximation quality of the POD model significantly by introducing a moderate amount of extra computational costs during optimization or the MPC loop. We illustrate our findings with an example satisfying our assumptions.},

To the best of our knowledge, the equation solutions in this framework have never been studied before. However, such equations arise frequently when modeling stochastic systems. We construct a Banach space of (right-continuous) distribution functions and reformulate the problem into an operator equation. We provide general necessary and sufficient conditions that allow us to show convergence of the approximation approach developed in this paper. We then provide two specific choices of approximation sequences and show that the properties of these sequences are sufficient to generate approximate equation solutions that converge to the true solution assuming solution uniqueness and some additional mild regularity conditions. Our analysis is performed under the supremum norm, allowing wider applicability of our results. Worst-case error bounds are also available from solving a linear program. We demonstrate the viability and computational performance of our approach by constructing three examples. The solution of the first example can be constructed manually but demonstrates the correctness and convergence of our approach. The second application example involves stationary distribution equations of a stochastic model and demonstrates the dramatic improvement our approach provides over the use of computer simulation. The third example solves a problem involving an everywhere nondifferentiable function for which no closed-form solution is available.},

To be specific, we prove the local linear convergence rates of numerical schemes of high-index saddle dynamics, which indicates that the local curvature in the neighborhood of the saddle point and the accuracy of computing the eigenfunctions are main factors that affect the convergence of discrete saddle dynamics.

  abstract     = {The complex scaling/perfectly matched layer method is a widely spread technique to simulate wave propagation problems in open domains. The method is very popular because its implementation is very easy and does not require any knowledge of a fundamental solution. However, for anisotropic media the method may yield an unphysical radiation condition and lead to erroneous and unstable results. In this article we argue that a radial scaling (opposed to a Cartesian scaling) does not suffer from this drawback and produces the desired radiation condition. This result is of great importance as it rehabilitates the application of the complex scaling method for anisotropic media. To present further details we consider the radial complex scaling method for scalar anisotropic resonance problems. We prove that the associated operator is Fredholm and show the convergence of approximations generated by simulateneous domain truncation and finite element discretization. We present computational studies to undergird our theoretical results.},

The methods support polyhedral meshes, rely on the primal formulation of the problem, and deliver $O(h^{k+1})$ $H^2$-error estimates when using polynomials of order $k\ge0$ to approximate the normal derivative on the mesh (inter)faces. Both HHO methods hinge on a stabilization in the spirit of Lehrenfeld and Schöberl for second-order PDEs. The cell unknowns are polynomials of order $(k+2)$ that can be eliminated locally by means of static condensation. The face unknowns approximating the trace of the solution on the mesh (inter)faces are polynomials of order $(k+1)$ in the first HHO method, which is valid in dimension two and uses an original stabilization involving the canonical hybrid finite element, and they are of order $(k+2)$ for the second HHO method, which is valid in arbitrary dimension and uses only $L^2$-orthogonal projections in the stabilization. A comparative discussion with the weak Galerkin methods from the literature is provided, highlighting the close connections and the improvements proposed herein. Additionally, we show how the two HHO methods can be combined with a Nitsche-like boundary-penalty technique to weakly enforce the boundary conditions. An originality in the devised Nitsche&#39;s technique is to avoid any penalty parameter that must be large enough. Finally, numerical results showcase the efficiency of the proposed methods and indicate that the HHO methods can generally outperform discontinuous Galerkin methods and even be competitive with $C^0$-interior penalty methods on triangular meshes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the perfectly matched layer (PML) method for wave scattering in a half space of a homogeneous medium bounded by a two-dimensional, perfectly conducting, and locally defected periodic surface, and develops a high-accuracy boundary integral equation (BIE) solver. Along the vertical direction, we place a PML to truncate the unbounded domain onto a strip and prove that the PML solution converges to the true solution in the physical subregion of the strip with an error bounded by the reciprocal PML thickness. Laterally, we divide the unbounded strip into three regions: one region containing the defect and two semi-waveguide regions, separated by two vertical line segments. In both semi-waveguides, we prove the well-posedness of an associated scattering problem so as to well define a Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) operator on the associated vertical segment. The two NtD operators, serving as exact lateral boundary conditions, reformulate the unbounded strip problem as a boundary value problem over the defected region. Due to the periodicity of the semi-waveguides, the two NtD operators are related to two different Neumann-marching operators, and either Neumann-marching operator is governed by a nonlinear Riccati equation. It is proved that the Neumann-marching operators are contracting, so that the PML solution decays exponentially fast along both lateral directions. The consequences culminate in two opposite aspects. Negatively, the PML solution cannot converge exponentially to the true solution in the whole physical region of the strip. Positively, from a numerical perspective, the Riccati equations can now be efficiently solved by a recursive doubling procedure and a high-accuracy PML-based BIE method so that the boundary value problem on the defected region can be solved efficiently and accurately. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the PML solution converges exponentially fast to the true solution in any compact subdomain of the strip.},

This decomposition allows us to express the eigenpair as an easy-to-calculate cell problem solution combined with an asymptotically vanishing remainder. We then prove that the easy-to-calculate limit eigenvalue can be used in a shift-and-invert preconditioning strategy to bound the number of eigensolver iterations uniformly.

It generalizes the stability analysis of only explicit RK methods in [Z. Sun and C.-W. Shu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 57 (2019), pp. 1158--1182]. The established energy identities provide a precise characterization on whether and how the energy dissipates in the RK discretization, thereby leading to weak and strong stability criteria of RK methods. Furthermore, we discover a unified energy identity for all the diagonal Padé approximations, based on an analytical Cholesky type decomposition of a class of symmetric matrices. The structure of the matrices is very complicated, rendering the discovery of the unified energy identity and the proof of the decomposition highly challenging. Our proofs involve the construction of technical combinatorial identities and novel techniques from the theory of hypergeometric series. Our framework is motivated by a discrete analogue of integration by parts technique and a series expansion of the continuous energy law. In some special cases, our analyses establish a close connection between the continuous and discrete energy laws, enhancing our understanding of their intrinsic mechanisms. Several specific examples of implicit methods are given to illustrate the discrete energy laws. A few numerical examples further confirm the theoretical properties.},

  abstract     = {A framework is presented to design multirate time stepping algorithms for two dissipative models with coupling across a physical interface. The coupling takes the form of boundary conditions imposed on the interface, relating the solution variables for both models to each other. The multirate aspect arises when numerical time integration is performed with different time step sizes for the component models. In this paper, we seek to identify a unified approach to develop multirate algorithms for these coupled problems. This effort is pursued though the use of discontinuous-Galerkin time stepping methods, acting as a general unified framework, with different time step sizes. The subproblems are coupled across user-defined intervals of time, called coupling windows, using polynomials that are continuous on the window. The coupling method is shown to reproduce the correct interfacial energy dissipation, discrete conservation of fluxes, and asymptotic accuracy. In principle, methods of arbitrary order are possible. As a first step, herein we focus on the presentation and analysis of monolithic methods for advection-diffusion models coupled via generalized Robin-type conditions. The monolithic methods could be computed using a Schur-complement approach. The framework and analysis herein accommodate multirate coupling for a wide variety of single-step, multistep, and multistage methods. A concrete example of Crank--Nicolson integrators coupled in a multirate fashion is also included to illustrate the ideas. We conclude with some discussion of future developments, such as different interface conditions and partitioned methods.},

Unlike the other low-regularity integrators for nonlinear dispersive equations, which are all fully explicit in time, the proposed method is a semi-implicit exponential method in time in order to preserve the energy-decay structure of the Navier--Stokes equations. First-order convergence of the proposed method is established independently of the viscosity coefficient $\mu$ under weaker regularity conditions than other existing numerical methods, including the semi-implicit Euler method and classical exponential integrators. The proposed low-regularity integrator can be extended to full discretization with either a stabilized finite element method or a spectral collocation method in space, as illustrated in this article. Numerical results show that the proposed method is much more accurate than the semi-implicit Euler method in the viscous case $\mu=O(1)$ and more stable than the classical exponential integrator in the inviscid case $\mu\rightarrow 0$.},

First, we show the dissipative weak--strong uniqueness principle, meaning a dissipative weak solution coincides with a classical solution as long as they emanate from the same initial data. Next, we show the convergence of consistent approximation toward the dissipative weak solution and thus the classical solution. Upon interpreting the consistent approximation as the stability and consistency of suitable numerical solutions we have established a generalized Lax equivalence theory: convergence $\Longleftrightarrow$ stability and consistency. Further, to illustrate the application of this theory, we propose two mixed finite volume--finite element methods with exact divergence-free magnetic field. Finally, by showing that solutions of these two schemes are consistent approximations, we conclude their convergence toward the dissipative weak solution and the classical solution.},

A direct application of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) improves this cost scaling slightly, but returns suboptimal computational complexities since estimation of the probability involves a discontinuous functional of $G_\ell$. We propose a general adaptive framework which is able to return the MLMC complexities seen for smooth or Lipschitz functionals of $G_\ell$.

In the considered setting, the physical domain that evolves essentially arbitrarily through a time-independent computational background domain is represented by a level set function. For the time discretization, the application of standard time stepping schemes that are based on finite difference approximations of the time derivative is not directly possible, as the degrees of freedom may become active or inactive across such a finite difference stencil in time. In [C. Lehrenfeld and M. A. Olshanskii, ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 53 (2019), pp. 585--614], this problem is overcome by extending the discrete solution at every time step to a sufficiently large neighborhood so that all degrees of freedom that are relevant at the next time step stay active. But that paper focuses on low-order methods. We advance these results by introducing and analyzing realizable techniques for the extension to higher order. To obtain higher-order convergence in space and time, we combine backward differentiation formula (BDF) time stepping with the isoparametric unfitted finite element method (FEM). The latter has been used and analyzed for several stationary problems. However, for moving domains the key ingredient in the method, the transformation of the underlying mesh, becomes time dependent, which gives rise to some technical issues. We treat these with special care, carry out an a priori error analysis, and present two numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Many nonlocal models have adopted Euclidean balls as the nonlocal interaction neighborhoods. When solving them numerically, it is sometimes convenient to adopt polygonal approximations of such balls. A crucial question is to what extent such approximations affect the nonlocal operators and the corresponding solutions. While recent works have analyzed this issue for a fixed horizon parameter, the question remains open in the case of a small or vanishing horizon parameter, which happens often in many practical applications and has a significant impact on the reliability and robustness of nonlocal modeling and simulations. In this work, we are interested in addressing this issue and establishing the convergence of the nonlocal solutions associated with polygonally approximated interaction neighborhoods to the local limit of the original nonlocal solutions. Our finding reveals that the new nonlocal solution does not converge to the correct local limit when the number of sides of polygons is uniformly bounded. On the other hand, if the number of sides tends to infinity, the desired convergence can be established. These results may be used to guide future computational studies of nonlocal models.},

Recently, the combination of linear multistep methods (LMMs) and deep learning has been successfully employed to discover dynamics, whereas a complete convergence analysis of this approach is still under development. In this work, we consider the deep network-based LMMs for the discovery of dynamics. We put forward error estimates for these methods using the approximation property of deep networks. It indicates, for certain families of LMMs, that the $\ell^2$ grid error is bounded by the sum of $O(h^p)$ and the network approximation error, where $h$ is the time step size and $p$ is the local truncation error order. Numerical results of several physically relevant examples are provided to demonstrate our theory.},

  abstract     = {Numerically solving the 2D Helmholtz equation is widely known to be very difficult largely due to its highly oscillatory solution, which brings about the pollution effect. A very fine mesh size is necessary to deal with a large wavenumber leading to a severely ill-conditioned huge coefficient matrix. To understand and tackle such challenges, it is crucial to analyze how the solution of the 2D Helmholtz equation depends on (perturbed) boundary and source data for large wavenumbers. In fact, this stability analysis is critical in the error analysis and development of effective numerical schemes. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze and derive several new sharp wavenumber-explicit stability bounds for the 2D Helmholtz equation with inhomogeneous mixed boundary conditions: Dirichlet, Neumann, and impedance. We use Fourier techniques, Rellich&#39;s identity, and a lifting strategy to establish these stability bounds. Some examples are given to show the optimality of our derived wavenumber-explicit stability bounds.},

Actually, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon \ll 1$, the NKGE with $O(\varepsilon^2)$ nonlinearity and $O(1)$ initial data is equivalent to that with $O(1)$ nonlinearity and small initial data, the amplitude of which is at $O(\varepsilon)$. We begin with a semidiscretization of the NKGE by the second-order time-splitting method and derive a full-discretization by the Fourier spectral method in space. Employing the regularity compensation oscillation technique which controls the high frequency modes by the regularity of the exact solution and analyzes the low frequency modes by phase cancellation and energy method, we carry out the improved uniform error bounds at $O(\varepsilon^2\tau^2)$ and $O(h^m+\varepsilon^2\tau^2)$ for the second-order semidiscretization and full-discretization up to the long time $T_\varepsilon = T/\varepsilon^2$ with $T$ fixed, respectively. Extensions to higher-order time-splitting methods and the case of an oscillatory complex NKGE are also discussed.

While some commonly used first-order time stepping schemes have turned out to preserve unconditionally both the energy dissipation law and the MBP for the equation, restrictions on the time step size are still needed for existing second-order or even higher order schemes in order to have such simultaneous preservation. In this paper, we develop and analyze novel first- and second-order linear numerical schemes for a class of Allen--Cahn type gradient flows. Our schemes combine the generalized scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach and the exponential time integrator with a stabilization term, while the standard central difference stencil is used for discretization of the spatial differential operator. We not only prove their unconditional preservation of the energy dissipation law and the MBP in the discrete setting, but we also derive their optimal temporal error estimates under fixed spatial mesh. Numerical experiments are also carried out to demonstrate the properties and performance of the proposed schemes.},

The two schemes are shown to “preserve” the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ in the following sense: via discrete energy and pressure estimates we control uniformly with respect to $\varepsilon$ the discrete density, velocity, and pressure; and, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, the limit pressure is shown to be activated only in the congested region where the discrete limit density is maximal, equal to 1. Finally, the semi-implicit scheme is implemented via the software CALIF$^3$S on 1D and 2D test cases and the numerical solutions are shown to capture well the transition between the congested regions ${\rho = 1}$ and the free regions ${\rho &lt; 1}$.},

In contrast to previous related works, our estimates are frequency-explicit. In particular, our key contribution is to show that even if the constants appearing in the reliability and efficiency estimates may blow up on coarse meshes, they become independent of the frequency for sufficiently refined meshes. Such results were previously known for the Helmholtz equation describing scalar wave propagation problems, and we show that they naturally extend, at the price of many technicalities in the proofs, to Maxwell&#39;s equations. Our mathematical analysis is performed in the three-dimensional case and covers conforming Nédélec discretizations of the first and second families.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of reconstructing the historical distribution for a nonlinear diffusion equation, in which the diffusion is driven by not only a nonlocal operator but also a locally one. The problem naturally arises in many real-world applications including the biological population dynamic where a population competes for the resources and diffuses by a combination of classical and nonlocal dispersal processes. By using the Banach fixed point theorem and some appropriate estimates, we first construct an example to show the ill-posedness of the problem. Next, we propose a filter regularization method written in form of a nonlinear Volterra integral equation, in combination with the new technique recently developed calling the globally Lipschitz approximation. Finally, several numerical tests, with a combination of the finite difference schemes and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, are also presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

The proposed method combines the advantages and central ideas of the following very successful numerical techniques: the summation-by-parts finite difference method, the spectral method, and the discontinuous Galerkin method. We prove energy stability and the discrete conservation principle and derive error estimates in the energy norm for the (1+1)-dimensions shifted wave equation in second order form. The energy-stability results, discrete conservation principle, and the error estimates generalize to multiple dimensions using tensor products of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements. Numerical experiments, in (1+1)-dimensions and (2+1)-dimensions, verify the theoretical results and demonstrate optimal convergence of $L^2$ numerical errors at subsonic, sonic and supersonic regimes.},

The governing equation is discretized in second order form by a fourth or sixth order accurate summation-by-parts operator. The mesh size is determined by the velocity structure of the material, resulting in nonconforming grid interfaces with hanging nodes. We use order-preserving interpolation and the ghost point technique to couple adjacent mesh blocks in an energy-conserving manner, which is supported by a fully discrete stability analysis. In our previous work for the wave equation, two pairs of order-preserving interpolation operators were needed when imposing the interface conditions weakly by a penalty technique. Here, we only use one pair in the ghost point method. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the convergence rate is optimal and is the same as when a globally uniform mesh is used in a single domain. In addition, with a predictor-corrector time integration method, we obtain time stepping stability with stepsize almost the same as that given by the usual Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy condition.},

In this context, the EnKF is known as ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). In recent years several continuous limits in the number of iterations and particles have been performed in order to study properties of the method. In particular, a one-dimensional linear stability analysis reveals possible drawbacks in the phase space of moments provided by the continuous limits of the EKI but is observed also in the multidimensional setting. In this work we address this issue by introducing a stabilization of the dynamics which leads to a method with globally asymptotically stable solutions. We illustrate the performance of the stabilized version by using test inverse problems from the literature and comparing it with the classical continuous limit formulation of the method.},

Our starting point is a formulation of the Fokker--Planck equation as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on finite-dimensional parameter space with the parameters inherited from generative models such as normalizing flows. We call such ODEs neural parametric Fokker--Planck equations. The fact that the Fokker--Planck equation can be viewed as the $L^2$-Wasserstein gradient flow of Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence allows us to derive the ODEs as the constrained $L^2$-Wasserstein gradient flow of KL divergence on the set of probability densities generated by neural networks. For numerical computation, we design a variational semi-implicit scheme for the time discretization of the proposed ODE. Such an algorithm is sampling-based, which can readily handle the Fokker--Planck equations in higher dimensional spaces. Moreover, we also establish bounds for the asymptotic convergence analysis of the neural parametric Fokker--Planck equation as well as the error analysis for both the continuous and discrete versions. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms and analysis.},

As an application we obtain new recovery guarantees for Sobolev type spaces related to Jacobi type differential operators, on the one hand, and classical multivariate periodic Sobolev type spaces with general smoothness weight on the other hand.

Proofs of convergence and rate of convergence exist for AFEMs; however, these proofs typically rely upon a nested structure for the sequence of meshes. A metric adaptive finite element method (MAFEM) utilizes the continuous mesh model and instead seeks to optimize a Riemannian metric field for a given cost, from which a mesh is generated. This meshing process results in a sequence of nonnested meshes. In this paper we introduce a proof of convergence for a class of MAFEM, utilizing an optimization statement to relate the error on the sequence of meshes. In addition, we prove that such a sequence of meshes will demonstrate the optimal asymptotic rate of convergence for a given polynomial order. Finally some numerical results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for a singularly perturbed linear advection diffusion problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a Monte-Carlo Nystrom method for solving integral equations of the second kind, whereby the values $(z(y_i))_{1\leq i\leq N}$ of the solution $z$ at a set of $N$ random and independent points $(y_i)_{1\leq i\leq N}$ are approximated by the solution $(z_{N,i})_{1\leq i\leq N}$ of a discrete $N$-dimensional linear system obtained by replacing the integral with the empirical average over the samples $(y_i)_{1\leq i\leq N}$. Under the unique assumption that the integral equation admits a unique solution $z(y)$, we prove the invertibility of the linear system for sufficiently large $N$ with probability one, and the convergence of the solution $(z_{N,i})_{1\leq i\leq N}$ towards the point values $(z(y_i))_{1\leq i\leq N}$ in a mean-square sense at a rate $O(N^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. For a particular choices of kernels, the discrete linear system arises as the Foldy--Lax approximation for the scattered field generated by a system of $N$ sources emitting waves at the points $(y_i)_{1\leq i\leq N}$. In this context, our result can be equivalently considered as a proof of the well-posedness of the Foldy--Lax approximation for systems of $N$ point scatterers, and of its convergence as $N\rightarrow +\infty$ in a mean-square sense to the solution of a Lippmann--Schwinger equation characterizing the effective medium. The convergence of Monte-Carlo solutions at the rate $O(N^{-1/2})$ is numerically illustrated on one-dimensional examples and for solving a two-dimensional Lippmann--Schwinger equation.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a mortar technique for mixed finite element approximations of a class of domain decomposition saddle point problems on nonmatching grids in which the variable associated with the essential boundary condition, referred to as flux, is chosen as the coupling variable. It plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier to impose weakly continuity of the variable associated with the natural boundary condition. The flux-mortar variable is incorporated with the use of a discrete extension operator. We present well-posedness and error analysis in an abstract setting under a set of suitable assumptions, followed by a nonoverlapping domain decomposition algorithm that reduces the global problem to a positive definite interface problem. The abstract theory is illustrated for Darcy flow, where the normal flux is the mortar variable used to impose continuity of pressure, and for Stokes flow, where the velocity vector is the mortar variable used to impose continuity of normal stress. In both examples, suitable discrete extension operators are developed and the assumptions from the abstract theory are verified. Numerical studies illustrating the theoretical results are presented for Darcy flow.},

  abstract     = {We consider the computation of quadrature rules that are exact for a Chebyshev set of linearly independent functions on an interval $[a,b]$. A general theory of Chebyshev sets guarantees the existence of rules with a Gaussian property, in the sense that $2l$ basis functions can be integrated exactly with just $l$ points and weights. Moreover, all weights are positive, and the points lie inside the interval $[a,b]$. However, the points are not the roots of an orthogonal polynomial or any other known special function as in the case of regular Gaussian quadrature. The rules are characterized by a nonlinear system of equations, and earlier numerical methods have mostly focused on finding suitable starting values for a Newton iteration to solve this system. In this paper we describe an alternative scheme that is robust and generally applicable for so-called complete Chebyshev sets. These are ordered Chebyshev sets where the first $k$ elements also form a Chebyshev set for each $k$. The points of the quadrature rule are computed one by one, increasing the exactness of the rule in each step. Each step reduces to finding the unique root of a univariate and monotonic function. As such, the scheme of this paper is guaranteed to succeed. The quadrature rules are of interest for integrals with nonsmooth integrands that are not well approximated by polynomials.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes and examines a finite element method (FEM) for a Maxwell obstacle problem in electric shielding. The model is given by a coupled system comprising the Faraday equation and an evolutionary variational inequality (VI) of Ampère--Maxwell-type. Based on the leapfrog (Yee) time-stepping and the Nédélec edge elements, we set up a fully discrete FEM where the obstacle is discretized in such a way that no additional nonlinear solver is required for the computation of the discrete VI. While the $L^2$-stability is achieved for the discrete solutions and the associated difference quotients, the scheme only guarantees the $L^1$-stability for the discrete magnetic curl field in the obstacle region. The lack of the global $L^2$-stability for the magnetic curl field is justified by the low regularity issue in Maxwell obstacle problems and turns to be the main challenge in the convergence analysis. Our convergence proof consists of two main stages. First, exploiting the $L^1$-stability in the obstacle region, we derive a convergence result towards a weaker system involving smooth feasible test functions. In the second step, we recover the original system by enlarging the feasible test function set through a specific constraint preserving mollification process in the spirit of Ern and Guermond [Comput. Methods Appl. Math., 16 (2016), pp. 51--75]. This paper is closed by three-dimensional numerical results of the proposed FEM confirming the theoretical convergence result and, in particular, the Faraday shielding effect.},

By rigorous error analysis, we show that ELRI achieves first-order accuracy by requiring the boundedness of one additional spatial derivative of the solution.

The proposed numerical method can quantitatively capture to the fullest possible extent the development of Dirac-delta singularities for genetic segregation on the one hand and preserve several sets of biologically relevant and computationally favored properties of the random genetic drift on the other. Moreover, the numerical scheme exponentially converges to the unique numerical stationary state in time at a rate independent of the mesh size up to a mesh error. Numerical evidence is given to illustrate and support these properties and to demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamics of random genetic drift.},

  abstract     = {The main task of this paper is to prove that the perfectly matched layers (PML) method converges exponentially with respect to the PML parameter for scattering problems with periodic surfaces. In [S. N. Chandler-Wilde and P. Monk, Appl. Numer. Math., 59 (2009), pp. 2131--2154], a linear convergence is proved for the PML method for scattering problems with rough surfaces. At the end of that paper, three important questions are asked, and the third question is whether exponential convergence holds locally. In our paper, we answer this open question for a special case, when the rough surface is actually periodic. Due to technical reasons, we have to exclude all the wavenumbers which are half integers. The main idea of the proof is to apply the Floquet--Bloch transform to rewrite the problem as an equivalent family of quasi-periodic problems, and then study the analytic extension of the quasi-periodic problems with respect to the Floquet--Bloch parameters. Then the Cauchy integral formula is applied to avoid linear convergent points. Finally, the exponential convergence is proved from the inverse Floquet--Bloch transform. Numerical results are also presented at the end of this paper.},

  abstract     = {We present a detailed convergence analysis for an operator splitting scheme proposed in [C. Liu, C. Wang, and Y. Wang, J. Comput. Phys., 436 (2021), 110253] for a reaction-diffusion system with detailed balance. The numerical scheme has been constructed based on a recently developed energetic variational formulation, in which the reaction part is reformulated in terms of the reaction trajectory, and both the reaction and diffusion parts dissipate the same free energy. The scheme is energy stable and positivity-preserving. In this paper, the detailed convergence analysis and error estimate are performed for the operator splitting scheme. The nonlinearity in the reaction trajectory equation, as well as the implicit treatment of nonlinear and singular logarithmic terms, impose challenges in numerical analysis. To overcome these difficulties, we make use of the convex nature of the logarithmic nonlinear terms. In addition, a combination of rough error estimate and refined error estimate leads to a desired bound of the numerical error in the reaction stage, in the discrete maximum norm. Furthermore, a discrete maximum principle yields the evolution bound of the numerical error function at the diffusion stage. As a direct consequence, a combination of the numerical error analysis at different stages and the consistency estimate for the operator splitting procedure results in the convergence estimate of the numerical scheme for the full reaction-diffusion system. The convergence analysis technique could be extended to a more general class of dissipative reaction mechanisms. As an example, we also consider a near-equilibrium reaction kinetics, which was derived by the linear response assumption on the reaction trajectory. Although the reaction rate is more complicated in terms of concentration variables, we show that the numerical approach and the convergence analysis also work in this case.},

  abstract     = {We consider a model of energy minimization arising in the study of the mechanical behavior caused by cell contraction within a fibrous biological medium. The macroscopic model is based on the theory of non rank-one convex nonlinear elasticity for phase transitions. We study appropriate numerical approximations based on the discontinuous Galerkin treatment of higher gradients and used succesfully in numerical simulations of experiments. We show that the discrete minimizers converge in the limit to minimizers of the continuous problem. This is achieved by employing the theory of $\Gamma$-convergence of the approximate energy functionals to the continuous model when the discretization parameter tends to zero. The analysis is involved due to the structure of numerical approximations which are defined in spaces with lower regularity than the space where the minimizers of the continuous variational problem are sought. This fact leads to the development of a new approach to $\Gamma$-convergence, appropriate for discontinuous finite element discretizations, which can be applied to quite general energy minimization problems. Furthermore, the adoption of exponential terms penalizing the interpenetration of matter requires a new framework based on Orlicz spaces for discontinuous Galerkin methods which is developed in this paper as well.},

This nonoverlapping domain decomposition is commonly encountered when discretizing elliptic equations, as it enables the usage of parallel and distributed hardware. Convergence has been derived in various linear contexts, but little has been proven for nonlinear equations. Hence, we develop a new theory for nonlinear Steklov--Poincaré operators based on the $p$-structure and the $L^p$-generalization of the Lions--Magenes spaces. This framework allows the reformulation of the Robin--Robin method into a Peaceman--Rachford splitting on the interfaces of the subdomains, and the convergence analysis then follows by employing elements of the abstract theory for monotone operators. The analysis is performed on Lipschitz domains and without restrictive regularity assumptions on the solutions.},

The motivation to study the energy space problem follows from our analysis: we prove that the choice of the control space ${$L$}^2(\Gamma)$ can lead to an optimal control with discontinuities at the corners, even when the domain is convex. This phenomenon is also observed in numerical experiments. This behavior does not occur in Dirichlet boundary control problems for the Poisson equation on convex polygonal domains, and it may not be desirable in real applications. For the energy space problem, we show that the solution of the control problem is more regular than the solution of the problem with the ${$L$}^2(\Gamma)$-regularization. The improved regularity enables us to prove a priori error estimates for the control in the energy norm.

  abstract     = {We develop an algorithm that computes strongly continuous semigroups on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with explicit error control. Given a generator $A$, a time $t&gt;0$, an arbitrary initial vector $u_0$, and an error tolerance $\epsilon&gt;0$, the algorithm computes $\exp(tA)u_0$ with error bounded by $\epsilon$. The algorithm is based on a combination of a regularized functional calculus, suitable contour quadrature rules, and the adaptive computation of resolvents in infinite dimensions. As a particular case, we show that it is possible, even when only allowing pointwise evaluation of coefficients, to compute, with error control, semigroups on the unbounded domain $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ that are generated by partial differential operators with polynomially bounded coefficients of locally bounded total variation. For analytic semigroups (and more general Laplace transform inversion), we provide a quadrature rule whose error decreases like $\exp(-cN/\log(N))$ for $N$ quadrature points, that remains stable as $N\rightarrow\infty$, and which is also suitable for infinite-dimensional operators. Numerical examples are given, including Schrödinger and wave equations on the aperiodic Ammann--Beenker tiling, complex perturbed fractional diffusion equations on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, and damped Euler--Bernoulli beam equations.},

At every time level, the method first computes an auxiliary numerical solution by a linearly implicit lumped mass method and then renormalizes it at all finite element nodes before proceeding to the next time level. It is shown that such a renormalized finite element method has an error bound of $O(\tau+h^{r+1})$ for tensor-product finite elements of degree $r\ge 1$. The proof of the error estimates is based on a geometric relation between the auxiliary and renormalized numerical solutions.

Babuska and R. Lipton, Multiscale Model. Simul., 9 (2011), pp. 373--406]. First, in addition to a nearly exponential decay rate of the local approximation errors with respect to the dimensions of the local spaces, the rate of convergence with respect to the size of the oversampling region is also established. Second, the theoretical results hold for problems with mixed boundary conditions defined on general Lipschitz domains. Finally, an efficient and easy-to-implement technique for generating the discrete $A$-harmonic spaces is proposed which relies on solving an eigenvalue problem associated with the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, leading to a substantial reduction in computational cost. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to confirm the effectiveness of the new method.},

We provide conditions for inf-sup stable discretizations and present one such discretization for box domains with constant convection. We also provide a priori error estimates for this discretization. The preconditioner requires a fourth-order problem to be solved. For this reason, we use isogeometric analysis as a method of discretization. To efficiently realize the preconditioner, we consider geometric multigrid with a standard Gauss--Seidel smoother as well as a new macro Gauss--Seidel smoother. The latter smoother provides good results with respect to both the geometry mapping and the polynomial degree.},

The trial function of such a pair is constructed by applying the kinetic transport operator and the inverse velocity Laplace--Beltrami operator to a given test function. For the Petrov--Galerkin projection we choose an arbitrary discrete test space and then define the discrete trial space using the same application of transport and inverse Laplace--Beltrami operator. As a result, the spaces replicate the stable pairs of the continuous level, and we obtain a well-posed numerical method with a discrete inf-sup constant identical to the inf-sup constant of the continuous problem independently of the mesh size.

  abstract     = {Multigrid is one of the most efficient methods for solving large-scale linear systems that arise from discretized partial differential equations. As a foundation for multigrid analysis, two-grid theory plays an important role in motivating and analyzing multigrid algorithms. For symmetric positive definite problems, the convergence theory of two-grid methods with exact solution of the Galerkin coarse-grid system is mature, and the convergence factor of exact two-grid methods can be characterized by an identity. Compared with the exact case, the convergence theory of inexact two-grid methods (i.e., the coarse-grid system is solved approximately) is of more practical significance, while it is still less developed in the literature (one reason is that the error propagation matrix of inexact coarse-grid correction is not a projection). In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for the convergence analysis of inexact two-grid methods. More specifically, we present two-sided bounds for the energy norm of the error propagation matrix of inexact two-grid methods, from which one can readily obtain the identity for exact two-grid convergence. As an application, we establish a unified convergence theory for multigrid methods, which allows the coarsest-grid system to be solved approximately.},

One main difficulty here is to handle shock solutions involving the product of the velocity by pressure gradients. We develop a second order numerical scheme by using a discrete BGK relaxation model. The second order extension is based on a subdivision of each cartesian cell into four triangles to perform affine reconstructions of the solution. Such ideas have been developed in the literature for systems of conservation laws. We show here how they can be used in our nonconservative setting. The numerical method is implemented and tested in the last part of the paper.},

  abstract     = {We adopt the integral definition of the fractional Laplace operator and analyze an optimal control problem for a fractional semilinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE); control constraints are also considered. We establish the well-posedness of fractional semilinear elliptic PDEs and analyze regularity properties and suitable finite element discretizations. Within the setting of our optimal control problem, we derive the existence of optimal solutions as well as first and second order optimality conditions; regularity estimates for the optimal variables are also analyzed. We devise a fully discrete scheme that approximates the control variable with piecewise constant functions; the state and adjoint equations are discretized with continuous piecewise linear finite elements. We analyze convergence properties of discretizations and derive a priori error estimates.},
