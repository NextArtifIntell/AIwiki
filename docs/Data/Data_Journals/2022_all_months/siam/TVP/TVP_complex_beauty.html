Vacations in service can mean either a complete shutdown of the server or a transition to a different regime. If, during a vacation, the number of customers in the system reaches a certain fixed threshold, the vacation terminates and the unit resumes standard operations. A delay begins if the system is free from customers after a vacation; the delay interrupts at the moment of arrival of the first customer. Then a new vacation begins if no customers have arrived. The input of the queue outside vacations is a Poisson flow, and the remaining variables, which control the performance of the system (the service time, the durations of vacations and delays) have arbitrary distributions. A stationary distribution for the number of customers in the system is determined under the assumption that the process controlling the number of customers in the system during the vacation and the planned duration of the vacation are independent.

Here, when the limit ratio of the level and logarithm of tree size is zero, we present the asymptotic expectations, variances, and covariance of the protected node profile and the nonprotected node profile in random recursive trees.

In this paper, we establish some general results on the rates of normal approximation, which include the corresponding ones of Wang and Hu. The rate can be as high as $O(n^{-1/5})$ or $O(n^{-1/4}\log^{1/2} n)$ under some suitable conditions. As applications, we obtain the Berry--Esseen bounds of sample quantiles based on $\rho$-mixing random samples. Finally, we also present some numerical simulations to demonstrate finite sample performances of the theoretical result.},

In each fight, the winning probability of a gladiator is proportional to its strength (the amount of resources). Each player tries to distribute resources in order to maximize the winning probability. We consider the games in which a stronger team has a sufficiently large number of gladiators. For such games, we describe the Nash equilibria, present formulas for evaluation of boundaries between optimal strategy profiles, and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the boundaries.},

  abstract     = {The paper continues the author&#39;s long-term studies on extremes of random particle scores in branching processes. It is assumed that multiplication of particles is described by an immortal supercritical discrete-time branching process, the particle scores are dependent due to general heredity, and this dependence is a function of the degree of their relationship. The case of heavy-tail distributions of scores is considered. The max-linear model for scores formation is used. We evaluate the limit probabilities of the current generation superiority to the previous generation or all previous generations, in terms of maxima of particle scores.},

In the former case, the log-likelihood ratio converges to 0. In the latter case, the log-likelihood ratio has atypical limit distributions, which depend on the contiguity orders. The contiguity orders corresponding to the variances of random effects and disturbances can be equal to or greater than one, respectively, and that corresponding to the grand mean can be equal to or greater than one half. Consequently, we cannot use the ordinary optimal theory based on the LAN property. Meanwhile, the test based on the log-likelihood ratio is shown to be asymptotically most powerful with the benefit of the classical Neymann--Pearson framework.},

Next, we focus on the general (not necessarily stationary) case for which we prove an intertwining relation between Hua--Pickrell diffusions corresponding to different sets of parameters. Using the Cauchy beta integral on the one hand and Girsanov&#39;s theorem on the other hand, we discuss the connection between the stationary and general cases. Afterwards, we prove our main result providing novel integral representations of the Hua--Pickrell semigroup density, answering a question raised by Alili, Matsumoto, and Shiraishi [Séminaire de Probabilités XXXV, Lecture Notes in Math. 1755, Springer, 2001, pp. 396--415]. To this end, we appeal to the semigroup density of the Maass Laplacian and extend it to purely imaginary values of the magnetic field. In the last section, we use the Karlin--McGregor formula to derive an expression of the semigroup density of the multidimensional Hua--Pickrell particle system introduced by T. Assiotis.},

The distribution of the first exit point of such a process from an arbitrary domain of its values is determined, as a function of the initial point of the process, by an elliptic second-order differential equation, and corresponds to the solution of the Dirichlet problem for this equation (the case of nonconstant coefficients). We examine the distribution density of the first exit point of the process from the small circular neighborhood of its initial point and study its relation to the Dirichlet problem. In terms of this asymptotics, we prove two theorems, which provide sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for the distribution of the first exit point, as a function of the initial point of the process, to satisfy a certain second-order elliptic differential equation corresponding to the standard Wiener process with drift and break. The removable second-order terms of the expansion in powers of the radius of the small circular neighborhood of the initial point of the process are identified. In terms of the removable terms, these two theorems are combined as a single theorem giving a necessary and sufficient condition for correspondence to this Wiener process.},

The thread of the article is the role which the Galton--Watson process had played in the author&#39;s own research. We start with a discussion on a controlled Galton--Watson process. Then we pass to random absorbing processes, and also recall and discuss a problem in medicine. Further questions bring us, via the Borel--Cantelli lemma, to $\varphi$-branching processes and extensions. To gain more generality we then look at bisexual Galton--Watson processes. Finally, we briefly discuss relatively complicated resource-dependent branching processes to show that, again, using Galton--Watson reproduction schemes (whenever reasonable) can be a convincing approach to new processes, which are then sufficiently tractable to obtain results of interest.},

The literature already provides several proofs using variants of Stein&#39;s method. The characteristic function method has also been applied but led only to weaker results. In this paper, we show how to overcome the difficulties of this method by using a new identity for permanents of complex matrices in combination with a recently proved inequality for the characteristic function of the approximated distribution.},

It was shown by Jordan, Kinderlehrer, and Otto that, for diffusions of Langevin--Smoluchowski type, the Fokker--Planck probability density flow maximizes the rate of relative entropy dissipation, as measured by the distance traveled in the ambient space of probability measures with finite second moments, in terms of the quadratic Wasserstein metric. We obtain novel, stochastic-process versions of these features, valid along almost every trajectory of the diffusive motion in the backwards direction of time, using a very direct perturbation analysis. By averaging our trajectorial results with respect to the underlying measure on path space, we establish the maximal rate of entropy dissipation along the Fokker--Planck flow and measure exactly the deviation from this maximum that corresponds to any given perturbation. A bonus of our trajectorial approach is that it derives the HWI inequality relating relative entropy (H), Wasserstein distance (W), and relative Fisher information (I).},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the structure of solutions to Kolmogorov&#39;s equations for nonhomogeneous jump Markov processes and applications of these results to control of jump stochastic systems. These equations were studied by Feller [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 48 (1940), pp. 488--515], who clarified in 1945 in the errata to that paper that some of its results covered only nonexplosive Markov processes. In this work, which is largely of a survey nature, the case of explosive processes is also considered. This paper is based on the invited talk presented by the authors at the conference “P. L. Chebyshev -- 200,” and it describes the results of their joint studies with Manasa Mandava (1984--2019).},

In this paper, which is partially a review to some extent, we consider generalization of the exponential Chebyshev-type inequalities $\mathbf{P}(S_n\geq\alpha n)\leq\exp{-n\Lambda(\alpha)}$, $\alpha\geq\mathbf{E}\xi$, for the following three cases: I. Sums of random vectors, II. stochastic processes (the trajectories of random walks), and III. random fields associated with Erd\Hos--Rényi graphs with weights. It is shown that these generalized Chebyshev-type inequalities enable one to get exponentially unimprovable upper bounds for the probabilities to hit convex sets and also to prove the large deviation principles for objects mentioned in I--III.},

We give estimates for measures of sets of large and small values, estimates of distances in total variation norm between distributions of polynomials, and results on membership of such distributions in Nikolskii--Besov classes of fractional differentiability. New results are obtained on weak convergence of measures given by polynomial densities with respect to Gaussian measures.},
