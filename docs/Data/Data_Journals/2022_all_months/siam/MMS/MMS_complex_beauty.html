  abstract     = {Abstract. Small-scale features of shallow water flow obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) with two different computational codes for the shallow water equations are gathered offline and subsequently employed with the aim of constructing a reduced-order correction. This is used to facilitate high-fidelity online flow predictions at much reduced costs on coarse meshes. The resolved small-scale features at high resolution represent subgrid properties for the coarse representation. Measurements of the subgrid dynamics are obtained as the difference between the evolution of a coarse grid solution and the corresponding DNS result. The measurements are sensitive to the particular numerical methods used for the simulation on coarse computational grids and can be used to approximately correct the associated discretization errors. The subgrid features are decomposed into empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), after which a corresponding correction term is constructed. By increasing the number of EOFs in the approximation of the measured values the correction term can in principle be made arbitrarily accurate. Both computational methods investigated here show a significant decrease in the simulation error already when applying the correction based on the dominant EOFs only. The error reduction accounts for the particular discretization errors that are incurred and are hence specific to the particular simulation method that is adopted. This improvement is also observed for very coarse grids, which may be used for computational model reduction in geophysical and turbulent flow problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) for single phase compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. We follow the major steps of the GMsFEM to construct a permeability dependent offline basis for fast coarse-grid simulation. The offline coarse space is efficiently constructed only once based on the initial permeability field with parallel computing. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for two types of snapshot spaces. The analysis indicates that the convergence rates of the proposed multiscale method depend on the coarse meshsize and the eigenvalue decay of the local spectral problem. To further increase the accuracy of the multiscale method, a residual driven online multiscale basis is added to the offline space. The construction of an online multiscale basis is based on a carefully designed error indicator motivated by the analysis. We find that an online basis is particularly important for the singular source. Rich numerical tests on typical 3D highly heterogeneous media are presented to demonstrate the impressive computational advantages of the proposed multiscale method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This study constructs a new diffuse-domain (DD) lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for two-phase flows in complex geometries. We first coupled the DD method with the consistent and conservative phase-field (CCPF) method which can be described by the DD-CC Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard (NSCH) equations with the consistency of reduction, the consistency of mass and momentum transport, and the consistency of mass conservation. Then we conducted a matched asymptotic analysis and found that the DD-CCNSCH equations would converge to the CCNSCH equations as the thickness of the DD interface approaches to zero. Since the boundary conditions imposed on the complex geometries are incorporated into the DD-CCNSCH equations as the source terms, the system can be implemented more readily in a large and regular domain, and there is no need to treat the complex boundary conditions specially. We further developed a DD-CCPFLB method, and through the Chapman–Enskog analysis, the DD-CCPFLB method can correctly recover the DD-CCNSCH equations for two-phase flows in complex geometries. To quantitatively validate the DD-CCPFLB method, three benchmark problems are considered, and the numerical results are in agreement with those obtained through directly solving the CCNSCH equations combined with the original boundary conditions, the analytical solution, or the reported data. Finally, the present method is used to study the problems of two-phase flows in complex geometries, including the droplet dynamics in the Y-shaped channel and a droplet passing through cylindrical obstacles. The effects of the wettability and viscosity ratio are mainly investigated, and it is found that these two factors have significant impacts on the droplet dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Triadic closure describes the tendency for new friendships to form between individuals who already have friends in common. It has been argued heuristically that the triadic closure effect can lead to bistability in the formation of large-scale social interaction networks. Here, depending on the initial state and the transient dynamics, the system may evolve towards either of two long-time states. In this work, we propose and study a hierarchy of network evolution models that incorporate triadic closure, building on the work of Grindrod, Higham, and Parsons [Internet Math., 8 (2012), pp. 402–423]. We use a chemical kinetics framework, paying careful attention to the reaction rate scaling with respect to the system size. In a macroscale regime, we show rigorously that a bimodal steady state distribution is admitted. This behavior corresponds to the existence of two distinct stable fixed points in a deterministic mean-field ODE. The macroscale model is also seen to capture an apparent metastability property of the microscale system. Computational simulations are used to support the analysis.},

The proposed method is an attempt to develop the homogenization technique for the nonstationary Stokes system on noncylindrical domains. To resolve the uniform bound of solutions with respect to heterogeneous parameters, we transform the system into a reference domain and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness in the reference domain. In order to homogenize the velocity and pressure in the reference domain, two-scale convergence is employed. In contrast to all other available homogenization techniques, the one presented in this work is easily adaptable to evolving domains. We also establish error estimates for the homogenized system approximation by transforming the system into its initial configuration.},

The distinguishing characteristic of the new, rough LE state is that the ensemble average of single lattice site observables do not vary smoothly across lattice sites. We investigate numerically and analytically how the rough LE state affects the convergence mechanism via three key limits, and we show that by comparison more standard, “smooth” LE states satisfy stronger versions of these limits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the problem of determining the arrival statistics of unbiased planar random walkers to complex target configurations. In contrast to problems posed in finite domains, simple moments of the first passage time distribution, such as its mean and variance, are not defined. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the full arrival statistics. We describe several methods to obtain these distributions and other associated quantities such as splitting probabilities. One approach combines a Laplace transform of the underlying parabolic equation with matched asymptotic analysis followed by numerical transform inversion. The second approach is similar but uses a boundary integral equation method to solve for the transformed variable. To validate the results of this theory, and to obtain the arrival time statistics in very general configurations of absorbers, we introduce an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that describes trajectories as a combination of large but exactly solvable projection steps. The effectiveness of these methodologies is demonstrated on a variety of challenging examples highlighting the applicability of these methods to a variety of practical scenarios, such as source inference. A particularly useful finding arising from these results is that homogenization theories, in which complex configurations are replaced by equivalent simple ones, are remarkably effective at describing arrival time statistics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Data-driven stochastic parameterization methods use observational data to support and improve existing prediction systems. Specifically in atmospheric sciences, uncertainty in observations is a challenge for modeling because several aspects of the physical processes are yet to be understood in some contexts. A key goal in constructing atmospheric models is to express unresolved processes using the resolved variables of a prediction system. Estimating parameterisations for highly nonlinear systems with non stationary data requires application-specific tools. Previous work on methods for analyzing nonstationary data presents a flexible model-based nonparametric clustering methodology that can be exploited for parameterization development. This paper adapts the existing framework for stochastic parameterization by combining the continuous-time formulation of stochastic differential equations (SDE) with the clustering method. We use a closed-form likelihood function approach based on a suitable Hermite expansion to approximate the parameter values of the SDE with arbitrary nonlinear drift and nonlinear diffusion. The novel parameterization framework provides a smooth classification function that allows us to recover the underlying temporal parameter modulation of a nonstationary one-dimensional SDE. The numerical examples show that the clustering approach recovers a hidden functional relationship between the parameters of the SDE model and an additional auxiliary process. The study builds upon this functional relationship to develop closed-form, nonstationary, data-driven stochastic models for multiscale dynamical systems in real-world applications.},

As a result, WideBNet is efficient: it requires fewer training points than off-the-shelf architectures and has stable training dynamics which are compatible with standard weight initialization strategies. The architecture automatically adapts to the dimensions of the data with only a few hyper-parameters that the user must specify. WideBNet is able to produce images that are competitive with optimization-based approaches, but at a fraction of the cost, and we also demonstrate numerically that it learns to super-resolve scatterers with a full aperture configuration.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Adaptive Galerkin methods for time-dependent partial differential equations are studied and shown to be dissipative. The adaptation implies that the subset of the selected basis function changes over time according to the evolution of the solution. The corresponding projection operator is thus time-dependent and nondifferentiable. We therefore propose to use an integral formulation in time. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of this weak form of the dynamical Galerkin scheme, and we then prove that the nonsmooth projection operator introduces energy dissipation, which is a crucial result for adaptive Galerkin methods, e.g., adaptive wavelet methods. Numerical examples for the inviscid Burgers equation in one dimension and the incompressible Euler equations in two and three spatial dimensions show that the selection of basis functions, for instance by filtering out weak wavelet coefficients from the solution, introduces energy dissipation. Moreover, for the Burgers case we can show that adaptive wavelet regularization yields convergence of the truncated Galerkin solution to the physically relevant entropy solution. These results motivate adaptive wavelet-based Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, an online multiscale model reduction method is presented for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise, where the diffusion coefficient is spatially multiscale and the noise perturbation nonlinearly depends on the diffusion dynamics. It is necessary to efficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for quantifying a model’s uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion and nonlinearity may cause the computation to become very intractable. To overcome the multiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and obtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still defined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is applied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts the simulation efficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity. The stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots. The offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of the stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The online snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are used to correct the offline reduced model in an incremental manner. The stochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear dynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model. Thus, the online multiscale model reduction is constructed by using CEM-GMsFEM and the stochastic online DEIM. A priori error analysis is carried out for the nonlinear SPDEs. We present a few numerical examples with diffusion in heterogeneous porous media and show the effectiveness of the proposed model reduction.},

It describes the motion of a suspension of rigid rod-like particles under the influence of gravity. Since the coupled system is high dimensional (five dimensions plus time) we are interested in the derivation of models which can adaptively adjust the level of detail. Here we restrict ourselves to simplified lower dimensional flow situations and derive hierarchies of moment equations which can be interpreted as approximations of the coupled kinetic model. We show that the resulting systems of moment equations are hyperbolic.},

First, an integral representation of the solution is sought, which enables us to exploit the explicit dependence with respect to the small parameter to predict the correct form of a two-scale ansatz. Second, the terms of the ansatz are characterized by the method of compound asymptotic expansions as the solutions of a cascade of successive interior and exterior domains. This allows us to interpret them as high-order correctors, for which error bounds can be proved using variational estimates. The methodology is illustrated on two different problems: we start by revisiting the perforated Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on both the hole and the outer boundary, where we highlight how the method enables us to retrieve very naturally the correct form of the ansatz in the most delicate two-dimensional setting. Then, we provide original and complete asymptotic expansions for a perforated cell problem featuring periodic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a higher order phase averaging method for nonlinear oscillatory systems. Phase averaging is a technique to filter fast motions from the dynamics while still accounting for their effect on the slow dynamics. Phase averaging is useful for deriving reduced models that can be solved numerically with more efficiency, since larger timesteps can be taken. Recently, Haut and Wingate [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 36 (2014) pp. A693–A713] introduced the idea of computing finite window numerical phase averages in parallel as the basis for a coarse propagator for a parallel-in-time algorithm. In this contribution, we provide a framework for higher order phase averages that aims to better approximate the unaveraged system while still filtering fast motions. While the basic phase average assumes that the solution is independent of changes of phase, the higher order method expands the phase dependency in a basis which the equations are projected onto. In this new framework, the original numerical phase averaging formulation arises as the lowest order version of this expansion in which the nonlinearity is projected onto the space of functions that are independent of the phase. Our new projection onto functions that are th degree polynomials in the phase gives rise to higher order corrections to the phase averaging formulation. We illustrate the properties of this method on an ODE that describes the dynamics of a swinging spring due to Lynch (2002). Although idealized, this model shows an interesting analogy to geophysical flows as it exhibits a slow dynamics that arises through the resonance between fast oscillations. On this example, we show convergence to the nonaveraged (exact) solution with increasing approximation order also for finite averaging windows. At zeroth order, our method coincides with a standard phase average, but at higher order it is more accurate in the sense that solutions of the phase averaged model track the solutions of the unaveraged equations more accurately.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Homogenization in terms of multiscale limits transforms a multiscale problem with asymptotically separated microscales posed on a physical domain into a one-scale problem posed on a product domain of dimension by introducing so-called fast variables. This procedure allows one to convert scales in physical dimensions into a single-scale structure in dimensions. We prove here that both the original, physical multiscale problem and the corresponding high-dimensional, one-scale limiting problem can be efficiently treated numerically with the recently developed quantized tensor-train finite-element method (QTT-FEM). The QTT-FE approximation consists in restricting approximation and computation to sequences of nested subspaces, each of which is a tensor product of two factors of low dimension (rank), within a vast, but generic “virtual” (background) discretization space. In practice, these subspaces are determined iteratively and data-adaptively at runtime bypassing any “offline precomputation.” For theoretical analysis, low-dimensional subspaces are constructed analytically to bound the tensor ranks against the error tolerance. We consider a model linear elliptic multiscale problem in several physical dimensions and show, theoretically and experimentally, that both (i) the solution of the associated high-dimensional one-scale problem and (ii) the approximation to the solution of the multiscale problem induced thereby admit efficient QTT-FE approximations. These problems can therefore be numerically solved in a scale-robust fashion by standard (low-order) PDE discretizations combined with state-of-the-art general-purpose solvers for tensor-structured linear systems. Specifically, we prove the existence of QTT-FE approximations with an upper bound on the tensor ranks growing no faster than algebraically with respect to and independent of the scale parameters, where is the target accuracy for the approximation of the solution and of its gradient. In numerical experiments, we verify the theoretical rank bounds and computationally investigate the dependence of the complexity of the solutions on the number of microscales.},

We present a space-time multiscale method for a parabolic model problem with an underlying coefficient that may be highly oscillatory with respect to both the spatial and the temporal variables. The method is based on the framework of the variational multiscale method in the context of a space-time formulation and computes a coarse-scale representation of the differential operator that is enriched by auxiliary space-time corrector functions. Once computed, the coarse-scale representation allows us to efficiently obtain well-approximating discrete solutions for multiple right-hand sides. We prove first-order convergence independently of the oscillation scales in the coefficient and illustrate how the space-time correctors decay exponentially in both space and time, making it possible to localize the corresponding computations. This localization allows us to define a practical and computationally efficient method in terms of complexity and memory, for which we provide a posteriori error estimates and present numerical examples.},

The method merges the concepts of LOD and operator-adapted wavelets (gamblets) and proves its applicability for a class of complex-valued, non-hermitian, and indefinite problems. It computes hierarchical bases that block-diagonalize the Helmholtz operator and thereby decouples the discretization scales. Sparsity is preserved by a novel localization strategy that improves stability properties even in the elliptic case. We present a rigorous stability and a priori error analysis of the proposed method for homogeneous media. In addition, we investigate the fast solvability of the blocks by a standard iterative method. A sequence of numerical experiments illustrates the sharpness of the theoretical findings and demonstrates the applicability to scattering problems in heterogeneous media.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse learning algorithm that can be applied to learn the physical processes and obtain a sparse representation of the solution given a large snapshot space. Assume that there is a rich class of precomputed basis functions that can be used to approximate the quantity of interest. For instance, in the simulation of a multiscale flow system, one can adopt mixed multiscale methods to compute velocity bases from local problems and apply the proper orthogonal decomposition method to construct bases for the saturation equation. We then design a neural network architecture to learn the coefficients of solutions in the spaces which are spanned by these basis functions. The information of the basis functions is incorporated in the loss function, which minimizes the differences between the downscaled reduced order solutions and reference solutions at multiple time steps. The network contains multiple submodules and the solutions at different time steps can be learned simultaneously. We propose some strategies in the learning framework to identify important degrees of freedom. To find a sparse solution representation, a soft-thresholding operator is applied to enforce the sparsity of the output coefficient vectors of the neural network. To avoid oversimplification and enrich the approximation space, some degrees of freedom can be added back to the systems through a greedy algorithm. In both scenarios, that is, removing and adding degrees of freedom, the corresponding network connections are pruned or reactivated guided by the magnitude of the solution coefficients obtained from the network outputs. The proposed adaptive learning process is applied to some toy case examples to demonstrate that it can achieve a good basis selection and accurate approximation. More numerical tests are successfully performed on two-phase multiscale flow problems to show the capability and interpretability of the proposed method on complicated applications.},

Essentially, only the first order homogenized model globally in time can be derived. To achieve a high-order method, we have to adopt a numerical approach in the framework of the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM). By a successively refined microscopic solver, the accuracy improvement up to arbitrary order is attained providing input data smooth enough. Based on the formulation of the high-order microscopic solver we derived, an iterative formula to calculate the microscopic solver is then proposed. Using the iterative formula, we develop an implementation of the method in an efficient way for practical applications.

  abstract     = {We propose local space-time approximation spaces for parabolic problems that are optimal in the sense of Kolmogorov and may be employed in multiscale and domain decomposition methods. The diffusion coefficient can be arbitrarily rough in space and time. To construct local approximation spaces we consider a compact transfer operator that acts on the space of local solutions and covers the full time dimension. The optimal local spaces are then given by the left singular vectors of the transfer operator. To prove compactness of the latter we combine a suitable parabolic Caccioppoli inequality with the compactness theorem of Aubin--Lions. In contrast to the elliptic setting [I. Babuška and R. Lipton, Multiscale Model. Simul., 9 (2011), pp. 373--406] we need an additional regularity result to combine the two results. Furthermore, we employ the generalized finite element method to couple local spaces and construct an approximation of the global solution. Since our approach yields reduced space-time bases, the computation of the global approximation does not require a time stepping method and is thus computationally efficient. Moreover, we derive rigorous local and global a priori error bounds. In detail, we bound the global approximation error in a graph norm by the local errors in the $L^2(H^1)$-norm, noting that the space the transfer operator maps to is equipped with this norm. Numerical experiments demonstrate an exponential decay of the singular values of the transfer operator and the local and global approximation errors for problems with high contrast or multiscale structure regarding space and time.},

Further, the method is particularly promising for nonlinear eigenvalue problems in electronic structure calculations as it shall reduce the cost of early iterations in self-consistent algorithms.

However, when accounting for stochasticity in the internal dynamics of agents, these models frequently become computationally expensive. Traditional techniques to reduce the computational intensity of such models can lead to a reduction in the richness of the dynamics observed, compared to the original system. Here we use large deviation theory to decrease the computational cost of a spatially extended multiagent stochastic system with a region of multistability by coarse-graining it to a continuous time Markov chain on the state space of stable steady states of the original system. Our technique preserves the original description of the stable steady states of the system and accounts for noise-induced transitions between them. We apply the method to a bistable system modeling phenotype specification of cells driven by a lateral inhibition mechanism. For this system, we demonstrate how the method may be used to explore different pattern configurations and unveil robust patterns emerging on longer timescales. We then compare the full stochastic, coarse-grained, and mean-field descriptions via pattern quantification metrics and in terms of the numerical cost of each method. Our results show that the coarse-grained system exhibits the lowest computational cost while preserving the rich dynamics of the stochastic system. The method has the potential to reduce the computational complexity of hybrid multiscale models, making them more tractable for analysis, simulation, and hypothesis testing.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses the consistency and algorithm for semiconductor Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs) with multivalley arising from the modeling of the carrier transport in semiconductor materials and devices. A direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the BTEs with the space nonhomogeneous and the nonlinear collision terms is presented. The new results obtained in this paper are as follows. First, some theoretical results such as the consistency between the solution of the BTEs and a Markov process, the invariant measure, and the well-posedness for the solution of the BTEs are proved. Second, a DSMC algorithm and the convergence results are proposed. Third, some numerical results are carried out to validate the theoretical results of this paper. Finally, the typical applications for some semiconductor materials and devices such as GaAs and graphene are advanced.},

  abstract     = {In composite materials composed of a soft polymer matrix and rigid, high aspect-ratio particles, the composite undergoes a transition in mechanical strength when the incorporated particle phase surpasses a critical density. This phenomenon, termed rheological percolation, is well known to occur in many polymer-rod and polymer-platelet composites at a critical density that exceeds the conductivity percolation threshold (which occurs when the conducting particles form a large connected component that spans the composite). Contact percolation in rod-like composites has been routinely exploited to engineer thermal or electrical conductivity in otherwise nonconducting polymers, and the characterization of contact percolation is well established. Mechanical or rheological percolation, however, has evaded a complete theoretical explanation and predictive description. A natural hypothesis is that rheological percolation is due to a rigidity phenomenon, whereby a large rigid component of inclusions spans the composite. Here we build an algorithm to detect the rigidity percolation threshold in rod-polymer composites. We model the composites as systems of randomly distributed, soft-core (intersecting at contact) rods and study the emergence of a giant (i.e., spanning) rigid component. Building on our previous results for two-dimensional composites, we develop an approximate algorithm that identifies spanning rigid components through hierarchically identifying and compressing provably rigid motifs---equivalently, decomposing a giant rigid component into rigid assemblies of a hierarchy of successively smaller rigid components. We apply this algorithm to random monodisperse systems that are generated in Monte Carlo simulations to estimate a rigidity percolation threshold (critical density) and explore its dependence on rod aspect ratio. We show that this transition point---like its contact percolation analogue---scales inversely with the excluded volume of a rod. Moreover, this implies that the critical contact number (i.e., the number of contacts per rod at the rigidity percolation threshold) is constant for aspect ratios above some relatively low value and is lower than the prediction from Maxwell&#39;s isostatic condition.},

  abstract     = {Metastability is a formidable challenge to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In this paper we present methods for algorithm design to meet this challenge. The design problem we consider is temperature selection for the infinite swapping scheme, which is the limit of the widely used parallel tempering scheme obtained when the swap rate tends to infinity. We use a recently developed tool for the analysis of the empirical measure of a small noise diffusion to transform the variance reduction problem into an explicit optimization problem. Our first analysis of the optimization problem is in the setting of a double-well model, and it shows that the optimal selection of temperature ratios is a geometric sequence except possibly the highest temperature. In the same setting we identify two different sources of variance reduction and show how their competition determines the optimal highest temperature. In the general multiwell setting we prove that the same geometric sequence of temperature ratios as in the two-well case is always nearly optimal, with a performance gap that decays geometrically in the number of temperatures.},

  abstract     = {There is an intimate connection between numerical upscaling of multiscale PDEs and scattered data approximation of heterogeneous functions: the coarse variables selected for deriving an upscaled equation (in the former) correspond to the sampled information used for approximation (in the latter). As such, both problems can be thought of as recovering a target function based on some coarse data that are either artificially chosen by an upscaling algorithm or determined by some physical measurement process. The purpose of this paper is then to study, under such a setup and for a specific elliptic problem, how the lengthscale of the coarse data, which we refer to as the subsampled lengthscale, influences the accuracy of recovery, given limited computational budgets. Our analysis and experiments identify that reducing the subsampling lengthscale may improve the accuracy, implying a guiding criterion for coarse-graining or data acquisition in this computationally constrained scenario, especially leading to direct insights for the implementation of the Gamblets method in the numerical homogenization literature. Moreover, reducing the lengthscale to zero may lead to a blow-up of approximation error if the target function does not have enough regularity, suggesting the need for a stronger prior assumption on the target function to be approximated. We introduce a singular weight function to deal with it, both theoretically and numerically. This work sheds light on the interplay of the lengthscale of coarse data, the computational costs, the regularity of the target function, and the accuracy of approximations and numerical simulations.},

The NLDE involves a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon\in (0, 1]$, and its solution is highly oscillatory in time with wavelength $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in the nonrelativistic regime. To gain uniform accuracies in time, the NPI method employs an operator decomposition technique for explicitly separating the highly oscillatory phases and utilizes exponential wave integrators for the time integrals. Moreover, with the help of nested Picard iterations, the NPI method could easily achieve uniform first- and second-order accuracies.},

Numerical experiments illustrate the importance of the proposed asymptotic preserving schemes for several examples. In addition, in the averaging regime, error estimates are obtained, and the proposed scheme is proved to be uniformly accurate.},

We are interested in front speed enhancement in G-equation of turbulent combustion by large intensity ABC and Kolmogorov flows. First, we give a quantitative construction of the ballistic orbits of ABC and Kolmogorov flows, namely, those with maximal large time asymptotic speeds in a coordinate direction. Thanks to the optimal control theory of G-equation (a convex but noncoercive Hamilton--Jacobi equation), the ballistic orbits serve as admissible trajectories for front speed estimates. To study the tightness of the estimates, we compute front speeds of G-equation based on a semi-Lagrangian scheme with Strang splitting and weighted essentially nonoscillatory interpolation. The Semi-Lagrangian scheme is stable when the ratio of time step and spatial grid size is smaller than a positive constant independent of the flow intensity. Numerical results show that the front speed growth rate in terms of the flow intensity may approach the analytical bounds from the ballistic orbits.},

Anal., 126 (2021), pp. 129--155], we have studied the homogenization of the Poisson equation in a class of non-periodically perforated domains. In this paper, we examine the case of the Stokes system. We consider a porous medium in which the characteristic distance between two holes, denoted by $\varepsilon$, is proportional to the characteristic size of the holes. It is well known (see [G. Allaire, Asymptot. Anal., 2 (1989), pp. 203--222; E. Sanchez-Palencia, in Non-Homogeneous Media and Vibration Theory, Springer, New York, 1980, pp. 129--157; L. Tartar, in Non-Homogeneous Media and Vibration Theory, Springer, New York, 1980, Appendix]) that, when the holes are periodically distributed in space, the velocity converges to a limit given by Darcy&#39;s law when the size of the holes tends to zero. We generalize these results to the setting of [X. Blanc and S. Wolf, Asymptot. Anal., 126 (2021), pp. 129--155]. The nonperiodic domains are defined as a local perturbation of a periodic distribution of holes. We obtain classical results of the homogenization theory in perforated domains (existence of correctors and regularity estimates uniform in $\varepsilon$) and we prove $H^2$-convergence estimates for particular force fields.},

A cost-efficient approximation of the correctors is obtained using a method designed to exploit quasi-periodicity. Accuracy and cost reduction are investigated for local perturbations or small transformations of periodic materials as well as for materials with no periodicity but a mesoscopic structure, for which the limitations of the method are shown. Finally, for materials outside the scope of this method, we propose to use the approximation of homogenized quantities as control variates for variance reduction of a more accurate and costly Monte Carlo estimator (using a multifidelity Monte Carlo method). The resulting cost reduction is illustrated in a numerical experiment and compared with a control variate method from weakly stochastic homogenization. The limits of this variance reduction technique are tested on materials without periodicity or mesoscopic structure.},
