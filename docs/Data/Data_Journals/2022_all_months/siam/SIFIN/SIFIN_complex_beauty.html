We investigate the stability of the equilibrium-induced optimal value in a one-dimensional diffusion setting for a time-inconsistent stopping problem under nonexponential discounting.

With equilibria extended to -equilibria, we establish the relaxed continuity of the optimal value.},

  abstract     = {Using the exponential generating function of Hermite polynomials, we expand the prices of VIX power payoffs (including VIX futures) in various Bergomi models at any order in the volatility-of-volatility. We introduce the notion of volatility of the VIX squared implied by a VIX power payoff, which we call “implied VIX$^2$ volatility” and also expand at any order. We cover the one-factor and (skewed) two-factor Bergomi models and allow for maturity-dependent and/or time-dependent parameters. When the initial term-structure of variance swaps is flat, we provide the expansions up to order 8 in closed form; otherwise, they simply involve one-dimensional integrals, which are extremely fast to compute. Extensive numerical experiments show that the implied volatility expansion converges much faster than the price expansion and is extremely accurate for a wide range of model parameters, including typical market calibrating parameters with very large volatilities-of-volatility. It leads to new, simple approximation formulas for the price of a VIX power payoff that shed light on how those prices depend on model parameters. We combine the new expansion and the Bergomi--Guyon expansion of the vanilla smile [L. Bergomi and J. Guyon, Risk, May (2012), pp. 60--66] to calibrate the two-factor Bergomi model jointly to the term-structures of S&amp;P 500 at-the-money skew and VIX futures. Very interestingly, the joint fit selects (1) much larger values of volatility-of-volatility and mean reversion than those previously reported in [L. Bergomi, Risk, October (2005), pp. 67--73] and [L. Bergomi, Stochastic Volatility Modeling, CRC Press, 2016], and (2) fully correlated Brownian motions, thus producing a (Markovian) pure path-dependent volatility model with rough-like paths.},

The signature of a path of a stochastic process is a sequence of real numbers that provides a full description of the evolution of the process. The double-execution strategy maximizes the wealth (in units of the domestic currency) of an investor who liquidates a block of shares in a foreign stock market. Our approach is model agnostic because we do not specify the dynamics of the market. We prove that the optimal strategy is a linear combination of the terms in the expected signature of the market and employ high-frequency data from Nasdaq and for various currencies to compute the signature of the market. Data for 10 stocks and 4 currency pairs are employed to implement the strategy. Our results show that the performance of the signature-based double-execution strategy is superior than the performance of the benchmarks. In most cases, the outperformance increases further when the signature of the market is enhanced with the price dynamics of the SPY, a tracker of the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index.},

Our results have subtle implications for the field of robust finance. For instance, norm closures of bounded continuous functions with respect to the worst-case $L^p$-norm, as considered in the $G$-framework, lead to spaces which are lattice isomorphic to a sublattice of a classical $L^1$-space lacking, however, any form of order completeness. We further show that the topological spanning power of options is always limited under nondominated uncertainty.},

By means of dynamic programming, we solve the problem explicitly for power utilities. In a case study with Gaussian jumps, we find, for instance, that an investor may prefer to disinvest completely even after a mildly positive signal. Our setting also allows us to investigate whether, given the chance, it is better to improve signal quality or quantity and how much extra value can be generated from either choice.},

We measure the performance of the managers&#39; strategies via forward relative performance criteria, leading to the respective notions of forward best-response criterion and forward Nash equilibrium. The motivation to develop such criteria comes from the need to relax various crucial, but quite stringent for this problem, existing assumptions, such as the a priori choices of both the market model and the investment horizon, the commonality of the latter for both managers, as well as the full a priori knowledge of the competitor&#39;s policies for the best-response case. We focus on locally riskless criteria and deduce the random forward equations. We solve the CRRA cases and thus also extend the related results in the classical setting. An important by-product of the work herein is the development of forward performance criteria for investment problems in Itô-diffusion markets under the presence of correlated random endowment process for both the perfectly and incomplete market cases.},

We construct a model to investigate the long-term effect on the bank&#39;s revenue of deferring (escrowing) a trader&#39;s bonuses to facilitate clawback. We formulate the question by setting up an infinite-horizon dynamic programming model. Within this model, the trader&#39;s optimal investment and consumption strategy, with and without bonus escrow, can be expressed by explicit analytic formulas. These formulas enable calculation and comparison of the bank&#39;s total expected revenue under the two bonus payout schemes. The results of the comparison depend on the parameters describing the trader&#39;s risk appetite, the discount factor, and the bank&#39;s level of patience, in addition to the market parameters. In particular, when the bank&#39;s total expected discounted revenue is finite under both types of bonus payment schemes and the bank is sufficiently patient, the bank benefits by escrowing the trader&#39;s bonus, although not escrowing the trader&#39;s bonus brings better short-term revenue.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a model to study the impact of path-dependent reference points on optimal trading strategies of a realization utility investor, where the reference points are initial purchase prices adjusted dynamically by subsequent paper gains and losses. By homogeneity, this optimal trading problem can be reformulated as a new one with a unique state variable $x$ (wealth-reference ratio), which can be solved analytically. Importantly, we find that the introduction of path-dependent reference points can generate two interesting effects: (a) a discount effect, i.e., a constant subjective discount factor in the original problem becomes stochastic in the new problem; and (b) a mean-reverting effect, i.e., the state variable $x$ follows a mean-reverting process. These two effects offset each other in the state of paper gain ($x&gt;1$) while getting reinforced in the state of paper loss ($x&lt;1$), leading to a disposition effect even if a subjective discount factor in the original problem is zero. Finally, the model can be easily extended to incorporate other factors such as asymmetric adaptation of reference points, jump risks in the underlying stocks, and liquidation shocks.},

We construct a broad class of forward performance processes with initial conditions of power mixture type, $u(x) = \int_{\mathbb{I}} \frac{x^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma }\nu(d \gamma)$. We proceed to define and fully characterize two-power mixture forward performance processes with constant risk aversion coefficients in the interval $(0,1)$, and derive properties of two-power mixture forward performance processes when the risk aversion coefficients are continuous stochastic processes. Finally, we discuss the problem of managing an investment pool of two investors, whose respective preferences evolve as power forward performance processes.},

  abstract     = {We present a robust version of the life-cycle optimal portfolio choice problem in the presence of labor income, as introduced in Biffis, Gozzi, and Prosdocimi [SIAM J. Control Optim., 58 (2020), pp. 1906--1938] and Dybvig and Liu [J. Econom. Theory, 145 (2010), pp. 885--907]. In particular, in Biffis, Gozzi, and Prosdocimi the influence of past wages on the future ones is modeled linearly in the evolution equation of labor income, through a given weight function. The optimization relies on the resolution of an infinite dimensional HJB equation. We improve the state of art in three ways. First, we allow the weight to be a Radon measure. This accommodates for more realistic weighting of the sticky wages, e.g., on a discrete temporal grid according to some periodic income. Second, there is a general correlation structure between labor income and stock markets. This naturally affects the optimal hedging demand, which may increase or decrease according to the correlation sign. Third, we allow the weight to change with time, possibly lacking perfect identification. The uncertainty is specified by a given set of Radon measures K, in which the weight process takes values. This renders the inevitable uncertainty on how the past affects the future, and includes the standard case of error bounds on a specific estimate for the weight. Under uncertainty averse preferences, the decision maker takes a maxmin approach to the problem. Our analysis confirms the intuition: in the infinite dimensional setting, the optimal policy remains the best investment strategy under the worst case weight.},

After studying continuity properties of the value function for general utility functions, we rely on the dynamic programming approach to solve the optimization problem for power utility investors including the empirically relevant and mathematically challenging case of relative risk aversion larger than one. For this, we argue that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. The homogeneity of the value function is then used to reduce the HJB equation by one dimension, which allows us to prove that the value function is even a classical solution thereof. Using this, an optimal strategy is derived and its asymptotic behavior in the large wealth regime is discussed.},

We assume the reinsurance premium is calculated according to the mean-conditional value-at-risk principle and impose the incentive compatibility constraint to rule out moral hazard. Under the objective of maximizing the exponential utility function, we obtain the optimal strategies in closed form via a “relaxation and modification” approach. The optimal contracts have more complicated structures than the standard proportional and excess-of-loss reinsurance widely investigated in the literature. In particular, we demonstrate that the insurer may optimally choose to purchase proportional reinsurance in different layers when the reinsurer is more pessimistic about the underlying loss. Our model lends support to the observation that reinsurance contracts in practice often involve proportional reinsurance in multiple layers. We also demonstrate that belief heterogeneity can explain the inverse relationship between the purchase of reinsurance and the size of the insurer&#39;s losses observed in the reinsurance market.},

This question is more specifically analyzed in the case of an investor having additional, inside information. In particular, we establish conditions when minimal martingale and supermartingale measures both fail to exist. These correspond to the case when the insider information includes some nonnull events that are perceived as having null probabilities by the uninformed market investors, even as they cannot observe them.

We focus on agents using power Constant Relative Risk Aversion type FPPs for their investment-consumption optimization problem under a common noise Merton market model. We solve both the many-player and mean field game providing closed-form expressions for the solutions where the limit of the former yields the latter. In our case, the FPP framework yields a continuum of solutions for the consumption component as indexed to a market parameter we coin “market-risk relative consumption preference.” The parameter permits the agent to set a preference for their consumption going forward in time that, in the competition case, reflects a common market behavior. We show the FPP framework, under both competition and no-competition, allows the agent to disentangle her risk-tolerance and elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) just like Epstein--Zin preferences under a recursive utility framework and unlike the classical utility theory one. This, in turn, allows a finer analysis on the agent&#39;s consumption “income” and “substitution” regimes, and, of independent interest, motivates a new strand of economics research on EIS under the FPP framework. We find that competition rescales the agent&#39;s perception of consumption in a nontrivial manner. We provide numerical illustrations of our results.},

When the investor aims to maximize the worst-case scenario of his/her consumption-investment objective, we propose a dual approach to the robust optimization problem in a dual economy with volatility ambiguity. Using the $G$-expectation framework, we establish the duality theorem to bridge between the primal problem with return ambiguity and the dual problem with volatility ambiguity, and hence characterize the robust strategy for a general class of utility functions subject to the nonnegative consumption rate and wealth constraints. The volatility ambiguity in the dual problem induces correlation ambiguity when the primal economy comprises multiple risky assets with return ambiguity. By analyzing the dual economy, we show that the robust investment strategy favors a sparse portfolio, in addition to its usual feature---having the least exposure to ambiguity.},

We show that the optimal exercise times for the holders are the first times at which the asset price reaches some lower or upper stochastic boundaries depending on the current values of its running maximum or minimum. The proof is based on the reduction of the original optimal stopping problems to the associated free-boundary problems and the solution of the latter problems by means of the smooth-fit and normal-reflection conditions.

This is mostly due to its tractability and the fact that it encompasses important examples, including entropic risk measures and average value-at-risk. In this work we consider stochastic optimal control problems where the objective criterion is given by an OCE risk measure or, in other words, a risk minimization problem for controlled diffusions. A major difficulty arises since OCEs are often time-inconsistent. Nevertheless, via an enlargement of state space we achieve a substitute of sorts for time-consistency in fair generality. This allows us to derive a dynamic programming principle and thus recover central results of (risk-neutral) stochastic control theory. In particular, we show that the value of our risk minimization problem can be characterized as a viscosity solution of a Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman--Isaacs equation. We further establish a comparison principle and uniqueness of the latter under suitable technical conditions.},

We quantify this property through the large-dimensional asymptotic analysis of a spike model with diverging top eigenvalue, comprising a rank-one matrix and a random matrix. We show that, in this limit, the top eigenvector of the correlation matrix is close to the vector of market betas divided componentwise by returns standard deviation. Historical returns data are generally consistent with this analysis of the correspondence between the top eigenportfolio and the market portfolio. We further examine this correspondence using eigenvectors obtained from hierarchically constructed tensors where stocks are separated into their respective industry sectors. This hierarchical approach results in a principal factor whose portfolio weights are all positive for a greater percentage of time compared to the weights of the vanilla eigenportfolio computed from the correlation matrix. Returns from hierarchical construction are also more robust with respect to the duration of the time window used for estimation. All principal eigenportfolios that we observe have returns that exceed those of the market portfolio between 1994 and 2020. We attribute these excess returns to the brief periods where short holdings are more than a small percentage of portfolio weight.},

First, we recover the classical result on portfolio optimization that shows that the expected logarithmic utility of the insider is strictly greater than that of the honest trader. Then, we prove that whenever the market is viable, the honest trader can get a higher logarithmic utility, and therefore more wealth, than the insider with a strictly positive probability. Our proof relies on the analysis of a sort of forward integral variant of the Doléans--Dade exponential process. The main financial conclusion is that the logarithmic utility is perhaps too conservative for some insiders.},

The main idea is to optimize over a family of rank-based portfolios parameterized by an exponentially concave function on the unit interval. This choice can be motivated by the long term stability of the capital distribution observed in large equity markets and allows us to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. The resulting optimization problem, which is convex, allows for various regularizations and constraints to be imposed on the generating function. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for our optimization problem and provide a stability estimate in terms of a Wasserstein metric of the input measure. Then we formulate a discretization which can be implemented numerically using available software packages and analyze its approximation error. Finally, we present empirical examples using CRSP data from the U.S. stock market, including the performance of the portfolios allowing for dividends, defaults, and transaction costs.},

We formulate this problem as minimization of a cost-risk functional over a class of absolutely continuous and signal-adaptive strategies. The stochastic control problem is solved by following a probabilistic and convex analytic approach. We show that the optimal trading strategy is given by a system of four coupled forward-backward SDEs, which can be solved explicitly. Our results reveal how the induced transient price distortion provides together with the predictive signal an additional predictor about future price changes. As a consequence, the optimal signal-adaptive trading rate trades off exploiting the predictive signal against incurring the transient displacement of the execution price from its unaffected level. This answers an open question from [C. A. Lehalle and E. Neuman, Finance Stoch., 23 (2019), pp. 275--311] as we show how to derive the unique optimal signal-adaptive liquidation strategy when price impact is not only temporary but also transient.},

To generate approximations for such problems in continuous time, we define a sequence of models in discrete time with a finite state space and a restricted class of utility functions for which the exact optimal strategy can be found. We prove that the graphs of optimal policies form a connected subset of two bundles of parallel lines in the plane and that the optimization problem can be reduced to a sequence of simple binary decisions. This allows us to avoid the search over real numbers that is required for every possible value of the state when finite difference schemes for the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations in continuous time are used. A very efficient calculation scheme is defined which generates the exact solutions for our discrete time approximations, and we use known results from the theory of viscosity solutions to give conditions which guarantee that a sequence of such approximations for a given problem in continuous time converges to the correct limit. We show in a number of examples how the method can be used to find indifference prices in incomplete markets and that our approach can outperform alternative methods that are based on finite difference schemes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, academics, regulators, and market practitioners have increasingly addressed liquidity issues. Among the numerous problems addressed, the optimal execution of large orders is probably the one that has attracted the most research works, mainly in the case of single-asset portfolios. In practice, however, optimal execution problems often involve large portfolios comprising numerous assets, and models should consequently account for risks at the portfolio level. In this paper, we address multi-asset optimal execution in a model where prices have multivariate Ornstein--Uhlenbeck dynamics and where the agent maximizes the expected (exponential) utility of her Profit and Loss (PnL). We use the tools of stochastic optimal control and simplify the initial multidimensional Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) involving a matrix Riccati ODE for which classical existence theorems do not apply. By using a priori estimates obtained thanks to optimal control tools, we nevertheless prove an existence and uniqueness result for the latter ODE and then deduce a verification theorem that provides a rigorous solution to the execution problem. Using examples based on data from the foreign exchange and stock markets, we eventually illustrate our results and discuss their implications for both optimal execution and statistical arbitrage.},

  abstract     = {We formulate an infinite-horizon optimal investment and consumption problem, in which an individual forms a habit based on the exponentially weighted average of her past consumption rate, and in which she invests in a Black--Scholes market. The individual is constrained to consume at a rate higher than a certain proportion $\alpha$ of her consumption habit. Our habit-formation model allows for both addictive ($\alpha=1$) and nonaddictive ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) habits. The optimal investment and consumption policies are derived explicitly in terms of the solution of a system of differential equations with free boundaries, which is analyzed in detail. If the wealth-to-habit ratio is below (resp., above) a critical level $x^*$, the individual consumes at (resp., above) the minimum rate and invests more (resp., less) aggressively in the risky asset. Numerical results show that the addictive habit formation requires significantly more wealth to support the same consumption rate compared to a moderately nonaddictive habit. Furthermore, an individual with a more addictive habit invests less in the risky asset compared to an individual with a less addictive habit but with the same wealth-to-habit ratio and risk aversion, which provides an explanation for the equity-premium puzzle.},

  abstract     = {Given an intertemporal optimization problem over a time interval $[t_0,T]$ and a control plan associated to it, we introduce the four notions of local and global tail optimality of the control plan and local and global preferences consistency of the agent. While the notion of tail optimality of a control plan is not new, the main innovation of this paper is the definition of preferences consistency of an agent, which is a novel concept. We prove that, in the case of a linear time-consistent problem where dynamic programming can be applied, the optimal control plan is globally tail-optimal and the agent is globally preferences-consistent. Oppositely, in the case of a nonlinear problem that gives rise to time inconsistency, we find that global tail optimality and global preferences consistency do not coexist. We analyze three common ways to attack a time-inconsistent problem: (i) precommitment approach, (ii) dynamically optimal approach, and (iii) consistent planning approach. We find that none of the three approaches keeps simultaneously the desirable properties of global tail optimality and global preferences consistency: the existing approaches to time inconsistency are flawed in various ways. We also prove that if the performance criterion includes a convex function of expected final wealth and a globally tail-optimal plan exists, then the three approaches coincide and the problem is linear. The contribution of the paper is to disentangle the notion of time consistency into the two notions of tail optimality and preferences consistency. The analysis should shed light on the price to be paid in terms of tail optimality and preferences consistency with each of the three approaches currently available for time inconsistency.},

The main ingredient is an intermediate characterization of the necessary condition for no arbitrage obtained for any model by Fukasawa in 2012 that the inverse functions of the $-d_1$ and $-d_2$ of the Black--Scholes formula, viewed as functions of the log-forward moneyness, should be increasing. A natural rescaling of the SVI parameters and a meticulous analysis of the Durrleman condition allow us then to obtain simple range conditions on the parameters. This leads to a straightforward implementation of a least-squares calibration algorithm on the no arbitrage domain, which yields an excellent fit on the market data we used for our tests, with the guarantee to yield smiles with no butterfly arbitrage.},

  abstract     = {We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for robust optimization of risk-aware performance criteria. To allow agents to express a wide variety of risk-reward profiles, we assess the value of a policy using rank dependent expected utility (RDEU). RDEU allows agents to seek gains, while simultaneously protecting themselves against downside risk. To robustify optimal policies against model uncertainty, we assess a policy not by its distribution but rather by the worst possible distribution that lies within a Wasserstein ball around it. Thus, our problem formulation may be viewed as an actor/agent choosing a policy (the outer problem) and the adversary then acting to worsen the performance of that strategy (the inner problem). We develop explicit policy gradient formulae for the inner and outer problems and show their efficacy on three prototypical financial problems: robust portfolio allocation, benchmark optimization, and statistical arbitrage.},

As the framework is non-Markovian, the value function for a European option is not deterministic; rather, it is random and satisfies a backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE). The existence and uniqueness of a weak solution is proved for general nonlinear BSPDEs with unbounded random leading coefficients whose connections with certain forward-backward stochastic differential equations are derived as well. These BSPDEs are then used to approximate American option prices. A deep leaning-based method is also investigated for the numerical approximations to such BSPDEs and associated non-Markovian pricing problems. Finally, the examples of rough Bergomi type are numerically computed for both European and American options.},

However, the rigorous justification of the accuracy of these approximations has been limited to power utilities and a single factor.

Due to iterated distressed selling and the associated price impact, initial shocks to some institutions can be amplified dramatically through the network induced by portfolio overlaps. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that allows us to investigate central characteristics that drive or hinder the propagation of distress. We investigate single systems as well as ensembles of systems that are alike, where similarity is measured in terms of the empirical distribution of all defining properties of a system. This asymptotic approach ensures a great deal of robustness to statistical uncertainty and temporal fluctuations. A characterization of those systems that are resilient to small shocks emerges, and we provide criteria that regulators might exploit in order to assess the stability of a financial system. We illustrate the application of these criteria for some exemplary configurations in the context of capital requirements and test the applicability of our results for systems of moderate size by Monte Carlo simulations.},

Our method, built upon Malliavin calculus techniques, allows to transform any such underlying into the Black--Scholes model with a particular type of stochastic volatility. This, in turn, allows us to describe the properties of the at-the-money implied volatility (ATMI) in terms of the Malliavin derivatives of the transformed underlying process. Concretely, we study the short-time behavior of the ATMI level and skew. As an application, we describe the short-term behavior of the ATMI of VIX and realize variance options in terms of the Hurst parameter of the model, and most importantly, we describe the class of volatility processes that generate a positive skew for the VIX implied volatility.
