  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider Galois/monodromy groups arising in computer vision applications, with a view toward building more efficient polynomial solvers. The Galois/monodromy group allows us to decide when a given problem decomposes into algebraic subproblems, and whether or not it has any symmetries. Tools from numerical algebraic geometry and computational group theory allow us to apply this framework to classical and novel reconstruction problems. We consider three classical cases—three-point absolute pose, five-point relative pose, and four-point homography estimation for calibrated cameras—where the decomposition and symmetries may be naturally understood in terms of the Galois/monodromy group. We then show how our framework can be applied to novel problems from absolute and relative pose estimation. For instance, we discover new symmetries for absolute pose problems involving mixtures of point and line features. We also describe a problem of estimating a pair of calibrated homographies between three images. For this problem of degree 64, we can reduce the degree to 16, the latter better reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of algebraically solving the problem. As a byproduct, we obtain new constraints on compatible homographies, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Signomials are obtained by generalizing polynomials to allow for arbitrary real exponents. This generalization offers great expressive power but has historically sacrificed the organizing principle of “degree” that is central to polynomial optimization theory. We reclaim that principle here through the concept of signomial rings, which we use to derive complete convex relaxation hierarchies of upper and lower bounds for signomial optimization via sums of arithmetic-geometric exponentials (SAGE) nonnegativity certificates. The Positivstellensatz underlying the lower bounds relies on the concept of conditional SAGE and removes regularity conditions required by earlier works, such as convexity of the feasible set or Archimedeanity of its representing signomial inequalities. Through worked examples we illustrate the practicality of this hierarchy in areas such as chemical reaction network theory and chemical engineering. These examples include comparisons to direct global solvers (e.g., BARON and ANTIGONE) and the Lasserre hierarchy (where appropriate). The completeness of our hierarchy of upper bounds follows from a generic construction whereby a Positivstellensatz for signomial nonnegativity over a compact set provides for arbitrarily strong outer approximations of the corresponding cone of nonnegative signomials. While working toward that result, we prove basic facts on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to signomial moment problems.},

We obtain face counting formulas in terms of the intersection posets of tropical hypersurfaces or the number of upper faces of partial Minkowski sums, along with explicit sharp upper bounds for the number of regions for any input dimension, any number of units, and any ranks, in cases with and without biases.

Using methods from quiver invariant theory [C. Chindris and H. Derksen, Int. Math. Res. Notices, (2021), rnab064], we first prove a far reaching generalization of Barthe’s Radial Isotropy Theorem [F. Barthe, Invent. Math., 134 (1998), pp. 335–361] to matrix frames (see Theorems 1(3) and 29). With this tool at our disposal, we provide a quiver invariant theoretic approach to the Paulsen problem for matrix frames.

  abstract     = {The conformal barycenter of a point cloud on the sphere at infinity of the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space is a hyperbolic analogue of the geometric median of a point cloud in Euclidean space. It was defined by Douady and Earle as part of a construction of a conformally natural way to extend homeomorphisms of the circle to homeomorphisms of the disk, and it plays a central role in Millson and Kapovich&#39;s model of the configuration space of cyclic linkages with fixed edge lengths. In this paper we consider the problem of computing the conformal barycenter. Abikoff and Ye have given an iterative algorithm for measures on $\mathbb{S}^1$ which is guaranteed to converge. We analyze Riemannian versions of Newton&#39;s method computed in the intrinsic geometry of the Poincare ball model. We give Newton--Kantorovich (NK) conditions under which we show that Newton&#39;s method with fixed step size is guaranteed to converge quadratically to the conformal barycenter for measures on any $\mathbb{S}^d$ (including infinite-dimensional spheres). For measures given by $n$ atoms on a finite-dimensional sphere which obey the NK conditions, we give an explicit linear bound on the computation time required to approximate the conformal barycenter to fixed error. We prove that our NK conditions hold for all but exponentially few $n$ atom measures. For all measures with a unique conformal barycenter we show that a regularized Newton&#39;s method with line search will always converge (eventually superlinearly) to the conformal barycenter. Though we do not have hard time bounds for this algorithm, experiments show that it is extremely efficient in practice and in particular much faster than the Abikoff--Ye iteration.},

These functions form a semi-algebraic subset of the set of linear maps from input space to output space.

We observe that the functions represented by LCNs can be identified with polynomials that admit certain factorizations, and we use this perspective to describe the impact of the network&#39;s architecture on the geometry of the resulting function space. We further study the optimization of an objective function over an LCN, analyzing critical points in function space and in parameter space and describing dynamical invariants for gradient descent. Overall, our theory predicts that the optimized parameters of an LCN will often correspond to repeated filters across layers, or filters that can be decomposed as repeated filters. We also conduct numerical and symbolic experiments that illustrate our results and present an in-depth analysis of the landscape for small architectures.},

  abstract     = {Structural identifiability is a property of an ODE model with parameters that allows for the parameters to be determined from continuous noise-free data. This is a natural prerequisite for practical identifiability. Conducting multiple independent experiments could make more parameters or functions of parameters identifiable, which is a desirable property to have. How many experiments are sufficient? In the present paper, we provide an algorithm to determine the exact number of experiments for multi-experiment local identifiability and obtain an upper bound that is off at most by one for the number of experiments for multi-experiment global identifiability. Interestingly, the main theoretical ingredient of the algorithm has been discovered and proved using model theory (in the sense of mathematical logic). Based on the insights from the model-theoretic argument, an algebraic proof presented in the paper was obtained. We hope that this unexpected connection will stimulate interactions between applied algebra and model theory, and we provide a short introduction to model theory in the context of parameter identifiability. As another related application of model theory in this area, we construct a nonlinear ODE system with one output such that single-experiment and multiple-experiment identifiability are different for the system. This contrasts with recent results about single-output linear systems. We also present a Monte Carlo randomized version of the algorithm with a polynomial arithmetic complexity. Implementation of the algorithm is provided and its performance is demonstrated on several examples.},

The main problem that we focus on is as follows: Given the set of singular tuples of some general tensor, what are all the tensors that admit those same singular tuples? Assume that the triangle inequality holds, which is exactly the condition that the dual variety to the Segre--Veronese variety is a hypersurface, or equivalently, the hyperdeterminant exists. We show in such cases that, when at least one component has degree odd, this tensor is projectively unique. On the other hand, if all the degrees are even, the fiber is a 1-dimensional space.},

As a result, we derive an upper bound $2^{O(m+n^2)}$ on the degree of the Zariski closure of the central path, when $\mu$ is sufficiently small, and for the complexity of describing the limit point, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of affine constraints and size of the symmetric matrix, respectively. Furthermore, by the application of the quantifier elimination to the real univariate representations, we provide a lower bound $1/\gamma$, with $\gamma =2^{O(m+n^2)}$, on the convergence rate of the central path.},

The algorithm takes as input a short chain complex of free modules $X\xrightarrow{f} Y \xrightarrow{g} Z$ such that $M\cong \ker{g}/\operatorname{im}{f}$. It runs in time $O(|X|^3+|Y|^3+|Z|^3)$ and requires $O(|X|^2+|Y|^2+|Z|^2)$ memory, where $|\cdot |$ denotes the rank. Given the presentation computed by our algorithm, the bigraded Betti numbers of $M$ are readily computed. Our approach is based on a simple matrix reduction algorithm, slight variants of which compute kernels of morphisms between free modules, minimal generating sets, and Gröbner bases. Our algorithm for computing minimal presentations has been implemented in RIVET, a software tool for the visualization and analysis of 2-parameter persistent homology. In experiments on topological data analysis problems, our implementation outperforms the standard computational commutative algebra packages Singular and Macaulay2 by a wide margin.},

Following the classical progression for smooth functions in differential topology, we first define the notion of a generic, transversal ReLU neural network and show that almost all ReLU networks are generic and transversal. We then define a partially oriented linear 1-complex in the domain of $F$ and identify properties of this complex that yield an obstruction to the existence of bounded connected components of a decision region. We use this obstruction to prove that a decision region of a generic, transversal ReLU network $F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with a single hidden layer of dimension $n+1$ can have no more than one bounded connected component.},

The first part of the paper is devoted to general results relating the Möbius functions of nested atomistic lattices, extending some classical theorems in combinatorics. We then specialize our results to restriction geometries, i.e., to sublattices $\mathcal{A}$ of the lattice of subspaces of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear space, say, $X$, generated by a set of projective points $A \subseteq X$. In this context, we introduce the notion of subspace distribution and show that partial knowledge of the latter is equivalent to partial knowledge of the Whitney numbers of $\mathcal{A}$. This refines a classical result by Dowling. The most interesting applications of our results are to be seen in the theory of higher-weight Dowling lattices (HWDLs), to which we devote the second and most substantive part of the paper. These combinatorial geometries were introduced by Dowling in 1971 in connection with fundamental problems in coding theory, most notably the famous MDS conjecture. They were further studied by, among others, Zaslavsky, Bonin, Kung, Brini, and Games. To date, still very little is known about these lattices and the techniques to compute their Whitney numbers have not been discovered yet. In this paper, we bring forward the theory of HWDLs, computing their Whitney numbers for new infinite families of parameters. We also show that the second Whitney numbers of HWDLs are polynomials in the underlying field size $q$, whose coefficients are curious expressions involving the Bernoulli numbers. In passing, we obtain new results intersecting coding theory and enumerative combinatorics.},

We then use these bounds to describe the general behavior of common complements with respect to sparseness and density, showing that the decisive property is whether or not the number of spaces to be complemented is negligible with respect to the field size. By specializing our results to matrix spaces, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the number of maximum-rank-distance (MRD) codes in the rank metric. In particular, we answer an open question in coding theory, proving that MRD codes are sparse for all parameter sets as the field size grows, with only very few exceptions. We also investigate the density of MRD codes as their number of columns tends to infinity, obtaining a new asymptotic bound. Using properties of the Euler function from number theory, we then show that our bound improves on known results for most parameter sets.

In this paper, we provide a complete classification of $k$ point pairs for which a chiral reconstruction exists. The existence of chiral reconstructions is equivalent to the nonemptiness of certain semialgebraic sets. We describe these sets and develop tools to certify their nonemptiness. For up to three point pairs, we prove that a chiral reconstruction always exists while the set of five or more point pairs that do not have a chiral reconstruction is Zariski-dense. We show that for five generic point pairs, the chiral region is bounded by line segments in a Schläfli double six on a cubic surface with 27 real lines. Four point pairs have a chiral reconstruction unless they belong to two nongeneric combinatorial types, in which case they may or may not.},
