  abstract     = {We study two-layer neural networks whose domain and range are Banach spaces with separable preduals. In addition, we assume that the image space is equipped with a partial order, i.e., it is a Riesz space. As the nonlinearity we choose the lattice operation of taking the positive part; in case of $\mathbb R^d$-valued neural networks this corresponds to the ReLU activation function. We prove inverse and direct approximation theorems with Monte-Carlo rates for a certain class of functions, extending existing results for the finite-dimensional case. In the second part of the paper we study, from the regularization theory viewpoint, the problem of finding optimal representations of such functions via signed measures on a latent space from a finite number of noisy observations. We discuss regularity conditions known as source conditions and obtain convergence rates in a Bregman distance for the representing measure in the regime when both the noise level goes to zero and the number of samples goes to infinity at appropriate rates.},

  abstract     = {We study the basic properties of the $d$-plane transform on the Euclidean space as a Fourier integral operator and its application to the microlocal analysis of streaking artifacts in its filtered back-projection. The $d$-plane transform is defined by integrals of functions on the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space over all the $d$-dimensional planes, where $0&lt;d&lt;n$. This maps functions on the Euclidean space to those on the affine Grassmannian $G(d,n)$. This is said to be X-ray transform if $d=1$ and Radon transform if $d=n-1$. When $n=2$ the X-ray transform is thought to be measurements of computed tomography (CT) scanners. In this paper we obtain a concrete expression of the canonical relation between the $d$-plane transform and the quantitative properties of the filtered back-projection of the product of the images of the $d$-plane transform. The FBP of the product is related to the metal streaking artifacts of CT images. Our result is a generalization of recent results of Park, Choi, and Seo [Comm. Pure Appl.

  abstract     = {When sources of energy gain and loss are introduced to a wave scattering system, the underlying mathematical formulation will be non-Hermitian. This paves the way for the existence of exceptional points, where eigenmodes are linearly dependent. The primary goal of this work is to study the existence of exceptional points in high-contrast subwavelength metamaterials. We begin by studying a parity--time-symmetric pair of subwavelength resonators and prove that this system supports asymptotic exceptional points. These are points at which the subwavelength eigenvalues and eigenvectors coincide at leading order in the asymptotic parameter. We then investigate the exotic scattering behavior of a metascreen composed of repeating parity-time-symmetric pairs of subwavelength resonators. We prove that the non-Hermitian nature of this structure means that it exhibits asymptotic unidirectional reflectionless transmission at certain frequencies and demonstrate extraordinary transmission close to these frequencies.},

  abstract     = {We consider a system of evolutionary equations that is capable of describing certain viscoelastic effects in linearized yet nonlinear models of solid mechanics. The constitutive relation, involving the Cauchy stress, the small strain tensor, and the symmetric velocity gradient, is given in an implicit form. For a large class of these implicit constitutive relations, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a global-in-time large-data weak solution. Then we focus on the class of so-called limiting strain models, i.e., models for which the magnitude of the strain tensor is known to remain small a priori, regardless of the magnitude of the Cauchy stress tensor. For this class of models, a new technical difficulty arises. The Cauchy stress is only an integrable function over its domain of definition, resulting in the underlying function spaces being nonreflexive and thus the weak compactness of bounded sequences of elements of these spaces is lost. Nevertheless, even for problems of this type we are able to provide a satisfactory existence theory, as long as the initial data have finite elastic energy and the boundary data fulfill natural compatibility conditions.},

Two types of thin ellipsoids are considered: long prolate spheroids and flat oblate ellipsoids. We show that eigenvalues of the Neumann--Poincaré operators on a sequence of the prolate spheroids are densely distributed in the interval $[0,1/2]$ as their eccentricities tend to $1$, namely as they become longer. We then prove that eigenvalues of the Neumann--Poincaré operators on the oblate ellipsoids are densely distributed in the interval $[-1/2,1/2]$ as the ellipsoids become flatter. This shows, in particular, that even if there are at most finitely many negative eigenvalues on the oblate ellipsoids, more and more negative eigenvalues appear as the ellipsoids become flatter. We also show a similar spectral property for flat three-dimensional domains.},

Phys., 350 (2017), pp. 699--747] for vortex pairs, we reformulate the problem for the patch boundaries so that it no longer appears singular in the point vortex limit. Provided the point vortex equilibrium is nondegenerate in a natural sense, solutions can then be constructed directly using the implicit function theorem, yielding asymptotics for the shape of the patch boundaries. As an application, we construct new families of asymmetric translating and rotating pairs, as well as stationary tripoles. We also show how the techniques can be adapted for highly symmetric configurations such as regular polygons, body-centered polygons, and nested regular polygons by integrating the appropriate symmetries into the formulation of the problem.},

When this term is ignored in the context of nonrelativistic charged fluid, one obtains the standard MHD system. This extra term in the MHD-wave system assumes the form $\gamma \partial_{tt} b$ with $\gamma&gt;0$ being a small constant and $b$ the magnetic field. Mathematically this term makes the global well-posedness problem much more challenging than the corresponding MHD system. Even the global existence and regularity problem for the 2D MHD-wave system appears to be open. This paper solves the global well-posedness problem in a critical Sobolev setting when $\gamma$ and the size of the initial data satisfy a suitable constraint. In addition, the solution of the MHD-wave system is shown to converge to that of the corresponding MHD system with an explicit rate. The energy method does not work here, and this paper presents a new approach.},

Furthermore, the large deviation principle for the small noise asymptotics is derived for both the stochastic inhomogeneous dispersive equations and stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equations with variable coefficients. The crucial point of proof is the invariance of the principal symbol under the Doss--Sussman type transformation.

The model is governed by a $2\times 2$ Temple system with a discontinuous relaxation term. The system is marginally stable. Under such circumstances, there is no invariant region for this system. Instead, we consider two sequences of time evolution regions for free and congested flow cases. The global existence of entropy solutions to the Cauchy problem of the multilane model is established by a new version of the generalized Glimm scheme for some suitable class of initial data. We prove that the total variation of the solutions is bounded for all time if the total variation of the initial data is finite. We find that the Lipschitz constants in time for the $L^1_{\rm loc}$ norms of the solutions are independent of the relaxation parameter, which enables us to get the zero relaxation limit.},

  abstract     = {We study the stability of entropically regularized optimal transport with respect to the marginals. Lipschitz continuity of the value and Hölder continuity of the optimal coupling in $p$-Wasserstein distance are obtained under general conditions, including quadratic costs and unbounded marginals. The results for the value extend to regularization by an arbitrary divergence. As an application, we show convergence of Sinkhorn&#39;s algorithm in the Wasserstein sense, including for quadratic cost. Two techniques are presented: the first compares an optimal coupling with its so-called shadow, which is a coupling induced on other marginals by an explicit construction, and the second transforms one set of marginals by a change of coordinates and thus reduces the comparison of differing marginals to the comparison of differing cost functions under the same marginals.},

  abstract     = {We study the local well-posedness for an interface with surface tension that separates a perfectly conducting inviscid fluid from a vacuum. The fluid flow is governed by the equations of three-dimensional ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), while the vacuum magnetic and electric fields are supposed to satisfy the pre-Maxwell equations. The fluid and vacuum magnetic fields are tangential to the interface. This renders a nonlinear hyperbolic-elliptic coupled problem with a characteristic free boundary. We introduce some suitable regularization to establish the solvability and tame estimates for the linearized problem. Combining the linear well-posedness result with a modified Nash--Moser iteration scheme, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of solutions of the nonlinear problem. The non-collinearity condition required by Secchi and Trakhinin [Nonlinearity, 27 (2014), pp. 105--169] for the case of zero surface tension becomes unnecessary in our result, which verifies the stabilizing effect of surface tension on the evolution of moving vacuum interfaces in ideal compressible MHD.},

  abstract     = {We propose a general strategy for solving nonlinear integro-differential evolution problems with periodic boundary conditions, where no direct maximum/minimum principle is available. This is motivated by the study of recent macroscopic models for active Brownian particles with repulsive interactions, consisting of advection-diffusion processes in the space of particle position and orientation. We focus on one of such models, namely a semilinear parabolic equation with a nonlinear active drift term, whereby the velocity depends on the particle orientation and angle-independent overall particle density (leading to a nonlocal term by integrating out the angular variable). The main idea of the existence analysis is to exploit a priori estimates from (approximate) entropy dissipation. The global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions is shown using a two-step Galerkin approximation with appropriate cutoff in order to obtain nonnegativity, an upper bound on the overall density, and preserve a priori estimates. Our analysis naturally includes the case of finite systems, corresponding to the case of a finite number of directions. The Duhamel principle is then used to obtain additional regularity of the solution, namely continuity in time-space. Motivated by the class of initial data relevant for the application, which includes perfectly aligned particles (same orientation), we extend the well-posedness result to very weak solutions allowing distributional initial data with low regularity.},

First of all, the global existence, uniqueness, and mean-square stability with general decay rate of mild solutions are established. In particular, we would like to point out that our analysis is not necessary to construct Lyapunov functions, but we deal directly with stability via the Banach fixed point theorem, the fractional power of operators, and the semigroup theory. It is worth emphasizing that a novel estimate of stochastic integrals with respect to tfBm is presented, which greatly contributes to the stability analyses. Then after extending the factorization formula to the tfBm case, we construct the nontrivial equilibrium solution, defined for $t\in \mathbb{R}$, by means of an approximation technique and a convergence analysis. Moreover, we analyze the Hölder regularity in time and general stability (including both polynomial and logarithmic stability) of the nontrivial equilibrium solution in the sense of mean-square. As an example of application, the reaction diffusion neural network system with pantograph delay is considered, and the nontrivial equilibrium solution and general stability of the system are proved under the Lipschitz assumption.},

We obtain the local existence of strong solution to the initial-boundary value problem (IBVP), which is not trivial, especially for the nonisentropic system with vacuum and temperature-dependent viscosity. There is degeneracy caused by vacuum, and there is extremely strong nonlinearity caused by variable coefficients, both of which create great difficulty for the a priori estimates, especially for the second-order estimates. First, in order to obtain closed first-order estimates, we introduce a new variable to reformulate the system into a better form and require the measure of initial vacuum domain to be sufficiently small. Second, with the help of a cut-off and straightening out technique, and the thermo-insulated boundary condition, we establish the time involved estimate for the second-order derivative of temperature, which plays a key role in closing the a priori estimates. Moreover, our local existence result holds for the cases that the viscosity and heat conductivity depend on $\theta$ with possibly different power laws (i.e., $\mu, \lambda \sim\theta^{b_1}$, $\kappa\sim \theta^{b_2}$ with constants $ b_1, b_2\in [0,+\infty)$).},

In this paper we prove a theorem on the asymptotic stability of TOFs, where we allow the initial perturbation to be the sum of an exponentially localized part and a front-like part which approaches a small but nonzero limit at $+ \infty$. The underlying assumptions guarantee that the operator, obtained from linearizing about the TOF in a co-moving and co-rotating frame, has essential spectrum touching the imaginary axis in a quadratic fashion and that further isolated eigenvalues are bounded away from the imaginary axis. The basic idea of the proof is to consider the problem in an extended phase space which couples the wave dynamics on the real line to the ODE dynamics at $+ \infty$. Using slowly decaying exponential weights, the framework allows one to derive appropriate resolvent estimates, semigroup techniques, and Gronwall estimates.},

Moreover, the directional Gâteaux derivatives can be explicitly computed almost everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^N$ by means of the optimality system of the associated optimal control problem. We also prove that, in the one-dimensional case in space and in the quadratic case in any space dimension, these directional Gâteaux derivatives actually correspond to the unique duality solution to the linear transport equation with discontinuous coefficient, resulting from the linearization of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. The motivation behind these differentiability results arises from the following optimal inverse-design problem: given a time horizon $T&gt;0$ and a target function $u_T$, construct an initial condition such that the corresponding viscosity solution at time $T$ minimizes the $L^2$-distance to $u_T$. Our differentiability results allow us to derive a necessary first-order optimality condition for this optimization problem and the implementation of gradient-based methods to numerically approximate the optimal inverse design.},

The model is considered with the reflective radiative boundary conditions for the radiative intensity and with periodic, Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions for the temperature. The global existence of weak solutions for this system is given by using a Galerkin method with a careful treatment of the boundary conditions. Using the compactness method, averaging lemma and Young measure theory, we prove our main result that the weak solution converges to a nonlinear diffusion model in the diffusive limit. Moreover, under more regularity conditions on the limit system, the diffusive limit is also analyzed by using a relative entropy method. In particular, we get a rate of convergence. The initial and boundary conditions are assumed to be well-prepared in the sense that no initial or boundary layer exists.},

We establish the connection formulas for this family of solutions. In the special case that the reflection coefficient vanishes at the origin, the solutions of the Painlevé II hierarchy in the leading coefficient vanishes as well, and the leading and subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion are instead given explicitly in terms of derivatives of the generalized Airy function.},

Further, for the Cowling approximation (which neglects the Eulerian perturbation of gravity) we derive a scalar equation in the atmosphere and couple it to the vectorial interior equation.

  abstract     = {In this paper we are concerned with the existence of transonic shocks for two-dimensional steady isothermal Euler flows in a horizontal flat nozzle under vertical gravity. In particular, we focus on the contribution of the vertical gravity in determining the position of the shock front. For steady horizontal flows, the existence of normal shocks with the position of the shock front being arbitrary in the nozzle can be easily established. This paper will try to determine the position of the shock front as the state of the flow at the entrance of the nozzle and the pressure at the exit are slightly perturbed. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary problem for the steady Euler system with vertical gravity, and the position of the shock front is the very free boundary that need to be determined. Since the unperturbed normal shock solutions give no information on the position of the shock front, one of the key difficulties is to find where the shock front may appear. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes a free boundary problem of the linearized Euler system with vertical gravity, whose solution could be an initial approximation for the shock solution with the free boundary being the approximation for the shock front. Due to the existence of the vertical gravity, difficulties arise in solving the boundary value problem in the approximate subsonic domain behind the shock front. The linearized Euler system is elliptic-hyperbolic composite for subsonic flows, and the elliptic part and the hyperbolic part are coupled in the $0$-order terms depending on the acceleration of gravity $g$. Moreover, the coefficients are not constants since the unperturbed shock solution depends on the vertical variable. New ideas and techniques are developed to deal with these difficulties and, under certain sufficient conditions on the perturbation, the existence of the solution to the proposed free boundary problem is established as the acceleration of gravity $g&gt;0$ and the perturbation are sufficiently small. Then, with the obtained initial approximation of the shock solution, a nonlinear iteration scheme can be constructed which leads to a transonic shock solution with the position of the shock front being close to the initial approximating position.},

  abstract     = {The inverse problem of reconstructing a source term from boundary measurements, for the wave equation, is revisited. We propose a novel approach to recover the unknown source through measuring the wave fields after injecting small particles, enjoying a high contrast, into the medium. For this purpose, we first derive the asymptotic expansion of the wave field, based on the time-domain Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The dominant term in the asymptotic expansion is expressed as an infinite series in terms of the eigenvalues ${\lambda_n}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of the Newtonian operator (for the pure Laplacian). Such expansions are useful under a certain scale between the size of the particles and their contrast. Second, we observe that the relevant eigenvalues appearing in the expansion have non-zero averaged eigenfunctions. We prove that the family ${\sin(\frac{c_1}{\sqrt{\lambda_n}}\, t),\, \cos(\frac{c_1}{\sqrt{\lambda_n}}\, t)}$, for those relevant eigenvalues, with $c_1$ as the contrast of the small particle, defines a Riesz basis (contrary to the family corresponding to the whole sequence of eigenvalues). Then, using the Riesz theory, we reconstruct the wave field, generated before injecting the particles, on the center of the particles. Finally, from internal values of the last field, we reconstruct the source term by numerical differentiation, for instance. A significant advantage of our approach is that we only need the measurements on ${x}\times(0, T)$ for a single point $x$ away from $\Omega$, i.e., the support of the source, and large enough $T$.},

The goal is to determine the principal symbol of the covariance operator from the scattered wave measured in a bounded domain which has a positive distance from the domain of the potential. For such a rough potential, the well-posedness of the direct scattering problem in the distribution sense is established by studying an equivalent Lippmann--Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse scattering problem, it is shown with probability one that the principal symbol of the covariance operator can be uniquely determined by the amplitude of the scattered waves averaged over the frequency band from a single realization of the random potential. The analysis employs the Born approximation in high frequency, asymptotics of the Green tensor for the elastic wave equation, and microlocal analysis for the Fourier integral operators.},

We provide an improved asymptotic analysis of the coefficients of the higher order models in the low-volume fraction regime whereby the periodic obstacles are rescaled by a factor $\eta$ which converges to zero. By introducing a new family of order $k$ corrector tensors with a controlled growth as $\eta\rightarrow 0$ uniform in $k\in\mathbb{N}$, we are able to show that both the infinite order and the finite order models converge in a coefficient-wise sense to the three classical asymptotic regimes. Namely, we retrieve the Darcy model, the Brinkman equation or the Stokes equation in the homogeneous cubic domain depending on whether $\eta$ is respectively larger, proportional to, or smaller than the critical size $\eta_{\rm crit}\sim \epsilon^{2/(d-2)}$. For completeness, the paper first establishes the analogous results for the perforated Poisson equation, considered as a simplified scalar version of the Stokes system.},

  abstract     = {Consider the time-periodic flow of an incompressible viscous fluid past a body performing a rigid motion with nonzero translational and rotational velocity. We introduce a framework of homogeneous Sobolev spaces that renders the resolvent problem of the associated linear problem well posed on the whole imaginary axis. In contrast to the cases without translation or rotation, the resolvent estimates are merely uniform under additional restrictions, and the existence of time-periodic solutions depends on the ratio of the rotational velocity of the body motion to the angular velocity associated with the time period. Provided that this ratio is a rational number, time-periodic solutions to both the linear and, under suitable smallness conditions, the nonlinear problem can be established. If this ratio is irrational, a counterexample shows that in a special case there is no uniform resolvent estimate and solutions to the time-periodic linear problem do not exist.},

  abstract     = {We prove the existence of small-amplitude modulated solitary waves for the full-dispersion Kadomtsev--Petviashvilii (FDKP) equation with weak surface tension. The resulting waves are small-order perturbations of scaled, translated, frequency-shifted solutions of a Davey--Stewartson (DS) type equation. The construction is variational and relies upon a series of reductive steps which transform the FDKP functional to a perturbed scaling of the DS functional, for which least-energy ground states are found. We also establish a convergence result showing that scalings of FDKP solitary waves converge to ground states of the DS functional as the scaling parameter tends to zero. Our method is robust and applies to nonlinear dispersive equations with the properties that (i) their dispersion relation has a global minimum (or maximum) at a nonzero wave number, and (ii) the associated formal weakly nonlinear analysis leads to a DS equation of elliptic-elliptic focusing type. We present full details for the FDKP equation.},

In this paper we further study the global existence for an initial-boundary value problem in a horizontally periodic domain with finite height in three dimensions. Motivated by the multilayer energy method introduced in [Y. Guo and I. Tice, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 207 (2013), pp. 459--531], we develop a new type of two-layer energy structure to overcome the difficulties arising from three-dimensional nonlinear terms in the MHD equations, and prove thus the initial-boundary value problem admits a unique global smooth solution with small initial data. Moreover, the solution decays exponentially in time to some rest state. Our two-layer energy structure enjoys two features: (1) the lower-order energy (functional) cannot be controlled by the higher-order energy; (2) under the a priori smallness assumption of the lower-order energy, we can first close the higher-order energy estimates, and then further close the lower-energy estimates in turn.},

The global unique solvability of strong solution with large data is proved, the vanishing shear viscosity limit is justified, and the optimal $L^2$ convergence rate for the angular and axial velocities is obtained together with the estimation on the boundary layer thickness. The results are proved by establishing some (shear viscosity-independent) a priori estimates that are based on the basic energy estimates as well as the upper and lower bounds of the density. First, the basic energy estimates are derived by a new strategy used to overcome the difficulties caused by the loss of time derivative of one-direction velocity and the nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, and then the bounds of the density based on a key observation of the structure of the viscosities.},

However, if there are more than two stable steady states, the invasion phenomenon may become more intricate and involve intermediate steps, which leads one to consider not a single but a collection of traveling waves with ordered speeds. In this paper we show that, if the reaction function is discontinuous at the stable steady states, then such a collection of traveling waves exists and even provides a special solution which we call a terrace solution. More precisely, we will address both the existence and uniqueness of the terrace solution.},

Even though two-dimensional models are known to have emergent behaviors, such as population bursts, which are not observed in standard one-dimensional models, we show that in the weak connectivity regime, two-dimensional models behave like one-dimensional models, i.e., they relax to a unique stationary state. The proof is based on an application of Harris&#39;s ergodic theorem and a perturbation argument, both adapted to the case of a multidimensional equation with delays.},

In earlier work, we analyzed viscosity solutions of a related variational inequality, and showed that they provided the only upper semicontinuous (usc) solutions of the inverse problem. We furthermore proved weak regularity (continuity) of the boundary $b$ under additional assumptions on $p$. The purpose of this paper is to study higher-order regularity properties of the solution of the inverse first-passage problem. In particular, we show that when $p$ is smooth and has negative slope, the viscosity solution, and therefore also the unique usc solution of the inverse problem, is smooth. Consequently, the viscosity solution furnishes a unique classical solution to the free boundary problem associated with the inverse first-passage problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations (CNS) is considered. When the viscosity $\mu(\rho)$ depends on the density $\rho$ in a sublinear power law ($ \rho^\delta$ with $0&lt;\delta\leq 1$), based on an elaborate analysis of the intrinsic singular structure of this degenerate system, we prove the global-in-time well-posedness of regular solutions with conserved total mass, momentum, and finite total energy in some inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the solutions we obtained satisfy that $\rho$ keeps positive for all point $x\in \mathbb{R}$ but decays to zero in the far field, which is consistent with the facts that the total mass of the whole space is conserved, and CNS is a model of nondilute fluids where $\rho$ is bounded below away from zero. The key to the proof is the introduction of a well-designed reformulated structure by introducing some new variables and initial compatibility conditions, which, actually, can transfer the degeneracies of the time evolution and the viscosity to the possible singularity of some special source terms. Then, combined with the BD entropy estimates and transport properties of the so-called effective velocity $v=u+\varphi(\rho)_x$ ($u$ is the velocity of the fluid, and $\varphi(\rho)$ is a function of $\rho$ defined by $\varphi&#39;(\rho)=\mu(\rho)/\rho^2$), one can obtain the required uniform a priori estimates of corresponding solutions. Moreover, in contrast to the classical theory in the case of the constant viscosity, one can show that the $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ of the global regular solution we obtained does not decay to zero as time $t$ goes to infinity. It is worth pointing out that the well-posedness theory established here can be applied to the viscous Saint-Venant system for the motion of shallow water.},

The self-consistent electrostatic potential force is allowed to take different far-fields and the initial perturbation can be chosen arbitrarily large. Our analysis is based on the nonlinear energy method by taking into account the effect of the self-consistent electric field on the viscous compressible fluid, and the crucial step is to derive the desired positive upper and lower bounds of the density for both ions and/or electrons which are uniform in time and space. Moreover, the desired uniform estimate on the electric potential together with its large time behavior are also obtained for the one-fluid case. Our main idea is to use the smallness of the strength of the rarefaction waves to control the possible growth of the solutions of the compressible Navier--Stokes--Poisson system induced by the nonlinearities of the system and by the interactions between the rarefaction waves and the solutions.},

  abstract     = {The theory of Wasserstein gradient flows in the space of probability measures has made enormous progress over the last 20 years. It constitutes a unified and powerful framework in the study of dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) providing the means to prove well-posedness, regularity, stability, and quantitative convergence to the equilibrium. The recently developed entropic regularization technique paves the way for fast and efficient numerical methods for solving these gradient flows. However, many PDEs of interest do not have a gradient flow structure and, a priori, the theory is not applicable. In this paper, we develop a time-discrete entropy regularized variational scheme for a general class of such nongradient PDEs. We prove the convergence of the scheme and illustrate the breadth of the proposed framework with concrete examples including the nonlinear kinetic Fokker--Planck (Kramers) equation and a nonlinear degenerate diffusion of Kolmogorov type. Numerical simulations are also provided.},

  abstract     = {For a uniformly supersonic flow past a convex cornered wedge with the pressure being given for the surrounding quiescent gas at the downstream, as shown in experimental results, it is expected to form a shock followed by a contact discontinuity, which is also called the jet flow. By the shock polar analysis, it is well-known that there are two possible shocks, one a strong shock and the other one a weak shock. The strong shock is always transonic, while the weak shock could be transonic or supersonic. In this paper, we prove the global existence, asymptotic behaviors, uniqueness, and stability of the subsonic jet with a strong transonic shock under the perturbation of the upstream flow and the pressure of the surrounding quiescent gas, for the two-dimensional steady full Euler equations. We first formulate the problem into a nonlinear problem with two free boundaries meeting at the wedge corner, and formulate the boundary conditions on them. Then we introduce a modified Lagrange coordinates transformation to straighten the two free boundaries at the same time, and study the elliptic estimate with proper weighted Hölder norms to deal with the wedge corner singularity and the asymptotic behaviors for the Euler equations in the Lagrangian coordinates carefully, and then design an iteration scheme based on the estimates.},

In contrast to the confined case $\mathbb{T}^d_x \times \mathbb{R}_v^d$, or the unconfined case $\mathbb{R}^d_x \times \mathbb{R}^d_v$ with screening, the dynamics of the disturbance are not scattering towards free transport as $t \to \pm \infty$: we show that the electric field decomposes into a very weakly damped Klein--Gordon-type evolution for long waves and a Landau-damped evolution. The Klein--Gordon-type waves solve, to leading order, the compressible Euler--Poisson equations linearized about a constant density state, despite the fact that our model is collisionless, i.e., there is no trend to local or global thermalization of the distribution function in strong topologies. We prove dispersive estimates on the Klein--Gordon part of the dynamics. The Landau damping part of the electric field decays faster than free transport at low frequencies and damps as in the confined case at high frequencies; in fact, it decays at the same rate as in the screened case. As such, neither contribution to the electric field behaves as in the vacuum case.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a mixed system of free boundary problem modeling multi-layer tumor growth with time delay $\tau$. The concept of a time delay goes back to Byrne [Math. Biosci., 144 (1997), pp. 83--117] and the formulation of a multilayer tumor model can be found in Zhou, Escher, and Cui [J. Math. Anal. Appl., 337 (2008), pp. 443--457] and the references therein. In a quasi-steady state approximation of the multilayer tumor growth model with a time delay, He, Xing, and Hu [Math. Methods Appl. Sci., to appear] established a critical value $\mu_*$ for which the system is linearly stable if $\mu\mu_*$ under nonflat perturbations. We consider the full system without quasi-steady state simplification in this paper. This is a free boundary system of mixed elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. A key difference to our earlier work is the consideration of the full parabolic equation for the nutrient in the model, which makes the system more complex and more challenging. By applying series expansion and Laplace transform methods, we found a threshold $\mu^{*}&gt;0$ such that the unique flat stationary solution is linearly stable if $\mu\mu^{*}$ under nonflat perturbations. This is accomplished with the inverse Laplace transform and a careful study of the spectrum of the system. Some of our results are presented in a more useful abstract form, which would be applicable to other systems. As far as we know, this is the first paper for the study of stability for multilayer tumor models with a time delay and with a parabolic equation for the nutrient.},

The challenge is that the Eulerian domain for the fluid changes in time and is a part of the solution. We introduce a two fixed-point methodology: First we construct a time-periodic solutions for a given variable time-periodic geometry. Then in a second step a (set-valued) fixed point is performed w.r.t. the geometry of the domain. The existence relies on newly developed a priori estimates applicable for both coupled and uncoupled variable geometries. Due to the expected weak regularity of the solutions such Eulerian estimates are unavoidable. Note in particular that only the fluid is assumed to be dissipative; the here-produced a priori estimates show that its possible to exploit the dissipative effects of the fluid also for the solid deformation. The existence of time-periodic solutions for a given geometry is valid for arbitrary large data. The existence of periodic coupled solutions to the fluid-structure interaction is valid for all data that exclude a self-intersection a priori.},

The uniqueness result is a consequence of a stability estimate where the difference of two solutions is estimated by the distance of the initial values and outer forces. For that we introduce a methodology that overcomes the problem that the two (variable in time) domains of the fluid velocities and pressures are not the same. The estimate holds under the assumption that one of the two weak solutions possesses some additional higher regularity. The additional regularity is exclusively requested for the velocity of one of the solutions resembling the celebrated Ladyzhenskaya--Prodi--Serrin conditions in the given framework.},

The tasks in (a) and (b) are carried out here in Part 1, while (c) is done in a separate Part 2. This high dimensional problem poses considerable technical difficulties when the rate of spreading is considered, and we overcome that by introducing an intermediate kernel function which plays a crucial role both in determining the onset condition for accelerated spreading and in obtaining the spreading speed when it is finite.},

For the scalar viscous conservation law case, it is known by the work of Liu, Matsumura, and Nishihara [SIAM J. Math.

Motivated by their work, we prove the stability of the above three types of wave patterns for the hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system of radiating gas with small perturbation. A singular phase plane analysis method is introduced to show the existence and the precise asymptotic behavior of the stationary solution, especially for the degenerate case: $u_-&lt;u_+=0$ such that the system has inevitable singularities. The stability of the rarefaction wave, the stationary solution, and their superposition is proved by applying the standard $L^2$-energy method.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with two optimization problems that we tackle from a qualitative perspective. The first one deals with quantitative inequalities for spectral optimization problems for Schrödinger operators in general domains, and the second one deals with the turnpike property for optimal bilinear control problems. In the first part of this article, we prove, under mild technical assumptions, quantitative inequalities for the optimization of the first eigenvalue of $-\Delta-V$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions with respect to the potential $V$, under $L^\infty$ and $L^1$ constraints. This is done using a new method of proof which crucially relies on a quantitative bathtub principle. We believe our approach can be generalized to other steady elliptic optimization problems. In the second part of this paper, we use this inequality to tackle a turnpike problem. Namely, considering a bilinear control system of the form $u_t-\Delta u=\mathcal V u$, $\mathcal V=\mathcal V(t,x)$ being the control, can we give qualitative information, under $L^\infty$ and $L^1$ constraints on $\mathcal V$, on the solutions of the optimization problem $\sup \int_{\Omega} u(T,x)dx$? We prove that the quantitative inequality for eigenvalues implies an integral turnpike property: defining $\mathcal I^*$ as the set of optimal potentials for the eigenvalue optimization problem and $\mathcal V_T^*$ as a solution of the bilinear optimal control problem, the quantity $\int_0^T \operatorname{dist}_{L^1}(\mathcal V_T^*(t,\cdot)\, \mathcal I^*)^2$ is bounded uniformly in $T$.},

Some systems used to model biological processes, such as ion channel models, fall under the reaction-diffusion category and often have one or more nondiffusing species which results in a rank-deficient diffusion matrix. Previous theoretical research focused on spiral spectra for strictly positive diffusion matrices. In this paper, we use a general two-variable reaction-diffusion system to compare the essential and absolute spectra of spiral waves for strictly positive and rank-deficient diffusion matrices. We show that the essential spectrum is not continuous in the limit of vanishing diffusion in one component. Moreover, we predict locations for the absolute spectrum in the case of a nondiffusing slow variable. Predictions are confirmed numerically for the Barkley and Karma models.},

The viscosity and the heat conductivity coefficients are assumed to be functions of the temperature, and the shear viscosity coefficient may vanish as the temperature goes to zero. The proof is to apply the Galerkin method to a suitable approximate system with several parameters and obtain uniform estimates for the approximate solutions. The key ingredient in obtaining the required estimates is to apply De Giorgi&#39;s iteration to the modified temperature equation, from which we can get a lower bound for the temperature not depending on the artificial viscosity coefficient introduced in the modified momentum equation, which makes the compactness argument available as the artificial viscous term vanishes.},

  abstract     = {Weyl points are degenerate points on the spectral bands at which energy bands intersect conically. They are the origins of many novel physical phenomena and have attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we investigate the existence of such points in the spectrum of the three-dimensional Schrödinger operator $H = - \Delta +V(x)$ with $V(x)$ being in a large class of periodic potentials. Specifically, we give very general conditions on the potentials which ensure the existence of threefold Weyl points on the associated energy bands. Different from two-dimensional honeycomb structures which possess Dirac points where two adjacent band surfaces touch each other conically, the threefold Weyl points are conically intersection points of two energy bands with an extra band sandwiched in between. To ensure the threefold and three-dimensional conical structures, more delicate, new symmetries are required. As a consequence, new techniques combining more symmetries are used to justify the existence of such conical points under the conditions proposed. This paper provides a comprehensive proof of such threefold Weyl points. In particular, the role of each symmetry endowed to the potential is carefully analyzed. Our proof extends the analysis on the conical spectral points to a higher dimension and higher multiplicities. We also provide some numerical simulations on typical potentials to demonstrate our analysis.},

  abstract     = {In the study of turbulence, intermittency is a measure of how much Kolmogorov&#39;s theory of 1941 deviates from experimental measurements. It is quantified with the flatness of the velocity of the fluid, usually based on structure functions in physical space. However, it can also be defined with Fourier high-pass filters. Experimental and numerical simulations suggest that the two approaches do not always give the same results. Our purpose is to compare them from the analytical point of view of functions. We do that by studying generalizations of Riemann&#39;s nondifferentiable function, yielding computations that are related to some classical problems in Fourier analysis. The conclusion is that the result strongly depends on regularity. To visualize this, we establish an analogy between these generalizations and the influence of viscosity in turbulent flows. This article is motivated by the mathematical works on the multifractal formalism and the discovery of Riemann&#39;s nondifferentiable function as a trajectory of polygonal vortex filaments.},

  abstract     = {This work considers stochastic differential games with a large number of players, whose costs and dynamics interact through the empirical distribution of both their states and their controls. We develop a new framework to prove convergence of finite-player games to the asymptotic mean field game. Our approach is based on the concept of propagation of chaos for forward and backward weakly interacting particles which we investigate by stochastic analysis methods, and which appear to be of independent interest. These propagation of chaos arguments allow us to derive moment and concentration bounds for the convergence of Nash equilibria.},

Concerning bounded solutions we provide a sufficient criterion for a globally dissipative subsolution to induce infinitely many globally dissipative solutions having the same initial data, pressure, and dissipation measure as the subsolution. The criterion can easily be verified in the case of a flat vortex sheet giving rise to the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability. As another application we show that there exists initial data for which associated globally dissipative solutions realize every dissipation measure from an open set in ${\mathcal C}^0(\mathbb{T}^2\times[0,T])$. In fact the set of such initial data is dense in the space of solenoidal $L^2(\mathbb{T}^2;\mathbb{R}^2)$ vector fields.},

Our model can be used in two ways. First, the model makes it possible to do mathematical analysis on a compact 3-manifold $M$ by smoothly embedding the set $M\setminus L$, where $L$ is a finite union of closed curves, to an open subset of $\mathbb R^3$. Second, the model could in principle be physically implemented using a device built from metamaterials. In particular the measurements in the metamaterial device given by the Helmholtz source-to-solution operator are equivalent to Helmholtz source-to-solution measurements in a universe given by $(\mathbb{R}_+\times M, -dt^2 +g)$, where $(M,g)$ is a closed, orientable, $C^\infty$-smooth, 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Thus the obtained device could be used to simulate cosmological models using metamaterial devices.},

This is done in a very general setting, with nonlinear terms admitting maximal monotone graphs both in the bulk and on the boundary. The two graphs are related by a growth condition with the boundary graph that dominates the other one. It turns out that in the limiting procedure the solution of the problem loses some regularity and the limit equation has to be properly interpreted in the sense of a subdifferential inclusion. However, the limit problem is still well-posed since a continuous dependence estimate can be proved. Moreover, in the case when the two graphs exhibit the same growth, it is shown that the solution enjoys more regularity and the boundary condition holds almost everywhere. An error estimate can also be shown for a suitable order of the diffusion parameter.},

The key points of the proofs are various inequalities for the relative entropy associated with the systems and the analysis of the spectrum of a quadratic form capturing the frictional dissipation. The latter task is complicated by the singular nature of the diffusion matrix. This difficulty is addressed by proving its positive definiteness on a subspace and using the Bott--Duffin matrix inverse. The generalized Maxwell--Stefan systems are shown to cover several known cross-diffusion systems for the description of tumor growth and physical vapor deposition processes.},

It is proved that in the weak topology, the solution of the filtering equation converges in probability to a solution of a lower dimensional averaged filtering equation in the limit of large timescale separation.

  abstract     = {We focus on entropy admissible solutions of scalar conservation laws in one space dimension and establish new regularity results with respect to time. First, we assume that the flux function $f$ is strictly convex and show that, for every $ x \in \mathbb{R}$, the total variation of the composite function $f \circ u(\cdot, x)$ is controlled by the total variation of the initial datum. Next, we assume that $f$ is monotone and, under no convexity assumption, we show that, for every $x$, the total variation of the left and the right trace $u(\cdot, x^\pm)$ is controlled by the total variation of the initial datum. We also exhibit a counterexample showing that in the first result the total variation bound does not extend to the function $u$, or equivalently that in the second result we cannot drop the monotonicity assumption. We then discuss applications to a source-destination model for traffic flows on road networks. We introduce a new approach, based on the analysis of transport equations with irregular coefficients, and, under the assumption that the network only contains so-called T-junctions, we establish existence and uniqueness results for merely bounded data in the class of solutions where the traffic is not congested. Our assumptions on the network and the traffic congestion are basically necessary to obtain well-posedness in view of a counterexample due to Bressan and Yu. We also establish stability and propagation of $BV$ regularity, and this is again interesting in view of recent counterexamples.},

  abstract     = {When expressed in Lagrangian variables, the equations of motion for compressible (barotropic) fluids have the structure of a classical Hamiltonian system in which the potential energy is given by the internal energy of the fluid. The dissipative counterpart of such a system coincides with the porous medium equation, which can be cast in the form of a gradient flow for the same internal energy. Motivated by these related variational structures, we propose a particle method for both problems in which the internal energy is replaced by its Moreau--Yosida regularization in the $L^2$ sense, which can be efficiently computed as a semidiscrete optimal transport problem. Using a modulated energy argument which exploits the convexity of the problem in Eulerian variables, we prove quantitative convergence estimates towards smooth solutions. We verify such estimates by means of several numerical tests.},

We propose a new weighted energy functional to establish the uniform estimates, in particular for the time derivatives and the high-order spatial derivatives. The estimates of highest-order spatial derivatives of fast variables are subtle and crucial for the uniform bounds of solutions. The incompressible limit is shown by applying the Helmholtz decomposition, the weak convergence of the velocity, and the strong convergence of its divergence-free component.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to investigating the well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of a class of stochastic nonlocal partial differential equations driven by nonlinear noise. First, the existence of a weak martingale solution is established by using the Faedo--Galerkin approximation and an idea analogous to Da Prato and Zabczyk [Stochastic Equations in Infinite Dimensions, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1992]. Second, we show the uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial values of solutions to the above stochastic nonlocal problem when there exist some variational solutions. Third, the asymptotic local stability of steady-state solutions is analyzed either when the steady-state solution of the deterministic problem is also a solution of the stochastic one or when this does not happen. Next, to study the global asymptotic behavior, namely, the existence of attracting sets of solutions, we consider an approximation of the noise given by Wong and Zakai&#39;s technique using the so called colored noise. For this model, we can use the power of the theory of random dynamical systems and prove the existence of random attractors. Eventually, particularizing in the cases of additive and multiplicative noise, it is proved that the Wong--Zakai approximation models possess random attractors which converge upper-semicontinuously to the respective random attractors of the stochastic equations driven by standard Brownian motions. This fact justifies the use of this colored noise technique to approximate the asymptotic behavior of the models with general nonlinear noises, although the convergence of attractors and solutions is still an open problem.},

For initial condition $u_0(x)$ to (pBO) close to $Q_{0,1}(x)$, it was shown in [K. Z. Zhang, Nonlinearity, 33 (2020), pp. 1064--1093] that the solution $u(x,t)$ to (pBO) remains close to $Q_{a(t),c(t)}(x)$ and approximate parameter dynamics for $(a,c)$ were provided, on a dynamically relevant time scale. In this paper, we prove exact $(a,c)$ parameter dynamics. This is achieved using the basic framework of the paper [K. Z. Zhang, Nonlinearity, 33 (2020), pp. 1064--1093] but adding a local virial estimate for the linearization of (pBO) around the soliton. This is a local-in-space estimate averaged in time, often called a local smoothing estimate, showing that effectively the remainder function in the perturbation analysis is smaller near the soliton than globally in space. A weaker version of this estimate is proved in [C. E. Kenig and Y. Martel, Rev. Mat.

The framework is weakly nonlinear, as the boundary term is of order $ O(\epsilon) $ where the frequencies are of order $ O(1/\epsilon) $. We consider here multiple phases on the boundary, generating a countable infinite number of phases inside the domain, and we therefore use an almost-periodic functional framework. The major difficulties of this work are the lack of symmetry in the leading profile equation and the occurrence of infinitely many resonances (opposite to the simple phase case studied earlier). The leading profile is constructed as the solution of a quasilinear problem, which is solved using a priori estimates without loss of derivatives. The assumptions of this work are illustrated with the example of isentropic Euler equations in space dimension two.},

This allows us to include degenerate, discontinuous weights. The assumption on the smallness parameter is sharp and linear in terms of the integrability exponent of the gradient. This is a novelty even in the linear setting with nondegenerate weights compared to previously known results, where the dependency was exponential.

It is well known that the flow attains the sonic state at the throat, where the cross section is minimum in the Laval nozzle. However, the present friction term changes the position of the sonic state into downstream, which is called chooking. Our goal in this paper is to investigate these phenomena mathematically. From the mathematical point of view, the friction term is different from normal friction terms such as $-\alpha m$ and difficult to treat with. In spite of its physical importance, the friction term has not received much attention until now. For the case without the friction term, the global existence of a solution was obtained by the author. However, for the case with the friction term, there are only restrictive results. The most difficult point is to obtain the bounded estimate of solutions. To solve this problem, we introduce an invariant region depending on the mass. Adjusting the invariant region, we invent a new difference scheme, which yields approximate solutions including the mass.},

These are media consisting of negative-index metamaterials in a shell (plasmonic structure) and positive-index materials in its complement for which the shell is complementary to a part of the core and a part of the exterior of the core-shell structure. We show that an arbitrary object is invisible when it is placed close to a plasmonic structure of a doubly complementary medium as long as its cross section is smaller than a threshold given by the property of the plasmonic structure. To handle the loss of the compactness and of the ellipticity of the modeling Maxwell equations with sign-changing coefficients, we first obtain Cauchy&#39;s problems associated with two Maxwell systems using reflections. We then derive information from them, and combine it with the removing localized singularity technique to deal with the localized resonance. A central part of the analysis on Cauchy&#39;s problems is to establish three-sphere inequalities with partial data for general elliptic systems, which are interesting in themselves. The proof of these inequalities first relies on an appropriate change of variables, inspired by conformal maps, and is then based on Carleman&#39;s estimates for a class of degenerate elliptic systems.},

New methods including weak*-compactness and an approximation scheme are developed in this work to conquer these difficulties. This allows us to obtain a ground state solution and infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the existing literature to obtain the existence and multiplicity results of such a discrete problem under local superquadratic conditions.

  abstract     = {In heat exchangers, an incompressible fluid is heated initially and cooled at the boundary. The goal is to transfer the heat to the boundary as efficiently as possible. In this paper we study a related steady version of this problem where a steadily stirred fluid is uniformly heated in the interior and cooled on the boundary. For a given large Péclet number, how should one stir to minimize some norm of the temperature? This version of the problem was previously studied by Marcotte et al. [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2018), pp. 591--608] in a disk, where the authors used matched asymptotics to show that when the Péclet number, Pe, is sufficiently large one can stir the fluid in a manner that ensures the total heat is $O(1/{Pe})$. In this paper we Pconfirm their results with rigorous proofs and also provide an almost matching lower bound. For simplicity, we work on the infinite strip instead of the unit disk and the proof uses probabilistic techniques.},

In the noncooperative case, we establish the existence of the minimal wave speed of periodic traveling waves and its coincidence with the spreading speed. More specifically, when the system is nondegenerate, the existence of periodic traveling waves is proved by using Schauder&#39;s fixed point theorem and the regularity of analytic semigroup, while in the partially degenerate case, due to the lack of compactness and standard parabolic estimates, the existence result is obtained by appealing to the asymptotic fixed point theorem with the help of some properties of the Kuratowski measure of noncompactness.

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the global existence of smooth sonic-supersonic potential flows in a two-dimensional expanding nozzle with the critical geometry at the inlet. The flow is sonic and its velocity is along the normal direction at the inlet, which is a segment vertical to the walls of the nozzle, and is supersonic in the nozzle. Such a sonic-supersonic model is governed by a quasilinear nonstrictly hyperbolic equation with degeneracy at the inlet, and the degeneracy is strong in the sense that all characteristics from the inlet coincide with the inlet and never approach the domain. Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviors of the average speed on the cross section and the normal acceleration on the walls are of the same order with respect to the distance to the inlet, and of different order with respect to the height of the inlet. We seek the flows whose asymptotic behavior near the inlet is the same as the average speed on the cross section. An interesting phenomenon is that the existence of such sonic-supersonic flows depends on the height of the inlet. More precisely, it is shown by means of a method of characteristics with many elaborate estimates that there exists uniquely such a flow if it is suitably small, while it does not if it is suitably large. The results in the paper, together with other works, describe completely the geometry of the de Laval nozzles where there are smooth transonic flows of Meyer type whose sonic points are all exceptional.},

  abstract     = {The Kuramoto model of coupled second order damped oscillators on convergent sequences of graphs is analyzed in this work. The oscillators in this model have random intrinsic frequencies and interact with each other via nonlinear coupling. The connectivity of the coupled system is assigned by a graph which may be random as well. In the thermodynamic limit the behavior of the system is captured by the Vlasov equation, a hyperbolic partial differential equation for the probability distribution of the oscillators in the phase space. We study stability of mixing, a steady state solution of the Vlasov equation, corresponding to the uniform distribution of phases. Specifically, we identify a critical value of the strength of coupling, at which the system undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation. It corresponds to the loss of stability of mixing and marks the onset of synchronization. As for the classical Kuramoto model, the presence of the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis poses the main difficulty for the stability analysis. To overcome this problem, we use the methods from the generalized spectral theory developed for the original Kuramoto model. The analytical results are illustrated with numerical bifurcation diagrams computed for the Kuramoto model on Erdös--Rényi and small-world graphs. Applications of the second order Kuramoto model include power networks, coupled pendula, and various biological networks. The analysis in this paper provides a mathematical description of the onset of synchronization in these systems.},

In proving this, we develop a novel mathematical scheme by analyzing the generalized polarization tensors (GPTs) and the scattering coefficients (SCs) coming from the associated scattered fields, which in turn boils down to the analysis of the layer potential operators that sit inside the GPTs and SCs via microlocal analysis. In a delicate and subtle manner, we decompose the reconstruction process into several steps, where all but one step depends on the global geometry, and one particular step depends on the mean curvature at the given boundary point. Then by a sensitivity analysis with respect to local perturbations of the curvature of the boundary surface, we establish the local resolution effects.

  abstract     = {In the first main result of this paper, we prove that one can approximate discontinuous solutions of the 1d Navier--Stokes system with solutions of the 1d Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system as the capillarity parameter tends to 0. Moreover, we allow the viscosity coefficients $\mu=\mu\left( \rho\right) $ to degenerate near vacuum. In order to obtain this result, we propose two main technical novelties. First, we provide an upper bound for the density verifying NSK that does not degenerate when the capillarity coefficient tends to 0. Second, we are able to show that the positive part of the effective velocity is bounded uniformly w.r.t. the capillary coefficient. This turns out to be crucial in providing a lower bound for the density. The second main result states the existence of a unique finite-energy global strong solution for the 1d Navier--Stokes system assuming only that $\rho_{0},1/\rho_{0}\in L^{\infty}$. This last result finds itself a natural application in the context of the mathematical modeling of multiphase flows.},

This feature is crucial from a numerical perspective, as it provides the foundations to derive sharper error estimates and paves the way to devise efficient adaptive space-time boundary element methods, which will be tackled in future work. On the other hand, the proposed approach is compatible with the current time dependent boundary element method&#39;s implementations, and we predict that it explains many of the behaviors observed in practice but that were not understood with the existing theory.},

The proof is based on a novel iteration scheme: with an auxiliary random variable counting the firing events, both the density function of the stochastic process and the solution of the PDE problem admit series representations, and thus the difficulty in verifying the link between the density function and the PDE solution in each subproblem is greatly mitigated. The iteration approach provides a generic framework for integrating the probability approach with PDE techniques, with which we prove that the density function of the diffusion-jump stochastic process is indeed the classical solution of the Fokker--Planck equation with a unique flux-shift structure.},

The data points are sampled from a distribution supported on a smooth manifold. The family of equations that we study arises in data analysis in the context of graph-based learning and contains, as important examples, the equations satisfied by graph Laplacian eigenvectors. In particular, we prove high probability interior and global Lipschitz estimates for solutions of graph Poisson equations. Our results can be used to show that graph Laplacian eigenvectors are, with high probability, essentially Lipschitz regular with constants depending explicitly on their corresponding eigenvalues. Our analysis relies on a probabilistic coupling argument of suitable random walks at the continuum level, and an interpolation method for extending functions on random point clouds to the continuum manifold. As a byproduct of our general regularity results, we obtain high probability $L^\infty$ and approximate $\mathcal{C}^{0,1}$ convergence rates for the convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors toward eigenfunctions of the corresponding weighted Laplace--Beltrami operators. The convergence rates we obtain scale like the $L^2$ convergence rates established in J. Calder and N. García Trillos, arXiv:1910.13476, 2019.},

We consider rather general interaction kernels, nonlinear viscosity, and nonlinear friction. Particularly, we include normalized kernels which display a singularity when the flux of particles vanishes. Thus, in terms of the Cauchy theory for the kinetic equation, we extend to more general interactions and complete the program initiated in [I. M. Gamba and M.-J. Kang, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 222 (2016), pp. 317--342] (where the authors assume that the singularity does not take place) and in [A. Figalli, M.-J. Kang, and J. Morales, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 227 (2018), pp. 869--896] (where the authors prove that the singularity does not happen in the spatially homogeneous case). Moreover, we derive an explicit lower time of existence as well as a global existence criterion that is applicable, among other cases, to obtain a long time theory for nonrenormalized kernels and for the original Vicsek problem without any a priori assumptions. On the second part of the paper, we also establish the mean-field limit in the large particle limit for an approximated (regularized) system that coincides with the original one whenever the flux does not vanish. Based on the results proved for the limit kinetic equation, we prove that for short times, the probability that the dynamics of this approximated particle system coincides with the original singular dynamics tends to one in the many particle limit.},

Specifically, it is proven in the present work that there exists a triple of integrable functions $(n,c,{u})$ solving the system globally in a generalized sense provided that $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ satisfies $f(0)\ge0$ and $f(n)\le rn-\mu n^{\gamma}$ ($n\ge0$) with any $\gamma&gt;1$.

The unforced Hamiltonian, $H^0$, is known to generically have Dirac (conical) points in its band spectrum. The evolution under $H^\varepsilon(t)$ of band-limited Dirac wave-packets (spectrally localized near the Dirac point) is well-approximated on large time scales ($t\lesssim \varepsilon^{-2+}$) by an effective time-periodic Dirac equation with a gap in its quasi-energy spectrum. This quasi-energy gap is typical of many reduced models of time-periodic (Floquet) materials and plays a role in conclusions drawn about the full system: conduction vs. insulation, topological vs. nontopological bands. Much is unknown about the nature of the quasi-energy spectrum of original time-periodic Schrödinger equations, and it is believed that no such quasi-energy gap occurs. In this paper, we explain how to transfer quasi-energy gap information about the effective Dirac dynamics to conclusions about the full Schrödinger dynamics. We introduce the notion of an effective quasi-energy gap and establish its existence in the Schrödinger model. In the current setting, an effective quasi-energy gap is an interval of quasi-energies which does not support modes with large spectral projection onto band-limited Dirac wave-packets. The notion of effective quasi-energy gap is a physically relevant relaxation of the strict notion of quasi-energy spectral gap; if a system is tuned to drive or measure at momenta and energies near the Dirac point of $H^0$, then the resulting modes in the effective quasi-energy gap will only be weakly excited and detected.},

We prove that this problem is equivalent to a coupling condition introduced by Holden and Risebro. An $L^1$-contraction property of the coupling condition and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem are proved. Existence is obtained by a kinetic approximation of Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook type together with a kinetic coupling condition obtained by a kinetic maximum entropy dissipation problem. The arguments do not require total variation bounds on the initial data compared to previous results. We also discuss the role of the entropies involved in the macroscopic coupling condition at the traffic junction by studying an example.},

  abstract     = {The half-space matching (HSM) method has recently been developed as a new method for the solution of two-dimensional scattering problems with complex backgrounds, providing an alternative to perfectly matched layers or other artificial boundary conditions. Based on half-plane representations for the solution, the scattering problem is rewritten as a system of integral equations in which the unknowns are restrictions of the solution to the boundaries of a finite number of overlapping half-planes contained in the domain: this integral equation system is coupled to a standard finite element discretization localized around the scatterer. While satisfactory numerical results have been obtained for real wavenumbers, well-posedness and equivalence to the original scattering problem have been established only for complex wavenumbers. In the present paper, by combining the HSM framework with a complex-scaling technique, we provide a new formulation for real wavenumbers which is provably well-posed and has the attraction for computation that the complex-scaled solutions of the integral equation system decay exponentially at infinity. The analysis requires the study of double-layer potential integral operators on intersecting infinite lines, and their analytic continuations. The effectiveness of the method is validated by preliminary numerical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we characterize the regularity structure, as well as show the global-in-time existence and uniqueness, of (energy) conservative solutions to the Hunter--Saxton equation by using the method of characteristics. The major difference between the current work and previous results is that we are able to characterize the singularities of energy measure and their nature in a very precise manner. In particular, we show that singularities, whose temporal and spatial locations are also explicitly given in this work, may only appear at at most countably many times, and are completely determined by the absolutely continuous part of initial energy measure. Our mathematical analysis is based on using the method of characteristics in a generalized framework that consists of the evolutions of solutions to the Hunter--Saxton equation and the energy measure. This method also provides a clear description of the semigroup property for the solution and energy measure for all times.},

  abstract     = {Let $\mu_2(\Omega)$ be the first positive eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$. It was proved by Szegö for $N=2$ and by Weinberger for $N \geq 2$ that among all equimeasurable domains $\mu_2(\Omega)$ attains its global maximum if $\Omega$ is a ball. In the present work, we develop the approach of Weinberger in two directions. First, we refine the Szegö--Weinberger result for a class of domains of the form $\Omega_{\text{out}} \setminus \overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}$ which are either centrally symmetric or symmetric of order 2 (with respect to every coordinate plane $(x_i,x_j)$) by showing that $\mu_{2}(\Omega_{\text{out}} \setminus \overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}) \leq \mu_2(B_\beta \setminus \overline{B}_\alpha)$, where $B_{\alpha}, B_{\beta}$ are balls centered at the origin such that $B_{\alpha} \subset \Omega_{\text{in}}$ and $|\Omega_{\text{out}}\setminus \overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}| =|B_{\beta}\setminus \overline{B}_{\alpha}|$. Second, we provide Szegö--Weinberger type inequalities for higher eigenvalues by imposing additional symmetry assumptions on the domain. Namely, if $\Omega_{\text{out}} \setminus \overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}$ is symmetric of order 4, then we prove $\mu_{i}(\Omega_{\text{out}} \setminus \overline{\Omega}_{\text{in}}) \leq \mu_i(B_\beta \setminus \overline{B}_\alpha)$ for $i=3,\dots,N+2$, where we also allow $\Omega_{\text{in}}$ and $B_{\alpha}$ to be empty. If $N=2$ and the domain is symmetric of order 8, then the latter inequality persists for $i=5$. Counterexamples to the obtained inequalities for domains outside of the considered symmetry classes are given. The existence and properties of nonradial domains with required symmetries in higher dimensions are discussed. As an auxiliary result, we obtain the nonradiality of the eigenfunctions associated to $\mu_{N+2}(B_\beta \setminus \overline{B}_\alpha)$.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we mainly focus on radial transonic solutions for the steady hydrodynamic model of semiconductors represented by Euler--Poisson equations with sonic boundary in $n$ dimensions. In an annulus domain, given constant electronic current $j_0$ at the inner boundary and the sonic data of boundary electronic density $(\rho_0,\rho_1)$, we present that the Euler--Poisson system possesses infinitely many transonic shock solutions when the relaxation time is large and infinitely many $C^1$-smooth transonic solutions when the relaxation time is small and the doping profile is continuous. To study the structure of shock-transonic steady-states, the approach is the constructive method based on the entropy condition and Rankine--Hugoniot jump condition. To show the existence of $C^1$-smooth solutions, the adopted approach is the local continuation method, and the derivation on $C^1$-regularity of transonic steady-states is based on a new defined iterative approximation combining the singularity analysis on the critical point. The difficulties caused by the high dimensions for the system and the nonconstant doping both are essential. In short, the concept of local analysis throughout the entire proof is the basis and the core for solving this nonautonomous system.},

The effective equation for the dynamics at the quintic order, obtained in previous papers by quasilinear normal form, contains resonances corresponding to nontrivial terms in the energy estimates. Such resonances cannot be avoided by tuning external parameters (simply because the Kirchhoff equation does not contain parameters). In this paper we introduce nonresonance conditions on the initial data of the Cauchy problem and prove a lower bound $\varepsilon^{-6}$ for the lifespan of the corresponding solutions (the standard local theory gives $\varepsilon^{-2}$, and the normal form for the cubic terms gives $\varepsilon^{-4}$). The proof relies on the fact that, under these nonresonance conditions, the growth rate of the “superactions” of the effective equations on large time intervals is smaller (by a factor $\varepsilon^2$) than its a priori estimate based on the normal form for the cubic terms. The set of initial data satisfying such nonresonance conditions contains several nontrivial examples that are discussed in the paper.},

Our main interest is to model species-dependent diffusivities, while at the same time ensuring thermodynamic consistency. A key difficulty of the nonisothermal case lies in the intrinsic presence of cross-diffusion type phenomena like the Soret and the Dufour effect: due to the temperature/energy dependence of the thermodynamic equilibria, a nonvanishing temperature gradient may drive a concentration flux even in a situation with constant concentrations; likewise, a nonvanishing concentration gradient may drive a heat flux even in a case of spatially constant temperature. We use time discretization and regularization techniques and derive a priori estimates based on a suitable entropy and the associated entropy production. Renormalized solutions are used in cases where nonintegrable diffusion fluxes or reaction terms appear.},

Solutions on an energy surface of the ground state are characterized. We prove that solutions with kinetic energy less than that of the ground state must scatter to zero or belong to the stable/unstable manifolds of the ground state. In the latter case they converge to the ground state exponentially in the energy space as $t\to \infty$ or $t\to -\infty$. (In three-dimensions without radial assumption, this holds under the compactness assumption of nonscattering solutions on the energy surface.) When the kinetic energy is greater than that of the ground state, we show that all radial $H^1$ solutions blow up in finite time, with the only two exceptions being in the case of five-dimensions which belong to the stable/unstable manifold of the ground state. The proof relies on detailed spectral analysis, local invariant manifold theory, and a global Virial analysis.},

We assume that a diffuse interface already has developed and that it is in contact with the boundary $\partial\Omega$. The boundary condition is designed in such a way that the limit problem is given by the mean curvature flow with constant $\alpha$-contact angle. For $\alpha$ close to 90° we prove a local in time convergence result for well-prepared initial data for times when a smooth solution to the limit problem exists. Based on the latter we construct a suitable curvilinear coordinate system and carry out a rigorous asymptotic expansion for the Allen--Cahn equation with the nonlinear Robin boundary condition. Moreover, we show a spectral estimate for the corresponding linearized Allen--Cahn operator and with its aid we derive strong norm estimates for the difference of the exact and approximate solutions using a Gronwall-type argument.},

For any appropriately regular initial data, we prove the global existence and uniqueness of the classical solution to the corresponding two-dimensional system when $\mu_1\geq0,\mu_2=0$, and $\tau\in{0,1}$, and obtain the boundedness of this solution under an explicit smallness condition on $\eta$ when $\mu_1=\mu_2=0$ and $\tau=1$.
