  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a geometric Melnikov method to analyze a two-dimensional stable or unstable manifold associated with a saddle point in three-dimensional nonvolume preserving autonomous flows. The time-varying perturbed location of such a manifold is obtained under very general, nonvolume preserving and with arbitrary time-dependence, perturbations. We demonstrate the explicit computability of the leading-order spatio-temporal location of the manifold using our formulas. In unperturbed situations with a two-dimensional heteroclinic manifold, we adapt our theory to quantify the splitting into a stable and unstable manifold, and thereby obtain an instantaneous flux quantification in terms of a Melnikov function. The time-varying instantaneous flux theory does not require any intersections between perturbed manifolds, nor rely on descriptions of lobe dynamics. Our theory has specific application to transport in fluid mechanics, where the flow is in three dimensions and flow separators in forward/backward time are two-dimensional stable/unstable manifolds. We demonstrate our theory using both the classical and swirling versions of Hill’s spherical vortex.},

In this paper, we extend a recently established subgradient method for the computation of Riemannian metrics that optimizes certain singular value functions associated with dynamical systems. This extension is threefold. First, we introduce a projected subgradient method which results in Riemannian metrics whose parameters are confined to a compact convex set and we can thus prove that a minimizer exists; second, we allow inexact subgradients and study the effect of the errors on the computed metrics; and third, we analyze the subgradient algorithm for three different choices of step sizes: constant, exogenous, and Polyak. The new methods are illustrated by application to dimension and entropy estimation of the Hénon map.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Localized persistent cortical neural activity is a validated neural substrate of parametric working memory. Such activity “bumps” represent the continuous location of a cue over several seconds. Pyramidal (excitatory (E)) and interneuronal (inhibitory (I)) subpopulations exhibit tuned bumps of activity, linking neural dynamics to behavioral inaccuracies observed in memory recall. However, many bump attractor models collapse these subpopulations into a single joint E/I(lateral inhibitory) population and do not consider the role of interpopulation neural architecture and noise correlations. Both factors have a high potential to impinge upon the stochastic dynamics of these bumps, ultimately shaping behavioral response variance. In our study, we consider a neural field model with separate E/I populations and leverage asymptotic analysis to derive a nonlinear Langevin system describing E/I bump interactions. While the E bump attracts the I bump, the I bump stabilizes but can also repel the E bump, which can result in prolonged relaxation dynamics when both bumps are perturbed. Furthermore, the structure of noise correlations within and between subpopulations strongly shapes the variance in bump position. Surprisingly, higher interpopulation correlations reduce variance.},

We analyze a family of clustered excitatory-inhibitory neural networks and the underlying bifurcation structures that arise because of permutation symmetries in the network as the global coupling strength is varied. We primarily consider two network topologies: an all-to-all connected network which excludes self-connections, and a network in which the excitatory cells are broken into clusters of equal size. Although in both cases the bifurcation structure is determined by symmetries in the system, the behavior of the two systems is qualitatively different. In the all-to-all connected network, the system undergoes Hopf bifurcations leading to periodic orbit solutions; notably, for large , there is a single, stable periodic orbit solution and no stable fixed points. By contrast, in the clustered network, there are no Hopf bifurcations, and there is a family of stable fixed points for large .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Koopman operator theory has gained interest in the past decade as a framework for rigorously transforming nonlinear dynamics on the state space into linear dynamics on Koopman-invariant function spaces. These Koopman-invariant spaces can be approximated purely through data-driven methodologies, which then enables future state prediction and the application of classical linear control to strongly nonlinear systems. Recently in literature, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) was developed for systems represented through eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. However, the controller was limited to using real-valued eigenfunctions for conservative systems. In this paper, we extend the Koopman LQR framework to use multiple complex eigenfunctions. We illustrate in several examples that our proposed extension enables Koopman LQR to control dissipative systems and to drive different nonlinear oscillators to stabilize at nonequilibrium points and follow arbitrarily prescribed targets, which was not possible using a single real-valued Koopman eigenfunction.},

Significant past work has characterized properties of canard solutions, which spend unexpectedly long times near dynamically unstable manifolds in the phase space of an underlying dynamical system. We have recently introduced techniques to identify and analyze rivers, which are a class of trajectories that can serve as transient attractors in phase space. In this work, after generalizing the concept of rivers to arbitrary dimensions and introducing a classification of rivers, we show that maximal canards in systems with one fast and two slow variables are rivers of infinite order, or river canards. We use this relationship to provide new insights about how nearby trajectories behave and about how river canards organize the flow near the fold of a critical manifold. This analysis includes the calculation of the way-in way-out function, which provides an estimate for the extent of the delay in escape that trajectories experience when passing near the fold of a critical manifold with canard dynamics, without the need for complexification of time. We also illustrate our results for the well-known autocatalator system.},

We obtain estimates of the relative attractiveness of each one of the cycles by computing their stability indices. For the parameter values ensuring the asymptotic stability of the network we relate the attractiveness properties of each cycle to the others. In particular, for three of the cycles we show that if one of them has a weak form of attractiveness, then the other two are completely unstable.

Particles suspended in fluid flow through a curved duct focus to stable equilibrium positions in the duct cross-section due to the balance of two dominant forces: (i) inertial lift force, arising from the inertia of the fluid, and (ii) secondary drag force, resulting from cross-sectional vortices induced by the curvature of the duct. Such particle focusing is exploited in various medical and industrial technologies aimed at separating particles by size. Using the theoretical model developed by Harding, Stokes, and Bertozzi [J. Fluid Mech., 875 (2019), pp. 1–43], we numerically investigate the dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles in fluid flow through curved ducts with rectangular cross-sections at low flow rates. We explore the rich bifurcations that take place in the particle equilibria as a function of three system parameters—particle size, duct bend radius, and aspect ratio of the cross-section. We also explore the transient dynamics of particles as they focus to their equilibria by delineating the effects of these three parameters, as well as the initial location of the particle inside the cross-section, on the focusing dynamics.},

We then prove that our estimator is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically normal when the number of observations and the number of particles tend to infinity, and we provide a rate of convergence toward the exact value of the parameters.

As it turns out, the dynamics of our model is driven by a two-dimensional discontinuous piecewise linear map for which we provide an in-depth analytical and numerical investigation. Among other things, we obtain in explicit form the boundaries of the periodicity regions associated with attracting cycles with rotation number , These boundaries correspond to border collision bifurcations of the related cycles. We show that the periodicity regions are organized in a specific period adding structure, and some of the regions may overlap. Several examples of coexisting cycles and their basins of attraction are also presented. Economically, our results offer a new explanation for the boom-bust behavior of actual financial markets.},

  abstract     = {In two-dimensional space, we investigate the slow dynamics of multiple localized spots with oscillatory tails in a specific three-component reaction-diffusion system, whose key feature is that the spots attract or repel each other alternatively according to their mutual distances, leading to rather complex patterns. One fundamental pattern is the ring pattern, consisting of $N$ equally distributed spots on a circle with a certain radius. Depending on the parameters of the system, stationary or moving (i.e., traveling and rotating) $N$-spot rings can be observed. In order to understand the emergence of these patterns, we describe the dynamics of $N$ spots by a set of reduced ODEs encoding the information of each spot&#39;s location and velocity. On the basis of the reduced system, we analytically study the existence and stability of stationary and moving $N$-spot ring solutions, which keep most of the essential features of the collective motion of self-propelled particles. Numerical simulations of both PDEs and ODEs are provided to verify our results, and the comparison between them implies several future challenges including emergence of new spots and effects of higher order terms.},

  abstract     = {Excitable media are systems which are at rest in the absence of external input but which respond to a sufficiently strong stimulus by sending a wave of &quot;excitation&quot;across the medium. Examples include cardiac, cortical, and other tissue in the central nervous system. In each of these examples evidence of rotating spiral waves has been observed and associated with abnormalities. How such waves are initiated is not well understood. In this numerical study of a standard mathematical model of excitable media, we obtain spirals and other oscillatory patterns by a method, simple in design, which had previously been ruled out. This method applies in a parameter range of &quot;low excitability.&quot; We analyze the early stages of this process and show that long term stable oscillatory behavior, including spiral waves, can start with very simple initial conditions, such as two small spots of excitation and all other areas at rest, and no subsequent input or disturbance. Thus, there are no refractory cells in the initial condition. For this model, even random spots of stimulation result in periodic patterns relatively often, leading us to suggest that this could happen in living tissue.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with uncertainty propagation of general stochastic hybrid systems (GSHSs) where the continuous state space is a compact Lie group. A computational framework is proposed to solve the Fokker--Planck (FP) equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function for the state of GSHSs. The FP equation is split into two parts: the partial differential operator corresponding to the continuous dynamics and the integral operator arising from the discrete dynamics. These two parts are solved alternatively using the operator splitting technique. Specifically, the partial differential equation is solved by the spectral method where the density function is decomposed into a linear combination of a complete orthonormal function basis brought forth by the Peter--Weyl theorem, thereby resulting an ordinary differential equation. Next, the integral equation is solved by approximating the integral by a finite summation using a quadrature rule. The proposed method is then applied to a three-dimensional rigid body pendulum colliding with a wall, evolving on the product of the three-dimensional special orthogonal group and the Euclidean space. It is illustrated that the proposed method exhibits more accurate numerical results than the conventional Gaussian approach formulated in the tangent space by comparing with a Monte Carlo simulation while explicitly generating the density function that carries the complete stochastic information of the hybrid state.},

Using the intrinsic properties of the Koopman operator, we show that eigenfunctions for the subsystems induce eigenfunctions for the whole system. The use of principal eigenfunctions allows us to reverse this result. Similarly for the adjoint operator, the Perron--Frobenius operator, invariant measures for the dynamical system induce invariant measures of the subsystems, while constructing invariant measures from invariant measures of the subsystems is less straightforward. We address this question and show that under necessary compatibility assumptions such an invariant measure exists. Based on these results we demonstrate that the a priori knowledge of a decomposition of a dynamical system allows for a reduction of the computational cost on the examples of the dynamic mode decomposition and invariant measure computation.},

Here, we cast the classic energy-shaping control design process in an optimal control framework; once a task-dependent performance metric is defined, an optimal solution is systematically obtained through an iterative procedure relying on neural networks and gradient-based optimization.

When interactions are more general, we prove existence of the waves and use perturbation theory to estimate the shape, frequency, and stability of the waves. For large holes, we show that the phase satisfies a Burgers-type equation. We show that as the hole in the annulus decreases, the waves lose stability.

  abstract     = {Tangencies correspond to singularities of impact systems, separating between impacting and non-impacting trajectory segments. The closure of their orbits constitutes the singularity set, which, even in the simpler billiard limit, is known to have a complex structure. The properties of this set are studied in a class of near integrable two degrees-of-freedom Hamiltonian impact systems. For this class of systems, in the integrable limit, on iso-energy surfaces, tangency appears at an isolated torus. We construct a piecewise smooth iso-energy return map for the perturbed flow near such a tangent torus. Away from the singularity set, this map has invariant curves, so, the singularity set is included in a limiting singularity band. An asymptotic upper bound of this band width is found for both non-resonant and resonant tangent tori. In the Diophantine case the band extent to both the impacting and nonimpacting regimes is, asymptotically, of order (\epsilon). In the resonance case its asymptotic extent to the nonimpacting regime is at most of order (\sqrt\epsilon) whereas its maximal asymptotic extent to the impacting regime is of order (\epsilon^2/3). Studying numerically a truncated standard form of the return map which is integrable at (\epsilon=0) and has a square root singularity with a singularity parameter (\alpha) reveals that only the strongest resonance obeys this maximal extent resonance scaling. We find that for all but one resonant case the singularity band has connecting orbits from its lower to its upper boundaries. The number of iterates required for an orbit to visit close to both the lower and upper boundaries of the singularity band diverges as (\epsilon\alpha^2) is decreased, giving rise to a multitude of transient complex phenomena. On the other hand, large (\alpha) values at a fixed small (\epsilon) lead to a significant reduction in this connection time.},

  abstract     = {We present an analysis of activity patterns in a neuronal network that consists of three mutually inhibitory neurons with voltage-sensitive piecewise smooth coupling. This network model is motivated by the respiratory neuronal network in the mammalian brainstem and is able to exhibit various activity patterns including bistability of relaxation oscillation solutions in which activation propagates around the ring in opposite directions. One of the observed propagating solutions appears to be contrary to the network architecture and is characterized by a sudden “turn-around&quot; of trajectories during fast transitions between quasi-stable states. Standard fast-slow analysis provides the set of fast subsystem fixed points and transition surfaces parametrized by slow variables, but due to the voltage-sensitive nature of the coupling it fails to describe the mechanism underlying the sudden “turn-around&quot; during fast jumps. By considering a linear, reduced form of the model system that preserves the solution structure, we are able to perform a thorough analysis of the oscillations, which reveals novel adaptive escape and adaptive release phase transition mechanisms. To determine where the fast jumps actually go, we exploit the piecewise smooth nature of the coupling to consider a sequence of fast subsystems defined in a piecewise way. Our analysis shows that there are three possible scenarios during fast jumps, which may depend on both the fast dynamics and the slow dynamics. First, the fast dynamics may succeed to equilibrate at (or near) a critical manifold branch, after which the slow dynamics relaxes to its own fixed point, pulling the slaved fast variables along the critical manifold. Second, while the fast dynamics tries to equilibrate to a critical manifold, the slow dynamics may push the fast system through a bifurcation, which forces a second fast jump to a new critical manifold component, after which the slow relaxation follows. Third, the critical manifold component expected to be attracting may be lost prior to fast subsystem equilibration or may be inaccessible due to separatrix geometry, in which case the fast dynamics is forced to approach a new critical manifold directly. In the second and third cases, we observe the sudden``turn-around&quot; during fast jumps.},

In particular, methods using time delayed observables, such as Hankel DMD, are biased when the dynamics are random. We introduce a new, robust DMD algorithm that can approximate the stochastic Koopman operator despite the presence of noise. We then demonstrate how this algorithm can be applied to time delayed observables, which allows us to generate a Krylov subspace from a single observable. This allows us to compute a realization of the stochastic Koopman operator using a single observable measured over a single trajectory.

  abstract     = {Differential equation-based physiological models of sleep-wake networks describe sleep-wake regulation by simulating the activity of wake- and sleep-promoting neuronal populations and the modulation of these populations by homeostatic and circadian (${\sim}24$ h) drives. Here, we consider a sleep-wake flip-flop network model consisting of mutually inhibitory interactions between wake- and sleep-promoting neuronal populations. Motivated by changes in sleep behavior during early childhood as babies transition from napping to nonnapping behavior, we vary homeostatic and circadian modulation and analyze effects on resulting sleep-wake patterns. To identify the types and sequences of bifurcations leading to changes in stable sleep-wake patterns in this piecewise-smooth model, we employ multiple mathematical methods, including fast-slow decomposition and numerical computation of circle maps. We find that the average daily number of sleeps exhibits a period adding sequence as the homeostatic time constants are reduced, and that the temporal circadian profile influences the number of observed solutions in the sequence. These solutions emerge through sequences of saddle-node and border collision bifurcations, where the particular sequence depends on parameter values. When the temporal circadian profile is steep, as may occur with long day lengths, some sleep patterns are lost and bistability of other sleep patterns can be observed. We analyze a limiting case of the temporal circadian waveform, a circadian hard switch model, to understand this loss of solutions. Generally, our multipronged approach provides an alternative analysis method for describing bifurcations in high-dimensional, nonautonomous piecewise-smooth systems.},

  abstract     = {This contribution analyzes the widely used and well-known “intelligent driver model” (briefly IDM), which is a second-order car-following model governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Although this model was intensively studied in recent years for properly capturing traffic phenomena and driver braking behavior, a rigorous study of the well-posedness has, to our knowledge, never been performed. First, it is shown that, for a specific class of initial data, the vehicles&#39; velocities become negative or even diverge to (-\infty\) in finite time, both undesirable properties for a car-following model. Various modifications of the IDM are then proposed in order to avoid such ill-posedness. The theoretical remediation of the model, rather than post facto by ad hoc modification of code implementations, allows a more sound numerical implementation and preservation of the model features. Indeed, to avoid inconsistencies and ensure dynamics close to the one of the original model, one may need to inspect and clean large input data, which may result in practically impossible scenarios for large-scale simulations. Although well-posedness issues might only occur for specific initial data, this may happen frequently when different traffic scenarios are analyzed and especially in the presence of lane changing, on-ramps, and other network components, as it is the case for most commonly used microsimulators. On the other side, it is shown that well-posedness can be guaranteed by straight-forward improvements, such as those obtained by slightly changing the acceleration to prevent the velocity from becoming negative.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a procedure to compute reducible invariant tori and their stable and unstable manifolds in Poincaré maps. The method has two steps. In the first step we compute, by means of a quadratically convergent scheme, the Fourier series of the torus, its Floquet transformation, and its Floquet matrix. If the torus has stable and/or unstable directions, in the second step we compute the Taylor--Fourier expansions of the corresponding invariant manifolds up to a given order. The paper also discusses the case in which the torus is highly unstable so that a multiple shooting strategy is needed to compute the torus. If the order of the Taylor expansion of the manifolds is fixed and $N$ is the number of Fourier modes, the whole computational effort (torus and manifolds) increases as $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ and the memory required behaves as $\mathcal{O}(N)$. This makes the algorithm very suitable to compute high-dimensional tori for which a huge number of Fourier modes are needed. Besides, the algorithm has a very high degree of parallelism. The paper includes examples where we compute invariant tori (of dimensions up to 5) of quasi-periodically forced ODEs. The computations are run in a parallel computer, and the method&#39;s efficiency with respect to the number of processors is also discussed.},

The study of Painlevé paradoxes in three dimensions (3D) has received far less attention. In this paper, we highlight the pivotal role in the dynamics of the azimuthal angular velocity $\Psi$ by proving the existence of three critical values of $\Psi$, one of which occurs independently of any paradox. We show that the 2D problem is highly singular and uncover a rich geometry in the 3D problem, which we use to explain recent numerical results.},

We express the Newton--Euler equations of motion into the Hamiltonian formalism employing a noncanonical Poisson structure. For this system, we identify the full-symmetry group given by the Galilean group. We carry out a partial reduction in two stages: translational and rotational symmetries. Moreover, we identify the Poisson structure at each stage of the reduction process. A characterization of relative equilibria is provided. It allows for classification and shows that the centers of mass of all bodies move in parallel planes. The case of $N&gt;2$ reveals a rather different scenario from $N=2$. Precisely, the relative equilibria are classified as follows: Lagrangian equilibria, in which all the bodies are moving in the same plane; nonLagrangian equilibria, in which each body is in a different plane; and semi-Lagrangian equilibria, in which some of the bodies share a common plane but not all of them are in the same one. The main novelty in the equilibria classification is that the plane of motion of the center of mass does not need to be parallel to the plane determined by the total angular momentum. In our analysis, we specify sufficient conditions ensuring the planes of motion are parallel to the total angular momentum plane.},

We study SPDEs with a cubic nonlinearity, where the deterministic equation is close to a change of stability of the trivial solution. The natural separation of time scales close to this bifurcation allows us to obtain an amplitude equation describing the essential dynamics of the bifurcating pattern, thus reducing the original infinite dimensional dynamics to simpler finite dimensional effective dynamics. In the presence of a multiplicative stable Lévy noise that preserves the constant trivial solution we study the impact of noise on the approximation. In contrast to Gaussian noise, where due to averaging effects nondominant patterns are uniformly small in time, large jumps in the Lévy noise might lead to large error terms, and thus new estimates are needed to take this into account.},

Our particular interest is in the periodic traveling waves, which we construct and study in detail. The main results are that, for all natural values of the parameters, the periodic dnoidal waves are spectrally stable with respect to perturbations of the same period. For another natural set of parameters, we construct the snoidal waves, which exhibit instabilities, in the same setup. Our results are the first instability results in this context. On the other hand, the spectral stability established herein improves significantly on the work of Angulo, Corcho, and Hakkaev [Adv. Difference Equ., 16 (2011), pp. 523--550], which established stability of the dnoidal waves, on a subset of parameter space, by relying on the Grillakis--Shatah theory.

By applying the theory of large delay to the corresponding Ott--Antonsen equation, we explain fully analytically the mechanisms for the appearance of multiple coexisting partially locked states. Closely above the onset of synchronization, these states emerge in the Eckhaus scenario: With increasing coupling, more and more partially locked states appear unstable from the incoherent state and gain stability for larger coupling at a modulational stability boundary. The partially locked states with strongly detuned frequencies are shown to emerge subcritical and gain stability only after a fold and a series of Hopf bifurcations. We also discuss the role of the Sakaguchi phase lag parameter. For small delays, it determines, together with the delay time, the attraction or repulsion to the central frequency, which leads to supercritical or subcritical behavior, respectively. For large delay, the Sakaguchi parameter does not influence the global dynamical scenario.},

  abstract     = {Nonlocal advection is a key process in a range of biological systems, from cells within individuals to the movement of whole organisms. Consequently, in recent years, there has been increasing attention on modeling non-local advection mathematically. These often take the form of partial differential equations, with integral terms modeling the nonlocality. One common formalism is the aggregation-diffusion equation, a class of advection-diffusion models with nonlocal advection. This was originally used to model a single population but has recently been extended to the multispecies case to model the way organisms may alter their movement in the presence of coexistent species. Here we prove existence theorems for a class of nonlocal multispecies advection-diffusion models, with an arbitrary number of coexistent species. We prove global existence for models in $n=1$ spatial dimension and local existence for $n&gt;1$. We describe an efficient spectral method for numerically solving these models and provide an example simulation output. Overall, this helps provide a solid mathematical foundation for studying the effect of interspecies interactions on movement and space use.},

Thus, understanding the existence and stability of 1D spirals plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of the unwanted reflected pulses. Mathematically, we probe these issues by viewing the 1D spiral as a time-periodic antisymmetric source defect. Through a combination of direct numerical simulation and continuation methods, we investigate the existence and stability of a 1D spiral wave in a qualitative ionic model to determine how the system&#39;s propensity for reflections is influenced by system parameters. Our results support and extend a previous hypothesis that the 1D spiral is an unstable periodic orbit that emerges through a global rearrangement of heteroclinic orbits, and we identify key parameters and physiological processes that promote and deter reflection behavior.},

  abstract     = {Sequences of neural activity arise in many brain areas, including cortex, hippocampus, and central pattern generator circuits that underlie rhythmic behaviors like locomotion. While network architectures supporting sequence generation vary considerably, a common feature is an abundance of inhibition. In this work, we focus on architectures that support sequential activity in recurrently connected networks with inhibition-dominated dynamics. Specifically, we study emergent sequences in a special family of threshold-linear networks, called combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs), whose connectivity matrices are defined from directed graphs. Such networks naturally give rise to an abundance of sequences whose dynamics are tightly connected to the underlying graph. We find that architectures based on generalizations of cycle graphs produce limit cycle attractors that can be activated to generate transient or persistent (repeating) sequences. Each architecture type gives rise to an infinite family of graphs that can be built from arbitrary component subgraphs. Moreover, we prove a number of graph rules for the corresponding CTLNs in each family. The graph rules allow us to strongly constrain, and in some cases fully determine, the fixed points of the network in terms of the fixed points of the component subnetworks. Finally, we also show how the structure of certain architectures gives insight into the sequential dynamics of the corresponding attractor.},

A block triangular structure of the system is discovered by combining both Tarjan&#39;s algorithm for computing strongly connected components of a graph defined for the system and Gauss--Jordan elimination. This particular structure enables one to greatly reduce the size of polynomial systems defining border curves.

  abstract     = {The increasing availability of data presents an opportunity to calibrate unknown parameters which appear in complex models of phenomena in the biomedical, physical, and social sciences. However, model complexity often leads to parameter-to-data maps which are expensive to evaluate and are only available through noisy approximations. This paper is concerned with the use of interacting particle systems for the solution of the resulting inverse problems for parameters. Of particular interest is the case where the available forward model evaluations are subject to rapid fluctuations, in parameter space, superimposed on the smoothly varying large-scale parametric structure of interest. A motivating example from climate science is presented, and ensemble Kalman methods (which do not use the derivative of the parameter-to-data map) are shown, empirically, to perform well. Multiscale analysis is then used to analyze the behavior of interacting particle system algorithms when rapid fluctuations, which we refer to as noise, pollute the large-scale parametric dependence of the parameter-to-data map. Ensemble Kalman methods and Langevin-based methods (the latter use the derivative of the parameter-to-data map) are compared in this light. The ensemble Kalman methods are shown to behave favorably in the presence of noise in the parameter-to-data map, whereas Langevin methods are adversely affected. On the other hand, Langevin methods have the correct equilibrium distribution in the setting of noise-free forward models, while ensemble Kalman methods only provide an uncontrolled approximation, except in the linear case. Therefore a new class of algorithms, ensemble Gaussian process samplers, which combine the benefits of both ensemble Kalman and Langevin methods, are introduced and shown to perform favorably.},

This maximum principle ensures the applicability of the considered system of nonlocal balance laws to real-world problems. In the case of traffic flow, we show how the nonlocal impact and the coupling via the “semilinear” term can model multilane traffic flow with lane changing. We also demonstrate the applicability of the model to an on-ramp scenario in which the cars have to move from the on-ramp to the adjacent lane within a finite spatial domain. Moreover, we demonstrate how the problem of having obstacles can be modeled with these equations, introducing an additional ODE for the obstacle&#39;s dynamic.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of topological states in a new collective dynamics model. This individual-based model (IBM) describes self-propelled rigid bodies moving with constant speed and adjusting their rigid-body attitude to that of their neighbors. In previous works, a macroscopic model has been derived from this IBM in a suitable scaling limit. In the present work, we exhibit explicit solutions of the macroscopic model characterized by a nontrivial topology. We show that these solutions are well approximated by the IBM during a certain time but then the IBM transitions toward topologically trivial states. Using a set of appropriately defined topological indicators, we reveal that the breakage of the nontrivial topology requires the system to go through a phase of maximal disorder. We also show that similar but topologically trivial initial conditions result in markedly different dynamics, suggesting that topology plays a key role in the dynamics of this system.},

As the nonautonomous counterpart of an analytically completely integrable difference equation, this system is endowed with a rich dynamical structure. In addition, its nonpolar solutions, which grow without bounds as the iteration index $n$ increases, are of particular relevance to other areas of mathematics. We combine theory and asymptotics with high-precision numerical simulations to arrive at the following picture: when extended to include backward iterates, known nonpolar solutions of dP1 form a family of heteroclinic connections between two fixed points at infinity. One of these solutions, the Freud orbit of orthogonal polynomial theory, is a singular limit of the other solutions in the family. Near their asymptotic limits, all solutions converge to the Freud orbit, which follows invariant curves of dP1, when written as a three-dimensional autonomous system, and reaches the point at positive infinity along a center manifold. This description leads to two important results. First, the Freud orbit tracks sequences of period-1 and 2 points of the autonomous counterpart of dP1 for large positive and negative values of $n$, respectively. Second, we identify an elegant method to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the iterates on the Freud orbit for large positive values of $n$. The structure of invariant manifolds emerging from this picture contributes to a deeper understanding of the global analysis of an interesting class of discrete dynamical systems.},

In this paper we analyze transient dynamics in birth-jump metapopulations where dispersal occurs immediately after birth (e.g., via larval dispersal). We address the choice of appropriate norms as well as the effect of stage structure on transient dynamics. We advocate the use of the $\ell_1$ norm, because of its biological interpretation, and extend the transient metrics of reactivity and attenuation to birth-jump metapopulations in this norm. By way of examples we compare this norm to the more commonly used $\ell_2$ norm. Our focus is the case where transient dynamics are very different than asymptotic dynamics. We provide simple examples of metapopulations where this is the case and also show how increasing the number of habitat patches can increase this difference. We then connect the reactivity and attenuation of metapopulations to the source-sink classification of habitat patches and demonstrate how to meaningfully measure reactivity when metapopulations are stage-structured, with a focus on marine metapopulations. Our paper makes three primary contributions. First, it provides guidance to readers as to the appropriate norm and scalings for studying transients in birth-jump metapopulations. Second, it provides three examples of transient behavior in metapopulations involving slow-fast systems, crawl-bys, and high dimensionality. Third, it connects the concepts of reactivity and attenuation to the source-sink classification of habitat patches more commonly found in marine metapopulations.},

The focus is on long-term averages of these principal angles, which we call angular values: we demonstrate relationships between different types of angular values and prove their existence for random dynamical systems. For one-dimensional subspaces in two-dimensional systems our angular values agree with the classical theory of rotation numbers for orientation-preserving circle homeomorphisms if the matrix has positive determinant and does not rotate vectors by more than $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Because our notion of angular values ignores orientation by looking at subspaces rather than vectors, our results apply to dynamical systems of any dimension and to subspaces of arbitrary dimension. The second part of the paper delves deeper into the theory of the autonomous case. We explore the relation to (generalized) eigenspaces, provide some explicit formulas for angular values, and set up a general numerical algorithm for computing angular values via Schur decompositions.},

  abstract     = {The deep connections between braids and dynamics by way of the Nielsen--Thurston classification theorem have led to a wide range of practical applications. Braids have been used to detect coherent structures and mixing regions in oceanic flows, drive the design of industrial mixing machines, contextualize the evolution of taffy pullers, and characterize the chaotic motion of topological defects in active nematics. Mixing plays a central role in each of these examples, and the braids naturally associated with each system come equipped with a useful measure of mixing efficiency, the topological entropy per operation (TEPO). This motivates the following questions. What is the maximum mixing efficiency for braids, and what braids realize this? The answer depends on how we define braids. For the standard Artin presentation, well-known braids with mixing efficiencies related to the golden and silver ratios have been proven to be maximal. However, it is fruitful to consider surface braids, a natural generalization of braids, with presentations constructed from Artin-like braid generators on embedded graphs. In this work, we introduce an efficient and elegant algorithm for finding the topological entropy and TEPO of surface braids on any pairing of orientable surface and planar embeddable graph. Of the myriad possible graphs and surfaces, graphs that can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as a lattice are a simple, highly symmetric choice, and the braids that result more naturally model the motion of points on the plane. We extensively search for a maximum mixing efficiency braid on planar lattice graphs and examine a novel candidate braid, which we conjecture to have this maximal property.},

  abstract     = {When two-dimensional pattern-forming problems are posed on a periodic domain, classical techniques (Lyapunov--Schmidt, equivariant bifurcation theory) give considerable information about what periodic patterns are formed in the transition where the featureless state loses stability. When the problem is posed on the whole plane, these periodic patterns are still present. Recent work on the Swift--Hohenberg equation (an archetypal pattern-forming partial differential equation) has proved the existence of quasipatterns, which are not spatially periodic and yet still have long-range order. Quasipatterns may have eight-fold, ten-fold, twelve-fold, and higher rotational symmetry, which preclude periodicity. There are also quasipatterns with six-fold rotational symmetry made up from the superposition of two equal amplitude hexagonal patterns rotated by almost any angle $\alpha$ with respect to each other. Here, we revisit the Swift--Hohenberg equation (with quadratic as well as cubic nonlinearities) and prove existence of several new quasipatterns. The most surprising are hexa-rolls: periodic and quasiperiodic patterns made from the superposition of hexagons and rolls (stripes) oriented in almost any direction with respect to each other and with any relative translation; these bifurcate directly from the featureless solution. In addition, we find quasipatterns made from the superposition of hexagons with unequal amplitude (provided the coefficient of the quadratic nonlinearity is small). We consider the periodic case as well, and extend the class of known solutions, including the superposition of hexagons and rolls. While we have focused on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, our work contributes to the general question of what periodic or quasiperiodic patterns should be found generically in pattern-forming problems on the plane.},

  abstract     = {Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are voltage oscillations that can occur during the plateau phase of a cardiac action potential. EADs at the cellular level have been linked to potentially deadly tissue-level arrhythmias, and the mechanisms for their arisal are not fully understood. There is ongoing debate as to which is the predominant biophysical mechanism of EAD production: imbalanced interactions between voltage-gated transmembrane currents or overactive Ca$^{2+}$-dependent transmembrane currents brought about by pathological intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ release dynamics. In this article, we address this issue using a foundational 10-dimensional biophysical ventricular action potential model which contains both electrical and intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ components. Surprisingly, we find that the model can produce EADs through both biophysical mechanisms, which hints at a more fundamental dynamical mechanism for EAD production. Fast-slow analysis reveals EADs, in both cases, to be canard-induced mixed-mode oscillations. While the voltage-driven EADs arise from a fast-slow problem with two slow variables, the Ca$^{2+}$-driven EADs arise from the addition of a third slow variable. Hence, we adapt existing computational methods in order to compute 2D slow manifolds and 1D canard orbits in the reduced 7D model from which voltage-driven EADs arise. Further, we extend these computational methods in order to compute, for the first time, 2D sets of maximal canards which partition the 3D slow manifolds of the 8D problem from which Ca$^{2+}$-driven EADs arise. The canard viewpoint provides a unifying alternative to the voltage- or Ca$^{2+}$-driven viewpoints while also providing explanatory and predictive insights that cannot be obtained through the use of the traditional fast-slow approach.},

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a powerful tool for extracting coherent patterns, but the original DMD and most of its variants do not consider label information, which is often available as side information of spatiotemporal data. In this work, we propose a new method for extracting distinctive coherent patterns from labeled spatiotemporal data collections such that they contribute to major differences in a labeled set of dynamics. We achieve such pattern extraction by incorporating discriminant analysis into DMD. To this end, we define a kernel function on subspaces spanned by sets of dynamic modes and develop an objective to take both reconstruction goodness as DMD and class-separation goodness as discriminant analysis into account. We illustrate our method using a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets. The proposed method can be a useful tool for exploratory data analysis for understanding spatiotemporal data.},

  abstract     = {Phenomena in chemistry, biology, and neuroscience are often modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in which the right-hand side is comprised of terms which correspond to individual “processes” or “fluxes.” Frequently, these ODEs are characterized by multiple time-scale phenomena due to order of magnitude differences between contributing processes and the presence of switching, i.e., dominance or subdominance of particular terms as a function of state variables. We outline a heuristic procedure for the identification of small parameters in ODE models of this kind, with a particular emphasis on the identification of small parameters relating to switching behaviors. This procedure is outlined informally in generality, and applied in detail to a model for intracellular calcium dynamics characterized by switching and multiple (more than two) time-scale dynamics. A total of five small parameters are identified, and related to a single perturbation parameter by a polynomial scaling law based on order of magnitude comparisons. The resulting singular perturbation problem has a time-scale separation which depends on the region of state space. We prove the existence and uniqueness of stable relaxation oscillations with three distinct time scales using a coordinate-independent formulation of geometric singular perturbation theory in combination with the blowup method. We also provide an estimate for the period of the oscillations, and consider a number of possibilities for their onset under parameter variation.},

  abstract     = {Although mathematical models do not fully match reality, robustness of dynamical objects to perturbation helps bridge from theoretical to real-world dynamical systems. Classical theories of structural stability and isolated invariant sets treat robustness of qualitative dynamics to sufficiently small errors. But they do not indicate just how large a perturbation can become before the qualitative behavior of our system changes fundamentally. Here we introduce a quantity, intensity of attraction, that measures the robustness of attractors in metric terms. Working in the setting of ordinary differential equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider robustness to vector field perturbations that are time dependent or independent. We define intensity in a control-theoretic framework, based on the magnitude of control needed to steer trajectories out of a domain of attraction. Our main result is that intensity also quantifies the robustness of an attractor to time-independent vector field perturbations; we prove this by connecting the reachable sets of control theory to isolating blocks of Conley theory. In addition to treating classical questions of robustness in a new metric framework, intensity of attraction offers a novel tool for resilience quantification in ecological applications. Unlike many measurements of resilience, intensity detects the strength of transient dynamics in a domain of attraction.},

Nonlinear dynamical systems arising from physical, chemical, or biological situations are typically described by vector fields that are only locally Lipschitzian. To generalize the mathematical theory of stochastically adaptive control to realistic systems is quite a challenging and formidable task. We meet this challenge by proving rigorously that stabilization and synchronization can be achieved with probability one for only locally Lipschitzian systems. The result holds not only for one-dimensional but also for any finite-dimensional white noises. Representative examples and an application to synchronization-based parameter identification are presented to illustrate the broad applicability of the developed mathematical criteria. Our successful relaxation of the mathematical condition from globally to locally Lipschitzian provides a rigorous guarantee of the stability of stochastically adaptive control in physical systems with significant implications to the design and realization of engineering control systems.},

  abstract     = {Biochemical reaction systems, in particular those that govern the expression of genes in single cells, involve discrete numbers of molecules and are inherently stochastic. This study concerns reaction systems with two molecular species and an arbitrary number of reactions, the rates of which conform to a scaling of the classical type in the first species (but not the second). For limiting values of the scaling parameter, the first species is highly abundant, evolves slowly, and buffers the relatively fast fluctuation of the second, scarce, species. The scale separation facilitates the construction of asymptotic approximations to the molecular distributions: the large-time behavior is described by a WKB approximation, which is further resolved into a tractable mixture of metastable modes; the earlier-time dynamics are described by quasi-stationary and linear noise approximations. The paper presents the theory and the algebraic recipes that are required to implement it. The framework is applied on two reaction systems with positive feedback: a delayed feedback circuit and a gene autoregulation model with cooperative binding of the protein to the promoter. For the former, the approximation scheme results into a mixture of Gaussian/Poisson modes for the inactive/active protein distribution. For the latter, the analysis elucidates the effects of bursty gene expression, promoter responsivity, and protein sequestration on bimodality of protein distributions.},

  abstract     = {Multivector fields provide an avenue for studying continuous dynamical systems in a combinatorial framework. There are currently two approaches in the literature which use persistent homology to capture changes in combinatorial dynamical systems. The first captures changes in the Conley index, while the second captures changes in the Morse decomposition. However, such approaches have limitations. The former approach only describes how the Conley index changes across a selected isolated invariant set though the dynamics can be much more complicated than the behavior of a single isolated invariant set. Likewise, considering a Morse decomposition omits much information about the individual Morse sets. In this paper, we propose a method to summarize changes in combinatorial dynamical systems by capturing changes in the so-called Conley--Morse graphs. A Conley--Morse graph contains information about both the structure of a selected Morse decomposition and about the Conley index at each Morse set in the decomposition. Hence, our method summarizes the changing structure of a sequence of dynamical systems at a finer granularity than previous approaches.},

From a mathematical perspective, QSS reduction is generally interpreted as a special type of singular perturbation reduction, but in many instances the correspondence is not worked out rigorously, and the QSS reduction may yield incorrect results. The present paper contains a thorough discussion of QSS reduction and its relation to singular perturbation reduction for the special, but important, case when the right-hand side of the differential equation is linear in the variables to be eliminated (but the differential equation model might otherwise be nonlinear). For this class we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a singular perturbation reduction (in the sense of Tikhonov and Fenichel) to exist, and to agree with QSS reduction. We then apply the general results to chemical reaction networks with noninteracting species, generalizing earlier results and methods for steady states to QSS scenarios. We provide easy-to-check graphical conditions to select parameter values for which the singular perturbation reduction applies, and additionally, we identify when the singular perturbation reduction agrees with the QSS reduction.

  abstract     = {The sensitivity of time averages in a chaotic system to an infinitesimal parameter perturbation grows exponentially with the averaging time. However, long-term averages or ensemble statistics often vary differentiably with system parameters. Ruelle&#39;s response theory gives a rigorous formula for these parametric derivatives of statistics or linear response. But the direct evaluation of this formula is ill-conditioned, and hence linear response and downstream applications of sensitivity analysis, such as optimization and uncertainty quantification, have been a computational challenge in chaotic dynamical systems. This paper presents the space-split sensitivity (S3) algorithm to transform Ruelle&#39;s formula into a well-conditioned ergodic-averaging computation. We prove a decomposition of Ruelle&#39;s formula that is differentiable on the unstable manifold, which we assume to be one-dimensional. This decomposition of Ruelle&#39;s formula ensures that one of the resulting terms, the stable contribution, can be computed using a regularized tangent equation, similarly as in a nonchaotic system. The remaining term, known as the unstable contribution, is regularized and converted into an efficiently computable ergodic average. In this process, we develop new algorithms, which may be useful beyond linear response, to compute the unstable derivatives of the regularized tangent vector field and the unstable direction. We prove that the S3 algorithm, which combines these computational ingredients that enter the stable and unstable contributions, converges like a Monte Carlo approximation of Ruelle&#39;s formula. The algorithm presented here is hence a first step toward full-fledged applications of sensitivity analysis in chaotic systems, wherever such applications have been limited due to lack of availability of long-term sensitivities.},

  abstract     = {Microchannels are well known in microfluidic applications for the control and separation of microdroplets and cells. Often the objects in the flow experience inertial effects, resulting in dynamics that is a departure from the underlying channel flow dynamics. This paper considers small neutrally buoyant spherical particles suspended in flow through a curved duct having a square cross-section. The particle experiences a combination of inertial lift force induced by the disturbance from the primary flow along the duct, and drag from the secondary vortices in the cross-section, which drive migration of the particle within the cross-section. We construct a simplified model that preserves the core topology of the force field yet depends on a single parameter $\kappa$, quantifying the relative strength of the two forces. We show that $\kappa$ is a bifurcation parameter for the dynamical system that describes motion of the particle in the cross-section of the duct. At large values of $\kappa$ there exists an attracting limit cycle in each of the upper and lower halves of the duct. At small $\kappa$ we find that particles migrate to one of four stable foci. Between these extremes, there is an intermediate range of $\kappa$ for which all particles migrate to a single stable focus. Noting that the positions of the limit cycles and foci vary with the value of $\kappa$, this behavior indicates that, for a suitable particle mixture, duct bend radius might be chosen to segregate particles by size. We evaluate the time and axial distance required to focus particles near the unique stable node, which determines the duct length required for particle segregation.},

We review how a large customer scaling of the stochastic model yields a system of delay differential equations. We also show how these limiting delay differential equations approximate the stochastic mean dynamics of the original queueing model. To gain insight about the queue length dynamics such as the amplitude, the frequency, and the value of the critical delay we use the harmonic balance method and the method of multiple scales. We show that the method of multiple scales is more accurate but is less tractable from a computational perspective than the harmonic balance method. Using the method of multiple scales, we also prove that the only stable mode is where all $N$ queues have the same amplitude and frequency; however, each queue is shifted by $\frac{2\pi}{N}$ from its neighbor. This analysis provides great insights for queues with delayed information and how the oscillations manifest themselves.},

At the traditional AI limit, orbits of a map degenerate to sequences of symbols and the dynamics is reduced to the shift operator, a pure form of chaos. Under nondegeneracy conditions, a contraction mapping argument can show that infinitely many AI states continue to orbits of the deterministic map. For the 3D quadratic map, the AI limit that we study is a quadratic correspondence whose branches, a pair of one-dimensional maps, introduce symbolic dynamics on two symbols. The AI states, however, are nontrivial orbits of this correspondence. The character of these orbits depends on whether the quadratic takes the form of an ellipse, a hyperbola, or a pair of lines. Using contraction arguments, we find parameter domains for each case such that each symbol sequence corresponds to a unique AI state. In some parameter domains, sufficient conditions are then found for each such AI state to continue away from the limit becoming an orbit of the original 3D map. Numerical continuation methods extend these results, allowing computation of bifurcations to obtain orbits with horseshoe-like structures and intriguing self-similarity. We conjecture that pairs of periodic orbits in saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations have symbol sequences that differ in exactly one position.},

This paper investigates the instability and asymptotic behavior of planar fronts and planar pulses of the bidomain Allen--Cahn equation and the bidomain FitzHugh--Nagumo equation in two spatial dimensions. Previous work showed that planar fronts of the bidomain Allen--Cahn equation could become unstable in contrast to the classical Allen--Cahn equation. After the planar front is destabilized, a rotating zigzag front develops whose shape can be explained by simple geometric arguments using a suitable Frank diagram. We also show that the Hopf bifurcation through which the front becomes unstable can be either supercritical or subcritical by demonstrating a parameter regime in which a stable planar front and zigzag front can coexist. Our computational studies of the bidomain FitzHugh--Nagumo pulse solution show that the pulses can also become unstable, like the bidomain Allen--Cahn fronts. However, unlike the bidomain Allen--Cahn case, the destabilized pulse does not necessarily develop into a zigzag pulse. For certain choices of parameters, the destabilized pulse can disintegrate entirely. These studies are made possible by developing a numerical scheme that allows for the accurate computation of the bidomain equation in a two-dimensional strip domain of an infinite extent.},

We develop an algebraic approach to product-form stationary distributions in the framework of CRNs. Under certain hypotheses on linearity and decomposition of the state space for conservative CRNs, this gives sufficient and necessary algebraic conditions for product-form stationary distributions. Correspondingly, we obtain a semialgebraic subset of the parameter space that captures rates where, under the corresponding hypotheses, CRNs have product-form. We employ the developed theory to CRNs and some models of statistical mechanics, besides sketching the pertinence in other models from applied probability.},

Using Lyons&#39;s rough path theory, we show that SDDEs can be solved pathwise and induce a continuous stochastic flow on the space of (Gubinelli&#39;s) controlled paths. In the language of random dynamical systems, this result shows that SDDEs induce a continuous cocycle on random fibers, or, more precisely, on a measurable field of Banach spaces. We furthermore prove a multiplicative ergodic theorem (MET) on measurable fields of Banach spaces that applies under significantly weaker structural and measurability assumptions than preceding METs. Applying it to linear SDDEs shows that the induced cocycle possesses a discrete Lyapunov spectrum that can be used to describe the long-time behavior.},

Previous work has shown that linearized EC models exhibit resonance (preferred frequency response to oscillatory inputs at a nonzero, resonant, input frequency) in parameter regimes where the stable equilibrium is either a node (no intrinsic oscillations) or a focus (damped oscillations). We use a combination of numerical simulations and dynamical systems tools to understand how the model nonlinearities, partially captured by the geometry of the nullclines in the phase-space diagram, shape the response patterns to oscillatory inputs away from the validity of the corresponding linearization. We develop and adapt an extended version of the classical phase-plane diagram that allows us to track the evolution of the response trajectories and their interaction with the so-called moving nullclines (in response to the oscillatory inputs). We use this approach to explain the mechanisms of generation of nonlinear resonant patterns, the nonlinear amplification/attenuation of these patterns by increasing input amplitudes, and the mechanisms of generation of more complex patterns of mixed-mode--type, where the stationary amplitude response is not uniform across cycles.},

We refer to this strategy as threshold constant-catch (TCC) harvesting. We provide analytical and numerical results when applying TCC to monotone population growth models. TCC remedies the tendency to fishery collapse of pure constant-catch harvesting and provides a buffer for quotas larger than the maximum sustainable yield. From a dynamical systems point of view, TCC gives rise to a piecewise-smooth map with a discontinuity at the threshold population size. The dynamical behavior includes border-collision bifurcations, basin boundary metamorphoses, and boundary-collision bifurcation. We further find Farey trees, a slightly modified truncated skew tent map scenario, and the bandcount incrementing scenario. Our results underline, on the one hand, the protective function of thresholds in harvest control rules. On the other hand, they highlight the dynamical complexities due to discontinuities that can arise naturally in threshold-based harvesting strategies.},

For general values of parameters, we take both analytic and numerical approaches to further understand the potential behaviors of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, and we numerically observe that in addition to the competitive exclusion and coexistence, the bistable phenomenon is also possible, which is different from the known results of competitive ODE and reaction-diffusion systems (where bistability is impossible).

This provides a rigorous formulation and theoretical justification for some intuitive notions that damping increases stability. To establish this result, we prove a matrix perturbation result for complex symmetric matrices with positive semidefinite perturbations to their imaginary parts, which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the breakdown of hyperbolicity of the first-order system under damping variations in terms of observability of a pair of matrices relating damping, inertia, and Jacobian matrices, and propose sufficient conditions for Hopf bifurcation resulting from such hyperbolicity breakdown. The developed theory has significant applications in the stability of electric power systems, which are one of the most complex and important engineering systems.

Recent work has extended these results to a much more general setting, thus allowing for spectral stability of nonlinear waves in a variety of contexts to be determined by counting conjugate points. However, in practice, it is not yet clear whether it is easier to compute conjugate points than to just directly count unstable eigenvalues. We address this issue by developing a framework for the computation of conjugate points using validated numerics. Moreover, we apply our method to a parameter-dependent system of bistable equations and show that there exist both stable and unstable standing fronts. This application can be seen as complementary to the classical result via Sturm--Liouville theory that in scalar reaction-diffusion equations pulses are unstable whereas fronts are stable and to the more recent result of Beck et al. [Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A, 376 (2018), 20170187] that symmetric pulses in reaction-diffusion systems with gradient nonlinearity are also necessarily unstable.},

  abstract     = {Consider a parameter dependent vector field on either Euclidean space or a compact Riemannian manifold. Suppose that it possesses a parameter dependent initial condition and a parameter dependent stable hyperbolic equilibrium point. It is valuable to determine the set of parameter values, which we call the recovery set, whose corresponding initial conditions lie within the region of attraction of the corresponding stable equilibrium point. A boundary parameter value is a parameter value whose corresponding initial condition lies in the boundary of the region of attraction of the corresponding stable equilibrium point. Prior algorithms numerically estimated the recovery set by estimating its boundary via computation of boundary parameter values. The primary purpose of this work is to provide theoretical justification for those algorithms for a large class of parameter dependent vector fields. This includes proving that, for these vector fields, the boundary of the recovery set consists of boundary parameter values, and that the properties exploited by the algorithms to compute these desired boundary parameters will be satisfied. The main technical result which these proofs rely on is establishing that the region of attraction boundary varies continuously in an appropriate sense with respect to small variation in parameter value for this class of vector fields. Hence, the majority of this work is devoted to proving this result, which may be of independent interest. The proof of continuity proceeds by proving that, for this class of vector fields, the region of attraction permits a decomposition into a union of the stable manifolds of the equilibrium points and periodic orbits it contains, and this decomposition persists under small perturbations to the vector field.},

In many scientific applications the forward model is expensive to evaluate, and adjoint computations are difficult to employ; in this setting derivative-free methods which involve a small number of forward model evaluations are an attractive proposition. Ensemble Kalman-based interacting particle systems (and variants such as consensus-based and unscented Kalman approaches) have proven empirically successful in this context, but suffer from the fact that they cannot be systematically refined to return the true solution, except in the setting of linear forward models [A. Garbuno-Inigo et al., SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 19 (2020), pp. 412--441]. In this paper, we propose a new derivative-free approach to Bayesian inversion, which may be employed for posterior sampling or for maximum a posteriori estimation, and may be systematically refined. The method relies on a fast/slow system of stochastic differential equations for the local approximation of the gradient of the log-likelihood appearing in a Langevin diffusion. Furthermore the method may be preconditioned by use of information from ensemble Kalman--based methods (and variants), providing a methodology which leverages the documented advantages of those methods, while also being provably refinable. We define the methodology, highlighting its flexibility and many variants, provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, and demonstrate its efficacy by means of numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Originally arising in the context of interacting particle systems in statistical physics, dynamical systems and differential equations on networks/graphs have permeated into a broad number of mathematical areas as well as into many applications. One central problem in the field is to find suitable approximations of the dynamics as the number of nodes/vertices tends to infinity, i.e., in the large graph limit. A cornerstone in this context are Vlasov equations (VEs) describing a particle density on a mean-field level. For all-to-all coupled systems, it is quite classical to prove the rigorous approximation by VEs for many classes of particle systems. For dense graphs converging to graphon limits, one also knows that mean-field approximation holds for certain classes of models, e.g., for the Kuramoto model on graphs. Yet, the space of intermediate density and sparse graphs is clearly extremely relevant. Here we prove that the Kuramoto model can be be approximated in the mean-field limit by far more general graph limits than graphons. In particular, our contributions are as follows. (I) We show how to introduce operator theory more abstractly into VEs by considering graphops. Graphops have recently been proposed as a unifying approach to graph limit theory, and here we show that they can be used for differential equations on graphs. (II) For the Kuramoto model on graphs we rigorously prove that there is a VE approximating it in the mean-field sense. (III) This mean-field VE involves a graphop, and we prove the existence, uniqueness, and continuous graphop dependence of weak solutions. (IV) On a technical level, our results rely on designing a new suitable metric of graphop convergence and on employing Fourier analysis on compact abelian groups to approximate graphops using summability kernels.},

The reformulated model is shown to be a good approximation of the original one. As a consequence, one can extract fairly precise predictions of the behavior of the original model from the bifurcation analysis of the modified model. Thus, the findings of bifurcations linked to complex dynamics in the modified model---like early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which can be precursors to cardiac death---predicts the occurrence of the same dynamics in the original model. It is shown that bifurcations linked to EADs in the modified model accurately predict EADs in the original model at the single cell level. Finally, these bifurcations are linked to wave break-up leading to cardiac death at the tissue level.},

In the preceding decades, a wide variety of results have been obtained for weakly perturbed oscillators that place restrictive limits on the magnitude of the inputs or on the magnitude of the time derivatives of the inputs. By contrast, no general reduction techniques currently exist to analyze oscillatory dynamics in response to arbitrary, large magnitude inputs, and comparatively very little is understood about these strongly perturbed limit cycle oscillators. In this work, the theory of isostable reduction is leveraged to develop an adaptive phase-amplitude transformation that does not place any restrictions on the allowable input. Additionally, provided some of the Floquet multipliers of the underlying periodic orbits are near zero, the proposed method yields a reduction in dimension comparable to that of other phase-amplitude reduction frameworks. Numerical illustrations show that the proposed method accurately reflects synchronization and entrainment of coupled oscillators in regimes where a variety of other phase-amplitude reductions fail.},

  abstract     = {Gaining a better comprehension of the growth of microorganisms is a major scientific challenge, which has often been approached from a resource allocation perspective. Simple mathematical self-replicator models based on resource allocation principles have been surprisingly effective in accounting for experimental observations of the growth of microorganisms. Previous work, using a three-variable resource allocation model, predicted an optimal resource allocation scheme for the adaptation of microbial cells to a sudden nutrient change in the environment. We here propose an extended version of this model considering also proteins responsible for basic housekeeping functions, and we study their impact on predicted optimal strategies for resource allocation following changes in the environment. A full dynamical analysis of the system shows there is a single globally attractive equilibrium, which can be related to steady-state growth conditions of bacteria observed in experiments. We then explore the optimal allocation strategies using optimization and optimal control theory. We show that the solutions to this dynamical problem have a complicated structure that includes a second-order singular arc given in feedback form and characterized by (i) Fuller&#39;s phenomenon and (ii) the turnpike effect, producing a very particular asymptotic behavior towards the solution of the static optimization problem. Our work thus provides a generalized perspective on the analysis of microbial growth by means of simple self-replicator models.},

  abstract     = {We continue the study on the Hebbian network of Kuramoto oscillators with a second-order Fourier term, aiming to apply the system to the binary pattern retrieve task with nonorthogonal standard binary patterns. In [SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 19 (2020), pp. 1124--1159] the authors considered the system and studied the stability/instability by introducing the so-called $\varepsilon$-independent stability; this theory deals with the scenario where the memorized patterns coincide with the standard ones and the key assumption is the mutual orthogonality in standard patterns (or memorized ones). The key idea was to memorize these mutually orthogonal binary patterns in the network and retrieve one of them for a given defective pattern. However, in practice the orthogonality usually fails. When the orthogonality in the standard patterns fails, we find it is not a proper use of the system memorizing these standard patterns. In this paper we propose a new strategy which converts the problem to a case with orthogonality, and the standard patterns are $\varepsilon$-independently asymptotically stable. The structural stability is also considered, and sharp quantitative estimates on the strength of perturbations for the stability of binary patterns are presented. Numerical simulations illustrate the approach and the results.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines a longitudinal shape evolution model in which a three-dimensional volume progresses through a family of elastic equilibria in response to the time-derivative of an internal force, or yank, with an additional regularization to ensure diffeomorphic transformations. We consider two different models of yank and address the long time existence and uniqueness of solutions for the equations of motion in both models. In addition, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal yank that best describes the change from an observed initial volume to an observed volume at a later time. The main motivation for this work is the understanding of processes such as growth and atrophy in anatomical structures, where the yank could be roughly interpreted as a metabolic event triggering morphological changes. We provide preliminary results on simple examples to illustrate, under this model, the retrievability of some attributes of such events.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a broadly applicable dimensionality reduction algorithm that decomposes a matrix of time-series data into a product of a matrix of exponentials, representing Fourier-like time dynamics, and a matrix of coefficients, representing spatial structures. This interpretable spatio-temporal decomposition is classically formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved within the variable projection framework. When the data contains outliers, or other features that are not well represented by exponentials in time, the standard Frobenius norm misfit penalty creates significant biases in the recovered time dynamics. As a result, practitioners are left to clean such defects from the data manually or to use a black-box cleaning approach like robust principal component analysis (PCA). As an alternative, we propose a robust statistical framework for the optimization used to compute the DMD itself. We also develop variable projection algorithms for these new formulations, which allow for regularizers and constraints on the decomposition parameters. Finally, we develop a scalable version of the algorithm by combining the structure of the variable projection framework with the stochastic variance reduction (SVRG) paradigm. The approach is tested on a range of synthetic examples, and the methods are implemented in an open source software package RobustDMD.},

  abstract     = {Certain neural network architectures, in the infinite-depth limit, lead to systems of nonlinear differential equations. Motivated by this idea, we develop a framework for analyzing time signals based on nonautonomous dynamical systems. We view the time signal as a forcing function for a dynamical system that governs a time-evolving hidden variable. As in equation discovery, the dynamical system is represented using a dictionary of functions and the coefficients are learned from data. This framework is applied to the time signal classification problem. We show how gradients can be efficiently computed using the adjoint method, and we apply methods from dynamical systems to establish stability of the classifier. Through a variety of experiments, on both synthetic and real datasets, we show that the proposed method uses orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing methods, while achieving comparable accuracy. We created the synthetic datasets using dynamical systems of increasing complexity; though the ground truth vector fields are often polynomials, we find consistently that a Fourier dictionary yields the best results. We also demonstrate how the proposed method yields graphical interpretability in the form of phase portraits.},

  abstract     = {People&#39;s opinions evolve with time as they interact with their friends, family, colleagues, and others. In the study of opinion dynamics on networks, one often encodes interactions between people in the form of dyadic relationships, but many social interactions in real life are polyadic (i.e., they involve three or more people). In this paper, we extend an asynchronous bounded-confidence model (BCM) on graphs, in which nodes are connected pairwise by edges, to an asynchronous BCM on hypergraphs, in which arbitrarily many nodes can be connected by a single hyperedge. We show that our hypergraph BCM converges to consensus for a wide range of initial conditions for the opinions of the nodes, including for nonuniform and asymmetric initial opinion distributions. We also show that, under suitable conditions, echo chambers can form on hypergraphs with community structure. We demonstrate that the opinions of nodes can sometimes jump from one opinion cluster to another in a single time step; this phenomenon (which we call “opinion jumping&#39;&#39;) is not possible in standard dyadic BCMs. Additionally, we observe a phase transition in the convergence time of our BCM on a complete hypergraph when the variance $\sigma^2$ of the initial opinion distribution equals the confidence bound $c$. We prove that the convergence time grows at least exponentially fast with the number of nodes when $\sigma^2 &gt; c$ and the initial opinions are normally distributed. Therefore, to determine the convergence properties of our hypergraph BCM when the variance and the number of hyperedges are both large, it is necessary to use analytical methods instead of relying only on Monte Carlo simulations.},
