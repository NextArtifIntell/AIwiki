  abstract     = {Abstract. This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the inception of the SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization (SICON). The cover of Volume 1 reads Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics on Control: Series A. (Series B referred to the SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, introduced in 1964.) With J. E. Bertram serving as managing editor, the editorial board consisted of A. V. Balakrishnan, A. E. Bryson, R. F. Drenick, W. R. Haseltine, R. E. Kalman, J. P. LaSalle, L. Markus, and L. W. Neustadt. Volume 1 was published in three issues with 22 papers in a total of 376 pages. In the inaugural issue, past SIAM President (1959–1960) Brockway McMillan (and also Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development) described the motivation for publishing the new journal. “Many of us in the Society,” he wrote in the introduction, “have felt that control theory both needs, and merits, more explicit attention by mathematicians and by engineers of mathematical bent. It needs attention because of the pervasive importance of control systems to modern technological society.” The field of control, he continued, “shows promise of a rich mathematical harvest.” The journal first added optimization to the title in 1976 and has since been known as SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we tackle a topology optimization problem which consists in finding the optimal shape of a solid located inside a fluid that minimizes a given cost function. The motion of the fluid is modeled thanks to the Boussinesq system which involves the unsteady Navier–Stokes equation coupled with a heat equation. In order to cover several models presented in the literature, we choose a nonsmooth formulation for the outlet boundary conditions. This paper aims at proving the existence of solutions to the resulting equations, along with the study of a relaxation scheme of the nonsmooth conditions. A second part covers the topology optimization problem itself for which we proved the existence of optimal solutions and provides the definition of first order necessary optimality conditions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the sensitivity analysis of a class of parameterized fixed-point problems that arise in the context of obstacle-type quasi-variational inequalities. We prove that if the operators in the considered fixed-point equation satisfy a positive superhomogeneity condition, then the maximal and minimal elements of the solution set of the problem depend locally Lipschitz continuously on the involved parameters. We further show that if certain concavity conditions hold, then the maximal solution mapping is Hadamard directionally differentiable and its directional derivatives are precisely the minimal solutions of suitably defined linearized fixed-point equations. Our approach covers the elliptic and the parabolic setting simultaneously and also yields Hadamard directional differentiability results in situations in which the solution set of the fixed-point equation is a continuum and a characterization of directional derivatives via linearized auxiliary problems is provably impossible. To illustrate that our results can be used to study interesting problems arising in practice, we apply them to establish the Hadamard directional differentiability of the solution operator of a nonlinear elliptic quasi-variational inequality, which emerges in impulse control and in which the obstacle mapping is obtained by taking essential infima over certain parts of the underlying domain, and of the solution mapping of a parabolic quasi-variational inequality, which involves boundary controls and in which the state-to-obstacle relationship is described by a PDE.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The fundamental notion of relative degree is studied for a class of linear time-delay systems of retarded type, where the standard assumption of commensurate delays is dropped. Algebraic conditions are provided that fully exploit the delay dependence structure. Even though the analyzed systems do not have a nontrivial feedthrough from input to output, it is shown that the relative degree may be sensitive to infinitesimal delay perturbations, which is at the basis of a novel notion of relative degree, called strong relative degree. This notion is characterized algebraically and computationally in both a SISO and a MIMO setting. By means of the obtained characterizations and a benchmark problem, which illustrates that invariant zeros may be characterized as zeros of quasi-polynomials of retarded, neutral, or advanced type, new light is shed on existence conditions of a normal form. The novel concepts and theoretical results play a key role in the design and analysis of extended PD controllers, for which an algorithm and numerical experiments are presented.},

The optimal control problem solved in each iteration of funnel MPC resembles the basic idea of penalty methods used in optimization. To this end, we present a new stage cost design to mimic the high-gain idea of (adaptive) funnel control. We rigorously show initial and recursive feasibility of funnel MPC without imposing terminal conditions or other requirements like a sufficiently long prediction horizon.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The classical inward pointing condition (IPC) for a control system whose state is constrained in the closure of an open set prescribes that at each point of the boundary the intersection between the dynamics and the interior of the tangent cone of at is nonempty. Under this hypothesis, for every system trajectory on a time interval , possibly violating the constraint, one can construct a new system trajectory that satisfies the constraint and whose distance from is bounded by a quantity proportional to the maximal deviation . When IPC is violated, the construction of such a constrained trajectory is not possible in general. However, in this paper we prove that a “higher order” inward pointing condition involving Lie brackets of the dynamics’ vector fields (together with a nonpositiveness curvature-like assumption) and the implementation of a suitable “rotating” control strategy allows for a novel construction of a constrained trajectory whose distance from the reference trajectory is bounded by a quantity proportional to . As an application, we establish the continuity up to the boundary of the value function of a connected optimal control problem, a continuity that allows one to regard as the unique constrained viscosity solution of the corresponding Bellman equation.},

Under the local Lipschitz condition, the existence-and-unique theorem of the solution to the highly nonlinear SDDE is established. The key aim is to investigate the stabilization problem by delay feedback controls. The key features include that the time delay in the given system is time-varying and may not be differentiable, while the time lag in the feedback control can also be time-varying as long as it has a sufficiently small upper bound.},

A major difficulty which is caused by the information asymmetry is that Player 2 may not know whether Player 1 has already stopped the game or not. Furthermore, the classical backward-induction approach is not applicable in the current setup. This is because when the informed player decides not to stop, he reveals information to the uninformed player, and hence the decision of the uninformed player at time may be determined not only by the play after time , but also by the play before time . In the current work we initially show that the expected utility of Player 2 will remain the same even if he knows whether Player 1 has already stopped. Then, this result is applied in order to prove that, under appropriate conditions, a recursive construction in the style of Hamadène and Zhang (2010) converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.},

We prove the existence of a unique solution to the optimal control problem and derive the optimality system. The first-order necessary optimality condition results in a simplified Signorini-type problem for the control variable. The space discretization of the state variable is done using conforming finite elements, whereas the time discretization is based on discontinuous Galerkin methods. To discretize the control we use the conforming prismatic Lagrange finite elements. We derive an optimal order of convergence of error in the control, state, and adjoint state under some regularity assumptions on the solutions.

This paper investigates this relationship for time-invariant delay systems. We show that UGAS and GAS are equivalent for this class of systems under the assumption of robust forward completeness, i.e., under the assumption that the reachable set from any bounded set of initial states on any finite time horizon is bounded. We also show that, if the state space is a space in a particular family of Sobolev or Hölder spaces, then GAS is equivalent to UGAS and that robust forward completeness holds. Based on these equivalences, we provide a novel Lyapunov characterization of GAS (and UGAS) in the aforementioned spaces.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the adaptive consensus tracking control problem for strict-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems with parameter uncertainty under both fixed and switching topologies. When the topology is fixed, we first propose a novel distributed fusion least-squares algorithm without regressor filtering, which has a clear advantage that the estimate of each agent converges to the true parameter value under a weak cooperative persistent excitation condition. Then, we design a new adaptive consensus tracking control law to guarantee that each agent can asymptotically track the reference trajectory. After that, we generalize the corresponding results to the switching topology case. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Since uncertainties in many physical systems have impulsive properties poorly modeled by Gaussian distributions, heavier-tailed distributions, such as Laplace, may be used to improve model characteristics. From insights obtained through development of the scalar Laplace estimator, an algorithm is determined for the vector-state case. For a discrete-time vector linear system with scalar additive Laplace-distributed process and measurement noises, the a priori and a posteriori conditional probability density functions (pdfs) of the system states given the measurement history are propagated recursively and in closed form. The conditional pdfs are composed of signs and absolute values of affine functions, and a basis composed of signs of affine functions is constructed to simplify their representation. The a posteriori conditional mean and variance are derived analytically from the conditional pdf using characteristic functions. Generalization to independent vector measurement and process noises is straightforward. From the general method for deriving Laplace estimators in $n$-dimensions, a two-dimensional minimum variance estimator is explicitly developed, and a simulation is presented.},

This is a free-boundary problem that models solidification or melting processes. In each phase, a parabolic equation, completed with initial and boundary conditions, must be satisfied; the phases are separated by a phase change interface, where an additional free-boundary condition is imposed (the so-called Stefan condition). We assume that two localized sources of heating/cooling controls act on the system (one in each phase). We prove the following local null controllability result: the temperatures can be steered to zero and, simultaneously, the interface can be steered to a prescribed location provided the initial data and the interface position are sufficiently close to the targets. The ingredients of the proofs are a compactness-uniqueness argument (which gives appropriate observability estimates adapted to constraints) and a fixed-point formulation and resolution of the controllability problem (which gives the result for the nonlinear system). We also prove a negative result corresponding to the case where only one control acts on the system and the interface does not collapse to the boundary.},

Using the parameter-dependent vector technique, which helps to exploit more effectively all the information of vertex-matrices, we obtain a less conservative sufficient condition for the existence of an $\alpha$-exponential estimate. Furthermore, together with the constructions of respective numerical algorithms, our method can compute and provide “more accurate” $\alpha$-exponential estimates.

  abstract     = {We develop a new iterative method based on the Pontryagin principle to solve stochastic control problems. This method is nothing other than the Newton method extended to the framework of stochastic optimal control, where the state dynamics are given by an ODEs with stochastic coefficients and the cost is random. Each iteration of the method is made of two ingredients: computing the Newton direction, and finding an adapted step length. The Newton direction is obtained by solving an affine-linear Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) with random coefficients. This is done in the setting of a general filtration. Solving such an FBSDE reduces to solving a Riccati Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) and an affine-linear BSDE, as expected in the framework of linear FBSDEs or Linear-Quadratic stochastic control problems. We then establish convergence results for this Newton method. In particular, Lipschitz-continuity of the second-order derivative of the cost functional is established with an appropriate choice of norm and under boundedness assumptions, which is sufficient to prove (local) quadratic convergence of the method in the space of uniformly bounded processes. To choose an appropriate step length while fitting our choice of space of processes, an adapted Backtracking line search method is developed. We then prove global convergence of the Newton method with the proposed line search procedure, which occurs at a quadratic rate after finitely many iterations. An implementation with regression techniques to solve BSDEs arising in the computation of the Newton step is developed. We apply it to the control problem of a large number of batteries providing ancillary services to an electricity network.},

We show that they can be described as $\mathbb{F}[d^2]$-modules and present explicit representation of the set of equivalent encoders. We investigate their state-space representation and present two different but equivalent types of state-space realizations for these codes. These novel representations can be implemented by realizing two linear time-invariant systems separately and switching the input (or the output) that is entering (or leaving) the system. We investigate their minimality and provide necessary and also sufficient conditions in terms of the reachability and observability properties of the two linear systems involved. The ideas presented here can be easily generalized for codes with period larger than 2.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider two one-dimensional fluid-structure models where the parabolic component is degenerate. The first model that we consider involves a wave equation and a degenerate parabolic equation with natural transmissions. We discuss stability issues for this system under the Dirichlet boundary conditions at the outer endpoints. We show that when the degeneracy is weak (power is less than one), the underlying semigroup is polynomially stable, and provide sharp decay rates. The second model involves a beam equation and a weakly degenerate parabolic equation. For this model, we prove that the semigroup is exponentially stable. Our proofs are constructive, and combine the frequency domain method, boot strapping arguments, Hardy inequalities, and multipliers technique. In particular for the hyperbolic/parabolic model, our stability result generalizes and improves in some sense existing ones in the one-dimensional setting, while providing a simpler proof. As for the beam/parabolic model, our result seems to be the first even in the nondegenerate case.},

The second-order adjoint processes are introduced in the augmented Hamiltonian minimization step since the control domain is not necessarily convex. Thanks to the theory of bounded mean oscillation martingales, we give a delicate proof of the error estimate and then prove the convergence of the modified MSA algorithm. In a special case, we obtain a logarithmic convergence rate. When the control domain is convex and compact, a sufficient condition which makes the control returned from the MSA algorithm be a near-optimal control is given for a class of linear FBSCSs.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we consider a control system governed by a general ordinary differential equation on a Riemannian manifold M, with its endpoints satisfying some inequalities and its control constrained to a closed convex set. We obtain a second-order necessary optimality condition through the convex variation for an optimal control problem of this system (i.e., Theorem \refc230). It has the following characteristics. First, comparing to the second-order necessary optimality condition obtained by the needle variation (e.g., [Deng and Zhang, J. Differential Equations, 272 (2021), pp. 854--910, Theorem 2.2] and [Warga, J. Differential Equations, 28 (1978), pp. 284--307, Theorem 2.2]) it works for a different family of candidates for optimal pairs. Second, any condition of controllability type on the linearized system is not required. Third, Theorem 2.2 involves the second-order adjacent subset, which plays roles especially in the case where an admissible control stays at the boundary of the control set. Actually, we give an example (Example 2.6) to support the above features. The curvature tensor also arises in Theorem 2.2.},

Our motivating examples are a bottom-heavy underwater vehicle and a top spinning on a movable base. Their configuration space is the special Euclidean group $\mathsf{SE}(3) = \mathsf{SO}(3) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the $\mathsf{SE}(3)$-symmetry is broken by the gravity.

A complete geometric characterization of systems of that class requires special properties of the linearizability distributions $\mathcal{D}^0 \subset \mathcal{D}^1 \subset\mathcal{D}^2 \subset \cdots$. Contrary to the case of regular (i.e., invertible and static) feedback linearization, they need not be involutive but the first noninvolutive one has to contain a sufficiently large involutive subdistribution. Recently, we solved the problem of $\mathcal{D}^0$ being noninvolutive and then that of $\mathcal{D}^0$ involutive but $\mathcal{D}^1$ noninvolutive. In the present paper, we study the general case: the first noninvolutive distribution is $\mathcal{D}^k$, with $k\geq 0$ arbitrary. We provide geometric necessary and sufficient conditions, which can be verified by differentiation and algebraic operations only, describing our class of systems. We illustrate our results by several examples and discuss relations with other linearizability problems (static invertible feedback linearization or dynamic linearization).},

  abstract     = {There has been an increased interest in the variation diminishing properties of controlled linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and time-varying linear systems without inputs. In controlled LTI systems, these properties have recently been studied from the external perspective of $k$-positive Hankel operators. Such systems have Hankel operators that diminish the number of sign changes (the variation) from past input to future output if the input variation is at most $k-1$. For $k=1$, this coincides with the classical class of externally positive systems. For linear systems without inputs, the focus has been on the internal perspective of $k$-positive state-transition matrices, which diminish the variation of the initial system state. In the LTI case and for $k=1$, this corresponds to the classical class of (unforced) positive systems. This paper bridges the gap between the internal and external perspectives of $k$-positivity by analyzing internally Hankel $k$-positive systems, which we define as state-space LTI systems where controllability and observability operators as well as the state-transition matrix are $k$-positive. We show that the existing notions of external Hankel and internal $k$-positivity are subsumed under internal Hankel $k$-positivity, and we derive tractable conditions for verifying this property in the form of internal positivity of the first $k$ compound systems. As such, this class provides new means to verify external Hankel $k$-positivity, and lays the foundation for future investigations of variation diminishing controlled linear systems. As an application, we use our framework to derive new bounds for the number of over- and undershoots in the step responses of LTI systems. Since our characterization defines a new positive realization problem, we also discuss geometric conditions for the existence of minimal internally Hankel $k$-positive realizations.},

  abstract     = {The paper deals with stochastic control problems associated with $H_2$ performance indices such as energy or power norms or energy measurements. The control applies to a class of systems for which a stochastic process conveys the underlying uncertainties, known as control and state variation increase uncertainty (CSVIU). These indices allow various emphases, focusing on the transient behavior with the discounted norm to stricter conditions on stability and steady-state mean-square error and convergence rate, using the optimal overtaking criterion. The long-run average power control stands as a midpoint in this respect. A critical advance regards the explicit form of the optimal control law, expressed in two forms. One takes a perturbed affine Riccati-like form of feedback solution; the other comes from a generalized normal equation that arises from the nondifferentiable local optimal problem. They are equivalent, but the former allows optimality and stability, and the latter develops into a search method to attain the optimal law. A detectability notion and a Riccati solution grant stochastic stability from the behavior of the norms. The energy overtaking criterion requires a further constraint on a matrix spectral radius. With these findings, the paper revisits the rising of the inaction solution, a prominent feature of CSVIU models to deal with the uncertainty inherent to poorly known models. Besides the optimal solution, it provides the tools to pursue it.},

We introduce a phase-field formulation of this problem through diffuse interfaces between the lenses and the surrounding fluid. The resulting formulation is shown to be well-posed, and we prove that the corresponding optimization problem has a minimizer. By analyzing properties of the reduced objective functional and well-posedness of the adjoint problem, we rigorously derive first-order optimality conditions for this problem. Additionally, we consider the $\Gamma$-limit of the reduced objective functional and in this way establish a relation between the diffuse interface problem and a perimeter-regularized sharp interface shape optimization problem.},

This is done by applying the optimal convex Lyapunov function called the Barabanov norm, which provides a very refined analysis of trajectories. Until recently that notion remained rather theoretical apart from special cases. In 2015 N. Guglielmi and M. Zennaro [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 36 (2015), pp. 634--655] showed that many systems possess at least one efficiently computed Barabanov norm. In this paper we classify all possible Barabanov norms and prove that, under mild assumptions, which can be verified algorithmically, those norms are unique and are either piecewise-linear or piecewise-quadratic. For some narrow classes of systems, there are more complicated Barabanov norms, but they can still be classified and constructed. Using those results we find all trajectories of the fastest growth.

Under centralized information structure, we first obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of open-loop and closed-loop saddle points, which are characterized by the solvability of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) and two coupled Riccati equations, respectively. By considering the infinite system, we next design a set of decentralized open-loop strategies based on mean field FBSDEs and obtain closed-loop strategies in terms of two uncoupled Riccati equations. Finally, the performance of the proposed decentralized strategies is analyzed and the efficiency is verified by numerical simulation.},

Yet, while the mathematics and applications of the SBP/OMT have been developing at a considerable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant attention; the problem of interpolating between “unbalanced” marginals has been approached by introducing source/sink terms into the transport equations, in an ad hoc manner, chiefly driven by applications in image registration. Nevertheless, losses are inherent in many physical processes, and thereby models that account for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed marginals following Schrödinger&#39;s dictum; that is, it is necessary to adjust the probability of trajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal observation point, so that the updated law represents the most likely way that particles may have been transported, or have vanished, at some intermediate point. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of the SBP for stochastic evolution with losses, whereupon particles are “killed” (jump into a coffin/extinction state) according to a probabilistic law, and thereby mass is gradually lost along their stochastically driven flow. Through a suitable embedding we turn the problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism in the style of Schrödinger, given a prior law that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles along with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving a Feynman--Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure: The latter, as we argue, is far from Schrödinger&#39;s quest. An iterative scheme, generalizing the celebrated Fortet-IPF-Sinkhorn algorithm, permits us to compute the new drift and the new killing rate of the path-space solution measure. We finally formulate and solve a related fluid-dynamic control problem for the flow of one-time marginals where both the drift and the new killing rate play the role of control variables.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an infinite horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time linear systems and quadratic criteria, both with random parameters which are independent and identically distributed with respect to time. A classical approach is to solve an algebraic Riccati equation that involves mathematical expectations and requires certain statistical information of the parameters. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm in the spirit of Q-learning for the situation where only one random sample of parameters emerges at each time step. The first theorem proves the equivalence of three properties: the convergence of the learning sequence, the well-posedness of the control problem, and the solvability of the algebraic Riccati equation. The second theorem shows that the adaptive feedback control in terms of the learning sequence stabilizes the system as long as the control problem is well-posed. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate our results.},

In order to study its performance, we first derive its continuous-time limit as a system of differential inclusions. We then study sufficient conditions for tracking a KKT trajectory, and also derive asymptotic bounds for the tracking error (as a function of the time-variability of a KKT trajectory). Further, we provide a set of sufficient conditions for the KKT trajectories not to bifurcate or merge, and also investigate the optimal choice of the parameters of the algorithm.

The movement of each agent is described by a control system depending in their position, the distribution of other agents in the same population, and the distribution of agents on other populations. Thus, interactions between agents occur through their dynamics. In this paper we consider the existence of Lagrangian equilibria to this mean field game, their asymptotic behavior, and their characterization as solutions of a mean field game system, under few regularity assumptions on agents&#39; dynamics.

Using this representation, it has previously been demonstrated that one may obtain fundamental solutions for two-point boundary value problems for some classes of conservative systems via a solution of an associated dynamic program. It is also known that the gravitational and Coulomb potentials may be represented as stationary points of cubicly parameterized quadratic functionals. Hence, stationary points of the action functional may be represented via iterated “staticization” of polynomial functionals, where the staticization operator (introduced and discussed in [J. Differential Equations, 264 (2018), pp. 525--549] and [Automatica J. IFAC, 81 (2017), pp. 56--67]) maps a function to the function value(s) at its stationary (i.e., critical) points. This leads to representations through operations on sets of solutions of differential Riccati equations. A key step in this process is the reordering of staticization operations. Conditions under which this reordering is allowed are obtained, and it is shown that the conditions are satisfied for an astrodynamics problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a class of space fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) that describe gas pressures in fractured media. First, the well-posedness, uniqueness, and stability of the considered FPDEs are investigated. Then, the reference tracking problem is studied to track the pressure gradient at a downstream location of a channel. This requires manipulation of gas pressure at the downstream location and the use of pressure measurements at an upstream location. To achieve this, the backstepping approach is adapted to the space FPDEs. The key challenge in this adaptation is the nonapplicability of the Lyapunov theory, which is typically used to prove the stability of the target system as the obtained target system is fractional in space. In addition, a backstepping adaptive observer is designed to jointly estimate both the system&#39;s state and the disturbance. The stability of the closed loop (reference tracking controller/observer) is also investigated. Finally, numerical simulations are given to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Under this framework, the existing works on identification can be categorized as special cases of these two phenomena. Several effective criteria for determining the identifiability and the corresponding identification algorithms are proposed. Two novel and important results are derived for the multiple-samples case: (1) A Boolean network is identifiable if and only if it is observable. (2) A BCN is identifiable if it is O1-observable, where O1-observability is the most general form of the existing observability terms. In addition, remarks present some challenging future research and contain a preliminary attempt about how to identify unobservable systems.},

We design distributed algorithms to estimate the unknown orders and parameters by combining the proposed local information criterion with the distributed least squares method. The simultaneous estimation for both the system orders and parameters brings challenges for the theoretical analysis. Some analysis techniques, such as double array martingale limit theory, stochastic Lyapunov functions, and martingale convergence theorems are employed. For the case where the upper bounds of the true orders are available, we introduce a cooperative excitation condition, under which the strong consistency of the estimation for the orders and parameters is established. Moreover, for the case where the upper bounds of true orders are unknown, a similar distributed algorithm is proposed to estimate both the orders and parameters, and the corresponding convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm is provided. We remark that our results are obtained without relying on the independency or stationarity assumptions of regression vectors, and the cooperative excitation conditions can show that all sensors can cooperate to fulfill the estimation task even though any individual sensor cannot.},

Unlike most Stackelberg game literature, the state to be controlled is characterized by a backward stochastic differential equation for which the terminal- instead of the initial-condition is specified a priori; the decisions of the leader consist of a static terminal-perturbation and a dynamic linear-quadratic control. In addition, the terminal control is subject to (convex-closed) pointwise and (affine) expectation constraints. Both constraints arise from real applications such as mathematical finance. For the information pattern, the leader announces both terminal and open-loop dynamic decisions at the initial time while taking into account the best response of the follower. Then, two interrelated optimization problems are sequentially solved by the follower (a backward linear-quadratic problem) and the leader (a mixed terminal-perturbation and backward-forward LQ problem). Our open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium is represented by some coupled backward-forward stochastic differential equations (BFSDEs) with mixed initial-terminal conditions. Our BFSDEs also involve a nonlinear projection operator (due to pointwise constraint) combining with a Karush--Kuhn--Tucker system (due to expectation constraint) via Lagrange multiplier. The global solvability of such BFSDEs is also discussed in some nontrivial cases. Our results are applied to one financial example.},

In particular, the weight function of the optimal linear filter, which solves a complicated operator equation in general, simplifies to the Riccati ordinary differential equation in the martingale case. This reduction lies in the foundations of the Kalman--Bucy approach to linear optimal filtering. In this paper we consider a basic Kalman--Bucy model with noises, generated by independent fractional Brownian motions, and develop a new method of asymptotic analysis of the integro-differential filtering equation arising in this case. We establish existence of the steady-state error limit and find its asymptotic scaling in the high signal-to-noise regime. Closed form expressions are derived in a number of important cases.},

  abstract     = {In optimal control theory one sometimes extends the minimization domain of a given problem, with the aim of achieving the existence of an optimal control. However, this issue is naturally confronted with the possibility of a gap between the original infimum value and the extended one. Avoiding this phenomenon is not a trivial issue, especially when the trajectories are subject to endpoint constraints. However, since the seminal works by Warga, some authors have recognized “normality” of an extended minimizer as a condition guaranteeing the absence of an infimum gap. Yet, normality is far from being necessary for this goal, a fact that makes the search for weaker assumptions a reasonable aim. In relation to a control-affine system with unbounded controls, in this paper we prove a sufficient no-gap condition based on a notion of higher order normality, which is less demanding than the standard normality and involves iterated Lie brackets of the vector fields defining the dynamics.},

We prove the existence of optimal solutions for the distributionally robust control problem, and the approximated and smoothed problems, and show that a worst-case distribution exists. For the numerical solution of the approximated problem, we develop a homotopy method that computes a sequence of stationary points of smoothed problems while decreasing smoothing parameters to zero.

We illustrate the impact of these formulae with an explicit description of the solution of time-varying Riccati difference equations and its fundamental-type solution in terms of the fixed point of the equation and an invertible linear matrix map as well as uniform upper and lower bounds on the Riccati maps.

  abstract     = {We study the temperature control problem for Langevin diffusions in the context of nonconvex optimization. The classical optimal control of such a problem is of the bang-bang type, which is overly sensitive to errors. A remedy is to allow the diffusions to explore other temperature values and hence smooth out the bang-bang control. We accomplish this by a stochastic relaxed control formulation incorporating randomization of the temperature control and regularizing its entropy. We derive a state-dependent, truncated exponential distribution, which can be used to sample temperatures in a Langevin algorithm, in terms of the solution to an Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman partial differential equation. We carry out a numerical experiment on a one-dimensional baseline example, in which the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation can be easily solved, to compare the performance of the algorithm with three other available algorithms in search of a global optimum.},

The system interacts with external bosonic fields, and its Hamiltonian and coupling operators depend linearly on the system variables. This results in a Hudson--Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) whose drift and dispersion terms are affine and linear functions of the system variables. The quasilinearity of the QSDE leads to tractable dynamics of mean values and higher-order multipoint moments of the system variables driven by vacuum input fields. This allows for the closed-form computation of the quasi-characteristic function of the invariant quantum state of the system and infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rates for a class of cost functionals. The tractability of the moment dynamics is also used for mean square optimal Luenberger observer design in a measurement-based filtering problem for a quasilinear quantum plant, which leads to a Kalman-like quantum filter.},

  abstract     = {The present work is devoted to a study of the solvability of a class of non-Lipschitz and noncanonical backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) that naturally arises from an intertemporal mutual fund management problem; to this end, we propose a method of combining the techniques of Malliavin calculus and a discussion on the Jacobian flow of the BSDE. Specifically, based on the intimate relationship between $Y_t$ and $Z_t$ of the BSDE via the Malliavin derivative of the former, namely, $D_tY_t=Z_t$, we construct an iterative Picard converging scheme for approximating the underlying solution pair by first obtaining $Z_t$ from the derived BSDE with respect to the Malliavin derivative and then recovering $Y_t$ from the underlying BSDE. A local unique existence result is first warranted over a short time horizon with carefully examined a priori estimates; indeed, each term in the iterative sequence is related to different Girsanov transforms for change of measure, and comparing them demands a delicate analysis. The use of Jacobian flow further enables us to properly control the lower and upper bounds for a certain product of the forward process and $Z_t$, which enables us to extend the solution globally by an inductive argument. Our proposed method is fundamentally different from other probabilistic methods that also involve estimating or bounding Malliavin traces such as [E. Pardoux and S. Peng, Some Backward SDEs with Non-Lipschitz Coefficients, Technical note, Université de Provence, Aix-en-Provence, France, 1996] and [M. C. Zedouri, Equations Différentielles Stochastiques Rétrogrades avec Générateurs Lipschitiziens Stochastiques, Master&#39;s Thesis, Université Mohammed Seddik Ben Yahia-Jijel, Jijel, Algeria, 2010]. We believe that our new approach proposed here can be potentially applied to resolve many other general non-Lipschitz forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) encountered in economics and finance, especially in the presence of generic utility functions.},

  abstract     = {This special section of the SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization (SICON) addresses the fundamental challenges inherent in the mathematical modeling, analysis, and control of epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought into the spotlight the critical importance of understanding complex epidemic processes. Yet the modeling, analysis, estimation, and control of these processes presents several formidable challenges. Epidemics inherently exhibit nonlinear dynamics as they spread through populations, requiring analytical techniques that can accurately capture both the transient and the steady-state aspects of the disease. Furthermore, careful attention must be paid to the resolution at which to model the epidemics, ranging from coarse mass-action models to metapopulation and individual-level models. Each of these approaches provides different insights and challenges for analysis and control. Models that operate at finer resolutions will also come with an increase in complexity, necessitating tractable abstractions ranging from mean-field models to deterministic and stochastic ODEs and PDEs. In the context of estimation of epidemics, the key challenge is to determine the important parameters of the epidemic (often in real time) based on data gathered from the affected population, in conjunction with dynamical models of the spreading process. Finally, formulating techniques to optimally control and address an ongoing epidemic (through either a centralized intervention, decentralized incentive mechanisms, or resource allocation policies) remains a critical challenge. The special section gathers contributions from the intersection of the fields of systems and control theory and the mathematical study of epidemic spread processes. A total of 16 papers represents a wide range of topics in modeling, identification, dynamic analysis, control, and optimization. Regarding modeling problems, the section covers contributions on Polya contagion networks, networked bivirus epidemic models, and age-differentiated compartmental models. For dynamic analysis, the section highlights contributions on explicit solutions and control design for simplified models, convergence and equilibria analysis, as well as the role of delays and saturations in closed loop settings. For identification and estimation problems, contributions are offered on the identifiability of model parameters and on parameter estimation using limited measurements. Most of the contributed articles focus on control design, optimization, and game theoretic problems. Centralized and distributed strategies are proposed. Actuation mechanisms include edge deletion, test allocation, optimal incentives, optimal switching between lockdown and opening the economy, screening, and curing policies. We believe this special section presents an excellent cross section of current research and hope that it will be of great interest to the broad readership of SICON.

Although similar in form to the standard SIR, SIR-NC admits a closed form solution while allowing us to model mortality and also provides a different, and arguably a more realistic, interpretation of model parameters. Numerical comparisons of this SIR-NC model with the standard, population conserving, SIR model are provided. Extensions to include imported infections, interacting communities, and models that include births and deaths are presented and analyzed. Several numerical examples are also presented to illustrate these models. A discrete time control problem for the SIR-NC epidemic model is presented in which the cost function depends on variables that correspond to the levels of lockdown, the level of testing and quarantine, and the number of infections. We include a switching cost for moving between lockdown levels. Numerical experiments are presented.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new model for contagion spread using a network of interacting finite memory two-color Pólya urns, which we refer to as the finite memory interacting Pólya contagion network. The urns interact in the sense that the probability of drawing a red ball (which represents an infection state) for a given urn, not only depends on the ratio of red balls in that urn but also on the ratio of red balls in the other urns in the network, hence accounting for the effect of spatial contagion. The resulting networkwide contagion process is a discrete-time finite-memory ($M$th order) Markov process, whose transition probability matrix is determined. The stochastic properties of the network contagion Markov process are analytically examined, and for homogeneous system parameters, we characterize the limiting state of infection in each urn. For the nonhomogeneous case, given the complexity of the stochastic process, and in the same spirit as the well-studied SIS models, we use a mean-field type approximation to obtain a discrete-time dynamical system for the finite memory interacting Pólya contagion network. Interestingly, for $M=1$, we obtain a linear dynamical system which exactly represents the corresponding Markov process. For $M&gt;1$, we use mean-field approximation to obtain a nonlinear dynamical system. Furthermore, noting that the latter dynamical system admits a linear variant (realized by retaining its leading linear terms), we study the asymptotic behavior of the linear systems for both memory modes and characterize their equilibrium. Finally, we present simulation studies to assess the quality of the approximation purveyed by the linear and nonlinear dynamical systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a networked bivirus model, in which two competing viruses spread across a network of interconnected populations; each node represents a population with a large number of individuals. The viruses may spread through possibly different network structures, and an individual cannot be simultaneously infected with both viruses. Focusing on convergence and equilibria analysis, a number of new results are provided. First, we show that for networks with generic system parameters, there exist a finite number of equilibria. Exploiting monotone systems theory, we further prove that for bivirus networks with generic system parameters, convergence to an equilibrium occurs for all initial conditions, except possibly for a set of measure zero. Given the network structure of one virus, a method is presented to construct an infinite family of network structures for the other virus that results in an infinite number of equilibria in which both viruses coexist. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the local stability/instability of boundary equilibria, in which one virus is present and the other is extinct. A sufficient condition for a boundary equilibrium to be almost globally stable is presented. Then, we show how to use monotone systems theory to generate conclusions on the ordering of stable and unstable equilibria, and in some instances identify the number of equilibria via rapid simulation testing. Last, we provide an analytical method for computing equilibria in networks with only two nodes, and show that it is possible for a bivirus network to have an unstable coexistence equilibrium and two locally stable boundary equilibria.},

The principal influences the nature of the resulting Nash equilibrium through incentives to optimize its own objective. We analyze this game using a probabilistic approach. We then propose an application to an epidemic model of SIR type in which the agents control the intensities of their interactions, and the principal is a regulator acting with nonpharmaceutical interventions. To compute the solutions, we propose an innovative numerical approach based on Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning tools for stochastic optimization. We conclude with numerical experiments illustrating the impact of the agents&#39; and the regulator&#39;s optimal decisions in two specific models: a basic SIR model with semiexplicit solutions and a more complex model with a larger state space.},

First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity optimization and Monte Carlo techniques to obtain solutions with explicit quality guarantees. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the problem of using the data from the sensing system to obtain estimates of the initial patient and the current status of the epidemic. Finally, we consider the problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize this problem in terms of mutual information and propose an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte Carlo--based algorithms for non-Markovian dynamics or large networks. We illustrate the performance of the proposed framework in numerical experiments involving a model of COVID-19 applied to a real human contact network.},

The model belongs to the class of continuous-time models, usually involving ordinary/partial differential equations, but has a novel feature. The core model---a single integral equation---does not explicitly use transition rates between compartments. Instead, it is based on statistical information on the disease status of infected individuals, depending on the time since infection. The approach is especially relevant for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in which infected individuals are infectious before onset of symptoms during a relatively long incubation period. Based on the analysis of the proposed optimal control problem, including necessary optimality conditions, this paper outlines some efficient numerical approaches. Numerical solutions show some interesting features of the optimal policy for social distancing, depending on the weights attributed to the number of isolated individuals with symptoms and to economic losses due to the enforcement of the control policy. The general nature of the model allows for inclusion of additional epidemic features with minor adaptations in the basic equations. Therefore, the modeling approach may contribute to the analysis of combined intervention strategies and to the guidance of public health decisions.},

Our analysis highlights the critical importance of speed and scale in the TeTrIs process. Precisely, ensuring that the delay in the TeTrIs process is much smaller than the doubling time of the disease spread is necessary for achieving acceptable performance. Similarly, limited TeTrIs capacity introduces a threshold on the size of an outbreak beyond which the disease spreads almost like the uncontrolled case. Along the way, we provide numerical illustrations to highlight these points.},

  abstract     = {We investigate optimization policies for resource distribution in network epidemics using a model that derives from the classical Pólya process. This model, called the Pólya network contagion process, is based on a modified urn sampling scheme that accounts for both temporal and spatial contagion between neighboring nodes in a network. We study two infection mitigation problems---one which takes place upon initialization and one which occurs continually as the Pólya network process develops. We frame these problems as resource allocation problems with fixed budgets and analyze a suite of potential policies. Due to the complexity of these problems, we introduce effective proxy measures for the average infection rate in each case. We also prove that the two-sided infection-curing game on the so-called expected network exposure admits a Nash equilibrium. In both the curing and initialization scenarios, we introduce heuristic policies that primarily function on the basis of limiting the number of targeted nodes within a particular network setup. Simulations are run for mid-to-large--scale networks to compare performance of our heuristics to provably convergent gradient descent algorithms run on the simplified proxy measures.},

Then, optimal mass-testing and age-dependent social distancing policies are determined by solving optimal control problems both in open loop and within a model predictive control framework. We aim to minimize testing and/or social distancing until herd immunity sets in under a constraint on the number of available intensive care units. We find that an early and short lockdown is inevitable but can be slowly relaxed over the following months.},

  abstract     = {Italy was the first country to be affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe. In the past months, predictive mathematical models have been used to understand the proportion of this epidemic and identify effective policies to control it, but few have considered the impact of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infections in a structured setting. A critical problem that hinders the accuracy of these models is indeed given by the presence of a large number of asymptomatic individuals in the population. This number is estimated to be large, sometimes between 3 and 10 times the diagnosed patients. We focus on this aspect through the formulation of a model that captures two types of interactions---one with asymptomatic individuals and another with symptomatic infected. We also extend the original model to capture the interactions in the population via complex networks, and, in particular, the Watts--Strogatz model, which is the most suitable for social networks. The contributions of this paper include (i) the formulation of an epidemic model, which we call SAIR, that discriminates between asymptomatic and symptomatic infected through different measures of interactions and the corresponding stability analysis of the system in feedback form through the calculation of the $\mathcal R_0$ as $H_\infty$ gain; (ii) the analysis of the corresponding structured model involving the Watts and Strogatz interaction topology, to study the case of heterogeneous connectivity in the population; (iii) a case study on the Italian case, where we take into account the Istat seroprevalence study in the homogeneous case first, and then we analyze the impact of summer tourism and of the start of school in September in the heterogeneous case.},

Specifically, we analyze the susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered (SAIR) epidemic in the framework of activity-driven networks with heterogeneous node degrees and time-varying activation rates and derive both individual- and degree-based mean-field approximations of the exact state evolution. We then present a game-theoretic model where nodes choose their activation probabilities in a strategic manner using current state information as feedback, and we characterize the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) of the proposed setting. We then consider the activity-driven susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model, characterize equilibrium activation probabilities, and analyze epidemic evolution in closed-loop. Our numerical results provide compelling insights into epidemic evolution under game-theoretic activation. Specifically, for the SAIR epidemic, we show that under suitable conditions, the epidemic can persist, as any decrease in infected proportion is counteracted by an increase in activity rates by the nodes. For the SIS epidemic, we show that in regimes where there is an endemic state, the infected proportion could be significantly smaller under game-theoretic activation if the loss upon infection is sufficiently high.},

Such parameters are typically estimated by measuring various characteristics (such as the number of infected and recovered individuals) of the infected populations over time. However, these measurements also incur certain costs, depending on the population being tested and the times at which the tests are administered. We thus formulate the epidemic parameter estimation problem as an optimization problem, where the goal is to either minimize the total cost spent on collecting measurements or to optimize the parameter estimates while remaining within a measurement budget. We show that these problems are NP-hard to solve in general and then propose approximation algorithms with performance guarantees. We validate our algorithms using numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {It is known that the parameters in the deterministic and stochastic SEIR epidemic models are structurally identifiable. For example, from knowledge of the infected population time series $I(t)$ during the entire epidemic, the parameters can be successfully estimated. In this article we observe that estimation will fail in practice if only infected case data during the early part of the epidemic (prepeak) is available. This fact can be explained using a well-known phenomenon called dynamical compensation. We use this concept to derive an unidentifiability manifold in the parameter space of SEIR that consists of parameters indistinguishable from $I(t)$ early in the epidemic. Thus, identifiability depends on the extent of the system trajectory that is available for observation. Although the existence of the unidentifiability manifold obstructs the ability to exactly determine the parameters, we suggest that it may be useful for uncertainty quantification purposes. A variant of SEIR recently proposed for COVID-19 modeling is also analyzed, and an analogous unidentifiability surface is derived.},

In order to control the spread of the disease inside a prison, we consider an active case-finding strategy, consisting of screening a proportion of new inmates at the entry point, followed by a treatment depending on the results of this procedure. The control variable consists then in the coverage of the screening applied to new inmates. The disease dynamics is modeled by a SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model, typically used to represent diseases that do not confer immunity after infection. We determine the optimal strategy that minimizes a combination between the cost of the screening/treatment at the entrance and the cost of maintaining infected individuals inside the prison, in a given time horizon. Using the Pontryagin maximum principle and the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation, among other tools, we provide the complete synthesis of an optimal feedback control, consisting in a bang-bang strategy with at most two switching times and no singular arc trajectory, characterizing different profiles depending on model parameters.},

The Nash-type game in this framework is called fictitious as it is between the decision maker (called real player) and an auxiliary control variable (called fictitious player) with the real player and fictitious player looking for time-consistent policy and precommitted optimal policy, respectively. Namely, the fictitious game framework is actually an auxiliary-variable-based mechanism where the fictitious player is our particular design. Noting that the real player&#39;s cost functional is revised in accordance with that of the fictitious player, the equilibrium policy of the real player is called an open-loop self-coordination control of the original LQ problem. As a generalization, a time-inconsistent nonzero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic dynamic game is investigated, where one player looks for a precommitted optimal policy and the other player searches for a time-consistent policy. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the existence of open-loop equilibrium of the nonzero-sum game, which resort to a set of Riccati-like equations and linear equations. By applying the developed theory of nonzero-sum game, open-loop self-coordination control of the LQ optimal control is fully characterized, and multiperiod mean-variance portfolio selection is also investigated.},

Assuming that the total amount of agents to be given has been determined a priori based on a medical assessment of its side effects, we consider the problem how to best administer this amount. The model assumes a homogenous tumor and if the aim is to minimize the tumor volume, then optimal controls administer the total dose in a single maximum dose session. As, however, angiogenic effects of the agent are taken into account, this no longer is optimal. Lower dose strategies determined by an optimal singular arc with significantly reduced dose rates give a better response over time. In this paper, for the medically realistic domain of the mathematical model, the concatenation structure of optimal controlled trajectories as segments of bang and singular arcs is determined. This leads to simple numerical minimization procedures for the computation of globally optimal controls.},

  abstract     = {We are concerned with global practical tracking for uncertain nonlinear systems with intrinsic dependence on unmeasured states. Typically, we aim to remove the polynomial restrictions on system growth rates in relevant works, admitting the rates to be of arbitrary function-of-output type. Note that such highly nonlinear rates could alter so drastically in magnitude that no polynomial can upper bound them on any unbounded region, and would undermine the design rationale and the analysis route that are followed in polynomial rate scenarios. This entails refining/integrating state-of-the-art techniques and developing new ones, from design to analysis. Concretely, to circumvent the need for knowledge on polynomials, dual dynamic high gains are devised ingeniously which particularly incorporate certain highly nonlinear components to counteract the arbitrary function-of-output rates and other inherent nonlinearities and uncertainties. But unfavorable impacts of the components would also arise putting the effectiveness of the high gains at risk, which necessitates noticeable changes in the choice of vital variables/functions. In addition, to provide tractable observer error dynamics for control design and analysis, a nonlinear high-gain observer is pursued, which is filter based and of reduced order, following the design methodologies in relevant works. In terms of performance analysis, practical tracking suffers extra time variants and additive uncertainties which together with the highly nonlinear rates would carry over to stability analysis inevitably and in turn ruin the existing analysis routes. Hence, a new analysis route is paved to verify the anticipated performance. Notably, by unfolding an important implication, the performance verification boils down largely to the boundedness of the high gains. This makes plain and intelligible the verification, although sophisticated integration of multiple composite Lyapunov functions is still required. An exception, i.e., asymptotic stabilization, is presented to demonstrate its close connection with practical tracking.},

  abstract     = {We consider an ergodic harvesting problem with model ambiguity that arises from biology. To account for the ambiguity, the problem is constructed as a stochastic game with two players: the decision maker (DM) chooses the “best” harvesting policy, and an adverse player chooses the “worst” probability measure. The main result is establishing an optimal strategy (also referred to as a control) of the DM and showing that it is a threshold policy. The optimal threshold and the optimal payoff are obtained by solving a free-boundary problem emerging from the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. As part of the proof, we fix a gap that appeared in the HJB analysis of [Alvarez and Hening, Stochastic Process. Appl., 2019, in press], a paper that analyzed the risk-neutral version of the ergodic harvesting problem. Finally, we study the dependence of the optimal threshold and the optimal payoff on the ambiguity parameter and show that if the ambiguity goes to 0, the problem converges to the risk-neutral problem.},

  abstract     = {We study distributed estimation of a high-dimensional static parameter vector through a group of sensors whose communication network is modeled by a fixed directed graph. Different from existing time-triggered communication schemes, an event-triggered asynchronous scheme is investigated in order to reduce communication while preserving estimation convergence. A distributed estimation algorithm with a single step size is first proposed based on an event-triggered communication scheme with a time-dependent decaying threshold. With the event-triggered scheme, each sensor sends its estimate to neighbor sensors only when the difference between the current estimate and the last sent-out estimate is larger than the triggering threshold. Different sensors can have different step sizes and triggering thresholds, enabling the parameter estimation process to be conducted in a fully distributed way. We prove that the proposed algorithm has mean-square and almost-sure convergence, respectively, under an integrated condition of sensor network topology and sensor measurement matrices. The condition is satisfied if the topology is a balanced digraph containing a spanning tree and the system is collectively observable. The collective observability is the possibly mildest condition, since it is a spatially and temporally collective condition of all sensors and allows sensor measurement matrices to be time-varying, stochastic, and nonstationary. Moreover, we provide estimates for the convergence rates, which are related to the step size as well as the triggering threshold. Furthermore, as an essential metric of sensor communication intensity in the event-triggered distributed algorithms, the communication rate is proved to decay to zero with a certain speed almost surely as time goes to infinity. In addition, we show that it is feasible to tune the threshold and the step size such that requirements of algorithm convergence and communication rate decay are satisfied simultaneously. We also show that given the step size, adjusting the decay speed of the triggering threshold can lead to a tradeoff between the convergence rate of the estimation error and the decay speed of the communication rate. Specifically, increasing the decay speed of the threshold would make the communication rate decay faster but reduce the convergence rate of the estimation error. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the developed results.},

In order to guarantee global stability, it suffices to certify localized conditions over a graph covering, where the computational complexity of the verification of the proposed localized certificate is independent of network size. Several robustness conditions against local matrix perturbations are obtained that are useful for tuning network parameters in a decentralized manner while ensuring global exponential stability.},

This paper studies undetectable attacks on cone-invariant systems and multi-agent systems. We first provide a general characterization of zero-dynamics attacks, which characterizes fully undetectable attacks targeting the nonminimum phase zeros of a system. This geometrical characterization makes it possible to develop a defense strategy seeking to place a minimal number of sensors to detect and counter the zero-dynamics attacks on the system&#39;s actuators. The detect and defense scheme amounts to computing a set containing potentially vulnerable actuator locations and nodes and a defense union for feasible placement of sensors based on the geometrical properties of the cones under consideration.},

  abstract     = {We study controlled filter stability and its effects on the robustness properties of optimal control policies designed for systems with incorrect priors applied to a true system. Filter stability refers to the correction of an incorrectly initialized filter for a partially observed stochastic dynamical system (controlled or control-free) with increasing measurements. This problem has been studied extensively in the control-free context, and except for the standard machinery for linear Gaussian systems involving the Kalman filter, few studies exist for the controlled setup. One of the main differences between control-free and controlled partially observed Markov chains is that the filter is always Markovian under the former, whereas under a controlled model the filter process may not be Markovian since the control policy may depend on past measurements in an arbitrary (measurable) fashion. This complicates the dependency structure and therefore results from the control-free literature do not directly apply to the controlled setup. In this paper, we study the filter stability problem for controlled stochastic dynamical systems and provide sufficient conditions for when a falsely initialized filter merges with the correctly initialized filter over time. These stability results are applied to robust stochastic control problems: under filter stability, we bound the difference in the expected cost incurred for implementing an incorrectly designed control policy compared to an optimal policy. A conclusion is that filter stability leads to stronger robustness results to incorrect priors (compared with results in [A. D. Kara and S. Yüksel, SIAM J. Control Optim., 57 (2019), pp. 1929--1964] without controlled filter stability). Furthermore, if the optimum cost is the same for each prior, the cost of mismatch between the true prior and the assumed prior is zero.},

This capability is critical because it enables the analysis of neural network approximation errors for problems for which analytic solutions are not available, such as differential equations and optimal control. A set of key compositional features as well as its relationship with the complexity of neural network approximations are identified. We prove that in the approximation of functions, differential equations and optimal control, the complexity of neural networks is bounded by a polynomial function of the key features and error tolerance.

  abstract     = {Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are ubiquitous in modern control theory, as well as in a variety of other fields in science and engineering. Their analytic centers, i.e. the maximum determinant elements of the feasible set spanned by these LMIs, are the solution of many well-known problems in statistics, communications, geometry, and control and can be approximated to arbitrary precision by semidefinite programs (SDPs). The quality of these approximations is measured with respect to the difference in log-determinant of both the exact and the approximate solutions to these SDPs, a quantity that follows directly from the duality theory of semidefinite programming. However, in many applications the relevant parameters are functions of the entries of the LMI argument $X$. In these cases it is of interest to develop metrics that quantify the quality of approximate solutions based on the error of these parameters, something that the log-determinant error fails to capture due to the nonlinear interaction of all the matrix entries. In this work we develop upper bounds on the Frobenius norm error between suboptimal solutions $X_f$ and the exact optimizer $X_*$ of maximum determinant problems, a metric that provides a direct translation to the entrywise error of $X$ and thus to the relevant parameters of the application. We show that these bounds can be expressed through the use of the Lambert function $W(x)$, i.e., the solution of the equation $W(x) e^{W(x)}= x$, and derive novel bounds for one of its branches to generate efficient closed-form bounds on the Euclidean distance to the LMI analytic center. Finally, we test the quality of these bounds numerically in the context of interior point methods termination criteria.},

For such a simple system, the simplest considered continuous finite-time controller is composed of gained (proportional) exponentially weighted position and velocity error correction terms, with the exponential weights generally less than unity and constrained to satisfy a particular relation among them under homogeneity. What happens for less-than-unity exponential weights that do not satisfy such a homogeneity-based relation? Does the finite-time stabilization hold? Through a Lyapunov function--based study, we analyze and give more concrete answers to such questions than those partially provided by previous studies on the topic. We do find a more exhaustive spectrum of the exponential weights that give rise to finite-time stability of the trivial solution. Other types of stability properties are further found to take place for less-than-or-equal-to-unity exponential weights.

Here we propose and solve a stochastic generalization of such models where the stochastic term, in line with the standard stochastic economic growth models (see, e.g., the books [A. G. Malliaris and W. A. Brock, Stochastic Methods in Economics and Finance, Advanced Textbooks in Economics 17, North Holland, 1982, Chapter 3] and [H. Morimoto, Stochastic Control and Mathematical Modeling: Applications in Economics, Cambridge Books, 2010, Chapter 9]), is a multiplicative one, driven by a cylindrical Wiener process. The problem is studied using the dynamic programming approach. We find an explicit solution of the associated HJB equation, use a verification type result to prove that such a solution is the value function, and find the optimal feedback strategies. Finally, we use this result to study the asymptotic behavior of the optimal trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Particle filters (PFs), which are successful methods for approximating the solution of the filtering problem, can be divided into two types: weighted and unweighted PFs. It is well known that weighted PFs suffer from the weight degeneracy and curse of dimensionality. To sidestep these issues, unweighted PFs have been gaining attention, though they have their own challenges. The existing literature on these types of PFs is based on distinct approaches. In order to establish a connection, we put forward a framework that unifies weighted and unweighted PFs in the continuous-time filtering problem. We show that the stochastic dynamics of a particle system described by a pair process, representing particles and their importance weights, should satisfy two necessary conditions in order for its distribution to match the solution of the Kushner--Stratonovich equation. In particular, we demonstrate that the bootstrap particle filter (BPF), which relies on importance sampling, and the feedback particle filter (FPF), which is an unweighted PF based on optimal control, arise as special cases from a broad class and that there is a smooth transition between the two. The freedom in designing the PF dynamics opens up potential ways to address the existing issues in the aforementioned algorithms, namely weight degeneracy in the BPF and gain estimation in the FPF.},

Player 1 cannot observe $\theta$ or $\Lambda$ directly but can merely observe the path of the process $X$ and may choose a stopping rule $\tau$ to deactivate Player 2 at a cost $M$. Player 1 thus does not know if she is the victim of fraud or not and operates in this sense under unknown competition. Player 2 can observe both $\theta$ and $W$ and seeks to choose a fraud strategy $\Lambda$ that maximizes the expected discounted amount ${\mathbb E} \left [ \left. \int _0^{\tau} e^{-rs} d\Lambda_s \right \vert \theta=1\right ],$ whereas Player 1 seeks to choose the stopping strategy $\tau$ so as to minimize the expected discounted cost ${\mathbb E} \left [\theta \int _0^{\tau} e^{-rs} d\Lambda_s + e^{-r\tau}M\I{\tau&lt;\infty} \right ].$ This non-zero-sum game belongs to a class of stochastic dynamic games with unknown competition and continuous controls and is motivated by applications in fraud detection; it combines filtering (detection), stochastic control, optimal stopping, strategic features (games), and asymmetric information. We derive Nash equilibria for this game; for some parameter values we find an equilibrium in pure strategies, and for other parameter values we find an equilibrium by allowing for randomized stopping strategies.},

We derive optimal transport duality results for these Fréchet classes that extend previous results in the related literature. These proofs are based on representation results for convex increasing functionals and the explicit computation of the conjugates. We show that the dual transport problem admits an explicit solution for the function $f=1_B$, where $B$ is a rectangular subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and provide an intuitive geometric interpretation of this result. The improved Fréchet--Hoeffding bounds provide ad hoc bounds for these Fréchet classes. We show that the improved Fréchet--Hoeffding bounds are pointwise sharp for these classes in the presence of uncertainty in the marginals, while a counterexample yields that they are not pointwise sharp in the absence of uncertainty in the marginals, even in dimension 2. The latter result sheds new light on the improved Fréchet--Hoeffding bounds, since Tankov [J. Appl.

In this work we study probabilities of deviations of true filtering estimates from that obtained by solving the variational problem.

We also consider the American version of the contract, where the agent can also quit by optimally choosing the termination time of the contract. Our main result reduces such nonzero-sum stochastic differential games to appropriate stochastic control problems which may be solved by standard methods of stochastic control theory.

We first introduce an appropriate class of contracts for which the agent&#39;s optimal effort is immediately characterized by the standard verification argument in stochastic control theory. We then show that this class of contracts is dense in an appropriate sense, so that the optimization over this restricted family of contracts represents no loss of generality. The result is obtained by using the recent well-posedness result of random horizon second-order backward SDEs in [Y. Lin, Z. Ren, N. Touzi, and J. Yang, Electron. J. Probab., 25 (2020), 99].},

The gap phenomenon is somewhat “dual&quot; to the problem of the controllability of the original control system to an extended solution. In this paper we present sufficient conditions for the absence of an infimum gap and for controllability for a wide class of optimal control problems subject to endpoint and state constraints. These conditions are based on a nondegenerate version of the nonsmooth constrained maximum principle, expressed in terms of subdifferentials. In particular, under some new constraint qualification conditions, we prove that (i) if an extended minimizer is a nondegenerate normal extremal, then no gap shows up; (ii) given an extended solution verifying the constraints, either it is a nondegenerate abnormal extremal or the original system is controllable to it. An application to the impulsive extension of a free end-time, nonconvex optimization problem with control-polynomial dynamics illustrates the results.},

We consider first-order agents, and we assume that the agents&#39; input is subject to an uncertain constant delay, which may arise due to interagent communication or, additionally, by self-delay in the agent dynamics. We consider dynamic output feedback control protocol in the form of PID control and seek to determine the delay consensus margin (DCM) achievable by PID feedback protocols. The DCM, which generally poses a nonsmooth max-min problem, is a robustness measure that defines the maximal range of delay within which robust consensus can be achieved despite the variation and uncertainty in the delay. We show that the DCM achievable by PID protocols coincides with that by PD protocols and can be computed by solving convex optimization problems. Specifically, unlike with an undirected graph, we show that the DCM with a directed graph can be computed approximately via an iterative algorithm in which each step amounts to solving a quasi-concave optimization problem. The results show how unstable agent dynamics and graph connectivity may fundamentally limit the tolerable range of delay, so that consensus can or cannot be maintained in the presence of delay variations.},

It is further shown that the subsequent triggering instants are based on intermittent communication. Secondly, by using certain input-to-state stability (ISS) property, we design an event-triggered perturbed output regulation controller for each nonlinear multiagent. The ISS technique used in this paper is based on the milder condition that each agent has a certain ISS property from input (actuator) disturbance to state rather than measurement (sensor) disturbance to state. With the two-step design, the objective of output synchronization is successfully achieved with Zeno behavior avoided.},

  abstract     = {A new decentralized event-triggered strategy is proposed to realize consensus of leader-follower multiagent systems under fixed/switching topologies, in which a clock-like variable is designed for each follower agent to determine the event-triggered time. The basic idea of this novel control strategy is to set a positive initial value for each clock-like variable and design its decline rate so that the variable decreases from a preset maximum value to zero. That is, when the value of the clock-like variable is equal to or less than zero, the follower agent corresponding to the clock-like variable will update its feedback control input. Simultaneously, the value of the clock-like variable will be reset to the maximum. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that there exists a strictly positive minimum of interevent time (MIET) for each follower agent; thus the Zeno phenomenon is ruled out. In particular, the positive MIET can be adjusted according to the intrinsic data sampling frequency of the follower agent. It is worth noting that the event-triggered strategy is robust. In other words, if the state of a follower agent is affected by stochastic disturbance or noise, the control strategy can still guarantee that there exists a strictly positive MIET for the follower agent. Therefore, this control strategy is of engineering applicability. Three numerical simulations are provided to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the strategy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the analysis of the stability properties of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for dynamical systems with multiple state delays, focusing on the mathematical characterization of the potential sensitivity of stability with respect to infinitesimal parametric perturbations. These perturbations originate, for instance, from neglecting feedback delay, a finite-difference approximation of the derivative action, or neglecting fast dynamics. It is also shown that adding a low-pass filter, which might be necessary to reduce sensitivity to high-frequency noise, under certain conditions on the derivative feedback gain may destabilize the closed loop even for arbitrarily large cutoff frequencies. The analysis of these potential sensitivity problems leads us to the introduction of a “robustified” notion of stability called strong stability, inspired by the corresponding notion for neutral functional differential equations. We prove that strong stability can be achieved by adding a low-pass filter with a sufficiently large cutoff frequency to the control loop on the condition that the filter itself does not destabilize the nominal closed loop system. Throughout the paper, the theoretical results are illustrated by examples that can be analyzed analytically, including, among others, a third-order unstable system for which both proportional and derivative control action are necessary for achieving stability, while the regions in the gain parameter-space for stability and strong stability are not identical. Besides the analysis of strong stability, a computational procedure is provided for designing strongly stabilizing PID controllers. Computational case studies illustrating this design procedure complete the presentation.},

A Pareto front is obtained in each step by a multiobjective genetic algorithm, and a Pareto optimal point is chosen as the control action applied to the system. This choice is made based on a selection criterion according to the investor profile. Finally, the performance of the MO-MPC facing extreme situations of the financial market is investigated through numerical experiments using data from the Brazilian stock exchange.

First, a preliminary (classical) velocity feedback is applied in order to shift all but a finite number of the eivenvalues of the underlying unbounded operator into the open left half-plane. We then leverage the projection of the system trajectories into an adequate Riesz basis to obtain a truncated model of the system capturing the remaining unstable modes. The controller is computed by applying a classical PI control design scheme to this truncated model. Local stability of the resulting closed-loop infinite-dimensional system is obtained through the study of an adequate Lyapunov function. Finally, an estimate assessing the set point tracking performance of the left Neumann trace is derived.},
