  abstract     = {We provide a general framework for computing mixing times of finite Markov chains whose semigroup&#39;s minimal ideal is left zero. Our analysis is based on combining results by Brown and Diaconis with our previous work on stationary distributions of finite Markov chains. Stationary distributions can be computed from the Karnofsky--Rhodes and McCammond expansion of the right Cayley graph of the finite semigroup underlying the Markov chain. Using loop graphs, which are planar graphs consisting of a straight line with attached loops, there are rational expressions for the stationary distribution in the probabilities. From these we obtain bounds on the mixing time. In addition, we provide a new Markov chain on linear extension of a poset with $n$ vertices, inspired by but different from the promotion Markov chain of Ayyer, Klee, and the last author. The mixing time of this Markov chain is $O(n \log n)$.},

  abstract     = {In the Many-visits Path TSP, we are given a set of $n$ cities along with their pairwise distances (or costs) $c(uv)$, and moreover each city $v$ comes with an associated positive integer request $r(v)$. The goal is to find a minimum-cost path, starting at city $s$ and ending at city $t$, that visits each city $v$ exactly $r(v)$ times. We present a $3/2$-approximation algorithm for the metric Many-visits Path TSP that runs in time polynomial in $n$ and polylogarithmic in the requests $r(v)$. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization of the $3/2$-approximation algorithm for Path TSP by Zenklusen [Proceedings of SODA, 2019, pp. 1539--1549], which answered a long-standing open problem by providing an efficient algorithm which matches the approximation guarantee of Christofides&#39; algorithm from 1976 for metric TSP. One of the key components of our approach is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a connected, degree-bounded multigraph of minimum cost in an undirected graph with edge costs. We tackle this problem by generalizing a fundamental result of Király, Lau, and Singh [Combinatorica, 32 (2012), pp. 705--720] on the Minimum Bounded Degree Matroid Basis problem, and devise such an algorithm for generalized polymatroids, even allowing element multiplicities. Our result directly yields a $3/2$-approximation to the metric Many-visits TSP, as well as a $3/2$-approximation for the problem of scheduling classes of jobs with sequence-dependent setup times on a single machine so as to minimize the makespan.},

  abstract     = {For two graphs $G$ and $H$, write $G \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} H$ if $G$ has the property that every proper coloring of its edges yields a rainbow copy of $H$. We study the thresholds for such so-called anti-Ramsey properties in randomly perturbed dense graphs, which are unions of the form $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p)$, where $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with edge-density at least $d$, and $d$ is a constant that does not depend on $n$. Our results in this paper, combined with our results in a companion paper, determine the threshold for the property $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p) \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} K_s$ for every $s$. In this paper, we show that for $s \geq 9$ the threshold is $n^{-1/m_2(K_{\left\lceil s/2 \right\rceil})}$; in fact, our $1$-statement is a supersaturation result. This turns out to (almost) be the threshold for $s=8$ as well, but for every $4 \leq s \leq 7$, the threshold is lower; see our companion paper for more details. Also in this paper, we determine that the threshold for the property $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p) \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} C_{2\ell - 1}$ is $n^{-2}$ for every $\ell \geq 2$; in particular, the threshold does not depend on the length of the cycle $C_{2\ell - 1}$. For even cycles, and in fact any fixed bipartite graph, no random edges are needed at all; that is, $G \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} H$ always holds, whenever $G$ is as above and $H$ is bipartite.},

This simple-looking notion leads to some generalizations of known results about cycles, offering an interesting paradigm of “replacing average degree by crux.” In particular, we prove that every graph contains a cycle of length linear in its crux. Long proved that every subgraph of a hypercube $Q^m$ (resp., discrete torus $C_3^m$) with average degree $d$ contains a path of length $2^{d/2}$ (resp., $2^{d/4}$) and conjectured that there should be a path of length $2^{d}-1$ (resp., $3^{d/2}-1$). As a corollary of our result, together with isoperimetric inequalities, we close these exponential gaps giving asymptotically optimal bounds on long paths in hypercubes, discrete tori, and more generally Hamming graphs. We also consider random subgraphs of $C_4$-free graphs and hypercubes, proving near optimal lower bounds on the lengths of long cycles.},

This answers a question of Eckhoff [Discrete Comput. Geom., 9 (1993), pp. 203--214], who proved that, under the same condition, there are four lines intersecting all the sets. In fact, we prove a colorful version of this result under weakened conditions on the sets. Three sets $A,B,C$ form a tight triple if $\textrm{conv}(A\cup B)\cap \textrm{conv}(A\cup C)\cap \textrm{conv}(B\cap C)\neq \emptyset.$ This notion was first introduced by Holmsen, who showed that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of compact convex sets in the plane in which every three sets form a tight triple, then there is a line intersecting at least $\frac{1}{8}|\mathcal{F}|$ members of $\mathcal{F}$. Here we prove that if $\mathcal{F}_1,\dots,\mathcal{F}_6$ are families of compact connected sets in the plane such that every three sets, chosen from three distinct families $\mathcal{F}_i$, form a tight triple, then there exists $1\le j\le 6$ and three lines intersecting every member of $\mathcal{F}_j$. In particular, this improves $\frac{1}{8}$ to $\frac{1}{3}$ in Holmsen&#39;s result.},

For one of the most basic cases, the relaxation based on knapsack-cover inequalities has an integrality gap of 2. We generalize the setting considering items that can be taken fractionally to cover a given demand, with a cost given by an arbitrary nondecreasing function (not necessarily convex) of the chosen fraction. We generalize the knapsack-cover inequalities and use them to obtain a polynomial $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm. Our primal-dual procedure has a natural interpretation as a water-filling algorithm, which overcomes the difficulties implied by having different growth rates in the cost functions: when the cost of an item increases slowly at some superior segment, it carefully increases the priority of all preceding segments. We generalize our algorithm to the Unsplittable Flow-Cover problem on a line, also for fractional items with non-linear costs. We obtain a $4$-approximation in pseudopolynomial time ($4+\varepsilon$ in polynomial time), matching the approximation ratio of the classical setting. We also present a rounding algorithm with an approximation guarantee of 2. This result is coupled with a polynomial time separation algorithm that allows solving our linear relaxation up to a loss of a $(1+\varepsilon)$ factor.},

  abstract     = {A classical branch of graph algorithms is graph transversals, where one seeks a minimum-weight subset of nodes in a node-weighted graph $G$ which intersects all copies of subgraphs $F$ from a fixed family $\mathcal F$. Many such graph transversal problems have been shown to admit polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTASs) for planar input graphs $G$, using a variety of techniques like the shifting technique [B. S. Baker, J. ACM, 41 (1994), pp. 153--180], bidimensionality [F. V. Fomin et al., Bidimensionality and EPTAS, in Proceedings of SODA 2011, ACM, New York, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2011, pp. 748--759], or connectivity domination [V. Cohen-Addad et al., Approximating connectivity domination in weighted bounded-genus graphs, in Proceedings of STOC 2016, ACM, New York, 2016, pp. 584--597]. These techniques do not seem to apply to graph transversals with parity constraints, which have recently received significant attention, but for which no PTASs are known. In the Even Cycle Transversal (ECT) problem, the goal is to find a minimum-weight hitting set for the set of even cycles in an undirected graph. For ECT, Fiorini, Joret, and Pietropaoli [Hitting diamonds and growing cacti, in Proceedings of IPCO 2010, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 6080, Springer, Berlin, 2010, pp. 191--204] showed that the integrality gap of the standard covering LP relaxation is $\Theta(\log n)$, and that adding sparsity inequalities reduces the integrality gap to 10. Our main result is a primal-dual algorithm that yields a $47/7\approx6.71$-approximation for ECT on node-weighted planar graphs, and an integrality gap upper bound of the same value for the standard LP relaxation on node-weighted planar graphs.},

  abstract     = {We study the kernelization complexity of structural parameterizations of the Vertex Cover problem. Here, the goal is to find a polynomial-time preprocessing algorithm that can reduce any instance $(G,k)$ of the Vertex Cover problem to an equivalent one, whose size is polynomial in the size of a predetermined complexity parameter of $G$. A long line of previous research deals with parameterizations based on the number of vertex deletions needed to reduce $G$ to a member of a simple graph class $\mathcal{F}$, such as forests, graphs of bounded tree-depth, and graphs of maximum degree two. We set out to find the most general graph classes $\mathcal{F}$ for which Vertex Cover parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance of the input graph to $\mathcal{F}$ admits a polynomial kernelization. We give a complete characterization of the minor-closed graph families $\mathcal{F}$ for which such a kernelization exists. We introduce a new graph parameter called bridge-depth, and prove that a polynomial kernelization exists if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ has bounded bridge-depth. The proof is based on an interesting connection between bridge-depth and the size of minimal blocking sets in graphs, which are vertex sets whose removal decreases the independence number.},

In this paper, we provide the first algorithmic applications of tree-cut width to hard combinatorial problems. Tree-cut width is known to be lower-bounded by a function of treewidth, but it can be much larger and hence has the potential to facilitate the efficient solution of problems that are not known to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by treewidth. We introduce the notion of nice tree-cut decompositions and provide FPT algorithms for the showcase problems Capacitated Vertex Cover, Capacitated Dominating Set, and Imbalance parameterized by the tree-cut width of an input graph. On the other hand, we show that List Coloring, Precoloring Extension, and Boolean CSP (the last parameterized by the tree-cut width of the incidence graph) are W[1]-hard and hence unlikely to be FPT when parameterized by tree-cut width.},

  abstract     = {An identifying code $C$ of a graph $G$ is a dominating set of $G$ such that any two distinct vertices of $G$ have distinct closed neighborhoods within $C$. These codes have been widely studied for over two decades. We give an improvement over all the best known upper bounds, some of which have stood for over 20 years, for identifying codes in trees, proving the upper bound of $(n+\ell)/2$, where $n$ is the order and $\ell$ is the number of leaves (pendant vertices) of the graph. In addition to being an improvement in size, the new upper bound is also an improvement in generality, as it actually holds for bipartite graphs having no twins (pairs of vertices with the same closed or open neighborhood) of degree 2 or greater. We also show that the bound is tight for an infinite class of graphs and that there are several structurally different families of trees attaining the bound. We then use our bound to derive a tight upper bound of $2n/3$ for twin-free bipartite graphs of order $n$ and characterize the extremal examples as 2-corona graphs of bipartite graphs. This is the best possible, as there exist twin-free graphs, and trees with twins, that need $n-1$ vertices in any of their identifying codes. We also generalize the existing upper bound of $5n/7$ for graphs of order $n$ and girth at least 5 when there are no leaves to the upper bound $\frac{5n+2\ell}{7}$ when leaves are allowed. This is tight for the 7-cycle $C_7$ and for all stars.},

In this paper, we show that any 1-planar graph with minimum degree 6 and $n \geq 36$ vertices has a matching of size at least $\frac{3n+4}{7}$, and this lower bound is tight.

The first is budgeted uncertainty (the $U^\Gamma$ model), in which at most $\Gamma$ items deviate, each reaching its peak value, while other items assume their nominal values. The second uncertainty set, the $U^\Omega$ model, bounds the total amount of deviation in each scenario. We show that a variant of the Next-cover algorithm is a $2$ approximation for the $U^\Omega$ model, and another variant of this algorithm is a $2\Gamma$ approximation for the $U^\Gamma$ model. Unlike the classical bin packing problem, it is shown that (unless $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{NP}$) no asymptotic approximation scheme exists for the $U^\Gamma$ model, for $\Gamma=1$. This motivates the question of the existence of a constant approximation factor algorithm for the $U^\Gamma$ model. Our main result is to answer this question by proving a (polynomial-time) $4.5$ approximation algorithm, based on a dynamic-programming approach.},

We provide a min-max theorem and a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem for several types of rigidity, such as rigidity in the plane or on the cylinder. Rigidity is often characterized by some sparsity properties of the underlying graph, and global rigidity is characterized by redundant rigidity (where the graph remains rigid after deleting an arbitrary edge) and 2- or 3-vertex-connectivity. Hence, to solve the above-mentioned problem, we define and solve polynomially a combinatorial optimization problem family based on these sparsity and connectivity properties. This family also includes the problem of augmenting a $k$-tree-connected graph to a highly $k$-tree-connected and 2-connected graph. Moreover, as an interesting consequence, we give an optimal solution to the so-called global rigidity pinning problem, where we aim to find a minimum cardinality vertex set $X$ for a rigid graph $G=(V,E)$, such that the graph $G+K_X$ is globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^2$ where $K_X$ denotes the complete graph on the vertex set $X$.},

  abstract     = {We prove new complexity results for Feedback Vertex Set and Even Cycle Transversal on $H$-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. In particular, we prove that for every $s\geq 1$, both problems are polynomial-time solvable for $sP_3$-free graphs and $(sP_1+P_5)$-free graphs; here, the graph $sP_3$ denotes the disjoint union of $s$ paths on three vertices and the graph $sP_1+P_5$ denotes the disjoint union of $s$ isolated vertices and a path on five vertices. Our new results for Feedback Vertex Set extend all known polynomial-time results for Feedback Vertex Set on $H$-free graphs, namely for $sP_2$-free graphs [Chiarelli et al., Theoret. Comput. Sci., 705 (2018), pp. 75--83], $(sP_1+P_3)$-free graphs [Dabrowski et al., Algorithmica, 82 (2020), pp. 2841--2866] and $P_5$-free graphs [Abrishami et al., Induced subgraphs of bounded treewidth and the container method, in Proceedings of the 2021 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), SIAM, Philadelphia, 2021, pp. 1948--1964]. Together, the new results also show that both problems exhibit the same behavior on $H$-free graphs (subject to some open cases). This is in part due to a new general algorithm we design for finding in a ($sP_3)$-free or $(sP_1+P_5)$-free graph $G$ a largest induced subgraph whose blocks belong to some finite class ${\cal C}$ of graphs. We also compare our results with the state-of-the-art results for the Odd Cycle Transversal problem, which is known to behave differently on $H$-free graphs.},

  abstract     = {Lightness and sparsity are two natural parameters for Euclidean $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners. Classical results show that, when the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ are constant, every set $S$ of $n$ points in $d$-space admits a $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner with $O(n)$ edges and weight proportional to that of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of $S$. In a recent breakthrough, Le and Solomon [Proceedings of FOCS, 2019, pp. 1078--1100] established the precise dependencies on $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for constant $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the minimum lightness and sparsity of $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners, and observed that Steiner points can substantially improve the lightness and sparsity of a $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner. They gave upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-(d+1)/2})$ for the minimum lightness in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ for the minimum sparsity in $d$-space for all $d\geq 1$. Subsequently, Le and Solomon [LIPIcs Leibniz Int. Proc. Inform. 173, Schloss Dagstuhl, Wadern, 2020, pp. 67:1--67:22] constructed Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners of lightness $O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log\Delta)$ in the plane, where $\Delta\in \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ is the spread of $S$, defined as the ratio between the maximum and the minimum distance between a pair of points. In this work, we improve several bounds on the lightness and sparsity of Euclidean Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners. We establish lower bounds of $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-d/2})$ for the lightness and $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ for the sparsity of such spanners in Euclidean $d$-space for all constant $d\geq 2$. Our lower bound constructions generalize previous constructions by Le and Solomon, but the analysis substantially simplifies previous work, using new geometric insight, focusing on the directions of edges. Next, we show that for every finite set of points in the plane and every $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$, there exists a Euclidean Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner of lightness $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$; this matches the lower bound for $d=2$. We generalize the notion of shallow light trees, which may be of independent interest, and use directional spanners and a modified window partitioning scheme to achieve a tight weight analysis.},

  abstract     = {In the random subgraph model we consider random subgraphs $G(t)$ of a graph $G$ obtained as follows: for each edge in $G$ we independently decide to retain the edge with probability $t$ and discard the edge with probability $1-t$ for some $0\leq t\leq 1$. A special case of this model is the Erdös--Rényi random graph model, where the host graph is the complete graph $K_n$. In this paper we analyze the rigidity properties of random subgraphs and give new upper bounds on the threshold $t_0$ for which $G(t)$ is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) rigid or globally rigid when $t\geq t_0$. By specializing our results to complete host graphs we obtain, among others, that an Erdös--Rényi random graph is a.a.s. globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if $t\geq \frac{C_d\log n}{n}$ for some constant $C_d$. We also consider random subframeworks of (bar-and-joint) frameworks, which are geometric realizations of our graphs. Our bounds for the rigidity threshold of random subgraphs are in terms of the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the stiffness matrix of the framework, which is the Gramian of its normalized rigidity matrix. Motivated by this connection, we introduce the concept of $d$-dimensional algebraic connectivity of graphs and provide upper and lower bounds for this value of several fundamental graph classes. The case $d=1$ corresponds to the well-known algebraic connectivity, that is, the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue of the graph. We also consider the rigidity threshold in random molecular graphs, also called bond-bending networks, which are used in the study of rigidity properties of molecules. In this model we are concerned with the rigidity of the square graph of some graph $G$. We give an upper bound for the rigidity threshold of the square of random subgraphs in terms of the algebraic connectivity of the host graph. This enables us to derive an upper bound for the rigidity threshold for sparse host graphs.},

  abstract     = {The hard-sphere model is one of the most extensively studied models in statistical physics. It describes the continuous distribution of spherical particles, governed by hard-core interactions. An important quantity of this model is the normalizing factor of this distribution, called the partition function. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating the grand canonical partition function of the hard-sphere model in $d$ dimensions. Up to a fugacity of $\lambda &lt; e/2^d$, the runtime of our algorithm is polynomial in the volume of the system. Key to our approach is to define a discretization that closely approximates the partition function of the continuous model. This results in a discrete hard-core instance that is exponential in the size of the initial hard-sphere model. Our approximation bound follows directly from the correlation decay threshold of an infinite regular tree with degree equal to the maximum degree of our discretization. To cope with the exponential blow-up of the discrete instance, we use block dynamics, a Markov chain that generalizes the more frequently studied Glauber dynamics by grouping the vertices of the graph into blocks and updating an entire block instead of a single vertex in each step. We prove rapid mixing of block dynamics, based on disjoint cliques as blocks, up to the tree threshold of the univariate hard-core model. This is achieved by adapting the spectral expansion method, which was recently used for bounding the mixing time of Glauber dynamics within the same parameter regime.},

  abstract     = {We study the 3-Coloring problem in graphs with small diameter. In 2013, Mertzios and Spirakis showed that for $n$-vertex diameter-2 graphs this problem can be solved in subexponential time $2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n \log n})}$. Whether the problem can be solved in polynomial time remains a well-known open question in the area of algorithmic graph theory. In this paper we present an algorithm that solves 3-Coloring in $n$-vertex diameter-2 graphs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3} \log^{2} n)}$. This is the first improvement upon the algorithm of Mertzios and Spirakis in the general case, i.e., without putting any further restrictions on the instance graph. In addition to standard branchings and reducing the problem to an instance of 2-Sat, the crucial building block of our algorithm is a combinatorial observation about 3-colorable diameter-2 graphs, which is proven using a probabilistic argument. As a side result, we show that 3-Coloring can be solved in time $2^{\mathcal{O}( (n \log n)^{2/3})}$ in $n$-vertex diameter-3 graphs. This is the first algorithm for 3-Coloring which works in subexponential time for all diameter-3 graphs. We also discuss generalizations of our results to the weighted variant of 3-Coloring.},

Following recent trends in both statistical physics and algorithmic research, we allow the edge interaction $\beta$ to be any complex number. Many recent partition function results focus on complex parameters, both because of physical relevance and because of the key role of the complex case in delineating the tractability/intractability phase transition of the approximation problem. In this work we establish both new tractability results and new intractability results. Our tractability results show that $Z_{\mathrm{Ising}}(-; \beta)$ has an FPTAS when $\lvert \beta - 1 \rvert / \lvert \beta + 1 \rvert 1 / \sqrt{\Delta - 1}$. These are the first results to show intractability of approximating $Z_{\mathrm{Ising}}(-, \beta)$ on bounded degree graphs with complex $\beta$. Moreover, we demonstrate situations in which zeros of the partition function imply hardness of approximation in the Ising model.},

  abstract     = {Spanning trees are a representative example of linear matroid bases that are efficiently countable. Perfect matchings of Pfaffian bipartite graphs are a countable example of common bases of two matrices. Generalizing these two, Webb Counting Bases, Ph.D. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2004 introduced the notion of Pfaffian pairs as a pair of matrices for which counting of their common bases is tractable via the Cauchy--Binet formula. This paper studies counting on linear matroid problems extending Webb&#39;s work. We first introduce “Pfaffian parities” as an extension of Pfaffian pairs to the linear matroid parity problem, which is a common generalization of the linear matroid intersection problem and the matching problem. We show that a large number of efficiently countable discrete structures are interpretable as special cases of Pfaffian pairs and parities. Our study then turns to algorithmic aspects. We observe that the fastest randomized algorithms for the linear matroid intersection and parity problems by Harvey SIAM J. Comput., 39 (2009), pp. 679--702 and Cheung, Lau, and Leung ACM Trans. Algorithms, 10 (2014), pp. 1--26 can be derandomized for Pfaffian pairs and parities. We further present polynomial-time algorithms to count the number of minimum-weight solutions on weighted Pfaffian pairs and parities. Our algorithms make use of Frank&#39;s weight-splitting lemma for the weighted matroid intersection problem and the algebraic optimality criterion of the weighted linear matroid parity problem given by Iwata and Kobayashi SIAM J.

It is known that planar graphs with $n$ vertices admit a labeling scheme with labels of bit length $(2+o(1))\log{n}$. In this work we improve this bound by designing a labeling scheme with labels of bit length $(\frac{4}{3}+o(1))\log{n}$. All the labels of the input graph can be computed in polynomial time, while adjacency can be decided from the labels in constant time. In graph-theoretical terms, this implies an explicit construction of a graph on $n^{4/3+o(1)}$ vertices that contains all planar graphs on $n$ vertices as induced subgraphs, improving the previous best upper bound of $n^{2+o(1)}$. Our labeling scheme can be generalized to larger classes of topologically constrained graphs, for instance, to graphs embeddable in any fixed surface or to $k$-planar graphs for any fixed $k$, at the cost of larger second-order terms.},

  abstract     = {For integers $k$ and $d$ with $k\ge 2d&gt;0$, a circular ${k}/{d}$-flow of a graph $G$ is an orientation together with a mapping from $E(G)$ to ${\pm d, \pm (d+1),\ldots,\pm (k-d)}$ such that, for each vertex of $G$, the sum of images on outgoing edges is equal to the sum of images on incoming edges. Related to the four color problem, a classical result of Tutte shows that a cubic graph admits a circular $4/1$-flow if and only if it is Class I (i.e., $3$-edge-colorable). Tutte&#39;s $3$-flow conjecture implies that every $5$-regular Class I graph admits a nowhere-zero $3$-flow (equivalently, a circular $6/2$-flow) as a special case. Steffen in 2015 conjectured that every $(2t+1)$-regular Class I graph admits a circular $(2t+2)/t$-flow. He also proposed a more general conjecture that every $(2t+1)$-odd-edge-connected $(2t+1)$-regular graph admits a circular $(2t+2)/t$-flow for any integer $t\ge 2$, which includes the circular flow conjecture of Jaeger (1981) stating that every $2t$-edge-connected graph admits a circular $(2t+2)/t$-flow for any even $t\ge 2$. Jaeger&#39;s conjecture was disproved in 2018 for all even $t\ge 6$, and based on these results, Mattiolo and Steffen recently constructed counterexamples to Steffen&#39;s conjecture for Class I graphs when $t=4k+2$ for any integer $k\ge 1$. In this paper, we extend the above results and construct infinitely many $2t$-edge-connected $(2t+1)$-regular Class I graphs without circular $(2t+2)/t$-flows for any integer $t\in {6,8,10}$ or $t\geq 12$. Our result provides more general counterexamples to Steffen&#39;s two conjectures for both even and odd $t$ and simultaneously generalizes the counterexamples of Jaeger&#39;s circular flow conjecture to regular Class I graphs.},

  abstract     = {The Vertex Cover problem plays an essential role in the study of polynomial kernelization in parameterized complexity, i.e., the study of provable and efficient preprocessing for ${\mathsf{NP}}$-hard problems. Motivated by the great variety of positive and negative results for kernelization for Vertex Cover subject to different parameters and graph classes, we seek to unify and generalize them using so-called blocking sets. A blocking set is a set of vertices such that no optimal vertex cover contains all vertices in the blocking set, and the study of minimal blocking sets played implicit and explicit roles in many existing results. We show that in the most-studied setting, parameterized by the size of a deletion set to a specified graph class ${\mathcal{C}}$, bounded minimal blocking set size is necessary but not sufficient to get a polynomial kernelization. Under mild technical assumptions, bounded minimal blocking set size is shown to allow an essentially tight polynomial-time reduction in the number of connected components. We then determine the exact maximum size of minimal blocking sets for graphs of bounded elimination distance to any hereditary class $\mathcal{C}$, including the case of graphs of bounded treedepth. We get similar but not tight bounds for certain nonhereditary classes $\mathcal{C}$, including the class ${\mathcal{C}}_{{\mathrm{LP}}}$ of graphs where integral and fractional vertex cover size coincide. These bounds allow us to derive polynomial kernels for Vertex Cover parameterized by the size of a deletion set to graphs of bounded elimination distance to, e.g., forest, bipartite, or ${\mathcal{C}}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ graphs.},

This leads to a bound on the lattice width of lattice-free pyramids which solely depends on $\Delta({A})$ provided a conjecture regarding the height of Hilbert bases holds. Further, we exploit a combination of techniques to obtain novel bounds on the lattice width of simplices. A second part of the paper is devoted to a study of the above-mentioned Hilbert basis conjecture. We give a complete characterization of the Hilbert basis if $\Delta({A}) = 2$ which implies the conjecture in that case and prove its validity for simplicial cones.},

  abstract     = {The grid theorem of Robertson and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 41 (1986), pp. 92--114] is one of the most important tools in the field of structural graph theory, finding numerous applications in the design of algorithms for undirected graphs. An analogous version of the grid theorem in digraphs was conjectured by Johnson et al. [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 82 (2001), pp. 138--154] and proved by Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer [Proceedings of STOC, 2015, pp. 655--664]. Namely, they showed that there is a function $f(k)$ such that every digraph of directed tree-width at least $f(k)$ contains a cylindrical grid of order $k$ as a butterfly minor, and stated that their proof can be turned into an \sf XP algorithm, with parameter $k$, that either constructs a decomposition of the appropriate width or finds the claimed large cylindrical grid as a butterfly minor. In this paper, we adapt some of the steps of the proof of Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer to improve this \sf XP algorithm into a fixed-parameter tractable (\sf FPT) algorithm. Toward this, our main technical contributions are two \sf FPT algorithms with parameter $k$. The first one either produces an arboreal decomposition of width $3k-2$ or finds a haven of order $k$ in a digraph $D$, improving on the original result for arboreal decompositions by Johnson et al. [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 82 (2001), pp. 138--154]. The second algorithm finds a well-linked set of order $k$ in a digraph $D$ of large directed tree-width. As tools to prove these results, we show how to solve a generalized version of the problem of finding balanced separators for a given set of vertices $T$ in \sf FPT time with parameter $|T|$, a result that we consider to be of its own interest.},

Using them and a previous result of the author, we provide two new explicit families of linear partial maximum distance separable (PMDS) codes with smaller field sizes than previous PMDS codes for some parameter regimes. Our approach is to characterize evaluation points that turn extended Moore matrices into the parity-check matrix of a linear MSRD code. We then produce such sequences from codes with good Hamming-metric parameters. The six new families of linear MSRD codes with smaller field sizes are obtained using MDS codes, Hamming codes, Bose--Chaudhuri--Hocquenghem codes, and three algebraic-geometry codes. The MSRD codes based on Hamming codes, of minimum sum-rank distance 3, meet a recent bound by Byrne, Gluesing-Luerssen, and Ravagnani [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 67 (2021), pp. 6456--6475].},

This proves polynomial time solvability of the ideal membership problem (IMP) with restrictions on degree $d=O(1)$, which we call IMP$_d$, for these constrained problems.

  abstract     = {Structural graph parameters, such as treewidth, pathwidth, and clique-width, are a central topic of study in parameterized complexity. A main aim of research in this area is to understand the “price of generality” of these widths: as we transition from more restrictive to more general notions, which are the problems that see their complexity status deteriorate from fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) to intractable? This type of question is by now very well studied, but somewhat strikingly, the algorithmic frontier between the two (arguably) most central width notions, treewidth and pathwidth, is still not understood: currently, no natural graph problem is known to be W-hard for one but FPT for the other. Indeed, a surprising development of the last few years has been the observation that, for many of the most paradigmatic problems, their complexities for the two parameters actually coincide exactly, despite the fact that treewidth is a much more general parameter. It would thus appear that the extra generality of treewidth over pathwidth often comes “for free.” Our main contribution in this paper is to uncover the first natural example where this generality comes with a high price. We consider Grundy Coloring, a variation of coloring where one seeks to calculate the worst possible coloring that could be assigned to a graph by a greedy first-fit algorithm. We show that this well-studied problem is FPT parameterized by pathwidth; however, it becomes significantly harder (W[1]-hard) when parameterized by treewidth. Furthermore, we show that Grundy Coloring makes a second complexity jump for more general widths, as it becomes para-NP--hard for clique-width. Hence, Grundy Coloring nicely captures the complexity trade-offs between the three most well-studied parameters. Completing the picture, we show that Grundy Coloring is FPT parameterized by modular-width.},

The natural linear program (LP) for $\ensuremath{{2ECM}}$, which coincides with the subtour LP for the traveling salesman problem on the metric closure of $\overline{G}$, gives a lower bound on the optimal cost. For instances where this LP is optimized by a half-integral solution $x$, Carr and Ravi (1998) showed that the integrality gap is at most $\frac43$: they show that the vector $\frac43 x$ dominates a convex combination of incidence vectors of 2-edge connected spanning multisubgraphs of $\overline{G}$. We present a simpler proof of the result due to Carr and Ravi by applying an extension of Lovász&#39;s splitting-off theorem. Our proof naturally leads to a $\frac43$-approximation algorithm for half-integral instances. Given a half-integral solution $x$ to the LP for $\ensuremath{{2ECM}}$, we give an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm to obtain a 2-edge connected spanning multisubgraph of $\overline{G}$ with cost at most $\frac43 c^T x$. We also consider a related problem of finding a cheap 2-edge connected spanning subgraph of a 3-regular, 3-edge connected graph $G = (V,E)$ with arbitrary edge costs $c$. We give a polynomial-time Las Vegas algorithm that finds a random 2-edge connected spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ whose expected cost, $\mathbb{E}\left[{c(H)}\right]$, is at most $\frac45 c(E)$.},

  abstract     = {The Lovász Local Lemma is a powerful probabilistic technique for proving the existence of combinatorial objects. It is especially useful for coloring graphs and hypergraphs with bounded maximum degree. This paper presents a general theorem for coloring hypergraphs that in many instances matches or slightly improves upon the bounds obtained using the Lovász Local Lemma. Moreover, the theorem directly shows that there are exponentially many colorings. The elementary and self-contained proof is inspired by a recent result for nonrepetitive colorings by Rosenfeld [Electron. J. Combin., 27 (2020), P3.43]. We apply our general theorem in the settings of proper hypergraph coloring, proper graph coloring, independent transversals, star coloring, nonrepetitive coloring, frugal coloring, Ramsey number lower bounds, and $k$-SAT.},

In this paper we introduce a new poset of RNA diagrams ${\mathcal B}^r_{f,k}$, $r\ge 0$, $k \ge 1$, and $f \ge 3$, which we call the Penner--Waterman poset, and, using results from the theory of multitriangulations, we show that this is a pure poset of rank $k(2f-2k+1)+r-f-1$, whose geometric realization is the join of a simplicial sphere of dimension $k(f-2k)-1$ and an $\left((f+1)(k-1)-1\right)$-simplex in case $r=0$. As a corollary for the special case $k=1$, we obtain a result due to Penner and Waterman concerning the topology of the space of RNA secondary structures.

  abstract     = {Gomory--Hu (GH) trees are a classical sparsification technique for graph connectivity. For an edge-capacitated undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and subset $Z \subseteq V$ of terminals, a GH tree is an edge-capacitated tree $T=(Z,E(T))$ such that for every $u,v \in Z$, the value of the minimum capacity $uv$ cut in $G$ is the same as in $T$. It is well-known that there does not always exist a GH tree which is a subgraph (or minor if $Z \neq V$) of $G$. We characterize those graph-terminal pairs $(G,Z)$ which always admit such a tree. We show that these are the graphs which have no terminal-$K_{2,3}$ minor, that is, a $K_{2,3}$ minor whose nodes each corresponds to a terminal. We then show that the pairs $(G,Z)$ which forbid such $K_{2,3}$ terminal-minors arise, roughly speaking, from so-called Okamura--Seymour instances, planar graphs whose outside face contains all terminals. One consequence is a result on cut-sufficient pairs $(G,H)$, that is, multiflow instances where the cut condition is sufficient to guarantee a multiflow for any capacity/demand weights on $G/H$. Our results characterize the pairs $(G,Z)$ where $G$ is a graph, $Z \subseteq V(G)$, such that $(G,H)$ is cut-sufficient for any demand graph $H$ on $Z$.},

In this paper, we investigate necessary and/or sufficient conditions for a map to be antipodally self-dual. In particular, we present a combinatorial characterization for map $G$ to be antipodally self-dual in terms of certain involutive labelings. The latter lead us to obtain necessary conditions for a map to be strongly involutive (a notion relevant for its connection with convex geometric problems). We also investigate the relation of antipodally self-dual maps and the notion of antipodally symmetric maps. It turns out that the latter is a very helpful tool to study questions concerning the symmetry as well as the amphicheirality of links.},

  abstract     = {Given metric spaces $(X,d)$ and $(Y,\rho)$ and an ordering $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ of $(X,d)$, an embedding $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to have a prioritized distortion $\alpha(\cdot)$, for a function $\alpha(\cdot)$, if for any pair $x_j,x&#39;$ of distinct points in $X$, the distortion provided by $f$ for this pair is at most $\alpha(j)$. If $Y$ is a normed space, the embedding is said to have prioritized dimension $\beta(\cdot)$ if $f(x_j)$ may have at most $\beta(j)$ nonzero coordinates. The notion of prioritized embedding was introduced by Filtser and the current authors in [M. Elkin, A. Filtser, and O. Neiman, SIAM J. Comput., 47 (2018), pp. 829--858], where a rather general methodology for constructing such embeddings was developed. Though this methodology enabled [M. Elkin, A. Filtser, and O. Neiman, SIAM J. Comput., 47 (2018), pp. 829--858] to come up with many prioritized embeddings, it typically incurs some loss in the distortion. In other words, in the worst case, prioritized embeddings obtained via this methodology incur distortion which is at least a constant factor off compared to the distortion of the classical counterparts of these embeddings. This constant loss is problematic for isometric embeddings. It is also troublesome for Matoušek&#39;s embedding of general metrics into $\ell_\infty$, which, for a parameter $k = 1,2,\ldots$, provides distortion $2k-1$ and dimension $O(k \log n \cdot n^{1/k})$. All logarithms in this paper are base 2. In this paper we devise two lossless prioritized embeddings. The first one is an isometric prioritized embedding of tree metrics into $\ell_\infty$ with dimension $O(\log j)$, matching the worst-case guarantee of $O(\log n)$ of the classical embedding of [N. Linial, E. London, and Y. Rabinovich, Combinatorica, 15 (1995), pp. 215--245]. The second one is a prioritized Matoušek embedding of general metrics into $\ell_\infty$, which, for a parameter $k=1,2,\ldots$, provides prioritized distortion $2 \lceil k {{\log j} \over {\log n}} \rceil - 1$ and dimension $O(k \log n \cdot n^{1/k})$, again matching the worst-case guarantee $2k-1$ in the distortion of the classical Matoušek embedding. We also provide a dimension-prioritized variant of Matoušek&#39;s embedding. Finally, we devise prioritized embeddings of general metrics into a single ultrametric and of general graphs into a single spanning tree, with asymptotically optimal distortion.},

  abstract     = {Given any graph $H$, a graph $G$ is said to be $q$-Ramsey for $H$ if every coloring of the edges of $G$ with $q$ colors yields a monochromatic subgraph isomorphic to $H$. Such a graph $G$ is said to be minimal $q$-Ramsey for $H$ if additionally no proper subgraph $G&#39;$ of $G$ is $q$-Ramsey for $H$. In 1976, Burr, Erdös, and Lovász initiated the study of the parameter $s_q(H)$, defined as the smallest minimum degree among all minimal $q$-Ramsey graphs for $H$. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining how many vertices of degree $s_q(H)$ a minimal $q$-Ramsey graph for $H$ can contain. Specifically, we seek to identify graphs for which a minimal $q$-Ramsey graph can contain arbitrarily many such vertices. We call a graph satisfying this property $s_q$-abundant. Among other results, we prove that every cycle is $s_q$-abundant for any integer $q\geq 2$. We also discuss the cases when $H$ is a clique or a clique with a pendant edge, extending previous results of Burr and co-authors and Fox and co-authors. To prove our results and construct suitable minimal Ramsey graphs, we use gadget graphs, which we call pattern gadgets and which generalize earlier constructions used in the study of minimal Ramsey graphs. We provide a new, more constructive proof of the existence of these gadgets.},

Later, Hakimi, Schmeichel, and Thomassen in 1979 conjectured that every such triangulation on $n$ vertices has at least $2(n - 2)(n - 4)$ hamiltonian cycles. Along this direction, Brinkmann, Souffriau, and Van Cleemput in 2018 established a linear lower bound on the number of hamiltonian cycles in 4-connected planar triangulations. In stark contrast, Alahmadi, Aldred, and Thomassen in 2020 showed that every 5-connected triangulation of the plane or the projective plane has exponentially many hamiltonian cycles. This gives the motivation to study the number of hamiltonian cycles of 4-connected triangulations with few 4-separators. Recently, Liu and Yu in 2021 showed that every 4-connected planar triangulation with $O(n / \log n)$ 4-separators has a quadratic number of hamiltonian cycles. By adapting the framework of Alahmadi, Aldred, and Thomassen, we strengthen the last two aforementioned results. We prove that every 4-connected planar or projective planar triangulation with $O(n)$ 4-separators has exponentially many hamiltonian cycles.},

  abstract     = {We consider an online assortment problem with $[n]={1,2,\ldots,n}$ sellers, each holding exactly one item $i\in[n]$ with initial inventory $c_i\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, and a sequence of homogeneous buyers arriving over a finite time horizon $t=1,2,\ldots,m$. There is an online platform whose goal is to offer a subset $S_t\subseteq [n]$ of sellers to the arriving buyer at time $t$ to maximize the expected revenue derived over the entire horizon while respecting the inventory constraints. Given an assortment $S_t$ at time $t$, it is assumed that the buyer will select an item from $S_t$ based on the well-known multinomial logit model, a well-justified choice model from the economic literature. In this model, the revenue obtained from selling an item $i$ at a given time $t$ critically depends on the assortment $S_t$ offered at that time and is given by the Nash equilibrium of a Bertrand game among the sellers in $S_t$. This imposes a strong dependence/externality among the offered assortments, sellers&#39; revenues, and inventory levels. Despite that challenge, we devise a constant competitive algorithm for the online assortment problem with homogeneous buyers. It answers a question in [Z. Zheng and R. Srikant, Optimal Search Segmentation Mechanisms for Online Platform Markets, preprint, arXiv:1908.07489, 2019] that considered the static version of the assortment problem with only one buyer and no inventory constraints. We also show that the online assortment problem with heterogeneous buyers does not admit a constant competitive algorithm. To compensate that issue, we then consider the assortment problem under an offline setting with heterogeneous buyers. Under a mild market consistency assumption, we show that the generalized Bertrand game admits a pure Nash equilibrium over general buyer-seller bipartite graphs. Finally, we develop an $O(\ln m)$-approximation algorithm for optimal market segmentation of the generalized Bertrand game which allows the platform to derive higher revenues by partitioning the market into smaller pools.},

  abstract     = {Let $\Lambda(T)$ denote the set of leaves in a tree $T$. One natural problem is to look for a spanning tree $T$ of a given graph $G$ such that $\Lambda(T)$ is as large as possible. This problem is called maximum leaf number, and it is a well-known NP-hard problem. Equivalently, the same problem can be formulated as the minimum connected dominating set problem, where the task is to find a smallest subset of vertices $D\subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex of $G$ is in the closed neighborhood of $D$. Throughout recent decades, these two equivalent problems have received considerable attention, ranging from pure graph theoretic questions to practical problems related to the construction of wireless networks. Recently, a similar but stronger notion was defined by Bradshaw, Masařík, and Stacho [Flexible list colorings in graphs with special degeneracy conditions, in Proceedings of the 31st International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2020), LIPIcs. Leibniz Int. Proc. Inform. 181, Schloss Dagstuhl. Leibniz-Zent. Inform., Wadern, 2020, article 31]. They introduced a new invariant for a graph $G$, called the robust connectivity and written as $\kappa_\rho(G)$, defined as the minimum value $\frac{|R \cap \Lambda (T)|}{|R|}$ taken over all nonempty subsets $R\subseteq V(G)$, where $T = T(R)$ is a spanning tree on $G$ chosen to maximize $|R \cap \Lambda(T)|$. Large robust connectivity was originally used to show flexible choosability in nonregular graphs. In this paper, we investigate some interesting properties of robust connectivity for graphs embedded in surfaces. We prove a tight asymptotic bound of $\Omega(\gamma^{-\frac{1}{r}})$ for the robust connectivity of $r$-connected graphs of Euler genus $\gamma$. Moreover, we give a surprising connection between the robust connectivity of graphs with an edge-maximal embedding in a surface and the surface connectivity of that surface, which describes to what extent large induced subgraphs of embedded graphs can be cut out from the surface without splitting the surface into multiple parts. For planar graphs, this connection provides an equivalent formulation of a long-standing conjecture of Albertson and Berman [A conjecture on planar graphs, in Graph Theory and Related Topics, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1979, p. 57], which states that every planar graph on $n$ vertices contains an induced forest of size at least $n/2$.},

  abstract     = {The genus of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ is well understood for a wide range of $p=p(n)$. Recently, the study of the genus of the random bipartite graph $G(n_1,n_2,p)$, with partition classes of size $n_1$ and $n_2$, was initiated by Mohar and Jing, who showed that when $n_1$ and $n_2$ are comparable in size and $p=p(n_1,n_2)$ is significantly larger than $(n_1n_2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ the genus of the random bipartite graph has a similar behavior to that of the binomial random graph. In this paper we show that there is a threshold for planarity of the random bipartite graph at $p=(n_1n_2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ and investigate the genus close to this threshold, extending the results of Mohar and Jing. It turns out that there is qualitatively different behavior in the case where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are comparable, when with high probability (whp) the genus is linear in the number of edges, than in the case where $n_1$ is asymptotically smaller than $n_2$, when whp the genus behaves like the genus of a sparse random graph $G(n_1,q)$ for an appropriately chosen $q=q(p,n_1,n_2)$.},

Motivated by Lichiardopol&#39;s conjecture, we study the existence of vertex-disjoint directed cycles satisfying length constraints in digraphs of large connectivity or large minimum degree. Our main result is that for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $s(k) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every strongly $s(k)$-connected digraph contains $k$ vertex-disjoint directed cycles of pairwise distinct lengths. In contrast, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ we construct a strongly $k$-connected digraph containing no two vertex- or arc-disjoint directed cycles of the same length. It is an open problem whether $g(3)$ exists. Here we prove the existence of an integer $K$ such that every digraph of minimum out- and in-degree at least $K$ contains 3 vertex-disjoint directed cycles of pairwise distinct lengths.},

A well-known conjecture of Simon posits that any shellable complex is shelling completable. In this note we prove that vertex decomposable complexes are shelling completable. In fact we show that if $\Delta$ is a vertex decomposable complex, then there exists an ordering of its ground set $V$ such that adding the revlex smallest missing $(d+1)$-subset of $V$ results in a complex that is again vertex decomposable. We explore applications to matroids and shifted complexes, as well as connections to ridge-chordal complexes and $k$-decomposability. We also show that if $\Delta$ is a $d$-dimensional complex on at most $d+3$ vertices, then the notions of shellable, vertex decomposable, shelling completable, and extendably shellable are all equivalent.},

In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$ and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. We focus on the problem of constructing a perfect matching in as few rounds as possible. In particular, we present an adaptive strategy for the player which achieves a perfect matching in $\beta n$ rounds, where the value of $\beta 0.693 \, n$ and show that the player cannot achieve the desired property in less than $\alpha n$ rounds, where the value of $\alpha &gt; 0.932$ is derived from a solution to another system of differential equations.

For instance, with two agents we show that for biconnected graphs it is possible to obtain at least 3/4 of the maximin share with connected allocations, while for the remaining graphs the guarantee is at most 1/2. In addition, we determine the optimal relaxation of envy-freeness that can be obtained with each graph for two agents and characterize the set of trees and complete bipartite graphs that always admit an allocation satisfying envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) for three agents.

An observation of Erdös and Hajnal together with Shearer&#39;s classical upper bound for the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3, t)$ shows that $f(n)$ is at most $(2 \sqrt{2} + o(1)) \sqrt{n/\log n}$. We improve this bound by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, as well as obtaining an analogous bound on the list chromatic number which is tight up to a constant factor.

The $r$-uniform hypergraph $K_{r+1}^+$ is obtained from $K_{r+1}$ by enlarging each edge of $K_{r+1}$ with $r-2$ new vertices disjoint from $V(K_{r+1})$ such that distinct edges of $K_{r+1}$ are enlarged by distinct vertices. Let $H$ be a $K_{r+1}^+$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices. In this paper, we prove that when $n$ is sufficiently large, the spectral radius $\rho (H)$ of the adjacency tensor of $H$ is no more than $\frac{n}{r}$, i.e., $\rho (H)\leq \frac{n}{r}$, with equality if and only if $r|n$ and $H$ is a transversal design, where the transversal design is the balanced $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph such that each pair of vertices from distinct parts is contained in one hyperedge exactly. An immediate corollary of this result is that $ex_r^{lin}(n,K_{r+1}^+)= \frac{n^2}{r^2}$ for sufficiently large $n$ and $r|n$, where $ex_r^{lin}(n,K_{r+1}^+)$ is the maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}^+$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraph, i.e., the linear Turán number of $K_{r+1}^+$.},

As an application, we establish the following quantitative Helly-type result for the diameter. If $K$ is the intersection of finitely many convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then one can select $2d$ of these bodies whose intersection is of diameter at most $(2d)^3{diam}(K)$. The best previously known estimate, due to Brazitikos [Bull. Hellenic Math. Soc., 62 (2018), pp. 19--25], is $c d^{11/2}$. Moreover, we confirm that the multiplicative factor $c d^{1/2}$ conjectured by Bárány, Katchalski, and Pach [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 86 (1982), pp. 109--114] cannot be improved. The bounds above follow from our key result that concerns sparse approximation of a convex polytope by the convex hull of a well-chosen subset of its vertices: Assume that $Q \subset {\mathbb R}^d$ is a polytope whose centroid is the origin. Then there exist at most 2d vertices of $Q$ whose convex hull $Q^{\prime \prime}$ satisfies $Q \subset - 8d^3 Q^{\prime \prime}.$},

In the case where the graph contains no cycle of length $2t+1$, we can improve the bound on the number of edges to one that is exact for $t\in{1,2,3,4,6}$. In the case $\Delta=3$ and $t=3$, we obtain an exact bound. Our results also have implications for the related problem of bounding the distance-$t$ chromatic index, $t&gt;2$; in particular, for this, we obtain an upper bound of $1.941\Delta^t$ for graphs of large enough maximum degree $\Delta$, markedly improving on earlier bounds for this parameter.},

  abstract     = {In the literature on parameterized graph problems, there has been an increased effort in recent years aimed at exploring novel notions of graph edit-distance that are more powerful than the size of a modulator to a specific graph class. In this line of research, Bulian and Dawar [Algorithmica, 75 (2016), pp. 363--382] introduced the notion of elimination distance and showed that deciding whether a given graph has elimination distance at most $k$ to any minor-closed class of graphs is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by $k$ [Algorithmica, 79 (2017), pp. 139--158]. They showed that graph isomorphism parameterized by the elimination distance to bounded degree graphs is fixed-parameter tractable and asked whether determining the elimination distance to the class of bounded degree graphs is fixed-parameter tractable. Recently, Lindermayr, Siebertz, and Vigny [MFCS 2020, LIPIcs Leibniz Int. Proc. Inform. 170, Wadern Germany, 2020, 65] obtained a fixed-parameter algorithm for this problem in the special case where the input is restricted to $K_5$-minor free graphs. In this paper, we answer the question of Bulian and Dawar in the affirmative for general graphs. In fact, we give a more general result capturing elimination distance to any graph class characterized by a finite set of graphs as forbidden induced subgraphs.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by applications in combinatorial geometry, we consider the following question: Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_m)$ be an $m$-partition of a positive integer $n$, $S_i \subseteq \mathbb{C}^{\lambda_i}$ be finite sets, and let $S:=S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_m \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ be the multigrid defined by $S_i$. Suppose $p$ is an $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomial. How many zeros does $p$ have on $S$? We first develop a multivariate generalization of the combinatorial nullstellensatz that certifies existence of a point $t \in S$ so that $p(t) \neq 0$. Then we show that a natural multivariate generalization of the DeMillo--Lipton--Schwartz--Zippel lemma holds, except for a special family of polynomials that we call $\lambda$-reducible. This yields a simultaneous generalization of the Szemerédi--Trotter theorem and the Schwartz--Zippel lemma into higher dimensions, and has applications in incidence geometry. Finally, we develop a symbolic algorithm that identifies certain $\lambda$-reducible polynomials. More precisely, our symbolic algorithm detects polynomials that include a Cartesian product of hypersurfaces in their zero set. It is likely that using Chow forms the algorithm can be generalized to handle arbitrary $\lambda$-reducible polynomials, which we leave as an open problem.},

  abstract     = {The ring loading problem emerged in the 1990s to model an important special case of telecommunication networks (synchronous optical network rings) which gained attention from practitioners and theorists alike. Given an undirected cycle on $n$ nodes together with nonnegative demands between any pair of nodes, the ring loading problem asks for an unsplittable routing of the demands such that the maximum cumulated demand on any edge is minimized. Let $L$ be the value of such a solution. In the relaxed version of the problem, each demand can be split into two parts where the first part is routed clockwise while the second part is routed counterclockwise. Denote with $L^*$ the maximum load of a minimum split routing solution. In a landmark paper, Schrijver, Seymour, and Winkler [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 11 (1998), pp. 1--14] showed that $L \leq L^* + \frac{3}{2}D$, where $D$ is the maximum demand value. They also found (implicitly) an instance of the ring loading problem with $L = L^* + \frac{101}{100}D$. Recently, Skutella [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 30 (2016), pp. 327--342] improved these bounds by showing that $L \leq L^* + \frac{19}{14}D$, and there exists an instance with $L = L^* + \frac{11}{10}D$. We contribute to this line of research by showing that $L \leq L^* + \frac{13}{10}D$. We also take a first step toward lower and upper bounds for small instances.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is a cluster-growth model that consists of a set of particles that are sequentially aggregated over a two-dimensional grid. In this paper, we introduce a biased version of the DLA model, in which particles are limited to moving in a subset of possible directions. We denote by $k$-DLA the model where the particles move only in $k$ possible directions. We study the biased DLA model from the perspective of computational complexity, defining two decision problems. The first problem is Prediction, whose input is a site of the grid $c$ and a sequence $S$ of walks, representing the trajectories of a set of particles. The question is whether a particle stops at site $c$ when sequence $S$ is realized. The second problem is Realization, where the input is a set of positions of the grid, $P$. The question is whether there exists a sequence $S$ that realizes $P$, i.e., all particles of $S$ exactly occupy the positions in $P$. Our aim is to classify the Prediction and Realization problems for the different versions of DLA. We first show that Prediction is P-Complete for 2-DLA (thus for 3-DLA). Later, we show that Prediction can be solved much more efficiently for 1-DLA. In fact, we show that in that case, the problem is NL-Complete. With respect to Realization, we show that when restricted to 2-DLA the problem is in P, while in the 1-DLA case, the problem is in L.},

Mat. Hungar. 1 (1966), pp. 51--57] and Erdös and Stone [Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 52 (1946), pp. 1087--1091] showed that $\Pi_{\infty}^{(2)}=\Pi_{fin}^{(2)}=\Pi_{1}^{(2)}={0, {1 \over 2}, {2 \over 3}, ...,{l-1 \over l}, ...}.$ We know quite little about the Turán density of an $r$-uniform graph for $r\ge 3$. Baber and Talbot [Electron. J. Combin., 19 (2011)] and Pikhurko [Israel J. Math., 20 (2014), pp. 415--454] showed that there is an irrational number in $\Pi_{3}^{(3)}$ and $\Pi_{fin}^{(3)}$, respectively, disproving a conjecture of Chung and Graham [Erdös on Graphs: His Legacy of Unsolved Problems, A. K. Peters, Natick, MA, 1999]. Baber and Talbot [Electron. J. Combin., 19 (2011)] asked whether $\Pi_{1}^{(r)}$ contains an irrational number. The Lagrangian of a hypergraph has been a useful tool in hypergraph extremal problems. The Lagrangian density of an $r$-uniform graph $F$ is $\pi_{\lambda}(F)=\sup {r! \lambda(G):G\;is;F-free}$, where $\lambda(G)$ is the Lagrangian of an $r$-uniform graph $G$. Sidorenko [Combinatorica, 9 (1989), pp. 207--215] showed that the Lagrangian density of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $F$ is the same as the Turán density of the extension of $F$. In this paper, we show that the Lagrangian density of $F={123, 124, 134, 234, 567}$ (the disjoint union of $K_4^3$ and an edge) is ${\sqrt 3\over 3}$, and consequently, the Turán density of the extension of $F$ is an irrational number, answering the question of Baber and Talbot.},

Harborth conjectured in 1981 that the maximum number of edges of a matchstick graph with $n$ vertices is $\lfloor 3n-\sqrt{12n-3}\rfloor$. Using the Euler formula and the isoperimetric inequality, it can be shown that a matchstick graph with $n$ vertices has no more than $3n-\sqrt{2\pi\sqrt{3}\cdot n}+O(1)$ edges. We improve this upper bound to $3n-c\sqrt{n-1/4}$ edges, where $c=\frac12(\sqrt{12} + \sqrt{2\pi\sqrt{3}})$. The main tool in the proof is a new upper bound for the number of edges that takes into account the number of nontriangular faces. We also find a sharp upper bound for the number of triangular faces in a matchstick graph.},

We then disprove a conjecture of Haythorpe by showing that for every nonnegative integer $k$ there is a 5-regular graph on $26 + 6k$ vertices with $2^{k+10} \cdot 3^{k+3}$ Hamiltonian cycles. We prove that for every $d \ge 3$ there is an infinite family of Hamiltonian 3-connected graphs with minimum degree $d$, with a bounded number of Hamiltonian cycles.

In this paper, we demonstrate a unified understanding of these problems by commonly extending previous important results. We solve our problem under a reasonable assumption, which is sufficiently broad to include the specific problems listed above. We first present a min-max theorem and a combinatorial algorithm for the unweighted version. We then provide a linear programming formulation with dual integrality and a primal-dual algorithm for the weighted version. A key ingredient of the proposed algorithm is a technique to shrink forbidden structures, which corresponds to the techniques of shrinking odd cycles, triangles, squares, and directed cycles in Edmonds&#39; blossom algorithm, a triangle-free 2-matching algorithm, a square-free 2-matching algorithm, and an arborescence algorithm, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Stable Marriage is a fundamental problem to both computer science and economics. Four well-known NP-hard optimization versions of this problem are the Sex-Equal Stable Marriage (SESMI), Balanced Stable Marriage (BSMI), max-Stable Marriage with Ties (max-SMTI), and min-Stable Marriage with Ties (min-SMTI) problems. In this paper, we analyze these problems from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. We conduct the first study of these problems in particular, and of problems related to Stable Marriage in general, with respect to the parameter treewidth. The motivation behind the choice of treewidth is threefold. First, several problems in social choice theory have already been studied with respect to treewidth. The networks relevant to these problems (say, social networks) are clearly also relevant to Stable Marriage. Thus, the motivation underlying these studies directly extends to our study. Second, empirical studies of the treewidth of several types of networks relevant to Stable Marriage have also already been undertaken, identifying that some of these networks indeed have a treelike structure. Third, treewidth is the most well studied structural parameter in parameterized complexity. We design optimal parameterized algorithms for all four problems under the treewidth of both their primal graphs and rotation digraphs. First, we study the treewidth ${\mathtt{tw}}$ of the primal graph. We establish that all four problems are W[1]-hard. In particular, while it is easy to show that all four problems admit algorithms that run in time $n^{{\mathcal{O}}({\mathtt{tw}})}$, we prove that unless the exponential-time hypothesis is false, all of these algorithms are optimal. Next, we study the treewidth ${\mathtt{tw}}$ of the rotation digraph. In this context, max-SMTI and min-SMTI are not defined. For both SESMI and BSMI, we design (highly nontrivial) algorithms that run in time $2^{{\mathtt{tw}}}n^{{\mathcal{O}}(1)}$. Then, for both SESMI and BSMI, we prove that unless the strong exponential-time hypothesis is false, algorithms that run in time $(2-\epsilon)^{{\mathtt{tw}}}n^{{\mathcal{O}}(1)}$ do not exist for any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$. We thus present a comprehensive, complete picture of the behavior of Stable Marriage with respect to treewidth.},

A vertex outside the active set becomes active if the number of so far activated vertices in its neighborhood is at least its threshold. We give two parameterized algorithms for a special case where each vertex has the threshold set to half of its neighbors (the so-called Majority Target Set Selection problem) for parameterizations by the neighborhood diversity and the twin cover number of the input graph. We complement these results from the negative side. We give a hardness proof for the Majority Target Set Selection problem when parameterized by (a restriction of) the modular-width---a natural generalization of both previous structural parameters. We also show the Target Set Selection problem parameterized by the neighborhood diversity or by the twin cover number is \sf W[1]-hard when there is no restriction on the thresholds.},

The second approach combines methods from coding theory and statistics to compare the mean and variance of the nonzero weights in a minimal code. Finally, the third approach regards minimal codes as cutting blocking sets and studies these using the theory of spreads in finite geometry. By applying and combining these approaches with each other, we derive several new bounds and constraints on the parameters of minimal codes. Moreover, we obtain two new constructions of cutting blocking sets of small cardinality in finite projective spaces. In turn, these allow us to give explicit constructions of minimal codes having short length for the given field and dimension.},

  abstract     = {The graph parameter of pathwidth can be seen as a measure of the topological resemblance of a graph to a path. A popular definition of pathwidth is given in terms of node search, where we are given a system of tunnels (represented by a graph) that is contaminated by some infectious substance and we are looking for a search strategy that, at each step, either places a searcher on a vertex or removes a searcher from a vertex and where an edge is cleaned when both endpoints are simultaneously occupied by searchers. It was proved that the minimum number of searchers required for a successful cleaning strategy is equal to the pathwidth of the graph plus one. Two desired characteristics for a cleaning strategy are to be monotone (no recontamination occurs) and connected (clean territories always remain connected). Under these two demands, the number of searchers is equivalent to a variant of pathwidth called connected pathwidth. We prove that connected pathwidth is fixed parameter tractable; in particular we design a $2^{O(k^2)}\cdot n$ time algorithm that checks whether the connected pathwidth of $G$ is at most $k.$ This resolves an open question by Dereniowski, Osula, and Rzaͅżewski [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 794 (2019), pp. 85--100]. For our algorithm, we enrich the typical sequence technique that is able to deal with the connectivity demand. Typical sequences have been introduced by Bodlaender and Kloks [J. Algorithms, 21 (1996), pp. 358--402] for the design of linear parameterized algorithms for treewidth and pathwidth. While this technique has been later applied to other parameters, none of its advancements was able to deal with the connectivity demand, as it is a “global” demand that concerns an unbounded number of parts of the graph of unbounded size. The proposed extension is based on an encoding of the connectivity property that is quite versatile and may be adapted to deliver linear parameterized algorithms for the connected variants of other width parameters as well. An immediate consequence of our result is a $2^{O(k^2)}\cdot n$ time algorithm for the monotone and connected version of the edge search number.},

  abstract     = {Maximizing a monotone submodular function under various constraints is a classical and intensively studied problem. However, in the single-pass streaming model, where the elements arrive one by one and an algorithm can store only a small fraction of input elements, there is large gap in our knowledge, even though several approximation algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we present the first lower bound on the approximation ratios for cardinality and matroid constraints that beat $1-\frac{1}{e}$ in the single-pass streaming model. Let $n$ be the number of elements in the stream. Then, we prove that any (randomized) streaming algorithm for a cardinality constraint with approximation ratio $2-\sqrt{2}+\varepsilon$ requires $\Omega(\frac{n}{K^2})$ space for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $K$ is the size limit of the output set. We also prove that any (randomized) streaming algorithm for a (partition) matroid constraint with approximation ratio $\frac{K}{2K-1}+\varepsilon$ requires $\Omega(\frac{n}{K^2})$ space for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $K$ is the rank of the given matroid. In addition, we give streaming algorithms that assume access to the objective function via a weak oracle that can only be used to evaluate function values on feasible sets. Specifically, we show weak-oracle streaming algorithms for cardinality and matroid constraints with approximation ratios $\frac{K}{2K-1}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, respectively, whose space complexity is exponential in $K$ but is independent of $n$. The former one exactly matches the known inapproximability result for a cardinality constraint in the weak oracle model. The latter one almost matches our lower bound of $\frac{K}{2K-1}$ for a matroid constraint, which almost settles the approximation ratio for a matroid constraint that can be obtained by a streaming algorithm whose space complexity is independent of $n$.},

  abstract     = {The Weisfeiler--Leman procedure is a widely used technique for graph isomorphism testing that works by iteratively computing an isomorphism-invariant coloring of vertex tuples. Meanwhile, a fundamental tool in structural graph theory, which is often exploited in approaches to tackle the graph isomorphism problem, is the decomposition into 2- and 3-connected components. We prove that the two-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm implicitly computes the decomposition of a graph into its 3-connected components. This implies that the dimension of the algorithm needed to distinguish two given nonisomorphic graphs is at most the dimension required to distinguish nonisomorphic 3-connected components of the graphs (assuming dimension at least 2). To obtain our decomposition result, we show that, for �� ≥ 2, the ��-dimensional algorithm distinguishes ��-separators, i.e., ��-tuples of vertices that separate the graph, from other vertex ��-tuples. As a byproduct, we also obtain insights about the connectivity of constituent graphs of association schemes.

A decomposition of $K_{r,n}^{(k)}$ is a partition of $E(K_{r,n}^{(k)})$. A perfect matching (resp., Hamilton tight cycle) decomposition of $K_{r,n}^{(k)}$ is a decomposition of $K_{r,n}^{(k)}$ into perfect matchings (resp., Hamilton tight cycles). In this paper, we prove that if $k\mid n$ (resp., $2\nmid k$ and $k\mid n$), then $K_{k+1,n}^{(k)}$ (resp., $K_{k+2,n}^{(k)}$) has a perfect matching decomposition. We also prove that for any integer $k\geq 2$, $K_{k+1,n}^{(k)}$ has a Hamilton tight cycle decomposition. In all cases, we use constructive methods involving number theory. In fact, we confirm two conjectures proposed by Zhang, Lu, and Liu [Appl. Math. Comput., 386 (2020), 125492].},

  abstract     = {An instance of the marriage problem is given by a graph $G = (A \cup B,E)$, together with, for each vertex of $G$, a strict preference order over its neighbors. A matching $M$ of $G$ is popular in the marriage instance if $M$ does not lose a head-to-head election against any matching where vertices are voters. Every stable matching is a min-size popular matching; another subclass of popular matchings that always exists and can be easily computed is the set of dominant matchings. A popular matching $M$ is dominant if $M$ wins the head-to-head election against any larger matching. Thus, every dominant matching is a max-size popular matching, and it is known that the set of dominant matchings is the linear image of the set of stable matchings in an auxiliary graph. Results from the literature seem to suggest that stable and dominant matchings behave, from a complexity theory point of view, in a very similar manner within the class of popular matchings. The goal of this paper is to show that there are instead differences in the tractability of stable and dominant matchings and to investigate further their importance for popular matchings. First, we show that it is easy to check if all popular matchings are also stable; however, it is co-NP hard to check if all popular matchings are also dominant. Second, we show how some new and recent hardness results on popular matching problems can be deduced from the NP-hardness of certain problems on stable matchings, also studied in this paper, thus showing that stable matchings can be employed to show not only positive results on popular matchings (as is known) but also most negative ones. Problems for which we show new hardness results include finding a min-size (resp., max-size) popular matching that is not stable (resp., dominant). A known result for which we give a new and simple proof is the NP-hardness of finding a popular matching when $G$ is nonbipartite.},

With Maria Chudnovsky, we recently proved that, for every forest $F$, every graph $G$ with at least two vertices that does not contain $F$ or its complement as an induced subgraph has a pure pair $(Z_1,Z_2)$ with $|Z_1|,|Z_2|$ linear in $|G|$. Here we investigate what we can say about pure pairs in an ordered graph $G$, when we exclude an ordered forest $F$ and its complement as induced subgraphs. Fox showed that there need not be a linear pure pair; but Pach and Tomon showed that if $F$ is a monotone path, then there is a pure pair of size $c|G|/\log |G|$. We generalize this to all ordered forests, at the cost of a slightly worse bound: we prove that, for every ordered forest $F$, every ordered graph $G$ with at least two vertices that does not contain $F$ or its complement as an induced subgraph has a pure pair of size $|G|^{1-o(1)}$.},

We focus on tight cycles and obtain optimal results for a weaker notion of uniformly dense hypergraphs. We show that if an $n$-vertex 3-uniform hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ has the property that for any set of vertices $X$ and for any collection $P$ of pairs of vertices, the number of hyperedges composed by a pair belonging to $P$ and one vertex from $X$ is at least $(1/4+o(1))|X||P| - o(|V|^3)$ and $H$ has minimum vertex degree at least $\Omega(|V|^2)$, then $H$ contains a tight Hamilton cycle.

  abstract     = {The switch Markov chain has been extensively studied as the most natural Markov chain Monte Carlo approach for sampling graphs with prescribed degree sequences. In this work we study the problem of uniformly sampling graphs for which, in addition to the degree sequence, joint degree constraints are given. These constraints specify how many edges there should be between two given degree classes (i.e., subsets of nodes that all have the same degree). Although the problem was formalized over a decade ago, and despite its practical significance in generating synthetic network topologies, small progress has been made on the random sampling of such graphs. In the case of one degree class, the problem reduces to the sampling of regular graphs (i.e., graphs in which all nodes have the same degree), but beyond this very little is known. We fully resolve the case of two degree classes, by showing that the switch Markov chain is always rapidly mixing. We do this by combining a recent embedding argument developed by the authors in combination with ideas of Bhatnagar et al. [Algorithmica, 50 (2008), pp. 418--445] introduced in the context of sampling bichromatic matchings.},

Earlier, Schicho provided an “onion skins” algorithm for mapping a lattice polygon $P$ into a small integer multiple of the standard simplex, based on passing successively to the convex hull of the interior lattice points of $P$. Castryck and Cools showed that this algorithm computes the lattice size of $P$. In this paper we show that for a plane convex body $P$ a reduced basis of $\mathbb Z^2$ computes the lattice size. This provides a lattice reduction algorithm for computing the lattice size, which works for any convex body $P\subset\mathbb R^2$ and outperforms the “onion skins” algorithm in the case when $P$ is a lattice polygon.},

  abstract     = {In computational biology, tandem duplication is an important biological phenomenon which can occur either at the genome or at the DNA level. A tandem duplication takes a copy of a genome segment and inserts it right after the segment---this can be represented as the string operation $AXB \Rightarrow AXXB$. Tandem exon duplications have been found in many species such as human, fly, and worm and have been largely studied in computational biology. The tandem duplication (TD) distance problem we investigate in this paper is defined as follows: given two strings $S$ and $T$ over the same alphabet $\Sigma$, compute the smallest sequence of TDs required to convert $S$ to $T$. The natural question of whether the TD distance can be computed in polynomial time was posed in 2004 by Leupold et al. and had remained open, despite the fact that TDs have received much attention ever since. In this paper, we focus on the special case when all characters of $S$ are distinct. This is known as the exemplar TD distance, which is of special relevance in bioinformatics. We first prove that this problem is NP-hard when the alphabet size is unbounded, settling the 16-year-old open problem. We then show how to adapt the proof to $|\Sigma|=4$, hence proving the NP-hardness of the TD problem for any $|\Sigma|\geq 4$. One of the tools we develop for the reduction is a new problem called Cost-Effective Subgraph, for which we obtain W[1]-hardness results that might be of independent interest. We finally show that computing the exemplar TD distance between $S$ and $T$ is fixed-parameter tractable. Our results open the door to many other questions, and we conclude with several open problems.},

If we weaken this condition to demand only that each pair of points occur together in at most one block, then the resulting object is a partial $(n,k,1)$-design.

Here, for all sufficiently large $n$, we determine exactly the minimum number of blocks in an uncompletable partial $(n,k,1)$-design.
