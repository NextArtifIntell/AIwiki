  abstract     = {Abstract. Production of blood cells is a complex and tightly regulated process. Its quantitative understanding is highly relevant for the treatment of various diseases, including blood cancers. White blood cells (WBCs) originate from the so-called hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. HSCs give rise to immature WBCs that divide and further differentiate into mature cells. It is still a matter of debate whether cell differentiation resembles a discrete or a continuous process. We propose a novel continuous integral model (CIM) to describe WBC production. In agreement with recent experimental results, the maturity level of cells is described by a one-dimensional continuous variable. The process of maturation is modeled by an integral term that accounts for the influx of cells of maturity level from the differentiation of cells with lower maturity levels. In the model, cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled by a feedback signal which is a function of the mature cell population. We investigate the relationships between the proposed CIM, the multicompartment ordinary differential equations model introduced in [A. Marciniak-Czochra et al., Stem Cells Dev., 18 (2009), pp. 377–385] which treats differentiation as a discrete process, and the partial differential equations model of transport type studied by Doumic et al. [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 71 (2011), pp. 1918–1940] which describes differentiation as a continuous process. We show that both models can be derived from the CIM and we perform numerical simulations to compare them qualitatively.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new type of object characterization, which is capable of accurately describing small isolated inclusions for potential field inverse problems such as in electrostatics, magnetostatics, and related low frequency Maxwell problems. Relevant applications include characterizing ferrous unexploded ordnance from magnetostatic field measurements in magnetometry, describing small conducting inclusions for medical imaging using electrical impedance tomography, performing geological ground surveys using electrical resistivity imaging, characterizing objects by electrosensing fish to navigate and identify food, and describing the effective properties of dilute composites. Our object characterization builds on the generalized polarizability tensor (GPT) object characterization concept and provides an alternative to the contracted GPT. We call the new characterizations harmonic GPTs (HGPTs) as their coefficients correspond to products of harmonic polynomials. Then, we show that the number of independent coefficients of HGPTs needed to characterize objects can be significantly reduced by considering the symmetry group of the object and propose a systematic approach for determining the subspace of symmetric harmonic polynomials that is fixed by the group and its dimension. This enables us to determine the independent HGPT coefficients for different symmetry groups.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While a common trend in disease modeling is to develop models of increasing complexity, it was recently pointed out that outbreaks appear remarkably simple when viewed in the incidence vs. cumulative cases (ICC) plane. This article details the theory behind this phenomenon by analyzing the stochastic Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model in the cumulative cases domain. We prove that the Markov chain associated with this model reduces, in the ICC plane, to a pure birth chain for the cumulative number of cases, whose limit leads to an independent increments Gaussian process that fluctuates about a deterministic ICC curve. We calculate the associated variance and quantify the additional variability due to estimating incidence over a finite period of time. We also illustrate the universality brought forth by the ICC concept on real-world data for Influenza A and for the COVID-19 outbreak in Arizona.},

We derive a characterization of the large deviation rate function which quantifies the rate of exponential decay of probabilities of rare events for paths of the process. The characterization relies on a solution of a partial integro-differential equation with boundary constraints. We develop a practical implementation of our results in terms of a numerical solution for the PIDE.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We typically interact in groups, not just in pairs. For this reason, it has recently been proposed that the spread of information, opinion, or disease should be modeled over a hypergraph rather than a standard graph. The use of hyperedges naturally allows for a nonlinear rate of transmission, in terms of both the group size and the number of infected group members, as is the case, for example, when social distancing is encouraged. We consider a general class of individual-level, stochastic, susceptible-infected-susceptible models on a hypergraph, and focus on a mean field approximation proposed in [G. F. de Arruda, G. Petri, and Y. Moreno, Phys. Rev. Res., 2 (2020), 023032]. We derive spectral conditions under which the mean field model predicts local or global stability of the infection-free state. We also compare these results with (a) a new condition that we derive for decay to zero in mean for the exact process, (b) conditions for a different mean field approximation in [D. J. Higham and H.-L. de Kergorlay, Proc. A, 477 (2021), 20210232], and (c) numerical simulations of the microscale model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Networks are a widely used tool for investigating the large-scale connectivity structure in complex systems and graphons have been proposed as an infinite-size limit of dense networks. The detection of communities or other meso-scale structures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. Similarly, we may want to simplify graphons in terms of communities, in order to gain a comprehensible description of their meso-scale structure. This raises the question of how communities in graphons can be identified. In this paper, we define a graphon modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximized to detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximization as a continuous optimization problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with exclusively maximizing the modularity of the network. While the choice of graphon estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Wolbachia is a natural bacterium that can infect mosquitoes and reduce their ability to transmit mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials and modeling studies have shown that the fraction of infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection to persist. To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial heterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes created by a local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop and analyze PDE models to study the invasion dynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field. Our reaction-diffusion-type models account for the complex vertical transmission and the spatial mosquito dispersion. We characterize the threshold for a successful invasion with a bubble-shaped distribution, called the “critical bubble.” The critical bubble is optimal in its release size compared to other spatial profiles in a one-dimensional landscape. The fraction of infection near the release center is higher than the threshold level for the corresponding homogeneously mixing ODE models. We show that the proposed spatial models give rise to the traveling waves of Wolbachia infection when above the threshold. We quantify how the threshold condition and traveling-wave velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters. Numerical studies for different scenarios are presented to inform the design of release strategies.},

However, many applications impose elementwise constraints on the transport plan which traditional optimal transport cannot enforce. Here we introduce supervised optimal transport (sOT), which formulates a constrained optimal transport problem where couplings between certain elements are prohibited according to specific applications. sOT is proved to be equivalent to an penalized optimization problem, from which efficient algorithms are designed to solve its entropy regularized formulation. We demonstrate the capability of sOT by comparing it to other variants and extensions of traditional optimal transport in the color transfer problem. We also study the barycenter problem in sOT formulation, where we discover and prove a unique reverse and portion selection (control) mechanism. Supervised optimal transport is broadly applicable to applications in which a constrained transport plan is involved and the original unit should be preserved by avoiding normalization.},

Second, we numerically construct solution landscapes by varying and , and report a novel X state, which emerges from saddle-node bifurcation and serves as the parent state in such a solution landscape. Various new classes are then found among these solution landscapes, including the X class, the S class, and the L class.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Pattern formation arising from the reaction-diffusion epidemic model is a space-time depiction of the distribution and transmission of infectious diseases. Disease control can be achieved by controlling the associated pattern formations. For an SIR reaction-diffusion epidemic model, we review its Turing pattern formations with different transmission rates under the case of a constant recovery rate. To control pattern formations of the SIR epidemic model, we introduce a regulator as a control function of the recovery rate. For a perfect control strategy, it not only leads to a desired pattern formation, but also has a small support in space-time domains. In order to obtain such a control strategy, we propose a sparse optimal control problem governed by the SIR epidemic model. We study the existence of optimal solutions, derive the first order necessary optimality system, obtain the sparsity structure of the control function, and numerically solve the control problem. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectivity of our method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we formulate susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction-diffusion epidemic models with cognition and show the impact of movement strategies on disease outbreak and mitigation under a spatially heterogeneous environment. The cognitive diffusion either takes a Fokker–Planck type diffusion obtained by Chapman’s diffusion law (called random diffusion) or follows Fick’s diffusion law (called symmetric diffusion). We derive a variational expression of the basic reproduction number for both models and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable if . Furthermore, if , the model following Fick’s diffusion law admits at least one endemic equilibrium and the model following Chapman’s diffusion law has a unique endemic equilibrium. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, which additionally show the segregation phenomenon between susceptible and infected populations regulated by different movement strategies. Spatial segregation here is natural, not caused by an isolation policy, and thus is the most important indicator for an infectious disease to spread or wane in the absence of intervention. The first example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion segregates infected and susceptible populations further than an ODE model and thus reduces the infection size. However, symmetric diffusion never does that. The second example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion detriments segregation but still reduces the infection severity by moving infected individuals to a disease-free region. In a certain situation, a heterogeneous random diffusion may increase the infection severity as shown in the last example.},

We also show how this reaction time can introduce a partial string stability, where the transfer function modulus remains smaller than 1 up to some critical frequency.

We present four microscopic models with different types of repulsive interactions between particles and their associated macroscopic models, which are formally obtained using different coarse-graining methods. The macroscopic limits are integro-differential equations for the density in phase space (positions and orientations) of the particles and may include nonlinearities in both the diffusive and advective components. In contrast to passive particles, systems of active particles can undergo phase separation without any attractive interactions, a mechanism known as motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We explore the onset of such a transition for each model in the parameter space of occupied volume fraction and Péclet number via a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. We establish that one of the models, namely, the mean-field model which assumes long-range repulsive interactions, cannot explain the emergence of MIPS. In contrast, MIPS is observed for the remaining three models that assume short-range interactions that localize the interaction terms in space.},

We first study how the capacitance matrix formalism, both when the material parameters are static and modulated, can be posed in a Hamiltonian form. Then, we use this result to compare this formalism to the tight-binding approximation. We prove that the correspondence between the capacitance formulation and the tight-binding approximation holds only in the case of dilute resonators. On the other hand, the tight-binding model is often coupled with a nearest-neighbor approximation, whereby long-range interactions are neglected. Even in the dilute case, we show that long-range interactions between subwavelength resonators are relatively strong and nearest-neighbor approximations are not generally appropriate.},

  abstract     = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute and highly contagious infectious disease of cloven-hoofed animals. In order to reveal the transmission dynamics and explore effective control measures of FMD, we formulate a diffusive FMD model with a fixed latent period and nonlocal infections. The threshold dynamics of the FMD model are determined by using the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$: if $\mathcal{R}_01$: at a low infection level, the faster the infectious individuals and virus diffuse, the faster the disease reaches the steady state. However, at a high infection level (i.e., the value of $\mathcal{R}_0$ is relatively large), the influence of diffusion on time from initial values to steady state is more complicated, but at least it is certain that the time will be shortened overall. By carrying out some sensitivity analysis of $\mathcal{R}_0 (&gt;1)$ and the equilibrium value of the infectious individuals $I^\ast$ in terms of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2,$ it is found that the $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$-plane is divided into two regions by the intersection of two parameter-related surfaces; the sensitivity of $\mathcal{R}_0$ and $I^\ast$ varies when $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ belong to different regions. When the values of both $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are very large or very small, $\beta_1$ plays a more significant role in the transmission of FMD. These results indicate that stamping out the infected individuals and blocking the epidemic spots and areas are effective in preventing and controlling the spread of FMD.},

As such, our proposed overlay networks accelerate convergence, improve generalization, and enhance robustness to client failures in DFL with theoretical guarantees. Also, we present an efficient algorithm to convert a given graph to a practical overlay network and maintain the network topology after potential client failures.

Apart from rare values of the attractive and repulsive exponents $(\alpha,\beta)$, the energy minimizing configurations of particles are not explicitly known, although simulations and local stability considerations have led to conjectures with strong evidence over a much wider region of parameters. For dimension $n\ge 2$ and for a segment $\beta=2\beta\ge2$, a unimodal threshold $2&lt;\alpha_{\Delta^n}(\beta) \le \max{\beta,4}$ exists such that equidistribution of particles over a unit diameter regular $n$-simplex minimizes the energy if and only if $\alpha \ge \alpha_{\Delta^n}(\beta)$ (and minimizes uniquely up to rigid motions if strict inequality holds). For $n\ge 2,$ the point $(\alpha,\beta)=(2,4)$ separates these regimes. At this point we show the minimizers all lie on a sphere and are precisely characterized by sharing all first and second moments with the spherical shell. Although the minimizers need not be asymptotically stable, our approach establishes $d_\alpha$-Lyapunov nonlinear stability of the associated ($d_2$-gradient) aggregation dynamics near the minimizer in both of these adjacent regimes---without reference to linearization. The $L^\alpha$-Kantorovich--Rubinstein--Wasserstein distance $d_\alpha$ which quantifies stability is chosen to match the attraction exponent.},

The entropy of the scalar is taken relative to the liquid molar fraction which induces a chemotactic behavior. This provides a transparent mechanism for the rejection of the scalar under formation of the solid phase. We identify slow varying coordinates, including the scalar density relative to liquid molarity weighted by latent heat, and use multiscale analysis to derive a quasi-equilibrium Stefan-type problem via a sharp interface scaling. The singular limit is underdetermined, and the leading order system is closed by imposing local conservation of the scalar under interface perturbation. The quasi-steady system determines interface motion as balance of curvature, temperature gradient, and scalar density. We resolve this numerically for axisymmetric surfaces and show that the thermal gradients typical of arctic sea ice can have a decisive impact on the mode of pinch-off of cylindrical brine inclusions and on the size distribution of the resultant spherical shapes. The density and distribution of these inclusion sizes is a key component of sea ice albedo which factors into global climate models.},

  abstract     = {The conformal mapping technique has long been used to obtain exact solutions to Laplace&#39;s equation in two-dimensional domains with awkward geometries. However, a major limitation of the technique is that it is only directly compatible with Dirichlet and zero-flux Neumann boundary conditions. It would be useful to have a means of adapting the technique to handle more general boundary conditions, for example, Robin or nonlinear flux conditions. Boundary tracing is an unconventional method for tackling boundary value problems with generic flux boundary conditions, where one takes a known solution to the field equation and seeks new boundaries satisfying the prescribed boundary condition. In this paper, we adapt boundary tracing for compatibility with conformal mapping to produce a new prescription for studying Laplace&#39;s equation coupled with general flux boundary conditions. We illustrate the procedure via two simple examples involving heat transfer. In both cases, we demonstrate how to construct infinite families of nontrivial domains in which the solution to the chosen flux boundary value problem is exactly equal to a selected harmonic function.},

  abstract     = {Localized wave oscillations in an open system that do not decay or grow in time, despite their frequency lying within a continuous spectrum of radiation modes carrying energy to or from infinity, are known as bound states in the continuum (BIC). Small perturbations from the typically delicate conditions for BIC almost always result in the waves weakly coupling with the radiation modes, leading to leaky states called quasi-BIC that have a large quality factor. We study the asymptotic nature of this weak coupling in the case of acoustic waves interacting with a rigid substrate featuring a partially partitioned slit---a setup that supports quasi-BIC that exponentially approach BIC as the slit is made increasingly narrow. In that limit, we use the method of matched asymptotic expansions in conjunction with reciprocal relations to study those quasi-BIC and their resonant excitation. In particular, we derive a leading approximation for the exponentially small imaginary part of each wavenumber eigenvalue (inversely proportional to quality factor), which is beyond all orders of the expansion for the wavenumber eigenvalue itself. Furthermore, we derive a leading approximation for the exponentially large amplitudes of the states in the case where they are resonantly excited by a plane wave at oblique incidence. These resonances occur in exponentially narrow wavenumber intervals and are physically manifested in cylindrical-dipolar waves emanating from the slit aperture and exponentially large field enhancements inside the slit. The asymptotic approximations are validated against numerical calculations.},

In this work, we present a justification for using fictitious domains to study obstacles immersed in incompressible viscous fluids through a simplified version of Brinkman&#39;s law for porous media. If the scalar function $\psi$ is considered as the inverse of permeability, it is possible to study the singularities of $\psi$ as approximations of obstacles (when $\psi$ tends to $\infty$) or of the domain corresponding to the fluid (when $\psi = 0$ or is very close to 0). The strong convergence of the solution of the perturbed problem to the solution of the strong problem is studied, also considering error estimates that depend on the penalty parameter, for fluids modeled with both the Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations with inhomogeneous boundary conditions. A numerical experiment is presented that validates this result and allows us to study the application of this perturbed problem simulation of flows and the identification of obstacles.},

In order to achieve synchronization and optimize time and energy consumption, a novel switching controller is designed, which combines the advantages of both the proportional feedback control method and the finite-time control technology. Sufficient conditions for achieving synchronization are established, and the estimates of time and energy costs are obtained mathematically as well. Particularly, the theoretical analysis and simulating calculation show that there exists a trade-off between time and energy costs. That is to say, the energy consumption can be reduced by adjusting the control parameters, but the time cost will increase inevitably, and vice versa. Further, we find that for fixed weights of time and energy costs of the performance index, the optimal values of parameters can be chosen to minimize the total cost.},

For holes that are infinite parallel strips or circular holes, we transform the problem to an equivalent eigenvalue integro-differential equation on an interval and expand in the appropriate basis (Legendre and radial polynomials, respectively). We use computational methods to demonstrate that the high spot, i.e., the maximal elevation of the fundamental sloshing profile, for the ice-fishing problem is in the interior of the free surface for large Bond numbers, but for a sufficiently small Bond number the high spot is on the boundary of the free surface. While several papers have proven high spot results in the absence of surface tension as it depends on the shape of the container, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effects of surface tension on the location of the high spot.},

  abstract     = {The Half-Space Matching (HSM) method has recently been developed as a new method for the solution of two-dimensional scattering problems with complex backgrounds, providing an alternative to Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) or other artificial boundary conditions. Based on half-plane representations for the solution, the scattering problem is rewritten as a system coupling (1) a standard finite element discretization localized around the scatterer and (2) integral equations whose unknowns are traces of the solution on the boundaries of a finite number of overlapping half-planes contained in the domain. While satisfactory numerical results have been obtained for real wavenumbers, well-posedness and equivalence of this HSM formulation to the original scattering problem have been established for complex wavenumbers only. In the present paper we show, in the case of a homogeneous background, that the HSM formulation is equivalent to the original scattering problem also for real wavenumbers, and so is well-posed, provided the traces satisfy radiation conditions at infinity analogous to the standard Sommerfeld radiation condition. As a key component of our argument we show that if the trace on the boundary of a half-plane satisfies our new radiation condition, then the corresponding solution to the half-plane Dirichlet problem satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition in a slightly smaller half-plane. We expect that this last result will be of independent interest, in particular in studies of rough surface scattering.},

Armed with the Lifshitz--Petrich free energy, we take the spectral viewpoint to examine tilt grain boundaries of the hexagonal phase. Several ingredients of grain boundaries are extracted, which are not easy to obtain from real-space profiles. We find that only a few spectra substantially contribute to the formation of grain boundaries. Their linear relation to the intrinsic spectra of the bulk hexagonal phase is independent of the tilt angle. By examining the feature of the spectral intensities, we propose a definition of the interface width. The widths calculated from this definition are consistent with visual estimation.},

In particular, in the fields of swarm robotics, sociobiology, and social dynamics, several types of local pairwise interactions were proposed and analyzed leading to spatial gathering, clustering, agreement, or coordinated motion in teams of robotic agents, in animal herds, or in human societies. We here propose a very simple stochastic interaction at encounters that leads to agreement or geometric alignment in swarms of simple agents and analyze the process of converging to consensus. Consider a group of agents whose “states&quot; evolve in time by pairwise interactions: the state of an agent is either a real value (a randomly initialized position within an interval) or a vector that is either unconstrained (e.g., the location of the agent in the plane) or constrained to have unit length (e.g., the direction of the agent&#39;s motion). The interactions are doubly stochastic in the sense that, at discrete time steps, pairs of agents are randomly selected and their new states are independently and uniformly set at random in (local) domains or intervals defined by the states of the interacting pair. We show that such processes lead, in finite expected time (measured by the number of interactions that occurred) to agreement in case of unconstrained states and alignment when the states are unit vectors.},

  abstract     = {Predictive modeling is key for saving time and resources in manufacturing processes such as fermentation arising in food and chemical manufacturing. To make reliable predictions, realistic models representing the most important process features are required. Several models describing the white wine fermentation process already exist. However, all of these models lack a combination of features, such as the importance of oxygen at the beginning of the process, the consumption of sugar due to yeast activity, and the toxicity of alcohol on the yeast cells combined with the single-cell yeast dynamics. This work introduces a new population balance model representing all these features in one model. It is based on a system of highly nonlinear weakly hyperbolic partial/ordinary integro-differential equations which poses a number of theoretical and numerical challenges. This paper increases the understanding of the latter and of the process itself by combining theoretical with numerical investigations. Existence and uniqueness of solutions to a simplified problem are studied based on semigroup theory. For the numerical solution of the problem, a numerical methodology based on a finite volume scheme combined with a time implicit scheme is derived. The impact of the initial cell distribution on the dynamics is studied. The detailed model is compared to a simpler model based on ordinary differential equations. The observed differences for different initial cell distributions and distinct models turn out to be smaller than expected. The outcomes of this paper are specifically relevant for applied mathematicians, winemakers, and process engineers.},

The core of the whole model is the description of the myocardium as a multicompartment poromechanics system. A novel decomposition of the poroelastic Helmholtz potential involved in the poromechanics model allows for a quasi-incompressible model that adequately describes the physical interaction among all components in the porous medium. We further provide a rigorous mathematical analysis that gives guidelines for the choice of the Helmholtz potential. To reduce the computational cost of our integrated model we propose decoupling the deformation of the tissue and systemic circulation from the porous flow in the myocardium and coronary vessels, which allows us to apply the model also in combination with precomputed cardiac displacements, obtained form other models or medical imaging data. We test the methodology through the simulation of a heartbeat in healthy conditions that replicates the systolic impediment phenomenon, which is particularly challenging to capture as it arises from the interaction of several parts of the model.},

The driven source is assumed to be a centered generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field, whose covariance and relation operators are classical pseudodifferential operators. Given the random source, the direct problems are shown to be well-posed in the sense of distributions and the regularity of the solutions are given. For the inverse problems, we demonstrate by ergodicity that the principal symbols of the covariance and relation operators can be uniquely determined by a single realization of the far-field pattern averaged over the frequency band with probability one.},

For this sake we resort to a two phase field model that uses diffuse descriptions of both the membrane and the cortex, which in particular allows for a suitable description of the interaction via linker protein densities. Besides the detailed modeling we discuss some energetic aspects of the models and present a numerical scheme, which allows us to carry out several computational studies. In those we demonstrate that several effects found in experiments can be reproduced, in particular bleb formation by cortex rupture, which was not possible by previous models without the linker dynamics.},

Unlike the majority of existing relevant works, these results apply to kinetic Langevin equations with high-dimensional potentials and nonlinear perturbations. They are obtained based on a higher-order Hamiltonian formalism and perturbation analysis for the Freidlin--Wentzell action functional. This tool allowed us to show that parametric excitation at a resonant frequency can significantly enhance the rate of metastable transitions.

In particular, lower and upper bounds for the entropic function are of great importance. In applied topics, we often deal with situations where the sums of certain powers of probabilities are known. The main question is how to convert the imposed restrictions into two-sided estimates on the Shannon entropy. It is addressed in two different ways. The more intuitive of them is based on truncated expansions of the Taylor type. Another method is based on the use of coefficients of the shifted Chebyshev polynomials. We propose here a family of polynomials for estimating the Shannon entropy from below. As a result, estimates are more uniform in the sense that errors do not become too large in particular points. The presented method is used for deriving uncertainty and certainty relations for positive operator-valued measures assigned to a quantum design. Quantum designs are currently the subject of active researches due to potential use in quantum information science. It is shown that the derived estimates are applicable in quantum tomography and detecting steerability of quantum states.},

This paper focuses on the case that the denominator has a repeated real root and obtains the next results. The positive equilibrium (if exists) is globally stable provided that it is locally stable. If it is a weak focus, it must be of order one and stable. When the positive equilibrium is unstable, the system has always a limit cycle, which could come from a singular Hopf bifurcation, and undergoes two consecutive canard explosions via relaxation oscillations.

Such a setup yields a system of partial differential equations on the network. We study the influence of three geometric network parameters on filter performance: (1) average number of neighbors of each vertex, (2) initial total void volume of the pore network, and (3) tortuosity of the network. We find that total volumetric throughput depends more strongly on the initial void volume than on average number of neighbors. Tortuosity, however, turns out to be a universal parameter, leading to almost perfect collapse of all results for a variety of different network architectures. In particular, the accumulated foulant concentration in the filtrate shows an exponential decay as tortuosity increases.},

In this paper, we propose a susceptible-infective-asymptomatic-recovered patch model to address the influence of asymptomatic infections on the spatial spread of infectious diseases. The multipatch basic reproduction number ${\mathcal{R}}_0$ of the model is defined and shown to be a threshold quantity for disease eradication and persistence. Namely, the disease disappears if ${\mathcal{R}}_0\le1$ whereas it spreads otherwise. The monotonicity of ${\mathcal{R}}_0$ with respect to the dispersal rates of the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations is investigated. In particular, for the two-patch case, ${\mathcal{R}}_0$ is either strictly decreasing or strictly increasing or constant in terms of dispersal rates. However, nonmonotonic dependence can occur with movement between three or more patches. The asymptotic profiles of the endemic equilibrium (when it exists) as one or all dispersal rates approach zero or infinity are studied. Interestingly, an increase in infectious dispersal may decrease ${\mathcal{R}}_0$ but increase the number of nonsusceptible individuals. Analytical and numerical results confirm that ignoring asymptomatic carriers not only significantly underestimates the infection risk but also impairs the efficacy of travel restrictions.},

In this case it follows (from a result of Vodop&#39;yanov, Gol&#39;dshtein, and Reshetnyak) that discontinuous deformations must have infinite energy. After characterizing the rate at which this energy blows up, we introduce a modified energy functional which differs from the original by a null Lagrangian and for which cavitating energy minimizers with finite energy exist. In particular, the Euler--Lagrange equations for the modified energy functional are identical to those for the original problem except for the boundary condition at the inner cavity. This new boundary condition states that a certain modified radial Cauchy stress function has to vanish at the inner cavity. This condition corresponds to the radial Cauchy stress for the original functional diverging to $-\infty$ at the cavity surface. Many previously known variational results for finite energy cavitating solutions now follow for the modified functional, such as the existence of radial energy minimizers, satisfaction of the Euler--Lagrange equations for such minimizers, and the existence of a critical boundary displacement for cavitation. We also discuss a numerical scheme for computing these singular cavitating solutions using regular solutions for punctured balls. We show the convergence of this numerical scheme and give some numerical examples including one for the incompressible limit case. Our approach is motivated in part by the use of the “renormalized energy” for Ginzburg--Landau vortices.},

We consider the stochastic analogue of the vesicle transport model in [Park and Fai, Bull. Math. Biol., 82 (2020), pp. 1--31]. The stochastic version, which may be considered as an agent-based model, relies mostly on the action of individual myosin motors to produce vesicle motion. To aid in our analysis, we coarse-grain this agent-based model using a master equation combined with a partial differential equation describing the probability of local motor positions. We confirm through convergence studies that the coarse-graining captures the essential features of bistability in velocity (observed in experiments) and waiting-time distributions to switch between steady-state velocities. Interestingly, these results allow us to reformulate the translocation problem in terms of the mean first passage time for a run-and-tumble particle moving on a finite domain with absorbing boundaries at the two ends. We conclude by presenting numerical and analytical calculations of vesicle translocation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to study the motions of interfaces and coarsening rates governed by the time-fractional Cahn--Hilliard equation (TFCHE). It is observed by many numerical experiments that the microstructure evolution described by the TFCHE displays quite different dynamical processes compared with the classical Cahn--Hilliard equation, in particular, regarding motions of interfaces and coarsening rates. By using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we first derive the sharp interface limit models. Then we can theoretically analyze the motions of interfaces with respect to different timescales. For instance, for the TFCHE with the constant diffusion mobility, the sharp interface limit model is a fractional Stefan problem at the timescale $t=O(1)$. However, on the timescale $t=O(\varepsilon^{-\frac1\alpha})$, the sharp interface limit model is a fractional Mullins--Sekerka model. Similar asymptotic regime results are also obtained for the case with one-sided degenerated mobility. Moreover, the scaling invariant property of the sharp interface models suggests that the TFCHE with constant mobility preserves an $\alpha/3$ coarsening rate, and a crossover of the coarsening rates from $\frac{\alpha}{3}$ to $\frac\alpha4$ is obtained for the case with one-sided degenerated mobility, in good agreement with the numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {A tractable solution is proposed to a classical problem in kinetic theory, namely, given any set of realizable velocity moments up to order $2n$, a closure for the moment of order $2n+1$ is constructed for which the moment system found from the free-transport term in the one-dimensional (1-D) kinetic equation is globally hyperbolic and in conservative form. In prior work, the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM) was introduced to close this moment system up to fourth order ($n \le 2$). Here, HyQMOM is reformulated and extended to arbitrary even-order moments. The HyQMOM closure is defined based on the properties of the monic orthogonal polynomials $Q_n$ that are uniquely defined by the velocity moments up to order $2n-1$. Thus, HyQMOM is strictly a moment closure and does not rely on the reconstruction of a velocity distribution function with the same moments. On the boundary of moment space, $n$ double roots of the characteristic polynomial $P_{2n+1}$ of the Jacobian matrix of the system are the roots of $Q_n$, while in the interior, $P_{2n+1}$ and $Q_n$ share $n$ roots. The remaining $n+1$ roots of $P_{2n+1}$ bound and separate the roots of $Q_n$. An efficient algorithm, based on the Chebyshev algorithm, for computing the moment of order $2n+1$ from the moments up to order $2n$ is developed. The analytical solution to a 1-D Riemann problem is used to demonstrate convergence of the HyQMOM closure with increasing $n$.},

By means of analysis using similarity-like variables, we also find that the delta-peaked initial condition used in the original analysis leads to an unexpected and easily overlooked restriction on the reaction order, which cannot be greater than 3; the same applies for two-term regular perturbation expansions that are valid for short times, and which we also determine. The full equations are then solved numerically for all times and the solutions are found to agree well with the analytical results that are available for short times.},

In this paper, we provide two new proofs rooted in our investigation of persistence in spatial population dynamics. The first one is an analytic derivation utilizing a graph-theoretic approach based on Kirchhoff&#39;s matrix-tree theorem; the second one employs the Collatz--Wielandt formula from matrix theory and complex analysis arguments. This monotonicity result has numerous applications in persistence and stability analysis of complex biological systems in heterogeneous environments.

  abstract     = {In mathematical models of lithium-ion batteries, the highly heterogeneous porous electrodes are frequently approximated as comprising spherical particles of uniform size, leading to the commonly used single-particle model (SPM) when transport in the electrolyte is assumed to be fast. Here electrode heterogeneity is modeled by extending this to a distribution of particle sizes. Unimodal and bimodal particle-size distributions (PSD) are considered. For a unimodal PSD, the effect of the spread of the distribution on the cell dynamics is investigated, and choice of effective particle radius when approximating by an SPM assessed. Asymptotic techniques are used to derive a correction to the SPM valid for narrow, but realistic, PSDs. In addition, it is shown that the heterogeneous internal states of all particles (relevant when modeling degradation, for example) can be efficiently computed after the fact. For a bimodal PSD, the results are well approximated by a double-particle model (DPM), with one size representing each mode. Results for lithium iron phosphate with a bimodal PSD show that the DPM captures an experimentally observed double plateau in the discharge curve, suggesting it is entirely due to bimodality.},

When two species are identical except for their diffusion rates, our results suggest that the faster diffusing species could be favored for some intermediate range of relaxation time, while the slower diffusing species will be favored for both short and long relaxation time.

Using the abstract theory of nonlinear analytic semiflows, we are able to prove local existence, uniqueness, and continuation of classical Hölder smooth solutions to the governing system of nonlinear parabolic equations. Using the finite volume method, we construct an efficient numerical scheme solving the governing system of nonlinear parabolic equations. Additionally, a nontrivial tangential velocity is considered allowing for redistribution of discretization nodes. We also present several computational studies of the flow combining the normal and binormal velocity and considering nonlocal interactions.},

We focus on three simplified but characteristic examples of increasing complexity to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed ABCs: the propagation in a duct with a longitudinal variation of the speed of sound, the propagation in a nonuniform mean flow using a convected wave operator, and the propagation in a duct with a transverse variation of the speed of sound and density. For each case, we follow the same systematic approach to construct a family of local ABCs and explain their implementation in a high-order finite element context.

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the modeling and numerical simulation of the process of speciation. In particular, given conditions for which one or more speciation events within an ecosystem occur, our aim is to develop the necessary modeling and simulation tools. Care is also taken to establish a solid mathematical foundation on which our modeling framework is built. This is the subject of the first half of the paper. The second half is devoted to developing a multiscale framework for eco-evolutionary modeling, where the relevant scales are that of species and individual/population, respectively. The species level model we employ can be considered as an extension of the classical Lotka--Volterra model, where in addition to the species abundance, the model also governs the evolution of the species mean traits and species trait covariances and in this sense generalizes the purely ecological Lotka--Volterra model to an eco-evolutionary model. Although the model thus allows for evolving species, it does not (by construction) allow for the branching of species, i.e., speciation events. The reason for this is related to that of separate scales; the unit of species is too coarse to capture the fine-scale dynamics of a speciation event. Instead, the branching species should be regarded as a population of individuals moving along a selection of trait axes (i.e., trait-space). For this, we employ a trait-specific population density model governing the dynamics of the population density as a function of evolutionary traits. At this scale there is no a priori definition of species, but both species and speciation may be defined a posteriori as, e.g., local maxima and saddle points of the population density, respectively. Hence, a system of interacting species can be described at the species level, while for branching species a population level description is necessary. Our multiscale framework thus consists of coupling the species and population level models where speciation events are detected in advance and then resolved at the population scale until the branching is complete. Moreover, since the population level model is formulated as a PDE, we first establish the well-posedness in the time-discrete setting and then derive the a posteriori error estimates, which provides a fully computable upper bound on an energy-type error, including also for the case of general smooth distributions (which will be useful for the detection of speciation events). Several numerical tests validate our framework in practice.},

The idea is to not define the electrodes as strict geometric objects on the measurement boundary but only to assume approximate knowledge about their whereabouts and let a boundary admittivity function determine the actual locations of the current inputs. Such an approach enables reconstructing the boundary admittivity, i.e., the locations and strengths of the contacts, at the same time and with analogous methods as the interior admittivity.

However, many interesting phenomena that we would like to model, such as the “honeymoon period” of a disease after the onset of mass vaccination programs, are transient dynamics. Honeymoon periods can last for decades and can be important public health considerations. In many fields of science, especially in ecology, there is growing interest in a systematic study of transient dynamics. In this work, we attempt to provide a technical definition of “long transient dynamics” such as the honeymoon period and explain how these behaviors arise in systems of ordinary differential equations. We define a transient center, a point in state space that causes long transient behaviors, and derive some of its properties. In the end, we define reachable transient centers, which are transient centers that can be reached from initializations that do not need to be near the transient center.},

The model is formulated as a continuous-time Markov chain, whose transition matrix involves multiscale effects; the whole (or part of the) population affects the rates of individual birth, migration, and death events. Using the slow-fast property of the model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the limit model in the framework of stochastic singular perturbations. The derivation of the limit model is based on compactness and coupling arguments. The uniqueness is handled by applying the ergodicity theory and studying a dedicated Poisson equation. The limit model consists of an ordinary differential equation ruling the dynamics of the first (slow) compartment, coupled with a quasi-stationary distribution in the remaining (fast) compartments, which averages the contribution of the fast component of the Markov chain on the slow one. We illustrate numerically the convergence and highlight the relevance of dealing with nonlinear event rates for our application in reproductive biology. The numerical simulations involve a simple integration scheme for the deterministic part, coupled with the nested algorithm to sample the quasi-stationary distribution.},

The main purpose of the work is to study the features of the phytoplankton front propagation in the presence of vortex flow. The vortex flow represents chain of two-dimensional vortices described by the Taylor--Green solution of incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. Different regimes of wave propagation are revealed depending on the intensity of the vortex flow and the model parameters. In particular, the wobbling, zigzag, and jumping regimes are found if the velocity of convective flow is less or comparable, exceeds, and is much greater than the front propagation speed in still media, respectively. The front propagation velocity is characterized by definite types of dependence on the flow intensity in different regimes.},

We provide theoretical justifications based on the factorization of the near field operator in both the symmetric factorization case and the nonsymmetric factorization case. Furthermore, we introduce a data completion algorithm which allows us to apply the modified sampling methods to treat the limited-aperture inverse scattering problems.

Modeling nonlocal interactions between connected vehicles and analyzing their impact on traffic flows become important research questions to traffic planners. This paper considers a particular nonlocal LWR model that has been studied in the literature. The model assumes that vehicle velocities are controlled by the traffic density distribution in a nonlocal spatial neighborhood. By conducting stability analysis of the model, we obtain that, under suitable assumptions on how the nonlocal information is utilized, the nonlocal traffic flow is stable around the uniform equilibrium flow and all traffic waves dissipate exponentially. Meanwhile, improper use of the nonlocal information in the vehicle velocity selection could result in persistent traffic waves. Such results can shed light on the future design of driving algorithms for connected and automated vehicles.},

When two materials are put side by side, the heat that propagates from one material to the other experiences thermal boundary resistance. Mathematically, it is represented by the reflection coefficient of the phonon transport equation on the interface of the two materials. This coefficient takes different values at different phonon frequencies, between different materials. In experiments scientists measure the surface temperature of one material to infer the reflection coefficient as a function of phonon frequency. In this article, we formulate this inverse problem in an optimization framework and apply the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method for finding the optimal solution. We furthermore prove the maximum principle and show the Lipschitz continuity of the Fréchet derivative. These properties allow us to justify the application of SGD in this setup.},

To study the effects of environmental toxicants on population dynamics in polluted rivers, we develop a process-oriented model that describes the interaction between a population and a toxicant in an advective environment. The model consists of two reaction-diffusion-advection equations, one of which governs the dispersal and growth of the population under the influence of toxicants, while the other describes the dispersal, input, as well as decay of the toxicant. We explore the existence and stability of steady states based on the analysis of eigenvalue problems, which yields sufficient conditions that lead to population persistence or extinction. We numerically analyze how the interplay between several factors (toxicant input, flow velocity, the diffusion and advection characteristics of the population and the toxicant) affects the persistence and spatial distribution of the population.},

Force and torque balance equations are obtained exploiting the principle of virtual work, where the first contact point between rods is identified by the Weierstrass--Erdmann condition of variational nature. The chordae tendineae are modeled as a force applied to the free endpoint of the flaps. Different possible boundary conditions are investigated at the mitral annulus, and, by an asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that in the pressure regime of interest generic boundary conditions generate a tensional boundary layer.

  abstract     = {Defects in the atomic structure of crystalline materials may spawn electronic bound states, known as defect states, which decay rapidly away from the defect. Simplified models of defect states typically assume the defect is surrounded on all sides by an infinite perfectly crystalline material. In reality the surrounding structure must be finite, and in certain contexts the structure can be small enough that edge effects are significant. In this work we investigate these edge effects and prove the following result. Suppose that a one-dimensional infinite crystalline material hosting a positive energy defect state is truncated a distance $M$ from the defect. Then, for sufficiently large $M$, there exists a resonance exponentially close (in $M$) to the bound state eigenvalue. It follows that the truncated structure hosts a metastable state with an exponentially long lifetime. Our methods allow both the resonance frequency and associated resonant state to be computed to all orders in $e^{-M}$. We expect this result to be of particular interest in the context of photonic crystals, where defect states are used for wave-guiding and structures are relatively small. Finally, under a mild additional assumption we prove that if the defect state has negative energy, then the truncated structure hosts a bound state with exponentially close energy.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by complex systems in social and industrial contexts, we consider a family of coupled diffusion processes modeling system components and an associated system objective. Each process is inherently noisy, driven by a controllable drift, and fails upon reaching a critical state. Interdependence is captured via the global objective and the governing dynamics (correlated noise, cascading failures). Analytical and numerical calculations reveal that the optimal strategies to steer such systems to maximize the objective are highly coupled, depending strongly on the state of the entire system. Strikingly, they exhibit a rich set of bifurcations, describing qualitatively different strategies throughout the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {Transmission eigenfunctions are certain interior resonant modes that are of central importance to the wave scattering theory. In this paper, we present the discovery of novel global rigidity properties of the transmission eigenfunctions associated with the Maxwell system. It is shown that the transmission eigenfunctions carry the geometrical information of the underlying domain. We present both analytical and numerical results of these intriguing rigidity properties. As an interesting application, we propose an illusion scheme of artificially generating a mirage image of any given optical object.},
