  abstract     = {Several successful partitioning models and methods have been proposed and used for computational load balancing of irregularly sparse applications in a distributed-memory setting. However, the literature lacks partitioning models and methods that encode both computational and data load balancing. In this article, we try to close this gap in the literature by proposing two hypergraph partitioning (HP) models which simultaneously encode computational and data load balancing. Both models utilize a two-constraint formulation, where the first constraint encodes the computational loads and the second constraint encodes the data loads. In the first model, we introduce explicit data vertices for encoding data load and we replicate those data vertices at each recursive bipartitioning (RB) step for encoding data replication. In the second model, we introduce a data weight distribution scheme for encoding data load and we update those weights at each RB step. The nice property of both proposed models is that they do not necessitate developing a new partitioner from scratch. Both models can easily be implemented by invoking any HP tool that supports multiconstraint partitioning as a two-way partitioner at each RB step. The validity of the proposed models are tested on two widely used irregularly sparse applications: parallel mesh simulations and parallel sparse matrix sparse matrix multiplication. Both proposed models achieve significant improvement over a baseline model.},

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network method called SympOCnet that applies the symplectic network to solve high-dimensional optimal control problems with state constraints. We present several numerical results on path planning problems in two- and three-dimensional spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate that our SympOCnet can solve a problem with more than 500 dimensions in 1.5 hours on a single GPU, which shows the effectiveness and efficiency of SympOCnet. The proposed method is scalable and has the potential to solve truly high-dimensional path planning problems in real-time.},

By minimizing a quadratic cost functional, which measures the deviation from periodicity, the controllability method determines iteratively a periodic solution in the time domain. At each conjugate gradient iteration, the gradient of the cost functional is simply computed by running any time-dependent simulation code forward and backward for one period, thus leading to a nonintrusive implementation easily integrated into existing software. Moreover, the proposed algorithm automatically inherits the parallelism, scalability, and low memory footprint of the underlying time-domain solver. Since the time-periodic solution obtained by minimization is not necessarily unique, we apply a cheap postprocessing filtering procedure which recovers the time-harmonic solution from any minimizer. Finally, we present a series of numerical examples which show that our algorithm greatly speeds up the convergence toward the desired time-harmonic solution when compared to simply running the time-marching code until the time-harmonic regime is eventually reached.},

  abstract     = {A new kind of spline geometric method approach is presented. Its main ingredient is the use of well established spline spaces forming a discrete de Rham complex to construct a primal sequence ${X^k_h}^n_{k=0}$, starting from splines of degree $p$, and a dual sequence ${\tilde{X}^k_h}_{k=0}^n$, starting from splines of degree $p-1$. By imposing homogeneous boundary conditions to the spaces of the primal sequence, the two sequences can be isomorphically mapped into one another. Within this setup, many familiar second order partial differential equations can be finally accommodated by explicitly constructing appropriate discrete versions of constitutive relations, called Hodge--star operators. Several alternatives based on both global and local projection operators between spline spaces will be proposed. The appeal of the approach with respect to similar published methods is twofold: first, it exhibits high order convergence. Second, it does not rely on the geometric realization of any (topologically) dual mesh. Several numerical examples in various space dimensions will be employed to validate the central ideas of the proposed approach and compare its features with the standard Galerkin approach in isogeometric analysis.},

  abstract     = {We describe a new approach to derive numerical approximations of boundary conditions for high-order accurate finite-difference approximations. The approach, called the local compatibility boundary condition (LCBC) method, uses boundary conditions and compatibility boundary conditions derived from the governing equations, as well as interior and boundary grid values, to construct a local polynomial, whose degree matches the order of accuracy of the interior scheme, centered at each boundary point. The local polynomial is then used to derive a discrete formula for each ghost point in terms of the data. This approach leads to centered approximations that are generally more accurate and stable than one-sided approximations. Moreover, the stencil approximations are local since they do not couple to neighboring ghost-point values, which can occur with traditional compatibility conditions. The local polynomial is derived using continuous operators and derivatives, which enables the automatic construction of stencil approximations at different orders of accuracy. The LCBC method is developed here for problems governed by second-order partial differential equations, and it is verified in two space dimensions for schemes up to sixth-order accuracy.},

Empirically, we observe that the condition number of the preconditioned system is $O(1)$, independent of the problem size. Our domain decomposition is designed so that we can construct approximate factorizations of the subproblems efficiently.

A novel parameterization of the control functions based on B-splines with carrier waves is introduced. The carrier waves are used to trigger the resonant frequencies in the system Hamiltonian, and the B-spline functions specify their amplitude and phase. This approach allows the number of control parameters to be independent of, and significantly smaller than, the number of time steps for integrating Schrödinger&#39;s equation. We present numerical examples of how the proposed technique can be combined with an interior point limited memory BFGS algorithm for realizing quantum gates and generalize our approach to calculate risk-neutral controls that are resilient to noise in the Hamiltonian model.

In this paper, we propose such a machine learning--like method for pOMT by adapting a new reduced basis (RB) technique specifically designed for nonlinear equations, the reduced residual reduced over-collocation (R2-ROC) approach, to the parameterized Monge--Ampère equation. It builds on top of a narrow-stencil finite difference method (FDM), a so-called truth solver, which we propose in this paper for the Monge--Ampère equation with the transport boundary. Together with the R2-ROC approach, it allows us to handle the strong and unique nonlinearity pertaining to the Monge--Ampère equation achieving online efficiency without resorting to any direct approximation of the nonlinearity. Several challenging numerical tests demonstrate the accuracy and high efficiency of our reduced solver for solving the parameterized Monge--Ampère equation, effectively transporting the nontrivial boundaries.},

Then, for such EPH curves, fundamental characteristics like parametric speed or arc length are discussed to show the interesting analogies with their well-known polynomial counterparts. Differences and advantages with respect to ordinary PH curves become commendable when discussing the solutions to application problems like the interpolation of first-order Hermite data.

Several neural operators have been recently developed. However, all the existing neural operators are only designed to learn operators defined on a single Banach space; i.e., the input of the operator is a single function. Here, for the first time, we study the operator regression via neural networks for multiple-input operators defined on the product of Banach spaces. We first prove a universal approximation theorem of continuous multiple-input operators. We also provide a detailed theoretical analysis including the approximation error, which provides guidance for the design of the network architecture. Based on our theory and a low-rank approximation, we propose a novel neural operator, MIONet, to learn multiple-input operators. MIONet consists of several branch nets for encoding the input functions and a trunk net for encoding the domain of the output function. We demonstrate that MIONet can learn solution operators involving systems governed by ordinary and partial differential equations. In our computational examples, we also show that we can endow MIONet with prior knowledge of the underlying system, such as linearity and periodicity, to further improve accuracy.},

Convergence in function values is proved for both algorithms, with convergence rates depending on problem/space smoothness. To show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling, some numerical tests highlighting the flexibility of the space $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$ are shown for exemplar deconvolution and mixed noise removal problems.

This paper introduces a new family of linearly implicit multistep methods (Limm), which only requires the solution of one linear system per timestep. Order conditions and stability theory for these methods are presented, as well as design and implementation considerations. Practical methods of order up to five are developed that have similar error coefficients, but improved stability regions, when compared to the widely used BDF methods. Numerical testing of a self-starting variable stepsize and variable order implementation of the new Limm methods shows measurable performance improvement over a similar BDF implementation.},

  abstract     = {We present the derivation, implementation, and analysis of a multiresolution adaptive grid framework for numerical simulations on octree-based three-dimensional block-structured collocated grids with distributed computational architectures. Our approach provides a consistent handling of nonlifted and lifted interpolating wavelets of arbitrary order demonstrated using second-, fourth-, and sixth-order wavelets, combined with standard finite-difference-based discretization operators. We first validate that the wavelet family used provides strict and explicit error control when coarsening the grid, and show that lifting wavelets increase the grid compression rate while conserving discrete moments across levels. Further, we demonstrate that high-order PDE discretization schemes combined with sufficiently high-order wavelets retain the expected convergence order even at resolution jumps. We then simulate the advection of a scalar to analyze convergence for the temporal evolution of a PDE. The results shows that our wavelet-based refinement criterion is successful at controlling the overall error while the coarsening criterion is effective at retaining the relevant information on a compressed grid. Our software exploits a block-structured grid data structure for efficient multilevel operations, combined with a parallelization strategy that relies on a one-sided MPI-RMA communication approach with active post-start-complete-wait synchronization. Using performance tests up to 16,384 cores, we demonstrate that this leads to a highly scalable performance.

Efficient boundary element methods (BEMs), such as the fast multipole method and $\mathcal{H}\text{-matrix}$ based methods, focus on structured low-rank approximations of subblocks in these systems. It is known that the (numerical) ranks of these subblocks increase linearly with the wavenumber. We explore a data-sparse representation of BEM matrices valid for a range of frequencies, based on extracting the known phase of the Green&#39;s function. Algebraically, this leads to a Hadamard product of a frequency matrix and an $\mathcal{H}\text{-matrix}$. We show that the frequency dependence of this $\mathcal{H}\text{-matrix}$ can be determined using a small number of frequency samples, even for geometrically complex three-dimensional scattering obstacles. We describe an efficient construction of the representation by combining adaptive cross approximation with adaptive rational approximation in the continuous frequency dimension. We show that our data-sparse representation allows one to efficiently sample the full BEM matrix at any given frequency, and as such it may be useful as part of an efficient sweeping routine.},

As is well known the problem is not always uniquely solvable due to the existence of guided modes. The limiting absorption principle is a standard way to get the unique physical solution. Both methods are based on the Floquet--Bloch transform which transforms the original problem to an equivalent family of cell problems. The first method, which is designed based on a complex contour integral of the inverse Floquet--Bloch transform, is called the complex contour integral method. The second method, which comes from an explicit definition of the radiation condition, is called the decomposition method. Due to the local perturbation, the family of cell problems is coupled with respect to the Floquet parameter, and the computational complexity becomes much larger. To this end, high order methods to discretize the complex contours are developed to have better performances. Finally we give the convergence results which we confirm with numerical examples.},

The proposed formulation is locally conservative. A mixed-type DG method in conjunction with the stress-velocity formulation is employed for the Stokes equations, where the symmetry of stress is strongly imposed. The staggered DG method is exploited to discretize the Darcy equations. As such, the discrete formulation can be easily adapted to account for the Beavers--Joseph--Saffman interface conditions without introducing additional variables. Importantly, the continuity of normal velocity is satisfied exactly at the discrete level. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for all the variables. Then we devise and analyze a domain decomposition method via the use of Robin-type interface boundary conditions, which allows us to solve the Stokes subproblem and the Darcy subproblem sequentially with low computational costs. The convergence of the proposed iterative method is analyzed rigorously. In particular, the proposed iterative method also works for very small viscosity coefficient. Finally, several numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the capabilities and accuracy of the novel mixed-type scheme, and the convergence of the domain decomposition method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a parallel probabilistic method using the Feynman--Kac formula of killed Brownian motions is proposed to solve the mixed boundary value problems (BVPs) of 3D Laplace equations. To avoid using reflecting Brownian motions and the calculation of their local time $L(t)$ in the Feynman--Kac representation of solutions for Neumann and Robin BVPs, the proposed method uses an iterative approach to approximate the solutions where each iteration will use the Feynman--Kac formula to solve a pure Dirichlet problem, thus only involving killed Brownian motions. First, the boundary of the domain is decomposed with overlapping local patches formed by the intersection of hemispheres superimposed on the domain boundary. The iteration starts with an arbitrary initial guess for the Dirichlet data on the Neumann and Robin boundaries; then, using the Feynman--Kac formula for a pure Dirichlet problem with the current available Dirichlet data on the whole boundary, the solution over the hemispheres can be obtained by the Feynman--Kac formula for the killed Brownian motions, sampled by a walk-on-spheres (WOS) algorithm. Second, by solving a local boundary integral equation (BIE) over each hemisphere and a local patch on the domain boundary, the Dirichlet data on the Neumann and Robin boundaries can be updated. By continuing this process, the proposed hybrid probabilistic and deterministic BIE-WOS method gives a highly parallel algorithm for the global solution of any mixed-type BVPs of the Laplace equations. Numerical results of various mixed interior and exterior BVPs demonstrate the parallel efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

The main advantage over the strong stability preserving (SSP) paradigm is more flexibility in the choice of the ERK scheme, thus allowing for less stringent restrictions on the time step.

The DG method can be designed with arbitrary order of accuracy and offers many advantages including easy adaptivity, compact stencils, and the ability of handling complicated boundary conditions and interfaces. We propose to carefully design the numerical fluxes of the DG methods to build the behavior of a classical particle at the potential barrier into the numerical scheme, which ensures the continuity of the Hamiltonian across the potential barrier and the correct transmission and reflection condition. Our scheme is proved to be positive and stable in $L^1$ norm if the positivity-preserving limiter is applied.

Both have weak order one of accuracy, but work properly only in specific regimes depending on the size of the parameter $\varepsilon$. We propose in this paper a new consistent method with an accuracy independent of $\varepsilon$ for solving penalized dynamics on a manifold of any dimension. Moreover, this method converges to the constrained Euler scheme when $\varepsilon$ goes to zero. The numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings, in the context of weak convergence and for the invariant measure, on a torus and on the orthogonal group in high dimension and high codimension.},

  abstract     = {Our aim is the development and analysis of the numerical schemes for approximately solving the backward diffusion-wave problem, which involves a fractional derivative in time with order $\alpha\in(1,2)$. From terminal observations at two time levels, i.e., $u(T_1)$ and $u(T_2)$, we simultaneously recover two initial data $u(0)$ and $u_t(0)$ and hence the solution $u(t)$ for all $t &gt; 0$. First, existence, uniqueness, and Lipschitz stability of the backward diffusion-wave problem were established under some conditions about $T_1$ and $T_2$. Moreover, for noisy data, we propose a quasi-boundary value scheme to regularize the “mildly&quot; ill-posed problem, and show the convergence of the regularized solution. Next, to numerically solve the regularized problem, a fully discrete scheme is proposed by applying the finite element method in space and convolution quadrature in time. We establish error bounds of discrete solutions in both cases of smooth and nonsmooth data. Those estimates are very useful in practice since they indicate the ways to choose discretization parameters and regularization parameter, according to the noise level. Intensive numerical experiments show the accuracy of the numerical scheme and support our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become a popular choice for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their excellent approximation power and generalization ability. Recently, extended PINNs (XPINNs) based on domain decomposition methods have attracted considerable attention due to their effectiveness in modeling multiscale and multiphysics problems and their parallelization. However, theoretical understanding of their convergence and generalization properties remains unexplored. In this study, we take an initial step towards understanding how and when XPINNs outperform PINNs. Specifically, for general multilayer PINNs and XPINNs, we first provide a prior generalization bound via the complexity of the target functions in the PDE problem and a posterior generalization bound via the posterior matrix norms of the networks after optimization. Moreover, based on our bounds, we analyze the conditions under which XPINNs improve generalization. Concretely, our theory shows that the key building block of XPINN, namely, the domain decomposition, introduces a tradeoff for generalization. On the one hand, XPINNs decompose the complex PDE solution into several simple parts, which decreases the complexity needed to learn each part and boosts generalization. On the other hand, decomposition leads to less training data being available in each subdomain, and hence such a model is typically prone to overfitting and may become less generalizable. Empirically, we choose five PDEs to show when XPINNs perform better than, similar to, or worse than PINNs, hence demonstrating and justifying our new theory.},

Different from deep least-squares methods that deal with time and space variables simultaneously, we propose a deep adaptive basis Galerkin (DABG) method which employs the spectral-Galerkin method for time variable by a tensor-product basis for oscillatory solutions and the deep neural network method for high-dimensional space variables. The proposed method can lead to a linear system of differential equations having unknown DNNs that can be trained via the loss function. We establish a posteriori estimates of the solution error which is bounded by the minimal loss function and the term $O(N^{-m})$, where $N$ is the number of basis functions and $m$ characterizes the regularity of the equation, and show that if the true solution is a Barron-type function, the error bound converges to zero as $M=O(N^p)$ approaches to infinity where $M$ is the width of the used networks and $p$ is a positive constant. Numerical examples, including high-dimensional linear parabolic and hyperbolic equations, and a nonlinear Allen--Cahn equation are presented to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed DABG method is better than that of existing DNNs.},

In order to preserve the isobaric steady state, we introduce a provable positivity-preserving parameter, which is one of the main contributions of the current scheme. For preserving the moving-water steady states, we reconstruct the discharge and energy variables instead of the conservative variables. We also need to redefine the discretization of the source term for the moving-water equilibrium. Riemann problems with a step of the Ripa system are also particularly challenging for most numerical schemes. One reason is that the bed slope source term may become a singular measure at cell boundaries. We use the SR method to define local Riemann states, which are used to compute the numerical flux across the cell interface and discretize the source term of the Ripa system. The current scheme can preserve the still-water and moving-water steady states and guarantee the positivity of the water depth and the temperature. The current scheme easily extends to a two-dimensional Ripa system. Several numerical experiments of the Ripa system confirm that the current scheme is robust and effective. Especially, we show numerical results associated with four Riemann problems with a step. The SR scheme produced superior results to the hydrostatic reconstruction scheme.},

Vogel, et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), PP. A1358--A1382]. Some stability risks in the original algorithm are analyzed, including potential exponential norm growth, cancellations, loss of accuracy with clustered eigenvalues or intermediate eigenvalues, etc. In the dividing stage, we give a new structured low-rank updating strategy with balancing that eliminates the exponential norm growth and also minimizes the ranks of low-rank updates. In the conquering stage with low-rank updated eigenvalue solution, the original algorithm directly uses the standard fast multipole method (FMM) to accelerate function evaluations, which has the risks of cancellation, division by zero, and slow convergence. Here, we design a triangular FMM to avoid cancellation. Furthermore, when there are clustered intermediate eigenvalues, we design a novel local shifting strategy to integrate FMM accelerations into the solution of shifted secular equations. This helps achieve both the efficiency and the reliability. We also provide a deflation strategy with a user-supplied tolerance and give a precise description of the structure of the resulting eigenvector matrix. The SuperDC eigensolver has significantly improved stability while keeping the nearly linear complexity for finding the entire eigenvalue decomposition. Extensive numerical tests are used to show the efficiency and accuracy of SuperDC.},

  abstract     = {Surface reconstruction from a set of scattered points, or a point cloud, has many applications ranging from computer graphics to remote sensing. We present a new method for this task that produces an implicit surface (zero-level set) approximation for an oriented point cloud using only information about (approximate) normals to the surface. The technique exploits the fundamental result from vector calculus that the normals to an implicit surface are curl-free. By using curl-free radial basis function (RBF) interpolation of the normals, we can extract a potential for the vector field whose zero-level surface approximates the point cloud. We use curl-free RBFs based on polyharmonic splines for this task, since they are free of any shape or support parameters. To make this technique efficient and able to better represent local sharp features, we combine it with a partition of unity method. The result is the curl-free partition of unity (CFPU) method. We show how CFPU can be adapted to enforce exact interpolation of a point cloud and can be regularized to handle noise in both the normals and the point positions. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate how the method converges for a known surface as the sampling density increases, how regularization handles noisy data, and how the method performs on various problems found in the literature.},

Math., 66 (1993), pp. 493--515]. However, for very high polynomial degree it is not feasible to assemble or factorize the matrices for each patch. In this work we introduce a direct solver for separable patch problems that scales to very high polynomial degree on tensor product cells. The solver constructs a tensor product basis that diagonalizes the blocks in the stiffness matrix for the internal degrees of freedom of each individual cell. As a result, the nonzero structure of the cell matrices is that of the graph connecting internal degrees of freedom to their projection onto the facets. In the new basis, the patch problem is as sparse as a low-order finite difference discretization, while having a sparser Cholesky factorization. We can thus afford to assemble and factorize the matrices for the vertex-patch problems, even for very high polynomial degree. In the nonseparable case, the method can be applied as a preconditioner by approximating the problem with a separable surrogate. We demonstrate the approach by solving the Poisson equation and a $H(\mathrm{div})$-conforming interior penalty discretization of linear elasticity in three dimensions at $p = 15$.},

  abstract     = {Fourier transforms are an often necessary component in many computational tasks and can be computed efficiently through the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. However, many applications involve an underlying continuous signal, and a more natural choice would be to work with, e.g., the Fourier series (FS) coefficients in order to avoid the additional overhead of translating between the analog and discrete domains. Unfortunately, there exists very little literature and tools for the manipulation of FS coefficients from discrete samples. This paper introduces a Python library called pyFFS for efficient FS coefficient computation, convolution, and interpolation. While the libraries SciPy and NumPy provide efficient routines for discrete Fourier transform coefficients via the FFT algorithm, pyFFS addresses the computation of FS coefficients through what we call the fast Fourier series (FFS). Moreover, pyFFS includes an FS interpolation method based on the chirp Z-transform that can make it more than an order of magnitude faster than the SciPy equivalent when one wishes to perform distortionless bandlimited interpolation. Graphics processing unit (GPU) support through CuPy is readily available and allows for further acceleration: an order of magnitude faster for computing the 2-D FS coefficients of 1000 $\times$ 1000 samples and nearly two orders of magnitude faster for 2-D interpolation. As an application, we discuss the use of pyFFS in Fourier optics. pyFFS is available as an open source package at https://github.com/imagingofthings/pyFFS, with documentation at https://pyffs.readthedocs.io.},

  abstract     = {There are several factorizations of multidimensional tensors into lower-dimensional components, known as “tensor networks.” We consider the popular “tensor-train” (TT) format and ask, How efficiently can we compute a low-rank approximation from a full tensor on current multicore CPUs? Compared to sparse and dense linear algebra, kernel libraries for multilinear algebra are rare and typically not as well optimized. Linear algebra libraries like BLAS and LAPACK may provide the required operations in principle but often at the cost of additional data movements for rearranging memory layouts. Furthermore, these libraries are typically optimized for the compute-bound case (e.g., square matrix operations), whereas low-rank tensor decompositions lead to memory bandwidth limited operations. We propose a “TT singular value decomposition” (TT-SVD) algorithm based on two building blocks: a “Q-less tall-skinny QR” factorization and a fused tall-skinny matrix-matrix multiplication and reshape operation. We analyze the performance of the resulting TT-SVD algorithm using the roofline performance model. In addition, we present performance results for different algorithmic variants for shared-memory as well as distributed-memory architectures. Our experiments show that commonly used TT-SVD implementations suffer severe performance penalties. We conclude that a dedicated library for tensor factorization kernels would benefit the community: Computing a low-rank approximation can be as cheap as reading the data twice from main memory. As a consequence, an implementation that achieves realistic performance will move the limit at which one has to resort to randomized methods that only process part of the data.},

  abstract     = {Probing is a general technique that is used to reduce the variance of the Hutchinson stochastic estimator for the trace of the inverse of a large, sparse matrix $A$. The variance of the estimator is the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal elements of $A^{-1}$. Therefore, this technique computes probing vectors that when used in the estimator annihilate the largest off-diagonal elements. For matrices that display decay of the magnitude of $|A^{-1}_{ij}|$ with the graph distance between nodes $i$ and $j$, this is achieved through graph coloring of increasing powers $A^k$. Equivalently, when a matrix stems from a lattice discretization, it is computationally beneficial to find a distance-$k$ coloring of the lattice. Previously, a hierarchical coloring was proposed so that $k$ can be increased at runtime as needed without discarding previous work. In this work, we study probing for the more general problem of computing the trace of a permutation of $A^{-1}$, say $PA^{-1}$. The motivation comes from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where we need to construct “disconnected diagrams” to extract flavor-separated generalized parton functions. In lattice QCD, where the matrix has a four-dimensional toroidal lattice structure, these nonlocal operators correspond to a $PA^{-1}$, where $P$ is the permutation relating to some displacement $\vec{p}$ in one or more dimensions. We focus on a single dimension displacement ($p$), but our methods are general. We show that probing on $A^k$ or $(PA)^k$ does not annihilate the largest magnitude elements. To resolve this issue, our displacement-based probing works on $PA^k$ using a new coloring scheme that works directly on appropriately displaced neighborhoods on the lattice. We prove lower bounds on the number of colors needed and study the effect of this scheme on variance reduction, both theoretically and experimentally on a real-world lattice QCD calculation. We achieve orders of magnitude speedup over the unprobed or the naively probed methods.},

The scheme ensures exactly divergence-free approximations of both the velocity and the magnetic field up to solver tolerances.

To further enhance the computational efficiency of the implicit UGKS (IUGKS) [Y. Zhu, C. Zhong, and K. Xu, J. Comput. Phys., 315 (2016), pp. 16--38] for the steady-state solution, a two-step IUGKS is proposed in this paper. The multiscale solution of the UGKS is determined by the integral solution of the kinetic model equation, which is composed of the Lagrangian integration of the equilibrium and the free particle transport of the nonequilibrium state. With the implicit evaluation of the macroscopic variables in the first iterative step, the integration of the equilibrium can be directly used in the flux calculation of macroscopic flow variables in the second iterative step. This is equivalent to including the viscous flux in the implicit scheme to accelerate the convergence of the solution instead of using the Euler flux in the iterative process of the original IUGKS. In the present IUGKS, the update of macroscopic flow variables is closely coupled with the implicit evolution of the gas distribution function. At the same time, to get a more accurate physical solution the full Boltzmann collision term has been incorporated into the current scheme through the penalty method. Different iterative techniques, such as lower-upper symmetric Gauss--Seidel and multigrid, are used for solving the linear algebraic system of coupled macroscopic and microscopic equations. The efficiency of the current IUGKS has reached an outstanding level among all implicit schemes for the kinetic equations in the literature. Several numerical examples are used to validate the performance of the IUGKS. Accurate solutions have been obtained efficiently in all cases from rarefied to continuum regimes and from low to hypersonic speed.},

To develop efficient numerical methods for such a problem, on the basis of the existing model, we, for the first time, propose an alternative formulation by introducing a free energy accounting for rock compressibility and by using chemical potential gradient instead of pressure gradient as the primary driving force. This formulation has a distinct feature that it is proved to satisfy an energy dissipation law. We further propose an efficient energy stable time discrete scheme using the improved energy factorization approach to tackle the Helmholtz free energy density determined by the Peng--Robinson equation of state. The discrete pressure is taken carefully using the discrete chemical potential and free energy such that the discrete energy dissipation law can be preserved. The fully discrete scheme is constructed based on the cell-centered finite difference method with the upwind strategy, which features full mass conservation and positivity preservation of molar density under proper conditions. Numerical results are also provided to show the performance of the proposed scheme and validate theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the reduced order model (ROM) has been applied to reduce the computational cost of numerical methods. Merging this approach with the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as a powerful mesoscale fluid solver seems promising. Dealing with this idea requires a matrix form for the LBM. This matrix form must represent all the LBM&#39;s algorithm steps (including boundary condition implementation) to just one specific matrix-vector relation. Furthermore, the LBM contains some nonlinear parts inside the equilibrium distribution function (EDF), which must be treated with a nonlinear ROM like the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). So, in this paper, we discuss proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-ROM LBM in the general form, present an appropriate matrix form for the LBM as explained, and implement POD or DEIM on that matrix form. In the end, the ability of this scheme is challenged with solving the urban air pollutant transition problem over some canyons areas as a practical problem.},

  abstract     = {In anisotropic media, the standard perfectly matched layer (PML) technique suffers irrevocable instability in terminating the unbounded problem domains. It remains an open question whether a stable PML-like absorbing boundary condition exists. For wave scattering in a layered orthotropic medium, this question is affirmatively answered for the first time in this paper. In each orthotropic medium, the permittivity tensor uniquely determines a change of coordinates that transforms the governing anisotropic Helmholtz equation into an isotropic Helmholtz equation in the new coordinate system. This leads us to propose a novel Sommerfeld radiation condition (SRC) to rigorously characterize outgoing waves in the layered orthotropic medium. Naturally, the SRC motivates a regionalized PML (RPML) to truncate the scattering problem, in the sense that a standard PML is set up in the new coordinate system in each orthotropic region. It is revealed that the RPML is unconditionally stable compared with the unstable uniaxial PML. A high-accuracy boundary integral equation (BIE) method is developed to solve the resulting boundary value problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the stability of the RPML and the accuracy of the BIE method, showing exponentially decaying truncation errors as the RPML parameters increase.},

In the positive definite case we can solve the linear algebraic systems iteratively by Krylov subspace methods based on efficient three-term recurrences. We illustrate the performance of these iterative methods on several examples. The semidefinite case can be challenging and requires additional techniques to deal with the “singular part,” while the “positive definite part” can still be treated with the three-term recurrence methods.},

When data matrices are symmetric, a short-term recurrence can be used to generate an associated orthonormal basis.

We propose an implementation that allows one to obtain the rational subspace reduced matrices at lower overall computational costs than proposed in the literature by also conveniently combining the two system solves. Several applications are discussed where the short-term recurrence feature can be exploited to avoid storing the whole orthonormal basis.

This approach is prevalent in many critical fields such as battery design, numerical weather prediction, geosciences, and environmental and urban studies. State-of-the-art computational methods for experimental design, however, do not accommodate correlation structure in observational errors produced by many expensive-to-operate devices such as X-ray machines or radar and satellite retrievals. Discarding evident data correlations leads to biased results, poor data collection decisions, and waste of valuable resources. We present a general formulation of the OED formalism for model-constrained large-scale Bayesian linear inverse problems, where measurement errors are generally correlated. The proposed approach utilizes the Hadamard product of matrices to formulate the weighted likelihood and is valid for both finite- and infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out for empirical verification of the proposed approach by using an advection-diffusion model, where the objective is to optimally place a small set of sensors, under a limited budget, to predict the concentration of a contaminant in a closed and bounded domain.},

For weighted Sobolev spaces, we use the same approach but with the rank-1 lattice rules replaced by high-order polynomial lattice rules. A major advantage over the existing approaches is that we do not need to construct good generating vectors by a computer search algorithm, while our median QMC rule achieves almost the optimal worst-case error rate for the respective function space with any smoothness and weights, with a probability that converges to 1 exponentially fast as $r$ increases.

  abstract     = {Multigrid solvers for semistructured meshes are developed. Such semistructured meshes provide flexibility to address complex computational domains while still allowing most multigrid calculations to be accomplished using efficient structured grid ideas and kernels. The considered meshes center around the concept of block structured grids, i.e., a union of fully structured mesh blocks, or region structured grids, where some of the mesh blocks are allowed to be unstructured to enhance meshing flexibility. In both cases, meshes conform at the block or region interfaces. Overall, we aim to develop a multigrid framework for region structured grids that can easily be adopted by application codes without invasive changes to the existing code base. In particular, we target existing application codes that have been developed and optimized for unstructured meshes. To this end, the paper first proposes a formal mathematical framework for describing the semistructured solver. Then, this formalism allows us to precisely define the associated multigrid method and to show its relationship to a more traditional multigrid solver. Additionally, the mathematical framework clarifies the associated software design and implementation. Numerical experiments highlight the relationship of the new solver with classical multigrid. We also demonstrate the generality and potential performance gains associated with this type of semistructured multigrid as well as showcase its application to hypersonic flow problems and for meshes with structured/unstructured mesh interfaces.},

This approach is based on the scalar auxiliary variable method. The equation is reformulated into an equivalent system by introducing a scalar auxiliary variable, and the energy is reformulated into a sum of two quadratic terms. Therefore, the quadratic preserving Runge--Kutta method will preserve all the three invariants (momentum, mass, and the reformulated energy) in the discrete time flow (assuming the spatial variable is continuous). With the Fourier pseudospectral spatial discretization, the scheme conserves the first and third invariant quantities (momentum and energy) exactly in the space-time full discrete sense. The discrete mass possesses the precision of the spectral accuracy. Our numerical experiment shows the great efficiency of this scheme in simulating the breathers for the modified KdV equation.},

Due to their possessing vanishing moments, wavelets offer efficient compression strategies that lead to O($N$)-algorithms for the forward equation, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom. While wavelet schemes have been used very succesfully in the context of boundary element methods, their potential for the simulation of forward problems on domains involving nonlocal operators has yet to be fully exploited. These computational advantages carry over to the solution of the class of control problems under consideration. The latter are equivalent to a coupled system of nonsmooth operator equations with nonlocal operators.},

  abstract     = {Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) stand out for their simplicity and computational efficiency while offering the possibility of simulating complex phenomena. While they are optimal for Cartesian meshes, adapted meshes have traditionally been a stumbling block since it is difficult to predict the right physics through various levels of meshes. In this work, we design a class of fully adaptive LBM methods with dynamic mesh adaptation and error control relying on multiresolution analysis. This wavelet-based approach allows us to adapt the mesh based on the regularity of the solution and leads to a very efficient compression of the solution without loosing its quality and with the preservation of the properties of the original LBM method on the finest grid. This yields a general approach for a large spectrum of schemes and allows precise error bounds, without the need for deep modifications on the reference scheme. An error analysis is proposed. For the purpose of validating this error analysis, we conduct a series of test cases for various schemes and scalar and systems of conservation laws, where solutions with shocks are to be found and local mesh adaptation is especially relevant. Theoretical estimates are retrieved while a reduced memory footprint is observed. It paves the way to an implementation in a multidimensional framework and high computational efficiency of the method for both parabolic and hyperbolic equations, which is the subject of a companion paper.},

  abstract     = {Domain decomposition (DD) methods are widely used as preconditioner techniques. Their effectiveness relies on the choice of a locally constructed coarse space. Thus far, this construction was mostly achieved using nonassembled matrices from discretized partial differential equations (PDEs). Therefore, DD methods were mainly successful when solving systems stemming from PDEs. In this paper, we present a fully algebraic multilevel DD method where the coarse space can be constructed locally and efficiently without any information besides the coefficient matrix. The condition number of the preconditioned matrix can be bounded by a user-prescribed number. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner on a range of problems arising from different applications.},

  abstract     = {The equation-free approach to efficient multiscale numerical computation marries trusted micro-scale simulations to a framework for numerical macro-scale reduction---the patch dynamics scheme. A recent novel patch scheme empowered the equation-free approach to simulate systems containing shocks on the macro-scale. However, the scheme did not predict the formation of shocks accurately, and it could not simulate moving shocks. This article resolves both issues, as a first step in one spatial dimension, by embedding the equation-free, shock-resolving patch scheme within a classic framework for adaptive moving meshes. Our canonical micro-scale problems exhibit heterogeneous nonlinear advection and heterogeneous diffusion. We demonstrate many remarkable benefits from the moving patch scheme, including efficient and accurate macro-scale prediction despite the unknown macro-scale closure. Equation-free methods are here extended to simulate moving, forming, and merging shocks without a priori knowledge of the existence or closure of the shocks. Whereas adaptive moving mesh equations are typically stiff, typically requiring small time-steps on the macro-scale, the moving macro-scale mesh of patches is typically not stiff given the context of the micro-scale time-steps required for the subpatch dynamics.},

However such a Monte Carlo sampling suffers from the fact that the accuracy depends quadratically on the samples used, thus making higher precision estimation very costly. In this paper, we suggest and investigate a multilevel Monte Carlo approach which uses a multigrid hierarchy to stochastically estimate the trace. This results in a substantial reduction of the variance, so that higher precision can be obtained with much less effort. We illustrate this for the trace of the inverse using three different classes of matrices.},

  abstract     = {When adopting high-order finite volume schemes based on MUSCL reconstruction techniques to approximate the weak solutions of hyperbolic systems with source terms, the preservation of the steady states turns out to be very challenging. Indeed, the designed reconstruction must preserve the steady states under consideration in order to get the required well-balancedness property. A priori, to capture such a steady state, one needs to solve some strongly nonlinear equations. Here, we design a very easy correction to high-order finite volume methods. This correction can be applied to any scheme of order greater than or equal to 2, such as a MUSCL-type scheme, and ensures that this scheme exactly preserves the steady solutions. In contrast to usual techniques, our scheme avoids the inversion of the nonlinear function that governs the steady solutions. Moreover, for underdetermined steady solutions, several nonlinear functions must be considered simultaneously. Since the derived correction only considers the evaluation of the governing nonlinear functions, we are able to deal with underdetermined stationary systems. Several numerical experiments illustrate the relevance of the proposed well-balanced correction, as well as its main limitation, namely the fact that it may fail at being both well-balanced and more than second-order accurate for a specific class of initial conditions.},

First, a modified boundary shape gradient formula for shape optimization problems governed by elliptic Dirichlet problems was proposed recently based on the discrete variational outward normal derivatives. The advantages of this new formula over the previous one lie in the improved numerical accuracy and the continuity along the boundary. In the current paper we generalize this new formula to other shape optimization problems including the Laplace and Stokes eigenvalue optimization problems, the shape optimization of Stokes or Navier--Stokes flows, and the interface identification problems. We verify this new formula&#39;s numerical accuracy in different shape optimization problems and investigate its performance in several popular shape optimization algorithms. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a continuous discrete shape gradients of boundary type for Neumann problems, by using the ideas of gradient recovery techniques. The continuity property of the discrete boundary shape gradient is helpful in certain shape optimization algorithms and provides certain flexibility compared to the previous discontinuous ones, which are extensively discussed in the current paper.},

We develop a new error analysis and use it for the construction of stopping criteria, one for each form. Our criterion for split forms adds weights chosen relative to the importance of each scalar function, leading to the weighted adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) algorithm, a variant of the set-valued AAA algorithm that can guarantee to return a rational approximant with a user-chosen accuracy. We propose two-phase approaches for black box matrix-valued functions that construct a surrogate AAA approximation in phase one and refine it in phase two, leading to the surrogate AAA algorithm with exact search and the surrogate AAA algorithm with cyclic Leja--Bagby refinement. The stopping criterion for black box matrix-valued functions is updated at each step of phase two to include information from the previous step. When convergence occurs, our two-phase approaches return rational approximants with a user-chosen accuracy.

The transfer function typically exhibits a large norm at and near the imaginary parts of the dominant poles. Consequently, the dominant poles provide information about the points on the imaginary axis where the ${\mathcal L}_\infty$ norm of the system is attained, and they are also sometimes useful to obtain crude reduced order models. For a large-scale descriptor system, we introduce a subspace framework to estimate a prescribed number of dominant poles. At every iteration, the large-scale system is projected into a small system, whose dominant poles can be computed at ease. Then the projection spaces are expanded so that the projected system after subspace expansion Hermite interpolates the large-scale system at the computed dominant poles. We prove an at-least-quadratic-convergence result for the framework, and provide numerical results confirming this. On real benchmark examples, the proposed frameworks appears to be more reliable than SAMDP in Rommes and Martins [IEEE Trans.

But in this method we have to solve all the time steps in one shot (i.e., all-at-once), which results in a large-scale nonsymmetric dense system that is expensive to handle. In this paper, we propose and analyze a parallel-in-time preconditioner for such a dense system arising from both the parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. The proposed preconditioner is a low-rank perturbation of the original matrix and it has two advantages. First, we show that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned system are highly clustered with some uniform bounds which are independent of the mesh parameters. Second, the preconditioner can be computed in parallel for all the sinc time points via a block diagonalization procedure. Such a parallel potentials owing to the fact that the eigenvector matrix of the diagonalization is well conditioned. In particular, we show that the condition number of the eigenvector matrix only mildly grows as the number of sinc time points increases, and thus the roundoff error arising from the diagonalization procedure is controllable. The effectiveness of our proposed parallel-in-time preconditioners is verified by the observed mesh-independent convergence rates of the preconditioned GMRES in several numerical examples.},

For any positive initial vector, the proposed method is globally convergent and the convergence rate is quadratic. More specifically, NNI produces a bounded increasing sequence approximating an eigenvalue of NAEP and a positive vector sequence approximating the corresponding positive eigenvector. Finally, a number of numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of NNI for nonlinear-focusing Schrödinger equations, logarithmic Schrödinger equations, and modified Gross--Pitaevskii equations.

Numerical results show very good performance even for high degrees of the underlying B-splines, and fast convergence has been found for $p \leq 7$ using no more than $2(p^2+p-1)$ global (primal) variables per subdomain, where $p$ is the degree of the B-splines.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown their success as high-dimensional function approximators in many applications; however, training DNNs can be challenging in general. DNN training is commonly phrased as a stochastic optimization problem whose challenges include nonconvexity, nonsmoothness, insufficient regularization, and complicated data distributions. Hence, the performance of DNNs on a given task depends crucially on tuning hyperparameters, especially learning rates and regularization parameters. In the absence of theoretical guidelines or prior experience on similar tasks, this requires solving a series of repeated training problems which can be time-consuming and demanding on computational resources. This can limit the applicability of DNNs to problems with nonstandard, complex, and scarce datasets, e.g., those arising in many scientific applications. To remedy the challenges of DNN training, we propose \tt slimTrain, a stochastic optimization method for training DNNs with reduced sensitivity to the choice of hyperparameters and fast initial convergence. The central idea of slimTrain is to exploit the separability inherent in many DNN architectures; that is, we separate the DNN into a nonlinear feature extractor followed by a linear model. This separability allows us to leverage recent advances made for solving large-scale, linear, ill-posed inverse problems. Crucially, for the linear weights, \tt slimTrain does not require a learning rate and automatically adapts the regularization parameter. In our numerical experiments using function approximation tasks arising in surrogate modeling and dimensionality reduction, slimTrain outperforms existing DNN training methods with the recommended hyperparameter settings and reduces the sensitivity of DNN training to the remaining hyperparameters. Since our method operates on mini-batches, its computational overhead per iteration is modest and savings can be realized by reducing the number of iterations (due to quicker initial convergence) or the number of training problems that need to be solved to identify effective hyperparameters.},

While this can be easily performed when no error is present within the function evaluations, when the function is noisy, the optimal choice requires information about the noise level and higher-order derivatives of the function, which is often unavailable. Given the noise level of the function, we propose a bisection search for finding a finite-difference interval for any finite-difference scheme that balances the truncation error, which arises from the error in the Taylor series approximation, and the measurement error, which results from noise in the function evaluation. Our procedure produces reliable estimates of the finite-difference interval at low cost without explicitly approximating higher-order derivatives. We show its numerical reliability and accuracy on a set of test problems. When combined with limited memory BFGS, we obtain a robust method for minimizing noisy black-box functions, as illustrated on a subset of unconstrained CUTEst problems with synthetically added noise.},

The scheme is designed based on an energetic variational formulation, in which the reaction part is reformulated in terms of the reaction trajectory, and both the reaction and diffusion parts dissipate the same free energy. At the reaction stage, the reaction trajectory equation is approximated by a second-order Crank--Nicolson type method. The unique solvability, positivity-preserving property, and energy stability are established based on a convexity analysis. In the diffusion stage, an exact integrator is applied if the diffusion coefficients are constant, and a Crank--Nicolson type scheme is constructed if the diffusion part is nonlinear. In either case, both the positivity-preserving property and energy stability could be theoretically established. Moreover, a combination of the numerical algorithms at both stages by the Strang splitting approach leads to a second-order accurate, structure-preserving scheme for the original reaction-diffusion system.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel training method for multivariate two-layer rectified neural networks. The core mechanism is the augmentation of standard gradient descent direction by the inclusion of search vectors which are chosen to explicitly adjust the activation patterns of the neurons. Active neuron least squares (ANLS) proceeds iteratively with each iteration consisting of three steps: (a) generation of search vectors (including ones designed to change activation patterns), (b) identification of the candidate weights, and (c) a decision on which candidate weights are selected for update. We develop stable and efficient procedures for implementing the method. Numerical examples are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of ANLS compared with existing popular approaches on various learning tasks ranging from function approximation to solving PDEs.},

We prove that the numerical scheme is uniquely solvable and second-order convergent for both the spatial and temporal discretizations. Optimal error estimates for the velocity in the $L^{\infty}$-norm and for the surface elevation in the $L^2$-norm are obtained under a suitable step-size ratio restriction based on energy analysis. In particular, the analysis for the strongly nonlinear term is carried out by splitting it into several recursive expressions. Moreover, the numerical scheme preserves at least two conservation invariants: mass and energy. Extensive numerical experiments including long time simulations for zero$/$nonzero rotation parameters demonstrate solution behavior and verify the convergence results as well as mass/energy conservation.},

  abstract     = {The reconstruction of a low-rank matrix from its noisy observation finds its usage in many applications. It can be reformulated into a constrained nuclear norm minimization problem, where the bound $\eta$ of the constraint is explicitly given or can be estimated by the probability distribution of the noise. When the Lagrangian method is applied to find the minimizer, the solution can be obtained by the singular value thresholding operator, where the thresholding parameter $\lambda$ is related to the Lagrangian multiplier. In this paper, we first show that the Frobenius norm of the discrepancy between the minimizer and the observed matrix is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $\lambda$. From that we derive a closed form solution for $\lambda$ in terms of $\eta$. Since $\lambda$ is the same as the regularization parameter for the unconstrained regularized problem, our results can be applied to automatically choosing a suitable regularization parameter for the nuclear norm--type regularized minimization problems using the discrepancy principle. The regularization parameters obtained are comparable to (and sometimes better than) those obtained by Stein&#39;s unbiased risk estimator approach, while the cost of solving the minimization problem can be reduced by 11--18 times. Numerical experiments with both synthetic data and real MRI data are performed to validate the proposed approach.},

The deep learning model consists of a recurrent neural network, which aims to learn the time marching structure, and a generative adversarial network to learn and sample from the probability distribution of the random dynamical system. Although generative adversarial networks provide a powerful tool to model a complex probability distribution, the training often fails without a proper regularization. Here, we propose a regularization strategy for a generative adversarial network based on consistency conditions for the sequential inference problems. First, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is used to enforce the consistency between conditional and marginal distributions of a stochastic process. Then, the marginal distributions of the multiple-step predictions are regularized by using MMD or from multiple discriminators. The behavior of the proposed model is studied by using three stochastic processes with complex noise structures.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of many rigid bodies colliding with each other sometimes yield particularly interesting results if the colliding objects differ significantly in size and are nonspherical. The most expensive part within such a simulation code is the collision detection. We propose a family of novel multiscale collision detection algorithms that can be applied to triangulated objects within explicit and implicit time stepping methods. They are well suited to handle objects that cannot be represented by analytical shapes or assemblies of analytical objects. Inspired by multigrid methods and adaptive mesh refinement, we determine collision points iteratively over a resolution hierarchy and combine a functional minimization plus penalty parameters with the actual comparision-based geometric distance calculation. Coarse surrogate geometry representations identify “no collision” scenarios early on and otherwise yield an educated guess which triangle subsets of the next finer level might yield collisions. They prune the search tree and furthermore feed conservative contact force estimates into the iterative solve behind an implicit time stepping. Implicit time stepping and nonanalytical shapes often yield prohibitive high compute cost for rigid body simulations. Our approach reduces the object-object comparison cost algorithmically by one to two orders of magnitude. It also exhibits high vectorization efficiency due to its iterative nature.},

  abstract     = {There has been considerable interest in designing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms by exploiting numerical methods for Langevin dynamics, which includes Hamiltonian dynamics as a deterministic case. A prominent approach is Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), where a leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics is employed. We investigate a recently proposed class of irreversible sampling algorithms, called Hamiltonian assisted Metropolis sampling (HAMS), which uses an augmented target density similarly as in HMC but involves a flexible proposal scheme and a carefully formulated acceptance-rejection scheme to achieve generalized reversibility. We show that as the step size tends to 0, the HAMS proposal satisfies a class of stochastic differential equations including Langevin dynamics as a special case. We provide theoretical results for HAMS, including algebraic properties of the acceptance probability, the stationary variance from the HAMS proposal, and the expected acceptance rate under a product Gaussian target distribution and the convergence rate under standard Gaussian. From these results, we derive default choices of tuning parameters for HAMS such that only the step size needs to be tuned in applications. Various relatively recent algorithms for Langevin dynamics are also shown to fall in the class of HAMS proposals up to negligible differences. Our numerical experiments on sampling high-dimensional latent variables confirm that the HAMS algorithms consistently achieve superior performance compared with several Metropolis-adjusted algorithms based on popular integrators of Langevin dynamics.},

The method only alternates three steps: (1) convolution, (2) thresholding, and (3) projection. The method is simple, easy to implement, and insensitive to initial guesses and can be effectively applied to arbitrary domains without any special discretization. At each iteration, the computational complexity is linear in the discretization of the computational domain. Moreover, we theoretically prove the energy decaying property of the method. Experiments are performed to show the accuracy of approximation, efficiency, and unconditional stability of the algorithm. We apply the proposed algorithms on both 2- and 3-dimensional flat tori, triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, disk, three-fold star, five-fold star, cube, ball, and tetrahedron domains to compute Dirichlet $k$-partitions for different $k$ to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

For practical problems with complex geometry, schemes on the unstructured meshes are preferred. However, accurate and mass conservative SL methods on unstructured meshes are still under development and encounter several challenges. For instance, when tracking characteristics backward in time, high order curves are required to accurately approximate the shape of upstream cells, which brings in extra computational complexity. To avoid such computational complexity, we propose an Eulerian--Lagrangian Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method (EL RK DG) in [X. Cai, J.-M. Qiu, and Y. Yang, J. Comput. Phys., 439 (2021), 110392] as an extension of the SL discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. This work is a further extension of the algorithm to unstructured triangular meshes with discussion on the treatment of the inflow boundary condition. We also discuss the discrete geometric conservation law. The nonlinear weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) limiter is applied to control oscillations. Desired properties of the proposed method are numerically verified by a set of benchmark tests.},

The convergence property of the GADI framework is discussed. Most of existing ADI methods can be unified in the developed framework. Meanwhile the GADI framework can derive new ADI methods. Moreover, as the algorithm efficiency is sensitive to the splitting parameters, we offer a data-driven approach, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) method based on the Bayesian inference, to predict the GADI framework&#39;s relatively optimal parameters. The GPR method only requires a small training data set to learn the regression prediction mapping, can predict accurate splitting parameters, and has high generalization capability. It allows us to efficiently solve linear systems with a one-shot computation, and does not require any repeated computations. Finally, we use the three-dimensional convection-diffusion equation, two-dimensional parabolic equation, and continuous Sylvester matrix equation to examine the performance of our proposed methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework is faster tens to thousands of times than the existing ADI methods, such as (inexact) Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting type methods in which the consumption of obtaining relatively optimal splitting parameters is ignored. As a result, our proposed methods can solve much larger linear systems which these existing ADI methods have not reached.},

  abstract     = {We present a new scientific machine learning method that learns from data a computationally inexpensive surrogate model for predicting the evolution of a system governed by a time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), an enabling technology for many computational algorithms used in engineering settings. Our formulation generalizes to the function space PDE setting the Operator Inference method previously developed in [B. Peherstorfer and K. Willcox, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 306 (2016), pp. 196--215] for systems governed by ordinary differential equations. The method brings together two main elements. First, ideas from projection-based model reduction are used to explicitly parametrize the learned model by low-dimensional polynomial operators which reflect the known form of the governing PDE. Second, supervised machine learning tools are used to infer from data the reduced operators of this physics-informed parametrization. For systems whose governing PDEs contain more general (nonpolynomial) nonlinearities, the learned model performance can be improved through the use of lifting variable transformations, which expose polynomial structure in the PDE. The proposed method is demonstrated on two examples: a heat equation model problem that demonstrates the benefits of the function space formulation in terms of consistency with the underlying continuous truth, and a three-dimensional combustion simulation with over 18 million degrees of freedom, for which the learned reduced models achieve accurate predictions with a dimension reduction of five orders of magnitude and model runtime reduction of up to nine orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {We study the learning of numerical algorithms for scientific computing, which combines mathematically driven, handcrafted design of general algorithm structure with a data-driven adaptation to specific classes of tasks. This represents a departure from the classical approaches in numerical analysis, which typically do not feature such learning-based adaptations. As a case study, we develop a machine learning approach that automatically learns effective solvers for initial value problems in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), based on the Runge--Kutta (RK) integrator architecture. We show that we can learn high-order integrators for targeted families of differential equations without the need for computing integrator coefficients by hand. Moreover, we demonstrate that in certain cases we can obtain superior performance to classical RK methods. This can be attributed to certain properties of the ODE families being identified and exploited by the approach. Overall, this work demonstrates an effective learning-based approach to the design of algorithms for the numerical solution of differential equations. This can be readily extended to other numerical tasks.},

  abstract     = {Variational Bayes (VB) is a popular tool for Bayesian inference in statistical modeling. Recently, some VB algorithms were proposed to handle intractable likelihoods with applications such as approximate Bayesian computation. In this paper, we propose several unbiased estimators based on multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) for the gradient of Kullback--Leibler divergence between the posterior distribution and the variational distribution when the likelihood is intractable, but can be estimated unbiasedly. The new VB algorithm differs from the VB algorithms in the literature which usually render biased gradient estimators. Moreover, we incorporate randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling within the MLMC-based gradient estimators, which was known to provide a favorable rate of convergence in numerical integration. Theoretical guarantees for RQMC are provided in this new setting. Numerical experiments show that using RQMC in MLMC greatly speeds up the VB algorithm, and finds a better parameter value than some existing competitors do.},

  abstract     = {Stabilized explicit methods are particularly efficient for large systems of stiff stochastic differential equations (SDEs) due to their extended stability domain. However, they lose their efficiency when a severe stiffness is induced by very few “fast” degrees of freedom, as the stiff and nonstiff terms are evaluated concurrently. Therefore, inspired by [A. Abdulle, M. J. Grote, and G. Rosilho de Souza, Explicit stabilized multirate method for stiff differential equations, Math. Comp., in press, 2022], we introduce a stochastic modified equation whose stiffness depends solely on the “slow” terms. By integrating this modified equation with a stabilized explicit scheme, we devise a multirate method which overcomes the bottleneck caused by a few severely stiff terms and recovers the efficiency of stabilized schemes for large systems of nonlinear SDEs. The scheme is not based on any scale separation assumption of the SDE. Therefore, it is employable for problems stemming from the spatial discretization of stochastic parabolic partial differential equations on locally refined grids. The multirate scheme has strong order $1/2$, weak order $1,$ and its stability is proved on a model problem. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {We first consider the problem of approximating a few eigenvalues of a rational matrix-valued function closest to a prescribed target. It is assumed that the proper rational part of the rational matrix-valued function is expressed in the transfer function form $H(s) = C (sI - A)^{-1} B$, where the middle factor is large, whereas the number of rows of $C$ and the number of columns of $B$ are equal and small. We propose a subspace framework that performs two-sided or one-sided projections on the state-space representation of $H(\cdot)$, commonly employed in model reduction and giving rise to a reduced transfer function. At every iteration, the projection subspaces are expanded to attain Hermite interpolation conditions at the eigenvalues of the reduced transfer function closest to the target, which in turn leads to a new reduced transfer function. We prove in theory that, when a sequence of eigenvalues of the reduced transfer functions converges to an eigenvalue of the full problem, it converges at least at a quadratic rate. In the second part, we extend the proposed framework to locate the eigenvalues of a general square large-scale nonlinear meromorphic matrix-valued function $T(\cdot)$, where we exploit a representation $\mathcal{R}(s) = C(s) A(s)^{-1} B(s) - D(s)$ defined in terms of the block components of $T(\cdot)$. The numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed framework is reliable in locating a few eigenvalues closest to the target point, and that, with respect to runtime, it is competitive to established methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems.},

The definition of an asynchronous extension of multiplicative correction is not straightforward; however, our analysis allows for usual asynchronous programming approaches. General asynchronous iterative models are explicitly devised both for shared or replicated coarse problems and for centralized or distributed ones. Convergence conditions are derived and shown to be satisfied for M-matrices, as also done for the additive case. Implementation aspects are discussed, which reveal the need for nonblocking synchronization for building the successive right-hand side vectors of the coarse problem. Optionally, a parameter allows for applying each coarse solution a maximum number of times, which has an impact on the algorithm efficiency. Numerical results on a high-speed homogeneous cluster confirm the practical efficiency of the asynchronous two-level method over its synchronous counterpart, even when it is not the case for the underlying one-level methods.},

First, within a time iteration framework, we approximate economic policy functions using an adaptive, high-dimensional model representation scheme, combined with adaptive sparse grids to address the ubiquitous challenge of the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, the adaptivity within the individual component functions increases sparsity since grid points are added only where they are most needed, that is, in regions with steep gradients or at nondifferentiabilities. Second, we introduce a performant vectorization scheme for the interpolation compute kernel. Third, the algorithm is hybrid parallelized, leveraging both distributed- and shared-memory architectures. We observe significant speedups over the state-of-the-art techniques, and almost ideal strong scaling up to at least 1,000 compute nodes of a Cray XC50 system at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center. Finally, to demonstrate our method&#39;s broad applicability, we compute global solutions to two variates of a high-dimensional international real business cycle model up to 300 continuous state variables. In addition, we highlight a complementary advantage of the framework, which allows for a priori analysis of the model complexity.},

Under mild assumptions on the approximation, local conservation of mass, an energy bound, and the inheritance of the port-Hamiltonian structure can be shown. Our approach is not limited to conventional space discretization but also covers complexity reduction of the nonlinearities by inexact integration.

For finding an optimal feedback controller, the value function and associated fundamental equations such as the Bellman equation and the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation are essential. The numerical treatment of these equations poses formidable challenges due to their non-linearity and their (possibly) high dimensionality. In this paper we consider a finite horizon control system with associated Bellman equation. After a time discretization, we obtain a sequence of short time horizon problems which we call local optimal control problems. For solving the local optimal control problems we apply two different methods; one is the well-known policy iteration, where a fixed-point iteration is required for every time step. The other algorithm borrows ideas from model predictive control by solving the local optimal control problem via open-loop control methods on a short time horizon, allowing us to replace the fixed-point iteration by an adjoint method. For high-dimensional systems we apply low-rank hierarchical tensor product approximation/tree-based tensor formats, in particular tensor trains and multipolynomials, together with high-dimensional quadrature, e.g., Monte Carlo. We prove a linear error propagation with respect to the time discretization and give numerical evidence by controlling a diffusion equation with an unstable reaction term and an Allen--Cahn equation.},

  abstract     = {All-electron calculations play an important role in density functional theory, in which improving computational efficiency is one of the most needed and challenging tasks. In the model formulations, both the nonlinear eigenvalue problem and the total energy minimization problem pursue orthogonal solutions. Most existing algorithms for solving these two models invoke orthogonalization process either explicitly or implicitly in each iteration. Their efficiency suffers from this process in view of its cubic complexity and low parallel scalability in terms of the number of electrons for large scale systems. To break through this bottleneck, we propose an orthogonalization-free algorithm framework based on the total energy minimization problem. It is shown that the desired orthogonality can be gradually achieved without invoking orthogonalization in each iteration. Moreover, this framework fully consists of BLAS operations and thus can be naturally parallelized. The global convergence of the proposed algorithm is established. We also present a preconditioning technique which can dramatically accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. The numerical experiments on all-electron calculations show the effectiveness and high scalability of the proposed algorithm.},

Our approach may be applied to time-dependent problems which are discretized using backward Euler or Crank--Nicolson and is also a valuable candidate for Stokes control problems discretized using Crank--Nicolson. The key ingredients of the solver are a saddle-point type approximation for the linear systems, an inner iteration for the $(1,1)$-block accelerated by a preconditioner for convection-diffusion control, and an approximation to the Schur complement based on a potent commutator argument applied to an appropriate block matrix.

  abstract     = {In computational PDE-based inverse problems, a finite amount of data is collected to infer unknown parameters in the PDE. In order to obtain accurate inferences, the collected data must be informative about the unknown parameters. How to decide which data is most informative and how to efficiently sample it is the notoriously challenging task of optimal experimental design (OED). In this context, the best, and often infeasible, scenario is when the full input-to-output (ItO) map, i.e., an infinite amount of data, is available: This is the typical setting in many theoretical inverse problems, which is used to guarantee the unique parameter reconstruction. These two different settings have created a gap between computational and theoretical inverse problems, where finite and infinite amounts of data are used, respectively. In this article we aim to bridge this gap while circumventing the OED task. This is achieved by exploiting the structures of the ItO data from the underlying inverse problem, using the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problem as an example. To accomplish our goal, we leverage the rank structure of the EIT model and formulate the ItO matrix\textemdash the discretized ItO map\textemdash as an $\mathcal{H}$-matrix whose off-diagonal blocks are low rank. This suggests that, when equipped with the matrix completion technique, one can recover the full ItO matrix, with high probability, from a subset of its entries sampled following the rank structure: The data in the diagonal blocks is informative and should be fully sampled, while data in the off-diagonal blocks can be subsampled. This recovered ItO matrix is then utilized to present the full ItO map up to a discretization error, paving the way to connect with the problem in the theoretical setting where the unique reconstruction of parameters is guaranteed. This strategy achieves two goals: (I) it bridges the gap between the finite- and infinite-dimensional settings for numerical and theoretical inverse problems and (II) it improves the quality of computational inverse solutions. We detail the theory for the EIT model and provide numerical verification to both EIT and optical tomography problems.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a PDE-aware deep learning model for the numerical solution to the inverse problem of electrocardiography. The model both leverages data availability and exploits the knowledge of a physically based mathematical model, expressed by means of partial differential equations (PDEs), to carry out the task at hand. The goal is to estimate the epicardial potential field from measurements of the electric potential at a discrete set of points on the body surface. The employment of deep learning techniques in this context is made difficult by the low amount of clinical data at disposal, as measuring cardiac potentials requires invasive procedures. Suitably exploiting the underlying physically based mathematical model allowed circumventing the data availability issue and led to the development of fast-training and low-complexity models. Physical awareness has been pursued by means of two elements: the projection of the epicardial potential onto a space-time reduced subspace, spanned by the numerical solutions of the governing PDEs, and the inclusion of a tensorial reduced basis solver of the forward problem in the network architecture. Numerical tests have been conducted only on synthetic data, obtained via a full order model approximation of the problem at hand, and two variants of the model have been addressed. Both proved to be accurate, up to an average $\ell^1$-norm relative error on epicardial activation maps of 3.5\%, and both could be trained in $\approx$$15$ min. Nevertheless, some improvements, mostly concerning data generation, are necessary in order to bridge the gap with clinical applications.},

In the prediction step, the linear part of the equation is integrated exactly, which allows the $\varepsilon$-oscillatory solution to be captured effectively, while only a local nonlinear system needs to be solved at each spatial grid point. Besides, the compact representation saves the storage requirement and computational cost. In the correction step, the prediction solution is modified to admit the mass/energy conservation law or both of them by adding supplementary variables to the original equation. This procedure is inexpensive since only algebraic nonlinear equations need to be solved. Extensive numerical tests suggest the meshing stategies for obtaining correct physical quantities: $\tau=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ and $h=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ for the equation with defocusing nonlinearities or weak $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$--focusing/defocusing nonlinearities, and $\tau$ independent of $\varepsilon$ and $h=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ for the linear equation. Some numerical experiments for the equation in two and three dimensions are also carried out to demonstrate the power of the present methods in simulation of Bose--Einstein condensation.},

  abstract     = {To date, the analysis of high-dimensional, computationally expensive engineering models remains a difficult challenge in risk and reliability engineering. We use a combination of dimensionality reduction and surrogate modeling termed partial least squares--driven polynomial chaos expansion (PLS-PCE) to render such problems feasible. Standalone surrogate models typically perform poorly for reliability analysis. Therefore, in a previous work, we have used PLS-PCEs to reconstruct the intermediate densities of a sequential importance sampling approach to reliability analysis. Here, we extend this approach with an active learning procedure that allows for improved error control at each importance sampling level. To this end, we formulate an estimate of the combined estimation error for both the subspace identified in the dimension reduction step and the surrogate model constructed therein. With this, it is possible to adapt the training set so as to optimally learn the subspace representation and the surrogate model constructed therein. The approach is gradient-free and thus can be directly applied to black box--type models. We demonstrate the performance of this approach with a series of low- (2 dimensions) to high- (869 dimensions) dimensional example problems featuring a number of well-known caveats for reliability methods besides high dimensions and expensive computational models: strongly nonlinear limit-state functions, multiple relevant failure regions, and small probabilities of failure.},

The accurate simulation of this transport can be attained using standard dual-weighted-residual techniques to derive goal-oriented a posteriori error bounds. This work provides a key aspect in obtaining a suitable error estimate for the travel time functional: the evaluation of its Gâteaux derivative. A mixed finite element method is implemented to approximate Darcy&#39;s equations, and numerical experiments are presented to test the performance of the proposed error estimator.

With a suitable construction of multiscale space, one can achieve a stable temporal splitting scheme where the time step size is independent of the contrast [E. T. Chung et al., J. Comput. Phys., 445 (2021), 110578]. Considering the parabolic equation with a heterogeneous diffusion parameter, the flow rates vary significantly in different regions due to the high-contrast features of the diffusivity. In this work, we aim to introduce a multirate partially explicit splitting scheme to achieve efficient simulation with the desired accuracy. We first design multiscale subspaces to handle flow with different speeds. For the fast flow, we obtain a low-dimensional subspace for the high-diffusive component and adopt an implicit time discretization scheme. The other multiscale subspace will take care of the slow flow, and the corresponding degrees of freedom are treated explicitly. Then a multirate time stepping is introduced for the two parts. The stability of the multirate methods is analyzed for the partially explicit scheme. Moreover, we derive local error estimators corresponding to the two components of the solutions and provide an upper bound of the errors. An adaptive local temporal refinement framework is then proposed to achieve higher computational efficiency. Several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

In the proposed method, the homogenized solutions are sought through a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, the original oscillatory diffusion equation is approximated, for each fixed random sample $\omega$, by a spatially homogenized diffusion equation with piecewise constant coefficients, resulting in a random diffusion equation. In the second stage, the resulting random diffusion equation is approximated and computed by using an efficient multimodes Monte Carlo method which only requires solving a diffusion equation with a constant diffusion coefficient and a random right-hand side. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it separates the computational difficulty caused by the spatial fast oscillation of the solution and caused by the randomness of the solution, so they can be overcome separately using different strategies. The convergence of the solution of the spatially homogenized equation (from the first stage) to the solution of the original random diffusion equation is established, and the optimal rate of convergence is also obtained for the proposed multimodes Monte Carlo method. Numerical experiments on some benchmark test problems for random composite materials are also presented to gauge the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed two-stage stochastic homogenization method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a new family of semidiscrete and fully discrete finite volume schemes for overdetermined, hyperbolic, and thermodynamically compatible PDE systems. In the following, we will denote these methods as HTC schemes. In particular, we consider the Euler equations of compressible gasdynamics as well as the more complex Godunov--Peshkov--Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics, which, with the aid of suitable relaxation source terms, is able to describe nonlinear elasto-plastic solids at large deformations as well as viscous fluids as two special cases of a more general first-order hyperbolic model of continuum mechanics. The main novelty of the schemes presented in this paper lies in the fact that we solve the entropy inequality as a primary evolution equation rather than the usual total energy conservation law. Instead, total energy conservation is achieved as a mere consequence of a thermodynamically compatible discretization of all the other equations. For this, we first construct a discrete framework for the compressible Euler equations that mimics the continuous framework of Godunov&#39;s seminal paper [Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR, 139(1961), pp. 521--523] exactly at the discrete level. All other terms in the governing equations of the more general GPR model, including nonconservative products, are judiciously discretized in order to achieve discrete thermodynamic compatibility, with the exact conservation of total energy density as a direct consequence of all the other equations. As a result, the HTC schemes proposed in this paper are provably marginally stable in the energy norm and satisfy a discrete entropy inequality by construction. We show some computational results obtained with HTC schemes in one and two space dimensions, considering both the fluid limit as well as the solid limit of the governing PDEs.},

  abstract     = {A novel static algorithm is proposed for numerical reparametrization of periodic planar curves. The method identifies a monitor function of the arclength variable with the true curvature of an open planar curve and considers a simple interpolation between the object and the unit circle at the curvature level. Since a convenient formula is known for tangential velocity that maintains the equidistribution rule with curvature-type monitor functions, the strategy enables one to compute the correspondence between the arclength and another spatial variable by evolving the interpolated curve. With a certain normalization, velocity information in the motion is obtained with spectral accuracy while the resulting parametrization remains unchanged. Then, the algorithm extracts a refined representation of the input curve by sampling its arclength parametrization, whose Fourier coefficients are directly accessed through a simple change of variables. As a validation, improvements to spatial resolution are evaluated by approximating the invariant coefficients from downsampled data and observing faster global convergence to the original shape.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-order modeling techniques, including balanced truncation and $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction, exploit the structure of linear dynamical systems to produce models that accurately capture the dynamics. For nonlinear systems operating far away from equilibria, on the other hand, current approaches seek low-dimensional representations of the state that often neglect low-energy features that have high dynamical significance. For instance, low-energy features are known to play an important role in fluid dynamics, where they can be a driving mechanism for shear-layer instabilities. Neglecting these features leads to models with poor predictive accuracy despite being able to accurately encode and decode states. In order to improve predictive accuracy, we propose to optimize the reduced-order model to fit a collection of coarsely sampled trajectories from the original system. In particular, we optimize over the product of two Grassmann manifolds defining Petrov--Galerkin projections of the full-order governing equations. We compare our approach with existing methods including proper orthogonal decomposition, balanced truncation-based Petrov--Galerkin projection, quadratic-bilinear balanced truncation, and the quadratic-bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved accuracy both on a nonlinear toy model and on an incompressible (nonlinear) axisymmetric jet flow with $10^5$ states.},

  abstract     = {We consider the two-dimensional rotating shallow water equations with nonflat bottom topography. We focus on the case of low Froude number, in which the system is stiff and conventional explicit numerical methods are extremely inefficient and often impractical. Our goal is to design a finite volume scheme, which is both asymptotic preserving (uniformly asymptotically consistent and stable for a broad range of low Froude numbers) and well-balanced (capable of exactly preserving geophysically relevant steady-state solutions). The goal is achieved in two steps. We first rewrite the studied equations in terms of perturbations of the steady state and then apply the flux splitting similar to the one used in [Liu, Chertok, and Kurganov J. Comput. Phys., 391 (2019), pp. 259-279]. We split the flux into the stiff and nonstiff parts and then use an implicit-explicit approach: apply an explicit second-order central-upwind scheme to the nonstiff part of the system while treating the stiff part implicitly. As the stiff part of the flux is linear, we reduce the implicit stage of the proposed method to solving a Poisson-type elliptic equation, which is discretized using a standard second-order central difference scheme. We prove the asymptotic preserving property of the developed scheme and conduct a series of numerical experiments, which demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the non-well-balanced asymptotic preserving scheme from [Liu, Chertok, and Kurganov J.

  abstract     = {We introduce a simple, accurate, and extremely efficient method for numerically solving multimarginal optimal transport (MMOT) problems arising in density functional theory. The method relies on (i) the sparsity of optimal plans (for $N$ marginals discretized by $\ell$ gridpoints each, general Kantorovich plans require $\ell^N$ gridpoints, but the support of optimizers is of size $O(\ell\cdot N)$ [G. Friesecke and D. Vögler, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 50 (2018), pp. 3996--4019], (ii) the method of column generation (CG) from discrete optimization which is novel in the optimal transport context, and (iii) ideas from machine learning. The well-known bottleneck in CG consists in generating new candidate columns efficiently; we prove that in our context, finding the best new column is an NP-complete problem. To overcome this bottleneck we use a genetic learning method tailor-made for MMOT in which the dual state within CG plays the role of an “adversary” in loose similarity to Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (GANs). On a sequence of benchmark problems with up to 120 gridpoints and up to 30 marginals, our method always finds the exact optimizers. Moreover, empirically the number of computational steps needed to find them appears to scale only polynomially when both $N$ and $\ell$ are simultaneously increased (while keeping their ratio fixed to mimic a thermodynamic limit of the particle system).},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a tool for high-dimensional approximation based on trigonometric polynomials where we allow only low-dimensional interactions of variables. In a general high-dimensional setting, it is already possible to deal with special sampling sets such as sparse grids or rank-1 lattices. This requires black-box access to the function, i.e., the ability to evaluate it at any point. Here, we focus on scattered data points and grouped frequency index sets along the dimensions. From there we propose a fast matrix-vector multiplication, the grouped Fourier transform, for high-dimensional grouped index sets. Those transformations can be used in the application of the previously introduced method of approximating functions with low superposition dimension based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition where there is a one-to-one correspondence from the ANOVA terms to our proposed groups. The method is able to dynamically detect important sets of ANOVA terms in the approximation. In this paper, we consider the involved least-squares problem and add different forms of regularization: classical Tikhonov-regularization, namely, regularized least squares, and the technique of group lasso, which promotes sparsity in the groups. As for the latter, there are no explicit solution formulas, which is why we applied the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm to obtain the minimizer. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of incorporating smoothness information into the least-squares problem. Numerical experiments in underdetermined, overdetermined, and noisy settings indicate the applicability of our algorithms. While we consider periodic functions, the idea can be directly generalized to nonperiodic functions as well.},

NEPIN implicitly removes the components causing trouble for the global convergence through a correction based on nonlinear elimination within a subspace that provides a modified direction for the global Newton iteration. Numerical experiments show that NEPIN can be more robust than global inexact Newton algorithms and maintain fast convergence even for challenging problems, such as full potential transonic flows. NEPIN complements several previously studied nonlinear preconditioners with which it compares favorably experimentally on a classic shocked duct flow problem considered herein. NEPIN is shown to be fairly insensitive to mesh resolution and “bad” subproblem identification based on the local Mach number or the local nonlinear residual for transonic flow over a wing.},

Many graph-based machine learning approaches assume that the graphs have hidden group structures. However, the group structures are unclear or noisy in applications generally. Graph refinement aims to clarify the underlying group structures. In this work, a novel approach, called Simultaneously Low-rank and Sparse Approximation (SLSA), is proposed for graph refinement, which imposes a strong cluster structure through strict sparse and low-rank assumptions simultaneously. This approach minimizes a nonconvex function. Fortunately, the optimization problem can be efficiently solved via an alternating iteration method, and the iterative method converges globally under a weak condition. A fast iterative algorithm is also given for large-scale sparse graphs, which costs $O(n)$ in each iteration. Compared with two other related methods for graph refinement, SLSA performs better on both synthetic and real-world data sets. Applications of the refinement method SLSA on several machine learning algorithms are discussed in detail. Numerical experiments show that the improvements of these algorithms are significant under the SLSA modifications and better than the improvements based on the refinements of other approaches.},

In this paper, we introduce a Petrov--Galerkin spectral method for the Boltzmann equation in the unbounded domain. The basis functions (both test and trial functions) are carefully chosen mapped Chebyshev functions to obtain desired convergence and conservation properties. Furthermore, thanks to the close relationship of the Chebyshev functions and the Fourier cosine series, we are able to construct a fast algorithm with the help of the nonuniform fast Fourier transform. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method in comparison to the Fourier spectral method through a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples.},

Our approach is based on random sketching, which is a dimension reduction technique consisting in estimation of inner products of high-dimensional vectors by inner products of their small efficiently computable random images, so-called sketches. In this way, an approximate orthogonality of the full vectors can be obtained by orthogonalization of their sketches. The proposed Gram--Schmidt algorithm can provide computational cost reduction in any architecture. The benefit of random sketching can be amplified by performing the nondominant operations in higher precision. In this case the numerical stability can be guaranteed with a working unit roundoff independent of the dimension of the problem. The proposed Gram--Schmidt process can be applied to Arnoldi iteration and results in new Krylov subspace methods for solving high-dimensional systems of equations or eigenvalue problems.

In PROM, each parameter point can be associated with a subspace, which is used for Petrov--Galerkin projections of large system matrices. Previous efforts to approximate such functions use interpolations on manifolds, which can be inaccurate and slow. To tackle this, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for subspace prediction: the Gaussian process subspace (GPS) model. This method is extrinsic and intrinsic at the same time: with multivariate Gaussian distributions on the Euclidean space, it induces a joint probability model on the Grassmann manifold, the set of fixed-dimensional subspaces. The GPS adopts a simple yet general correlation structure, and a principled approach for model selection. Its predictive distribution admits an analytical form, which allows for efficient subspace prediction over the parameter space. For PROM, the GPS provides a probabilistic prediction at a new parameter point that retains the accuracy of local reduced models, at a computational complexity that does not depend on system dimension, and thus is suitable for online computation. We give four numerical examples to compare our method to subspace interpolation, as well as two methods that interpolate local reduced models. Overall, GPS is the most data efficient, more computationally efficient than subspace interpolation, and gives smooth predictions with uncertainty quantification.},

In order to overcome the computational difficulties of the full complex models, on one hand, and the limitations of surrogate models, on the other, this work proposes a new accelerated time-stepping strategy that combines information from both. This approach is based on the multirate infinitesimal general-structure additive Runge--Kutta framework. The inexpensive surrogate model is integrated with a small time step to guide the solution trajectory, and the full model is treated with a large time step to occasionally correct for the surrogate model error and ensure convergence.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach for solving the close evaluation problem in three dimensions, commonly encountered while solving linear elliptic partial differential equations via potential theory. The goal is to evaluate layer potentials close to the boundary over which they are defined. The approach introduced here converts these nearly singular integrals on a patch of the boundary to a set of nonsingular line integrals on the patch boundary using the Stokes theorem on manifolds. A function approximation scheme based on harmonic polynomials is designed to express the integrand in a form that is suitable for applying the Stokes theorem. As long as the data---the boundary and the density function---is given in a high-order format, the double-layer potential and its derivatives can be evaluated with high-order accuracy using this scheme both on and off the boundary. In particular, we present numerical results demonstrating seventh-order convergence on a smooth, warped torus example achieving 10-digit accuracy in evaluating double-layer potential at targets that are arbitrarily close to the boundary.},

  abstract     = {Recovering a signal (function) from finitely many binary or Fourier samples is one of the core problems in modern imaging, and by now there exist a plethora of methods for recovering a signal from such samples. Examples of methods which can utilize wavelet reconstruction include generalized sampling, infinite-dimensional compressive sensing, the parameterized-background data-weak (PBDW) method, etc. However, for any of these methods to be applied in practice, accurate and fast modeling of an $N \times M$ section of the infinite-dimensional change-of-basis matrix between the sampling basis (Fourier or Walsh--Hadamard samples) and the wavelet reconstruction basis is paramount. Building on the work of Gataric and Poon [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), pp. A1075--A1099], we derive an algorithm which bypasses the $NM$ storage requirement and the $\mathcal{O}(NM)$ computational cost of matrix-vector multiplication with this matrix and its adjoint when using Walsh--Hadamard samples and wavelet reconstruction. The proposed algorithm computes the matrix-vector multiplication in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ operations and has a storage requirement of $\mathcal{O}(2^q)$, where $N=2^{dq} M$ (usually $q \in {1,2}$) and $d=1,2$ is the dimension. As matrix-vector multiplications are the computational bottleneck for iterative algorithms used by the mentioned reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm speeds up the reconstruction of wavelet coefficients from Walsh--Hadamard samples considerably.},

  abstract     = {Approximate computing techniques, which trade off the computation accuracy of an algorithm for better performance and energy efficiency, have been successful in reducing computation and power costs in several domains. However, error sensitive applications in high-performance computing are unable to benefit from existing approximate computing strategies that are not developed with guaranteed error bounds. While approximate computing techniques can be developed for individual high-performance computing applications by domain specialists, this often requires additional theoretical analysis and potentially extensive software modification. Hence, the development of low-level error-bounded approximate computing strategies that can be introduced into any high-performance computing application without requiring additional analysis or significant software alterations is desirable. In this paper, we provide a contribution in this direction by proposing a general framework for designing error-bounded approximate computing strategies and apply it to the dot product kernel to develop \bf qdot---an error-bounded approximate dot product kernel. Following the introduction of qdot, we perform a theoretical analysis that yields a deterministic bound on the relative approximation error introduced by qdot. Empirical tests are performed to illustrate the tightness of the derived error bound and to demonstrate the effectiveness of qdot on a synthetic dataset, as well as two scientific benchmarks---the conjugate gradient (CG) and power methods. In some instances, using qdot for the dot products in CG can result in many components being quantized to half precision without increasing the iteration count required for convergence to the same solution as CG using a double precision dot product.},

  abstract     = {Monotonic interpolation and its avatars are major ingredients of many numerical schemes for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) under total variation diminishing (TVD) or similar constraints. However, despite over forty years of extensive study of principles and applications, a key aspect of monotonic interpolant design can still appear somewhat empirical: how does a monotonic interpolator connect the limiting cases of smooth (differentiable) and singular (limited) functions in a consistent and possibly canonical way? The present study aims at providing understanding in the basic but important case of per-cell monotonic one-dimensional scalar reconstruction and at applying it to second-order accurate transport. First, a general mapping of bounded monotonic functions in elliptic coordinates is built. Then, the usual “single-slope” second-order monotonic interpolants are continued into “slope-and-bound” monotonic interpolants. Finally, a critical constraint is introduced, the “double monotonicity,” in order to build various slope-and-bound monotonic interpolators from this set of interpolants. With these slope-and-bound interpolators, standard numerical tests show a complete cancellation of the “numerical wetting” that usual TVD transport schemes produce. When transporting scalar fields of compact support, this effect---not to be confused with usual numerical diffusion---is the low-level contamination that spreads linearly in time over all the regions of the computational domain where nonvanishing transport is present. Removal of numerical wetting is of particular importance in many industrial and academic applications, notably at “phase disappearance” episodes in multiphase flows or “wet-dry” transitions in shallow water flows. Improvement of the “numerical erosion” of extrema is also observed. The general principles exposed here can be extended to multidimensional settings, high-order schemes, and other PDEs.},

The condition number bound of the new method is shown to be independent of the coefficient contrast and only dependent on a user-prescribed tolerance. The interface of the nonoverlapping domain decomposition is partitioned into nonoverlapping patches. The new coarse space is obtained by selecting a few eigenvectors of certain local eigenproblems which are defined on these patches. These eigenmodes are energy-minimally extended to the interior of the nonoverlapping subdomains and added to the coarse space. By using a new interface decomposition, the reduced-dimension adaptive GDSW overlapping Schwarz method usually has a smaller coarse space than existing GDSW and adaptive GDSW domain decomposition methods. A robust condition number estimate is proven for the new reduced-dimension adaptive GDSW method which is also valid for existing adaptive GDSW methods.

SDD effectively denoises the given data and the corresponding derivatives. Second, we present two algorithms for PDE identification: Subspace pursuit Time evolution (ST) error and Subspace pursuit Cross-validation (SC). Our general strategy is to first find a candidate set using the Subspace Pursuit (SP) greedy algorithm, then choose the best one via time evolution or cross-validation. ST uses a multishooting numerical time evolution and selects the PDE which yields the least evolution error. SC evaluates the cross-validation error in the least-squares fitting and picks the PDE that gives the smallest validation error. We present various numerical experiments to validate our methods.

This is achieved by dividing the overall inference problem into subproblems where we sequentially infer the posterior distribution of one tensor decomposition component at a time. This leads to a probabilistic interpretation of the well-known iterative algorithm alternating linear scheme (ALS). In this way, the consideration of measurement noise is enabled, as well as the incorporation of application-specific prior knowledge and the uncertainty quantification of the low-rank tensor estimate.

To this end, we first formulate and analyze the continuous-stage exponential Runge--Kutta (ERK) method. After deriving the order conditions, energy-preserving conditions, and symmetric conditions for the continuous-stage ERK method, we construct a novel class of fourth-order symmetric energy-preserving continuous-stage ERK methods with a free parameter based on the established conditions and present a convergence theorem for the fixed-point iteration associated with the continuous-stage ERK method. Furthermore, we extend the proposed continuous-stage ERK method to noncanonical Hamiltonian systems and discuss implementation issues in detail. Finally, numerical results from the FPU problem, the charged-particle dynamics, and the Klein--Gordon equation demonstrate the high efficiency, good energy-preserving behavior, and applicability of large time stepsizes of the proposed fourth-order energy-preserving continuous-stage ERK method.},

However, despite such an optimal theoretical convergence rate, in practice the (local) oscillatory behavior of FISTA often damps its efficiency. Over the past years, various efforts have been made in the literature to improve the practical performance of FISTA, such as monotone FISTA, restarting FISTA, and backtracking strategies. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the original FISTA scheme which has two advantages: It allows us to (1) prove the convergence of generated sequence and (2) design a so-called lazy-start strategy which can be up to an order faster than the original scheme. Moreover, we propose novel adaptive and greedy strategies which further improve the practical performance.

  abstract     = {Solving the normal equations corresponding to large sparse linear least-squares problems is an important and challenging problem. For very large problems, an iterative solver is needed and, in general, a preconditioner is required to achieve good convergence. In recent years, a number of preconditioners have been proposed. These are largely serial, and reported results demonstrate that none of the commonly used preconditioners for the normal equations matrix is capable of solving all sparse least-squares problems. Our interest is thus in designing new preconditioners for the normal equations that are efficient and robust and can be implemented in parallel. Our proposed preconditioners can be constructed efficiently and algebraically without any knowledge of the problem and without any assumption on the least-squares matrix except that it is sparse. We exploit the structure of the symmetric positive definite normal equations matrix and use the concept of algebraic local symmetric positive semidefinite splittings to introduce two-level Schwarz preconditioners for least-squares problems. The condition number of the preconditioned normal equations matrix is shown to be theoretically bounded independently of the number of subdomains in the splitting. This upper bound can be adjusted using a single parameter $\tau$ that the user can specify. We discuss how the new preconditioners can be implemented on top of the PETSc library using only 150 lines of Fortran, C, or Python code. Problems arising from practical applications are used to compare the performance of the proposed new preconditioner with that of other preconditioners.},

  abstract     = {Generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), often combined with mono-implicit Runge--Kutta (MIRK) methods, is widely used to solve random ODEs. We investigate the impact of stiffness of random ODEs on the gPC performance. We start by extending pragmatic definitions of stiffness used in deterministic ODEs to their random counterparts. Then we introduce gPC with parallel MIRK schemes to solve random stiff ODEs, in which a suitable parallelism partially alleviates the curse of dimensionality. Our stiffness analysis comprises two parts: (i) the relationship between Jacobians of random ODEs and the corresponding gPC equations and (ii) stiffness of the gPC equations. It provides a direct way to determine whether a random ODE and/or the corresponding gPC equations are stiff. This theoretical analysis plays a key role in designing numerical implementations not only of gPC but also of other methods of stochastic computation, e.g., Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic collocation. A series of computational experiments is used to demonstrate the agreement between our theoretical analysis and numerical results and to establish gPC with parallel MIRK as a feasible and effective tool for solving stiff random ODEs.},

  abstract     = {Numerical solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Method of lines is a popular approach to discretize PDEs defined in spacetime, where space and time are discretized independently. When using explicit timesteppers on adaptive grids, the use of a global timestep size dictated by the finest grid-spacing leads to inefficiencies in the coarser regions. Even though adaptive space discretizations are widely used in computational sciences, temporal adaptivity is less common due to its sophisticated nature. This paper presents highly scalable algorithms to enable local timestepping (LTS) for explicit timestepping schemes on octrees. We demonstrate the accuracy of our methods and the scalability of our framework across 16K cores on TACC&#39;s Frontera supercomputer https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/. We also present a speedup estimation model for LTS that predicts the distributed speedup compared to global timestepping with an average of 0.1 relative error.},

The computational cost of the full multigrid iteration is quantified, and the solver is applied to multiple benchmark problems. Through a parameter study, we suggest configurations that achieve theoretical TME for both stabilized equal order and Taylor--Hood discretizations. We then identify and quantify the gaps to achieve TME for parallel multigrid implementations in practice. The excellent node-level performance of the relevant compute kernels is presented via a roofline analysis.

  abstract     = {Gauss--Seidel (GS) is a widely used iterative method for solving sparse linear systems of equations and also known to be effective as a smoother in algebraic multigrid methods. Parallelization of GS is a challenging task since solving the sparse lower triangular system in GS constitutes a sequential bottleneck at each iteration. We propose a distributed-memory parallel GS (dmpGS) by implementing a parallel sparse triangular solver (stSpike) based on the Spike algorithm. stSpike decouples the global triangular system into smaller systems that can be solved concurrently and requires the solution of a much smaller reduced sparse lower triangular system which constitutes a sequential bottleneck. In order to alleviate this bottleneck and to reduce the communication overhead of dmpGS, we propose a partitioning and reordering model consisting of two phases. The first phase is a novel hypergraph partitioning model whose partitioning objective simultaneously encodes minimizing the reduced system size and the communication volume. The second phase is an in-block row reordering method for decreasing the nonzero count of the reduced system. Extensive experiments on a dataset consisting of 359 sparse linear systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning and reordering model in terms of reducing the communication and the sequential computational overheads. Parallel experiments on 12 large systems using up to 320 cores demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves the scalability of dmpGS.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel stochastic approach to binary optimization suited for optimal experimental design (OED) for Bayesian inverse problems governed by mathematical models such as partial differential equations. The OED utility function, namely, the regularized optimality criterion, is cast into a stochastic objective function in the form of an expectation over a multivariate Bernoulli distribution. The probabilistic objective is then solved by using a stochastic optimization routine to find an optimal observational policy. This formulation (a) is generally applicable to binary optimization problems with soft constraints and is ideal for OED and sensor placement problems; (b) does not require differentiability of the original objective function (e.g., a utility function in OED applications) with respect to the design variable, and thus it enables direct employment of sparsity-enforcing penalty functions such as $\ell_0$, without needing to utilize a continuation procedure or apply a rounding technique; (c) exhibits much lower computational cost than traditional gradient-based relaxation approaches; and (d) can be applied to both linear and nonlinear OED problems with proper choice of the utility function. The proposed approach is analyzed from an optimization perspective with detailed convergence analysis of the optimization approach and is also analyzed from a machine learning perspective with correspondence to policy gradient reinforcement learning. The approach is demonstrated numerically by using an idealized two-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problem and validated by extensive numerical experiments carried out for sensor placement in a parameter identification setup.},

High order accuracy in time is obtained by a semi-implicit temporal integrator based on the IMEX Runge--Kutta (IMEX-RK) framework. High order in space is achieved by finite difference WENO schemes with characteristic-wise reconstructions adapted to the semi-implicit IMEX-RK time discretization. Type A IMEX schemes are constructed to handle non-well-prepared initial conditions. Besides, these schemes are proven to be asymptotic preserving and asymptotically accurate as the Mach number vanishes for well-prepared initial conditions. The divergence-free property of the time-discrete schemes is proved. The proposed scheme can also well capture discontinuous solutions in the compressible regime, especially for two-dimensional Riemann problems. Numerical tests in one and two space dimensions will illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Numerical simulations of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets involve the solution of large-scale highly nonlinear systems of equations on complex shallow geometries. This work is concerned with the construction of Schwarz preconditioners for the solution of the associated tangent problems, which are challenging for solvers mainly because of the strong anisotropy of the meshes and wildly changing boundary conditions that can lead to poorly constrained problems on large portions of the domain. Here, two-level generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW)--type Schwarz preconditioners are applied to different land ice problems, i.e., a velocity problem, a temperature problem, as well as the coupling of the former two problems. We employ the message passing interface (MPI)--parallel implementation of multilevel Schwarz preconditioners provided by the package FROSch (fast and robust Schwarz) from the Trilinos library. The strength of the proposed preconditioner is that it yields out-of-the-box scalable and robust preconditioners for the single physics problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time two-level Schwarz preconditioners have been applied to the ice sheet problem and a scalable preconditioner has been used for the coupled problem. The preconditioner for the coupled problem differs from previous monolithic GDSW preconditioners in the sense that decoupled extension operators are used to compute the values in the interior of the subdomains. Several approaches for improving the performance, such as reuse strategies and shared memory OpenMP parallelization, are explored as well. In our numerical study we target both uniform meshes of varying resolution for the Antarctic ice sheet as well as nonuniform meshes for the Greenland ice sheet. We present several weak and strong scaling studies confirming the robustness of the approach and the parallel scalability of the FROSch implementation. Among the highlights of the numerical results are a weak scaling study for up to 32,K processor cores (8,K MPI ranks and 4 OpenMP threads) and 566,M degrees of freedom for the velocity problem as well as a strong scaling study for up to 4,K processor cores (and MPI ranks) and 68,M degrees of freedom for the coupled problem.},

After introducing an infinite dimensional manifold with an admissible tangent space on the boundary of the manifold, by Onsager&#39;s principle for an obstacle problem, we derive the associated parabolic variational inequalities. These variational inequalities can be used to compute the contact line dynamics with unavoidable merging and splitting of droplets due to the impermeable obstacle. To efficiently solve the parabolic variational inequality, we propose an unconditional stable explicit boundary updating scheme coupled with a projection method. The explicit boundary updating efficiently decouples the computation of the motion by mean curvature of the capillary surface and the moving contact lines. Meanwhile, the projection step efficiently splits the difficulties brought by the obstacle and the motion by mean curvature of the capillary surface. Furthermore, we prove the unconditional stability of the scheme and present an accuracy check. Convergence of the proposed scheme is also proved using a nonlinear Trotter--Kato product formula under the pinning contact line assumption. After incorporating the phase transition information at splitting points, several challenging examples including splitting and merging of droplets are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces the Grassmannian diffusion maps (GDMaps), a novel nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that defines the affinity between points through their representation as low-dimensional subspaces corresponding to points on the Grassmann manifold. The method is designed for applications, such as image recognition and data-based classification of constrained high-dimensional data where each data point itself is a high-dimensional object (i.e., a large matrix) that can be compactly represented in a lower-dimensional subspace. The GDMaps is composed of two stages. The first is a pointwise linear dimensionality reduction wherein each high-dimensional object is mapped onto the Grassmann manifold representing the low-dimensional subspace on which it resides. The second stage is a multipoint nonlinear kernel-based dimension reduction using diffusion maps to identify the subspace structure of the points on the Grassmann manifold. To this end, an appropriate Grassmannian kernel is used to construct the transition matrix of a random walk on a graph connecting points on the Grassmann manifold. Spectral analysis of the transition matrix yields low-dimensional Grassmannian diffusion coordinates embedding the data into a low-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Further, a novel data classification/recognition technique is developed based on the construction of an overcomplete dictionary of reduced dimension whose atoms are given by the Grassmannian diffusion coordinates. Three examples are considered. First, a “toy” example shows that the GDMaps can identify an appropriate parametrization of structured points on the unit sphere. The second example demonstrates the ability of the GDMaps to revealing the intrinsic subspace structure of high-dimensional random field data. In the last example, a face recognition problem is solved considering face images subject to varying illumination conditions, changes in face expressions, and occurrence of occlusions. The technique presented high recognition rates (i.e., 95\% in the best case) using a fraction of the data required by conventional methods.},

This model represents the most advanced mathematical description of the cardiac bioelectrical activity, and it consists of a degenerate system of two nonlinear reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs), coupled with a stiff system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A finite element discretization in space and a segregated implicit discretization in time, based on decoupling the PDEs from the ODEs, yields at each time step the solution of a nonlinear algebraic system. The Jacobian linear system at each Newton iteration is solved by a Krylov method, accelerated by BDDC or FETI-DP preconditioners, both augmented with the recently introduced deluxe scaling of the dual variables. A polylogarithmic convergence rate bound is proven for the resulting parallel Bidomain solvers.

  abstract     = {Reaction networks are often used to model interacting species in fields such as biochemistry and ecology. When the counts of the species are sufficiently large, the dynamics of their concentrations are typically modeled via a system of differential equations. However, when the counts of some species are small, the dynamics of the counts are typically modeled stochastically via a discrete state, continuous time Markov chain. A key quantity of interest for such models is the probability mass function of the process at some fixed time. Since paths of such models are relatively straightforward to simulate, we can estimate the probabilities by constructing an empirical distribution. However, the support of the distribution is often diffuse across a high-dimensional state space, where the dimension is equal to the number of species. Therefore generating an accurate empirical distribution can come with a large computational cost. We present a new Monte Carlo estimator that fundamentally improves on the “classical” Monte Carlo estimator described above. It also preserves much of classical Monte Carlo&#39;s simplicity. The idea is basically one of conditional Monte Carlo. Our conditional Monte Carlo estimator has two parameters, and their choice critically affects the performance of the algorithm. Hence, a key contribution of the present work is that we demonstrate how to approximate optimal values for these parameters in an efficient manner. Moreover, we provide a central limit theorem for our estimator, which leads to approximate confidence intervals for its error.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a fast “two-dimensional Fourier continuation” (2D-FC) method for construction of biperiodic extensions of smooth nonperiodic functions defined over general two-dimensional smooth domains. The approach, which runs at a cost of (\mathcalO(Nłog N)\) operations for an $N$-point discretization grid, can be directly generalized to domains of any given dimensionality, but such generalizations are not considered in this contribution. The 2D-FC extensions are produced in a two-step procedure. In the first step the one-dimensional Fourier continuation method is applied along a discrete set of outward boundary-normal directions to produce, along such directions, continuations that vanish outside a narrow interval beyond the boundary. Thus, the first step of the algorithm produces “blending-to-zero along normals” for the given function values. In the second step, the extended function values are evaluated on an underlying Cartesian grid by means of an efficient, high-order boundary-normal interpolation scheme. A Fourier continuation expansion of the given function can then be obtained by a direct application of the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT). Algorithms of arbitrarily high order of accuracy can be obtained by this method. The usefulness and performance of the proposed 2D-FC method are illustrated with applications to the Poisson equation and the time-domain wave equation within a bounded domain. As part of these examples the novel “Fourier forwarding” solver is introduced which, propagating plane waves as they would in free space and relying on certain boundary corrections, can solve the time-domain wave equation and other hyperbolic partial differential equations within general domains at computing costs that grow sublinearly with the size of the spatial discretization.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian curvature is an important geometric property of surfaces, which has been used broadly in mathematical modeling. Due to the full nonlinearity of the Gaussian curvature, efficient numerical methods for models based on it are uncommon in literature. In this article, we propose an operator-splitting method for a general Gaussian curvature model. In our method, we decouple the full nonlinearity of Gaussian curvature from differential operators by introducing two matrix- and vector-valued functions. The optimization problem is then converted into the search for the steady state solution of a time dependent PDE system. The above PDE system is well-suited to time discretization by operator splitting, the subproblems encountered at each fractional step having a closed form solution or being solvable by efficient algorithms. The proposed method is not sensitive to the choice of parameters, its efficiency and performances being demonstrated via systematic experiments on surface smoothing and image denoising.},

With quaternion normal distribution-based random sampling, the randomized QSVD algorithm projects high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional subspace and then identifies an approximate range subspace of the quaternion matrix. The key statistical properties of quaternion Wishart distribution are proposed and used to perform the approximation error analysis of the algorithm. Theoretical results show that the randomized QSVD algorithm can trace dominant singular value decomposition triplets of a quaternion matrix with acceptable accuracy. Numerical experiments also indicate the rationality of proposed theories. Applied to color face recognition problems, the randomized QSVD algorithm obtains higher recognition accuracies and behaves more efficient than the known Lanczos-based partial QSVD and a quaternion version of the fast frequent directions algorithm.},

Nevertheless, efficient implementation of Riemannian gradients and Hessians, required in Riemannian optimization algorithms, can be a nontrivial task in practice. Moreover, in some cases, analytic formulas are not even available. In this paper, we build upon automatic differentiation and propose a method that, given an implementation of the function to be minimized, efficiently computes Riemannian gradients and matrix-by-vector products between an approximate Riemannian Hessian and a given vector.},

In this paper, we incorporate the $L_1/L_2$ formalism into an unconstrained model in order to deal with both noiseless and noisy observations. To design an efficient algorithm, we derive an analytical solution for the proximal operator of the $L_1/L_2$ functional. Since the analytical solution depends on the sparsity of an unknown signal, we develop a bisection search method to find the desired sparsity and the corresponding solution to the proximal operator of $L_1/L_2$. With the newly developed solver of the proximal operator, we propose a specific variable-splitting scheme for the alternating direction method of multipliers so that we can establish its global convergence under mild assumptions and prove its linear convergence rate under suitable conditions.

  abstract     = {Fully implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK) methods have many desirable accuracy and stability properties as time integration schemes, but high-order IRK methods are not commonly used in practice with large-scale numerical PDEs because of the difficulty of solving the stage equations. This paper introduces a theoretical and algorithmic framework for solving the nonlinear equations that arise from IRK methods (and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in time) applied to nonlinear numerical PDEs, including PDEs with algebraic constraints. Several new linearizations of the nonlinear IRK equations are developed, offering faster and more robust convergence than the often-considered simplified Newton, as well as an effective preconditioner for the true Jacobian if exact Newton iterations are desired. Inverting these linearizations requires solving a set of block 2 x 2 systems. Under quite general assumptions, it is proven that the preconditioned 2 x 2 operator&#39;s condition number is bounded by a small constant close to one, independent of the spatial discretization, spatial mesh, and time step, and with only weak dependence on the number of stages or integration accuracy. Moreover, the new method is built using the same preconditioners needed for backward Euler-type time stepping schemes, so can be readily added to existing codes. The new methods are applied to several challenging fluid flow problems, including the compressible Euler and Navier--Stokes equations, and the vorticity-streamfunction formulation of the incompressible Euler and Navier--Stokes equations. Up to 10th-order accuracy is demonstrated using Gauss IRK, while in all cases fourth-order Gauss IRK requires roughly half the number of preconditioner applications as required by standard Singly diagonally implicit Runge--Kutta methods.},

  abstract     = {The research of the two-level overlapping Schwarz (TL-OS) methods based on constrained energy minimizing coarse space is still in its infancy, and there exist some defects, e.g., mainly for a second order elliptic problem and too heavy computational cost of coarse space construction. In this paper, by introducing appropriate assumptions, we propose more concise coarse basis functions for general Hermitian positive and definite discrete systems, and establish the algorithmic and theoretical frameworks of the corresponding TL-OS methods. Furthermore, to enhance the practicability of the algorithm, we design two economical TL-OS preconditioners and prove the condition number estimate. As the first application of the frameworks, we prove that the assumptions hold for the linear finite element discretization of a second order elliptic problem with high contrast and oscillatory coefficient and the condition number of the TL-OS preconditioned system is robust with respect to the model and mesh parameters. In particular, we also prove that the condition number of the economically preconditioned system is independent of the jump range under a certain jump distribution. Experimental results show that the first kind of economical preconditioner is more efficient and stable than the existing one. Second, we construct TL-OS and the economical TL-OS preconditioners for the plane wave least squares discrete system of the Helmholtz equation by using the frameworks. The numerical results for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous cases illustrate that the preconditioned conjugate gradient method based on the proposed preconditioners has good stability in terms of the angular frequency, mesh parameters, and the number of degrees of freedom in each element.},

  abstract     = {Applying the latest parallel computing technology has become a recent trend in Eikonal equation solvers. Many recent studies have focused on parallelization of Eikonal solvers for multithreaded CPUs or single GPU systems. However, multi-GPU Eikonal solvers are largely underresearched owing to their complexity in terms of data and task management. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive domain decomposition method to realize an efficient implementation of the block-based fast iterative method on multiple GPUs. The proposed method progressively expands the computational domain assigned to each GPU to maximize load balancing and employs a locality-aware clustering algorithm to minimize inter-GPU communication overhead. We also propose various low- and high-level optimization techniques for GPU computing, such as overlapping CPU and GPU computation and inter-GPU data transfer using multiple CUDA streams. Thus, we effectively circumvent performance issues in the naïve parallelization using a regular decomposition method. The proposed method scales up to 6.6x for eight GPUs. We demonstrate that our efficient parallel implementation of the proposed method achieves an improvement in runtime performance under various experimental setups.},

PETSc TSAdjoint can compute the first-order derivative, that is, the gradient of a scalar functional, and the Hessian-vector product, which carries second-order derivative information, while requiring minimal input (a few callbacks) from the users.

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to design parareal algorithms in the context of thermostated molecular dynamics. In its original setup, the fine and coarse propagators used in the parareal algorithm solve the same dynamics with different time-steps, with the goal of achieving accuracy in the limit of small time-step of the integrators involved. This is typically not useful in molecular dynamics, where one is interested in extremely long trajectories and where the time-step of the fine propagator is in practice chosen as large as possible, that is, close to the limit of stability of the numerical scheme. In this article, we consider a version of the parareal algorithm which is better suited to molecular dynamics simulations, and wherein the propagators involved use the same time-step while employing different potential energy landscapes to drive the dynamics. Although the parareal algorithm always converges, it suffers from various limitations in this context: intermediate blow-up of the trajectory (which makes it impossible to postprocess) may be observed; in certain cases the trajectory encounters undefined values before converging (the way the algorithm handles them might depend on the computer architecture); the algorithm does not provide any computational gain in terms of wall-clock time (compared to a standard sequential integration) in the limit of increasingly long time horizons. We highlight these issues with numerical experiments and provide some elements of theoretical analysis. We then present a modified version of the parareal algorithm wherein the algorithm adaptively divides the entire time horizon into smaller time-slabs where the aforementioned issues are circumvented. Using numerical experiments on toy examples, we show that the adaptive algorithm overcomes the various limitations of the standard parareal algorithm, thereby allowing for significantly improved gains.},

By training a physics-informed generative model that generates “fake” sample paths, we aim to fit the observed particle ensemble distributions with a curve in the probability measure space, which is induced from the inferred particle dynamics. We employ different metrics to quantify the differences between distributions, e.g., the sliced Wasserstein distances and the adversarial losses in generative adversarial networks. We refer to this method as generative “ensemble-regression” (GER), in analogy to the classic “point-regression,” where we infer the dynamics by performing regression in the Euclidean space. We illustrate the GER by learning the drift and diffusion terms of particle ensembles governed by SODEs with Brownian motions and Lévy processes up to 100 dimensions. We also discuss how to treat cases with noisy or truncated observations. Apart from systems consisting of independent particles, we also tackle nonlocal interacting particle systems with unknown interaction potential parameters by constructing a physics-informed loss function. Finally, we investigate scenarios of paired observations and discuss how to reduce the dimensionality in such cases by proving a convergence theorem that provides theoretical support.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new preconditioner for a recently developed pressure-robust hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) finite element discretization of the Stokes equations. A feature of HDG methods is the straightforward elimination of degrees-of-freedom defined on the interior of an element. In our previous work [J. Sci. Comput., 77 (2018), pp. 1936--1952] we introduced a preconditioner for the case in which only the degrees-of-freedom associated with the element velocity were eliminated via static condensation. In this work we introduce a preconditioner for the statically condensed system in which the element pressure degrees-of-freedom are also eliminated. In doing so the number of globally coupled degrees-of-freedom are reduced, but at the expense of a more difficult problem to analyze. We will show, however, that the Schur complement of the statically condensed system is spectrally equivalent to a simple trace pressure mass matrix. This result is used to formulate a new, provably optimal preconditioner. Through numerical examples in two and three dimensions we show that the new preconditioned iterative method converges in fewer iterations, has superior conservation properties for inexact solves, and is faster in CPU time when compared to our previous preconditioner.},

The principal innovation that we introduce comes through the use of system response data that has been either measured or computed, without reference to any prescribed realization of the original model. Data are represented by sampled values of the transfer function or the impulse response corresponding to the original model. We discuss parallels that our approach bears with the Loewner framework, another popular data-driven method. We illustrate our approach numerically in both continuous-time and discrete-time cases.},

  abstract     = {We propose a space-time finite volume scheme on moving Chimera grids for a general advection-diffusion problem. Special care is devoted to grid overlapping zones in order to devise a compact and accurate discretization stencil to exchange information between different mesh patches. Like in the arbitrary high order derivatives method, the equations are discretized on a space-time slab. Thus, instead of time-dependent spatial transmission conditions between relatively moving grid blocks, we define interpolation polynomials on arbitrarily intersecting space-time cells at the block boundaries. Through this scheme, a mesh-free FEM-predictor/FVM-corrector approach is employed for representing the solution. In this discretization framework, a new space-time local Lax--Friederichs stabilization speed is defined by considering both the advective and the diffusive nature of the equation. The numerical illustrations for linear and nonlinear systems show that background and foreground moving meshes do not introduce spurious perturbation to the solution, uniformly reaching second order accuracy in space and time. Finally, it is shown that several foreground meshes, possibly overlapping and with independent displacements, can be employed thanks to this approach.},

  abstract     = {Fully implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK) methods have many desirable properties as time integration schemes in terms of accuracy and stability, but high-order IRK methods are not commonly used in practice with numerical PDEs due to the difficulty of solving the stage equations. This paper introduces a theoretical and algorithmic preconditioning framework for solving the systems of equations that arise from IRK methods applied to linear numerical PDEs (without algebraic constraints). This framework also naturally applies to discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in time. Under quite general assumptions on the spatial discretization that yield stable time integration, the preconditioned operator is proven to have condition number bounded by a small, order-one constant, independent of the spatial mesh and time-step size, and with only weak dependence on number of stages/polynomial order; for example, the preconditioned operator for 10th-order Gauss IRK has condition number less than two, independent of the spatial discretization and time step. The new method can be used with arbitrary existing preconditioners for backward Euler-type time-stepping schemes and is amenable to the use of three-term recursion Krylov methods when the underlying spatial discretization is symmetric. The new method is demonstrated to be effective on various high-order finite-difference and finite element discretizations of linear parabolic and hyperbolic problems, demonstrating fast, scalable solution of up to 10th-order accuracy. The new method consistently outperforms existing block preconditioning approaches, and in several cases, the new method can achieve 4th-order accuracy using Gauss integration with roughly half the number of preconditioner applications and wallclock time as required using standard diagonally IRK methods.},

  abstract     = {We propose a state redistribution method for high order discontinuous Galerkin methods on curvilinear embedded boundary grids. State redistribution relaxes the overly restrictive CFL condition that results from arbitrarily small cut cells and explicit time stepping. Thus, the scheme can take time steps that are proportional to the size of cells in the background grid. The discontinuous Galerkin scheme is stabilized by postprocessing the numerical solution after each stage or step of an explicit time stepping method. This is done by temporarily merging the small cells into larger, possibly overlapping neighborhoods using a special weighted inner product. Then, the numerical solution on the neighborhoods is returned to the base grid in a conservative fashion. The advantage of this approach is that it uses only basic mesh information that is already available in many cut cell codes and does not require complex geometric manipulations. Finally, we present a number of test problems that demonstrate the encouraging potential of this technique for applications on curvilinear embedded geometries. Numerical experiments reveal that our scheme converges with order $p+1$ in $L_1$ and between $p$ and $p+1$ in $L_\infty$ for problems with smooth solutions. We also demonstrate that state redistribution is capable of capturing shocks.},

We show exponential convergence in law and the validity of a central limit theorem for the Markov chains obtained via these integration methods, we show that a suggested integration scheme is consistent with asymptotic limits of the exact dynamics and can reproduce (in the short memory limit) a superconvergence property for the analogous splitting of underdamped Langevin dynamics. We then apply our proposed integration method to several model systems, including a Bayesian inference problem. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that our method outperforms other proposed GLE integration schemes in terms of the accuracy of sampling. Moreover, using a parameterization of the memory kernel in the GLE as proposed by Ceriotti, Bussi, and Parrinello Phys. Rev.

  abstract     = {Parallel-in-time methods have become increasingly popular in the simulation of time-dependent numerical PDEs, allowing for the efficient use of additional message passing interface processes when spatial parallelism saturates. Most methods treat the solution and parallelism in space and time separately. In contrast, all-at-once methods solve the full space-time system directly, largely treating time as simply another spatial dimension. All-at-once methods offer a number of benefits over separate treatment of space and time, most notably significantly increased parallelism and faster time to solution (when applicable). However, the development of fast, scalable all-at-once methods has largely been limited to time-dependent (advection-)diffusion problems. This paper introduces the concept of space-time block preconditioning for the all-at-once solution of incompressible flow. By extending well-known concepts of spatial block preconditioning to the space-time setting, we develop a block preconditioner whose application requires the solution of a space-time (advection-)diffusion equation in the velocity block, coupled with a pressure Schur complement approximation consisting of independent spatial solves at each time-step, and a space-time matrix-vector multiplication. The new method is tested on four classical models in incompressible flow. Results indicate perfect scalability in refinement of spatial and temporal mesh spacing, perfect scalability in nonlinear Picard iteration count when applied to a nonlinear Navier--Stokes problem, and minimal overhead in terms of number of preconditioner applications compared with sequential time-stepping.},

In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory-driven algorithm for computing the SRB density gradient defined for systems with high-dimensional unstable manifolds. We apply the concept of measure preservation together with the chain rule on smooth manifolds. Due to the recursive one-step nature of our derivations, the proposed procedure is memory-efficient and can be naturally integrated with existing Monte Carlo schemes widely used in computational chaotic dynamics.

We exploit the property that Schur complements arising in such problems can be well approximated by hierarchical matrices. An approximate factorization can be computed matrix-free and in a (quasi-)linear number of operations. The nested dissection is specifically designed to aid the factorization process using hierarchical matrices. We demonstrate the viability of the preconditioner on a range of two-dimensional problems, including the Helmholtz equation and the elastic wave equation. Throughout all tests, including wave phenomena with high wavenumbers, the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) with the proposed preconditioner converges in a very low number of iterations. The theoretical cost of the method is verified using numerical experiments, and the growth of off-diagonal ranks is studied for both $h$- and $p$-refinement.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-order models of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) where the solution is assumed as a linear combination of prescribed modes are rooted in a well-developed theory. However, more general models where the reduced solutions depend nonlinearly on time varying parameters have thus far been derived in an ad hoc manner. Here, we introduce reduced-order nonlinear solutions (RONS): a unified framework for deriving reduced-order models that depend nonlinearly on a set of time-dependent parameters. The set of all possible reduced-order solutions are viewed as a manifold immersed in the function space of the PDE. The parameters are evolved such that the instantaneous discrepancy between reduced dynamics and the full PDE dynamics is minimized. This results in a set of explicit ordinary differential equations on the tangent bundle of the manifold. In the special case of linear parameter dependence, our reduced equations coincide with the standard Galerkin projection. Furthermore, any number of conserved quantities of the PDE can readily be enforced in our framework. Since RONS does not assume an underlying variational formulation for the PDE, it is applicable to a broad class of problems. We demonstrate the efficacy of RONS on three examples: an advection-diffusion equation, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and Euler&#39;s equation for ideal fluids.},

  abstract     = {Multifidelity approximation is an important technique in scientific computation and simulation. In this paper, we introduce a bandit-learning approach for leveraging data of varying fidelities to achieve precise estimates of the parameters of interest. Under a linear model assumption, we formulate a multifidelity approximation as a modified stochastic bandit and analyze the loss for a class of policies that uniformly explore each model before exploiting. Utilizing the estimated conditional mean-squared error, we propose a consistent algorithm, adaptive explore-then-commit (AETC), and establish a corresponding trajectorywise optimality result. These results are then extended to the case of vector-valued responses, where we demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient without the need to worry about estimating high-dimensional parameters. The main advantage of our approach is that we require neither hierarchical model structure nor a priori knowledge of statistical information (e.g., correlations) about or between models. Instead, the AETC algorithm requires only knowledge of which model is a trusted high-fidelity model, along with (relative) computational cost estimates of querying each model. Numerical experiments are provided at the end to support our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {We present a new methodology for computing sensitivities in evolutionary systems using a model-driven low-rank approximation. To this end, we formulate a variational principle that seeks to minimize the distance between the time derivative of the reduced approximation and sensitivity dynamics. The first order optimality condition of the variational principle leads to a system of closed form evolution equations for an orthonormal basis and corresponding sensitivity coefficients. This approach allows for the computation of sensitivities with respect to a large number of parameters in an accurate and tractable manner by extracting correlations between different sensitivities on the fly. The presented method requires solving forward evolution equations, sidestepping the restrictions imposed by the forward/backward workflow of adjoint sensitivities. For example, the presented method, unlike the adjoint equation, does not impose any input/output load and can be used in applications in which real-time sensitivities are of interest. We demonstrate the utility of the method for three test cases: (1) computing sensitivity with respect to model parameters in the Rössler system, (2) computing sensitivity with respect to an infinite-dimensional forcing parameter in the chaotic Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and (3) computing sensitivity with respect to reaction parameters for species transport in a turbulent reacting flow.},

We show how the Gaussian belief propagation solver, known to work for symmetric matrices, can be modified to handle nonsymmetric matrices. Furthermore, we introduce a new algorithm for matrix inversion that corresponds to the generalized belief propagation derived from the cluster variation method. We relate these algorithms to LU and block LU decompositions and provide certain guarantees based on theorems from the theory of belief propagation. The proposed solvers can be accelerated within a framework of geometric multigrid. We benchmark the resulting multigrid method with a set of classical multigrid solvers based on incomplete LU, Chebyshev, and pattern Gauss--Seidel smoothers. The results indicate that Gaussian belief propagation can be used to construct competitive solvers, smoothers, and preconditioners for selected elliptic test problems.},

  abstract     = {Many problems in engineering can be understood as controlling the bifurcation structure of a given device. For example, one may wish to delay the onset of instability or bring forward a bifurcation to enable rapid switching between states. We propose a numerical technique for controlling the bifurcation diagram of a nonlinear partial differential equation by varying the shape of the domain. Specifically, we are able to delay or advance a given branch point to a target parameter value. The algorithm consists of solving a shape optimization problem constrained by an augmented system of equations, the Moore--Spence system, that characterize the location of the branch points. Numerical experiments on the Allen--Cahn, Navier--Stokes, and hyperelasticity equations demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in a wide range of settings.},

  abstract     = {Recently proposed numerical algorithms for solving high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) based on neural networks have shown their remarkable performance. We review some of them and study their convergence properties. The methods rely on probabilistic representation of PDEs by backward stochastic differential equations and their iterated time discretization. Our proposed algorithm, called the deep backward multistep (MDBDP) scheme, is a machine learning version of the least square multistep-forward dynamic programming scheme of Gobet and Turkedjiev [Math. Comp., 85, 2016, pp. 1359--1391]. It estimates simultaneously by backward induction the solution and its gradient by neural networks through sequential minimizations of suitable quadratic loss functions that are performed by stochastic gradient descent. Our main theoretical contribution is to provide an approximation error analysis of the MDBDP scheme as well as the deep splitting scheme for semilinear PDEs designed by Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A3135--A3154]. We also supplement the error analysis of the deep learning backward dynamic programming (DBDP) scheme of Huré, Pham, and Warin [Math. Comp., 89 (2020), pp. 1547--1580]. This yields notably convergence rate in terms of the number of neurons for a class of deep Lipschitz continuous GroupSort neural networks when the PDE is linear in the gradient of the solution for the MDBDP scheme, and in the semilinear case for the DBDP scheme. We illustrate our results with some numerical tests that are compared with some other machine learning algorithms in the literature.},

Under natural restrictions on the low-order refined space we prove that both the high-to-low-order and low-to-high-order linear mappings are conservative, constant preserving, and high-order accurate. While the proof holds for affine geometries, numerical experiments indicate that the results hold for more general curved meshes.
