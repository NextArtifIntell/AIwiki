A key insight is how to combine both statistical and physical properties in the process of an STSR network. Therefore, we elaborately design stacked convolutional layers and Transformer blocks to extract shallow and deep features. Besides, we employ an automatic differentiation process for solving the physical constraints. Unlike existing physics-informed solutions, our method is able to solve flow processes with uncertain boundary and initial conditions. Based on two typical flow simulations, we compare our method with the state-of-the-art physics-constrained model and a CNN-based baseline model . Our framework outperforms these methods in both PSNR and SSIM metrics and produces visually the best results. We also test our method at the large spatio-temporal scale, and the high-resolution outputs present stable performances.},

  abstract     = {Hypergraphs have become a powerful tool in many research fields that benefit from its high-order characteristics, such as network analysis, data mining and deep learning . The construction of hypergraphs plays an important role in subsequent tasks that are based on the hypergraph structure. The k-nearest neighbor method is widely used in hypergraph construction because of its low computational complexity and high data density. However, it only considers the relationship between the central vertex and the k nearest neighbors (or adjacent vertices) and does not consider if the other vertices are adjacent as well. Maximal clique enumeration algorithms can construct hyperedges where all vertices are adjacent, but the time cost is relatively large. In this paper, we introduce a CLIQUES-SEED algorithm, based on CLIQUES algorithm, which reduces the number of recursions required in the search process, and transforms the time complexity into space complexity, reducing the time complexity from O ( 3 n / 3 ) O(3n/3) to O ( n 2 / 3 ) O(n2/3) in the worst case. We implemented the algorithm on FPGA to realize the parallel algorithm . We also conducted experiments on the hypergraph neural networks using the CLIQUES-SEED algorithm to improve the hypergraphs construction in hypergraph neural networks . The maximum classification accuracy improvement rate was 6.7\% compared with the k-nearest neighbor method. The results show that our method can quickly obtain more accurate hypergraphs using maximal clique enumeration algorithm.},

  abstract     = {To reduce optimization time spent on real-world expensive multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), a relatively large number of points added in each cycle is an effective way to push the Pareto front approximation to the optimal Pareto front as more time-consuming experiments can be performed in a parallel manner. In this study, an enhanced multi-point infill criterion, namely, nearest-neighbor Euclidean distance-based pseudo-expected hypervolume improvement ( PEHVI nne PEHVInne ), is proposed to enhance the efficiency of the convergence during the process of point infills, particularly when a relatively large number of point infills are added. This criterion is calculated by multiplying the traditional expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) criterion by the nearest-neighbor Euclidean distance-based pseudo-expected improvement matrix ( PEIM nne PEIMnne ) criterion. Therefore, the effective information of an evaluation point with a huge potential for improvement, and the crowding distances between this point and the nearest-neighbor Pareto front points around it can be considered simultaneously. The proposed criterion was compared with the EHVI and Euclidean distance-based pseudo-expected improvement matrix ( PEIM e PEIMe ) criteria for multi-objective benchmarks. The results show that the proposed criterion enhances the efficiency and convergence of the EHVI criterion for most benchmarks. Moreover, the PEHVI nne PEHVInne can either converge better than the PEIM e PEIMe with the same efficiency or converge to a close-level Pareto front with higher efficiency as more points in each cycle can be selected to add. Therefore, the PEHVI nne PEHVInne is more suitable as a highly efficient criterion for seeking an acceptable-quality Pareto front with less time in multi-objective optimization (MOO). In addition, the influence of the optimizer on the proposed criterion was investigated. The results indicate that the PEHVI nne PEHVInne has some internal robustness even if the convergence level of the optimizer significantly influences its performance, which can help to set up an optimizer.},

As opposed to the well known network filters that rely on preserving key topological properties of the realized network, our method treats the spectrum as the fundamental object and preserves spectral properties . Applying asymptotic theory of high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation, we show that the proposed filter can be tuned to interpolate between zero filtering to maximal filtering that induces sparsity via thresholding, while having the least spectral distance from a consistent (non-)linear shrinkage estimator. We demonstrate the application of our proposed filter by applying it to covariance networks constructed from financial data, to extract core subnetworks embedded in full networks.},

The latter is on the basis of time second-order splitting technique to develop accurate, efficient, linear and decoupled difference scheme. A main idea of the latter is to split the original fractional KGZ system into linear and nonlinear parts , and then to advance the subproblems with three stages. Furthermore, by utilizing the cut-off technique, energy analysis method and mathematical induction method, we obtain the error estimates of the former scheme, without any restrictive conditions on the grid ratio, compared with the restrictive conditions demanded in the existing literature. The feature of proposed schemes are linear decoupled, and easy to be applied in parallel computing , especially in long time simulations. At last, some numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes, and simulate wave dynamics and interaction of the fractional KGZ system in one and two dimensions.},

The method is appropriate for systems in which multiple, noisy, partial observations are available (e.g. citizen weather stations or smart phones). The method is demonstrated for: (i) deterministic dynamics with uncertain initial conditions, (ii) multiple noisy observations of a randomly forced ordinary differential equation (ODE), (iii) observations from multiple sample paths from a stochastic differential equation (SDE). A bi-modal measure and a measure supported on a strange attractor are tested. The numerical results show that our method performs a relatively small Wasserstein distance which measures the approximation performance.

In the FTL algorithm, the random parameter ω may not give enough exploration to the particles, which may lead to local stagnation problems. One of the solutions to this problem can be the replacement of the random parameter ω by a chaotic variable. For a detailed study on the chaotic behavior of ω in FTL, the algorithm is implemented with ten different chaotic maps and tested on twenty-four standard benchmark functions . Thereafter, the best chaos FTL (cFTL) algorithm is tested on six different complex real engineering problems and compared with ten meta-heuristic algorithms. Moreover, to further validate the performance of cFT, it has been applied to ten standard classification datasets collected from UCI and Kaggle data repositories.

Existing evaluation methods struggle to balance accuracy and speed: centrality-based methods are quick but lack accuracy, while impact-based methods are precise but have high computational complexity . Approaches in the complex network field do not consider the business relationships in the inter-domain routing network, so their results may not match reality. This paper proposes a novel method for node importance evaluation in the inter-domain routing networks, called NIE-GAT. The key idea of NIE-GAT is to map a node’s static features to its dynamic cascading failure impact by a deep learning model based on the graph attention network. Additionally, several node centrality features based on the business relationships are defined. A method for calculating node impact labels with the cascading failure model is also designed. The experimental results on real inter-domain routing networks of different scales show that the evaluation accuracy of NIE-GAT for the top 3\% nodes reaches more than 93\%, which is over 7\% higher than the existing best method. For large-scale networks with more than ten thousand nodes, NIE-GAT can complete the evaluation within 2 min.},

A prominent instance of such a dynamical system is the system of equations governing fluid dynamics. Recent research results indicate that RL-augmented computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers can exceed the current state of the art, for example in the field of turbulence modeling . However, while in supervised learning, the training data can be generated a priori in an offline manner, RL requires constant run-time interaction and data exchange with the CFD solver during training. In order to leverage the potential of RL-enhanced CFD, the interaction between the CFD solver and the RL algorithm thus has to be implemented efficiently on high-performance computing (HPC) hardware. To this end, we present Relexi as a scalable RL framework that bridges the gap between machine learning workflows and modern CFD solvers on HPC systems, providing both components with its specialized hardware. Relexi is built with modularity in mind and allows easy integration of various HPC solvers by means of the in-memory data transfer provided by the SmartSim library. Here, we demonstrate that the Relexi framework can scale up to hundreds of parallel environments on thousands of cores. This allows to leverage modern HPC resources to either enable larger problems or faster turnaround times. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of an RL-augmented CFD solver by finding a control strategy for optimal eddy viscosity selection in large eddy simulations.},

  abstract     = {In dynamical systems , it is advantageous to identify regions of flow which can exhibit maximal influence on nearby behaviour. Hyperbolic Lagrangian Coherent Structures have been introduced to obtain two-dimensional surfaces which maximise repulsion or attraction in three-dimensional dynamical systems with arbitrary time-dependence. However, the numerical method to compute them requires obtaining derivatives associated with the system, often performed through the approximation of divided differences, which can lead to significant numerical error and numerical noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for the numerical calculation of hyperbolic Lagrangian Coherent Structures using Differential Algebra called DA-LCS. As a form of automatic forward differentiation, it allows direct computation of the Taylor expansion of the flow, its derivatives, and the eigenvectors of the associated strain tensor, with all derivatives obtained algebraically and to machine precision. It does so without a priori information about the system, such as variational equations or explicit derivatives. We demonstrate that this can provide significant improvements in the accuracy of the Lagrangian Coherent Structures identified compared to finite-differencing methods in a series of test cases drawn from the literature. We also show how DA-LCS uncovers additional dynamical behaviour in a real-world example drawn from astrodynamics.},

  abstract     = {Effective and reliable biomarker is a promising means to achieve early diagnosis of cancer. The availability of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data opens an unprecedented opportunity of discovering biomarkers by developing machine learning and feature selection methods. At present, the existing biomarker screening methods, such as recursive feature elimination (RFE), often treat genes as isolated features, ignoring their embedding complex network relationship. In addition, the interpretability of a cancer biomarker discovery model is as important as its classification accuracy . To address these problems, we propose a game theoretic method to discover gene modules serving as biomarkers on gene regulatory network (GRN) that can better distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples with healthy ones. Specifically, the network-based game theory method, called NGTM, is an interpretable module exploration of supervised feature selection procedure. We regard the process of gene-to-model selection as a cooperative game. The contribution of each feature in combination is evaluated by cooperative game theoretic metrics, that is, Shapley values. The extension strategy of gene module is conducted on GRN in the form of subnetwork , and NGTM makes the biomarker recognition easily interpretable. Furthermore, our method is statistically verified by Akaike information criterion (AIC) in model selection. There is a strong correlation between AIC and the area under curve in classification. In comparison study, we test the wrapper RFE and random feature extraction methods on random forest under the same conditions. NGTM achieves relatively better classification performances which prove its advantage. The enriched dysfunctions in biomarkers are also consistent with prior knowledge of the occurrence and development of HCC.},

  abstract     = {Meshless methods for in silico modeling and simulation of cardiac electrophysiology are gaining more and more popularity. These methods do not require a mesh and are more suitable than the Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate the activity of complex geometrical structures like the human heart. However, challenges such as numerical integration accuracy and time efficiency remain, which limit their applicability. Recently, the Fragile Points Method (FPM) has been introduced in the meshless methods family. It uses local, simple, polynomial, discontinuous functions to construct trial and test functions in the Galerkin weak form. This allows for accurate integration and improved efficiency while enabling the imposition of essential and natural boundary conditions as in FEM. In this work, we consider the application of FPM for cardiac electrophysiology simulation. We derive the cardiac monodomain model using the FPM formulation and we solve several benchmark problems in 2D and 3D. We show that FPM leads to solutions of accuracy and efficiency similar to FEM while alleviating the need for a mesh. Additionally, FPM demonstrates comparable convergence to FEM in the considered benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The complex multifactorial diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) are characterised by two factors: genomics and the variability in environment. The goal of studying the control vs diseases cohorts is to understand that what biological pathways are perturbed in the manifestation of the disease. Although many genetic mutations are associated with the disease, they have varying rate of risk among different patients. This is due the different genomic landscape and environmental conditions that varies from individual to individual. This raises a question that how different set of mutations are linked to the manifestation of the same disease? This can be answered by identifying the consensus gene/biological pathways that are perturbed under disease condition even if the disease has manifested through different set of mutations. To understand this we propose a network-based strategy for gene prioritisation that combines the knowledge of disease associated mutations and the expression pattern of genes in different samples from patients and healthy-controls. The network comprises of three layers, first being the genes with PD associated mutations. The third or target layer comprises of the core pathways associated with PD pathology and the middle layer is composed interacting partners between these two layers. A scoring mechanism for edges was developed using gene expression profiles across different samples and the busiest routes/paths were discovered between the first and the third layer. The results highlight a subset of genes from the middle layer of the network and could classify between the control vs patients sample using machine learning algorithm and are significantly associated with PD pathways.},

  abstract     = {A simplified immersed boundary (IB) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is developed in this study for simulating incompressible flows with heat transfer. The no-slip and constant temperature boundary conditions are both enforced by correcting the distribution functions. Similar to the previous distribution function correction (DFC)-IB method (S. Tao et al., 2021 [59]), the kinetic nature of LBM has been retained in the present scheme, which directly modifies the distribution functions other than models the interface as a source of IB force in the boundary treatment. However, this study presents two improvements. First, we reduce the number of distribution functions that need to be modified, and hence the computation load of the method can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, the correction term can be determined directly and explicitly, replacing the calculation of a local position-related adjustment parameter in the previous DFC-IB method. As a result, the computed velocity and temperature at the interface are consistent with their desired counterparts, and hence the Dirichlet boundary conditions can be accurately specified. The present simplified DFC IB method is validated in the simulations with both stationary and moving boundaries, including the flow past a hot cylinder, mixed convection in a square lid-driven cavity, and sedimentation of a particle in a long channel. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method.},

This paper illustrates the predictive ability of EnRML on several examples where we assimilate local extra-deep electromagnetic logs.

The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed GSHHO-FKNN has identified that ground grass opacity (GGO) and bronchovascular bundle were distinctive CT phenomenon of influenza pneumonia. Furthermore, the number of procalcitonin (PCT) and white blood cells (WBC) in the cases of influenza pneumonia were notable from those in the cases of bacterial pneumonia. In addition, an interesting result was that the absolute value of eosinophils, platelet and flake shadow in influenza pneumonia cases was more abnormal than those of bacterial pneumonia cases. It proved that the GSHHO-FKNN model was an effective method for discriminating influenza pneumonia from community acquired pneumonia, leading to accurate diagnosis against pathogenic microorganisms.},

  abstract     = {The Quantum Clustering (QC) method begins by generating a wave function for estimating the data points’ density distribution, which is the sum of Gaussian kernels to the data points’ centers. It then forms the corresponding potential function and finally locates clusters, emphasizing the potential function’s minimums. This process is highly sensitive to the kernel bandwidth in the Schrödinger equation that controls the shape of the Gaussian kernel and affects the clustering result . This paper proposes an Apollonius Circle-based Quantum Clustering (ACQC) method, which adaptively and automatically sets the kernel bandwidth without any prior knowledge regarding the data points and clusters. ACQC is the first attempt to achieve such an adaptive kernel bandwidth through the Apollonius region’s neighborhood construction. The wave function is estimated based on data points in the neighborhood group constructed by Apollonius circles to optimize ACQC calculations. The experimental results of ACQC compared to the original QC method indicate an improvement in calculation efficiency by approximately a 38.3\% reduction in terms of running time and a 41.17\% improvement in detecting the correct number of clusters. Extensive experiments on four synthetic and 20 real-world datasets show that ACQC outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.

  abstract     = {Cloud computing (CC) has become a major topic of study in recent years, providing a cost-effective deployment framework for hosting and running workflows. It is considered as the leading model for distributed computing due to its elasticity, speed, and pay-per-use model. Running scientific applications in the cloud environment with a number of criteria remains a great challenge for researchers, because it requires a robust infrastructure with high computing performance , communication and storage capabilities. Most previous works designed for cloud environments examine the fixed number of resources and aims only to reduce runtime. This has forced scientists to develop the workflow scheduling (WFS) optimization algorithms that strike the right balance between the three main qualities of service (QoS) parameters: time, cost and resource utilization. Due to its substantial implications for the front end and back end of the cloud research business, resource utilization is undoubtedly an important factor that should be taken into consideration. When efficient resource usage is performed in the cloud, good load balancing is obtained. To address the preceding problems, we propose in this paper an innovative workflow scheduling technique in the cloud employing the Pathfinder algorithm (PFA) and the oppositional-based learning algorithm (OBL). The proposed scheduler focused on three objectives (i.e., total execution time , cost, and resource utilization). Simulation tests are carried out using the workflowsim toolkit to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested approach. The results of the experiments proved that the proposed OBLPFA algorithm outperforms other algorithms called (Particle Swarm technique (PSO), dragonfly (DFA), the Arithmetic Optimization Technique (AOA), the Reptile Search technique (RSA), the Aquila Optimization method (AO), and Lion Optimization method (LOA)) in terms of total execution time , cost, and resource utilization.},

We propose a complex multi-population memetic strategy HMS combined with the Petrov–Galerkin method stabilized by the Demkowicz operator to overcome these obstacles. The paper delivers a rigorous mathematical formulation of the strategy as well as a theoretical motivation for common inverse/forward error scaling, which significantly reduces the computational cost of the strategy. The presented theory is illustrated with two examples. The first one shows the analytical construction of the Demkowicz operator.

To achieve the proposed diagnosis approach, a signal model for faulty current and a function of residual error are used for the formulation of a nonlinear least-square problem.

  abstract     = {Despite the fact that Iran is one of the main world&#39;s stone producers with more than 6000 stone-cutting centers, its share barely holds one percent of the world market. The industry, hence, awaits effective measures to increase its exports of building stone products. It is assumed in the present study that public-private partnership based on a win-win approach might not only facilitate foreign trades by different industries but also enhance export opportunities and improve production efficiency. Accordingly, efforts are made in the present study to investigate both production and supply networks in conjunction with the hitherto less heeded demand allocation. It is the objective to exploit functional criteria in each of these networks that will guarantee efficiency and functional values based on domestic and international demands. The way each player participates in its respective network and handles feedback from other players depends on the his/her conditions and the performance of the various players/components of the network they are part of. To determine these parameters, use is made in this study of the network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) with the efficiency of each industrial unit in the network considered as the weight of that unit within a game theoretic framework . More specifically, given the importance of exports and trade commodities as well as the great impacts such industrial units as R&amp;D and sales departments have on international markets and marketing, the weights associated with each industrial unit is calculated via the network data envelopment analysis that takes into account not only the effects of all the network components but also those of the parameters affecting their efficiency. Thus, all the factors involved in the evaluation of the supply chain are initially identified based on the SCOR model and the balanced scorecard that additionally includes sustainability criteria. The model is implemented on the data extracted from a survey of 10 stone-cutting plants, the supply chain network of which is determined based on a study of their structures and the criteria considered in the relevant sub-networks. In a subsequent stage, after implementing PCA, the NDEA model is solved for each of the subnetworks in GAMS software and the efficiency of each plant is obtained using the weights obtained from the demand allocation model within a game theoretic framework . The output from the model solved in GAMS indicates that, compared to the current situation, application of the integrated model proposed in this study leads to a significant increase in the profits gained from each customer demand; the profits earned is expressed as the number of orders placed with each plant.},

However, due to not offering good asymptotic complexity in its runtime, it performs very poorly both in the worst case and in the average case for most large data collections. In this article we offer a new sorting algorithm based on orderer block insertions with worst case optimal time. At the cost of an additional memory space of n k nk words, for any constant k k , our algorithm is able to easily transform it into an in-place algorithm with a time of o ( n 2 ) o(n2) in the worst case. Empirically, our method outperforms insertionsort in all the different cases tested, even for small input collections. Furthermore, our experiments show that, for small or large datasets from either of the two main probability distributions—Uniform and Normal; our algorithms also outperform any traditional method like quicksort , mergesort or heapsort , and even better than the efficient hybrid algorithm introsort — std::sort() method provided by the GNU C++ Standard Library.},

Then we propose a transfer learning scheme with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based k-means clustering algorithm, the so-called TLDK method, to enhance CNN-GRU model for multiple patients. In this method, we employ k-means to cluster the patients based on approximate components of PW data obtained from DWT. Next, a base CNN-GRU model trained on one patient is transferred to other patients within each cluster by freezing parameters of partial layers. As a result, TLDK avoids training models individually for each patient from scratch and improves the generalization ability of models. The numerical results based on MIMIC dataset show that the proposed method is time-saving while achieving superior performance. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied efficiently for convenient BP estimation for multiple patients.},

  abstract     = {A novel mesh refinement sensor is proposed for lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) applicable to either static or dynamic mesh refinement algorithms. The sensor exploits the kinetic nature of LBMs by evaluating the departure of distribution functions from their local equilibrium state. This sensor is first compared, in a qualitative manner, to three state-of-the-art sensors: (1) the vorticity norm, (2) the Q-criterion, and (3) spatial derivatives of the vorticity. This comparison shows that our kinetic sensor is the most adequate candidate to propose tailored mesh structures across a wide range of physical phenomena: incompressible, compressible subsonic/supersonic single phase, and weakly compressible multiphase flows. As a more quantitative validation, the sensor is then used to produce the computational mesh for two existing open-source LB solvers based on inhomogeneous, block-structured meshes with static and dynamic refinement algorithms, implemented in the Palabos and AMROC-LBM software, respectively. The sensor is first used to generate a static mesh to simulate the turbulent 3D lid-driven cavity flow using Palabos. AMROC-LBM is then adopted to confirm the ability of our sensor to dynamically adapt the mesh to reach the steady state of the 2D lid-driven cavity flow. Both configurations show that our sensor successfully produces meshes of high quality and allows to save computational time.},

This paper adopts a version of block-column iterative methods with nonnegativity constraints (BCI-NC) for solving the subproblems and presents an efficient algorithm in NMF decomposition based on the ANLS framework. The advantages of this method include simplicity and ease of implementation. Also, BCI-NC determines the step lengths without time-consuming line searches, unlike the existing ones. Numerical experiments on real-world image and text datasets show that the proposed algorithm is efficient. We observe that BCI-NC provides the best performance in balancing between accuracy and computation time.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series forecasting has been a critical issue in various fields, such as economics, traffic, solar energy, and engine data. Traditional methods focus on the pattern of each variate without internal relations. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in describing node dependence. The key to using GNNs in multivariate time-series forecasting is to obtain a reliable graph structure, which is not given in advance for most cases. Widely used adaptive graph construct algorithms are based on the cosine similarity of nodes or features mapped to a high-dimensional space. This study introduced a simple assumption that a stable pattern is hidden in the nodes. Furthermore, most GNNs use a constant graph without considering time-varying factors. A model referred to as the multichannel fusion graph neural network (MCFGNN) is proposed in this study. It designs triple channels to capture meta-feature, time-varying, and global-stabilize graphs. The overall architecture comprises a graph construct, graph convolution, and temporal convolution, which is an end-to-end framework. The mix-hop model was used for the graph convolution, whereas the dilated convolution model was applied to extract the hidden temporal feature. Experiments on traffic and engine datasets show that MCFGNN can perform better than the other state-of-the-art methods.},

In general, there are two ways to increase the critical step size. One is to reduce the stiffness of the spatially discretized system, while the other is to design time-marching schemes with larger stability regions. In this paper, we focus on the recently proposed explicit generalized- α α method for second-order hyperbolic equations and increase the critical step size by reducing the stiffness of the isogeometric-discretized system. In particular, we apply boundary penalization to lessen the system’s stiffness. For p p th order C p − 1 Cp−1 isogeometric elements, we show numerically that the critical step size increases by a factor of p 2 − 3 p + 6 4 p2−3p+64 , which indicates the advantages of using the proposed method, especially for high-order elements.

Spectral clustering , in its original form, is a two-step method. First, a new representation in which data points could be easily clustered is found. Then, a simple clustering algorithm like k k -means is applied. In this paper, we propose a novel and highly accurate method for spectral clustering, called spectral clustering via augmented Lagrangian (SCAL). Specifically, we formalize the spectral clustering problem as a constrained optimization problem , which is challenging to solve due to the orthogonality constraint. This constraint ensures the orthogonality of the dimensions of the new representation where samples of a specific cluster are as close as possible to each other. We then use the augmented Lagrangian method to dispose of the orthogonality constraint and form a new unconstrained cost function. Finally, the new unconstrained problem is solved using the Adam optimization technique. The proposed method is compared to the state-of-the-art methods using synthetic and real-world datasets. Results show that SCAL significantly outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy.},

Theoretically, however, the event of the asteroid falling into Earth, causing the tsunami, is possible since there are over 27,000 near-Earth asteroids [1] , and the Earth’s surface is covered in 71 percent by water. We introduce a novel graph-grammar-based framework for asteroid tsunami simulations. Our framework adaptively generates the computational mesh of the Earth model. It is built from triangular elements representing the seashore and the seabed. The computational mesh is represented as a graph, with graph vertices representing the computational mesh element’s interiors and edges. Mesh refinements are often performed by the longest-edge refinement algorithm. We have expressed this algorithm by only two graph-grammar productions. The resulting graph represents the terrain approximating the topography with a prescribed accuracy. We generalize the graph-grammar mesh refinement algorithm to work on the entire Earth model, allowing the generation of the terrain topography, including the seabed. Having the seashore and the seabed represented by a graph, we introduce the finite element method simulations of the tsunami wave propagation. We illustrate the framework with simulations of the disastrous asteroid falling into the Baltic sea.},

  abstract     = {While agent-based modeling (ABM) has become one of the most powerful tools in quantitative social sciences, it remains difficult to explain their structure and performance. We propose to use artificial intelligence both to build the models from data, and to improve the way we communicate models to stakeholders. Although machine learning is actively employed for pre-processing data, here for the first time, we used it to facilitate model development of a simulation model directly from data. Our suggested framework, ML-ABM accounts for causality and feedback loops in a complex nonlinear system and at the same time keeps it transparent for stakeholders. As a result, beside the development of a behavioral ABM, we open the ‘blackbox’ of purely empirical models. With our approach, artificial intelligence in the simulation field can open a new stream in modeling practices and provide insights for future applications.},

  abstract     = {Computing the numerical solution of the Kadanoff–Baym equations, a set of nonlinear integral differential equations satisfied by the two-time Green’s functions derived from many-body perturbation theory for a quantum many-body system away from equilibrium, is a challenging task. Recently, we have successfully applied dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to construct a data driven reduced order model that can be used to extrapolate the time-diagonal of a two-time Green’s function from numerical solutions of the KBE within a small time window. In this paper, we extend the previous work and use DMD to predict off-diagonal elements of the two-time Green’s function. We partition the two-time Green’s function into a number of one-time functions along the diagonal and subdiagonals of the two-time window as well as in horizontal and vertical directions. We use DMD to construct separate reduced order models to predict the dynamics of these one-time functions in a two-step procedure. We extrapolate along diagonal and several subdiagonals within a subdiagonal band of a two-time window in the first step. In the second step, we use DMD to extrapolate the Green’s function outside of the sub-diagonal band. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach by applying it to a two-band Hubbard model problem.},

Most sensors are battery powered and commonly collect data in short and equally spaced time periods resulting with large amount of redundant and often irrelevant data. In this paper, we propose a dynamic monitoring frequency (DMF) algorithm that aims at collecting data only when sensor readings change by more than a predefined value between consecutive readings. Thus, a sensor is turned on only when a change in monitored phenomenon value exceeds a predefined threshold. Two algorithms are analyzed, namely statistical and machine learning . DMF shows notable performance, resulting either with up to ∼ 70\% ∼70\% less missed readings, or it collects up to ∼ 40\% ∼40\% less data compared to the baseline algorithm that collects data with static monitoring frequency.},

The numerical results proved that the proposed method gives much better and more accurate results than the standard VIM method, as the effect of adding the parameter to the VIM method and its calculation method was clear in improving the method and increasing the convergence of the solution, where we solved several examples of ordinary and partial fractional differential equations. In addition, the fractional Kawahara and foam drainage equations have also been solved. All results were obtained using the Mathematica® 12 program. The results were also compared with the optimal Adomian decomposition method (ADM), and the proposed method showed higher efficiency and better accuracy.},

They are time-consuming and resource-intensive applications that profit from operating within distributed platforms, like cloud computing . However, the cloud presents several challenges that must be addressed to employ workflow applications efficiently. Although the workflow scheduling problem has been broadly examined, it still attracts attention. Furthermore, in the literature, little research has been conducted taking into consideration the data placement process in parallel with the execution of task scheduling . Hence, this paper proposes a task scheduling and data placement strategy to reduce the number of data movements between cloud data centers . The suggested strategy uses an algorithm based on the fuzzy clustering method Interval Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means (IT2FCM) and the meta-heuristic optimization technique Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to minimize data movements throughout the workflow’s execution. The proposed strategy is evaluated through a simulation process using various well-known scientific workflows of different sizes. Additionally, the outcomes show that our strategy is more reliable than the most recent state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {In machine learning , feature selection is the intrinsic factor that contributes to the success of a model. Due to the rise of deep learning in recent years, this process sometimes can be overlooked. The reason is because neural networks enable automatic feature extraction — the ability to select relevant features from the feature space without manual intervention. While this is a powerful technique when the data samples are images, it is not straight-forward in application-based samples. In this work, we explore the use of machine learning in Android application classification. We start with a research question: “Given a classification problem on the same dataset, why do several proposed models achieve considerably good performance, despite the fact that they use different training features?”. We hypothesize two reasons for this phenomenon: (1) the models overfit the dataset in question, and (2) the features are non-i.i.d (Independent and Identically Distributed). We confirm these cases by reviewing previous studies on the same datasets. By analyzing the mapping between components in Android, we conclude that the strong correlations among them allow machine learning models to learn efficiently with just the subset of those features. Experiments are conducted to realize that a feedforward DNN or CNN , when provided with sufficient features, can generalize as well as complicated ones. The findings show that it is possible to train application classifiers on less features and simpler network architectures with inconsiderable performance degradation .},

Different computational methods for PPI detection have recently been proposed, but most of them have used either node attributes or graph structure information. Meanwhile, it has been found that integrating node attributes into graph structure information could be potentially helpful in other complex networks. In the present research, a graph embedding method is suggested to incorporate these two kinds of information for the efficiency of several downstream tasks such as predicting interaction between proteins. At first, an enriched denser graph is reconstructed with graph structure information and protein evolutionary information. Then, a biased random walk model is used to produce sequences of proteins, and finally these sequences are given to skip-gram with negative sampling model to learn the low-dimensional representation of each protein. The proposed method is evaluated on several real-world datasets. The outcomes present the efficiency and effectiveness of the suggested method in comparison with the other methods.},

It is crucial to develop an efficient control mechanism for the FES system as it acts on the human musculoskeletal system which presents noise and uncertainties. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel control method for efficient operation of the FES system. In this regard, a proportional-integral-derivative controller with filter (PID-F) mechanism is proposed for the first time in literature for efficient operation of the FES system. Besides, a novel multi-strategy based weighted mean of vectors algorithm (m-INFO) is also developed using a modified opposition-based learning and Lévy flight mechanism together with Nelder-Mead simplex search method. Unimodal, multimodal, low-dimensional and CEC2019 benchmark functions are used to demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed m-INFO algorithm against several other metaheuristic optimizers. The proposed m-INFO algorithm is then used as an efficient tool to design the PID-F controlled FES system. To achieve optimal tuning, a simple yet effective objective function is also proposed. The excellent ability of the developed m-INFO algorithm-based PID-F controller for FES system is demonstrated through comparative statistical, transient response and frequency response analyses using original weighted mean of vectors, marine predators and moth-flame optimization algorithms based PID-F controlled FES systems.},

Such anodes demonstrate high efficiency as opposed to similar anodes with supporting plates made of other metals. The creation of monovacancies in silicene increases the capacity of the anode. The ultimate stresses and strains of a nickel plate and a silicene sheet under uniaxial tension are calculated. When lithium is intercalated into the silicene channel, significant fluctuations in the value of its self-diffusion coefficient are observed. The most significant effect of polyvacancies in the channel walls on the lithium packing in it is manifested at small values of the number of nearest neighbors and small angles of their mutual arrangement. Four- and five-membered rings are most often found in packings of lithium atoms in a channel. The strength of silicene with monovacancies and its adhesion to the nickel plate are sufficient to ensure long and trouble-free operation of the anode in LIB.},

  abstract     = {The presence of the internet of things allows various smart devices to be connected and interact with each other. Although IoT provides benefits in daily activities, however, with the presence of new technologies, IoT is vulnerable to new types of attacks. The massive IoT traffic results in a large number of traffic features and constructs complex network that makes intrusion detection systems (IDSs) require large resources to identify the type of attacks. On the other hand, most of the intrusion detection techniques are not feasible for IoT networks because they require more computing resources for attack detection, while IoT devices have limited computing resources and storage capacity. Thus, a lightweight IDS that has ability to identify new types of attacks is required. This research proposes a hybrid of Panigrahi and PSO-Search approaches to reduce the complexity of the network by eliminating the number of irrelevant features effectively and efficiently and combine with Random Forest optimization method to improve detection performance. The proposed IDS is validated with training and testing data, using hold-out, Stratified k-fold cross-validation, and percentage split test mode on CICIDS-2017 dataset MachineLearningCSV version. The dataset is chosen, as it represents real IoT network traffic data. Experimental results show that the performance improvement of the proposed hybrid IDS is very encouraging. The accuracy rate reaches 99.9\%, with an average Recall value of 1.000.},

We establish an edge-centered scheme based on the flux continuity. The main feature of the scheme lies in the fact that the approximate solutions as well as the gradients are determined by using a linear combination of special solutions. These special solutions are required to satisfy the homogeneous form of approximated equations on the local cell. This brings two important assets to numerical solution of the problems. First, the scheme efficiently tailors itself fit into the local properties of the solution, so that it exhibits robustness to mesh distortion and can correctly reproduce the details of the interface layers even without refining the mesh. Second, the flux can be approximated in terms of the edge-centered unknowns defined at the local cell and the unknowns at the adjacent cells are not needed. The local stencil makes writing code for the continuity condition of the flux on each edge easier. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the performance of the scheme with or without discontinuities on various types of distorted quadrilateral meshes.},

In this study we consider Dirichlet problems for scalar linear partial differential equations , though the methodology can be extended to non-linear problems. The utilization of tensor product finite elements allows us to construct a global system of linear algebraic equations that only relies on the finite element infrastructure of the lower dimensional subdomains contained in FEniCS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in four distinctive test cases. The first test case is a Poisson equation posed in a four dimensional domain which is a Cartesian product of two unit squares solved using the classical Galerkin finite element method . The second test case is the wave equation in space–time, where the computational domain is a Cartesian product of a two dimensional space grid and a one dimensional time interval. In this second case we also employ the Galerkin method. The third test case is an advection dominated advection–diffusion equation where the global domain is a Cartesian product of two one dimensional intervals in which the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin method is applied to ensure discrete stability. The final test case uses the Galerkin approach to solve a Poisson problem on a Cartesian product of two intervals with a spatially varying, non-separable diffusivity term In all cases, a p = 1 p=1 basis is used and optimal L 2 L2 convergence rates of order h p + 1 hp+1 of the errors are achieved with respect to h h refinement.},

  abstract     = {Fog cloud computing promotes the combination of fog and cloud nodes to satisfy the requests of data accessing from IoT (Internet of Things) devices. To reduce the data delay and enhancing the QoS (Quality of Service), effective task scheduling is one of the major requirements in fog cloud environment. Numerous approaches have been deployed by the researchers for maintaining the QoS requirements. However, the emergence of bursty traffic affects the process of task scheduling due to high service latency. Effective QoS is promoted by minimizing the costs of computation, communication and deadline violation cost. To achieve the main objective of cost minimization, the proposed work is implemented by adopting a novel model called HFSGA (Hybrid Flamingo Search with a Genetic Algorithm) for better task scheduling. Seven basic benchmark optimization test functions are used to compare the performance of HFSGA with other well-known algorithms. Also, Friedman Rank Test is performed to demonstrate the significance of the results. The implemented model presents better outcomes with respect to PDST (Percentage of deadline satisfied task), makespan and cost. When compared to the existing algorithms that include Ant colony optimization (ACO), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Min-CCV, Min-V and Round Robin (RR) approach, the proposed work shows better output in satisfying the task scheduling process.},

For functions that have a constrained domain of interest, this can be done by discretizing the domain and performing a local interpolation on the tabulated function values of each local domain. For these so-called tabular data methods, the method of discretizing the domain and mapping the input space to each subdomain can drastically influence the memory and computational costs of the emulator. This is especially true for functions that vary drastically in different regions. We present a method for domain discretization and mapping that utilizes quadtrees, which results in significant reductions in the size of the emulator with minimal increases to computational costs or loss of global accuracy. We apply our method to the electron–positron Helmholtz free energy equation of state and show over an order of magnitude reduction in memory costs for reasonable levels of numerical accuracy.},

However, the success of word2vec in natural language environments relies heavily on ubiquitous contextual semantics, and the Deepwalk model is less accurate than other deep models due to ignoring contextual semantics in complex networks. To solve this challenge, a semantic-aware network embedding algorithm is proposed in this paper, simply called SANE, via optimized random walk and paragaraph2vec. In the SANE, a semantic-aware random walk strategy is designed to unsupervised generate many semantic-bearing node sequences from a complex network as a training set. Then, based on the training set, the paragraph2vec model is optimized by considering both global semantics and local semantics for learning more accurate low-dimensional node feature representations.

  abstract     = {A probabilistic regression model provides decision-makers with the regression output along with its quantitative uncertainty for given input variables. Even though this uncertainty may help to avoid serious consequences such as misdiagnosis or blackout due to overconfidence in the output, it only provides a measure of the uncertainty of the output, and has a limitation in that it cannot explain the reasons for the output and its uncertainty. If they can be presented along with their reasons, more suitable alternatives to the output can be found. However, despite the development of artificial intelligence methods to explain machine learning models and their outputs, few probabilistic regression models with this functionality have been proposed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a variational autoencoder-based model for explainable probabilistic regression, called VAPER. VAPER provides a parametric probability distribution of an output variable over input variables and interprets it using layer-wise relevance propagation to investigate the effect of each input variable. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we performed extensive experiments using several datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that VAPER has competitive regression performance compared to existing models, even with effective explainability.},

  abstract     = {Convergence acceleration of flow simulations to their steady states at lower Mach numbers can be achieved via preconditioning the lattice Boltzmann (LB) schemes that alleviate the associated numerical stiffness, which have so far been constructed on square lattices . We present a new central moment LB method on rectangular lattice grids for efficient computations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flows by solving the preconditioned Navier–Stokes (PNS) equations. Moment equilibria corrections are derived via a Chapman–Enskog analysis for eliminating the truncation errors due to grid-anisotropy arising from the use of the rectangular lattice and the non-Galilean invariant cubic velocity errors resulting from an aliasing effect on the standard D2Q9 lattice for consistently recovering the PNS equations. Such corrections depend on the diagonal components of the velocity gradients , which are locally obtained from the second order non-equilibrium moments and parameterized by an associated grid aspect ratio r r and a preconditioning parameter γ γ , and the speed of sound in the collision model is naturally adapted to r r via a physically consistent strategy. We develop our approach by using a robust non-orthogonal moment basis and the central moment equilibria are based on a matching principle, leading to simpler expressions for the corrections for using the rectangular grids and for representing the viscosities as functions of the relaxation parameters, r r and γ γ , and its implementation is modular allowing a ready extension of the existing LB schemes based on the square lattice. Numerical simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic shear-driven bounded flows using the preconditioned rectangular central moment LB method demonstrate the accuracy and significant reductions in the numbers of steps to reach the steady states for various sets of characteristic parameters.},

Its early detection has a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of treatments, as well as reducing serious complications and deaths. Ultrasound imaging represents a standard diagnostic technique for this purpose, due to its low invasiveness and cost. However, as this technique is susceptible to a certain degree of uncertainty, computer-aided solutions have been proposed in recent years to reduce the operator workload and improve the accuracy of diagnoses. Following this trend, the present study aims to design and propose a fully-automated and multi-layer pipeline for the segmentation and classification of breast lesions associated with cancer risk, from ultrasound images . To achieve this goal, we first evaluate and compare the performance of several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures in tackling the above tasks. Then, we combine the performance of such networks through specialized ensembles, to better discriminate among heterogeneous cases. Lastly, we present a novel step of cyclic mutual optimization that exploits the intermediate results of the classification step to improve the segmentation outcome and vice versa, in an iterative manner. Experimental findings obtained on public datasets show the superiority of the ensemble methods over the individual networks. Moreover, with a Dice coefficient of ∼ 82\% in the segmentation task and an accuracy of ∼ 91\% in the classification task , our best configuration also shows to be competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art.},

These test cases show variable resolution discretization needs and realistic physical parameters. In general, our numerical results are consistent theoretically. The use of h h -adapted meshes was efficient to achieve a certain accuracy level in the synthetic EM responses. Regarding global p p -refinement, p = 2 p=2 exhibits the best accuracy/performance trade-off. Selective p p -refinement might offer a better compromise between accuracy and computational cost.

Thus, p p -refinement can be competitive if applied hierarchically. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the performance of our supervised h + p h+p refinement strategy depends on the input model (e.g., conductivity, frequency, domain decomposition strategy, among others).

  abstract     = {Reservoir simulations for petroleum fields and seismic imaging are known as the most demanding workloads for high-performance computing (HPC) in the oil and gas (O&amp;G) industry. The optimization of the simulator numerical parameters plays a vital role as it could save considerable computational efforts. State-of-the-art optimization techniques are based on running numerous simulations, specific for that purpose, to find good parameter candidates. However, using such an approach is highly costly in terms of time and computing resources. This work presents TunaOil, a new methodology to enhance the search for optimal numerical parameters of reservoir flow simulations using a performance model. In the O&amp;G industry, it is common to use ensembles of models in different workflows to reduce the uncertainty associated with forecasting O&amp;G production. We leverage the runs of those ensembles in such workflows to extract information from each simulation and optimize the numerical parameters in their subsequent runs. To validate the methodology, we implemented it in a history matching (HM) process that uses a Kalman filter algorithm to adjust an ensemble of reservoir models to match the observed data from the real field. We mine past execution logs from many simulations with different numerical configurations and build a machine learning model based on extracted features from the data. These features include properties of the reservoir models themselves, such as the number of active cells, to statistics of the simulation’s behavior, such as the number of iterations of the linear solver. A sampling technique is used to query the oracle to find the numerical parameters that can reduce the elapsed time without significantly impacting the quality of the results. Our experiments show that the predictions can improve the overall HM workflow runtime on average by 31\%.},

This paper focuses on the numerical solutions of one-dimensional discrete asset pricing models, which can be translated into integral equations. To solve integral equations, an improved trigonometric extreme learning machine is developed, where the Fourier series is selected as the basis function. In particular, the sampling frequency of the trigonometric function varies with the property of data distribution, which helps to improve the accuracy of numerical solutions. The interior-point method is introduced to optimize the sampling frequency. Then, the integral equation is converted into a linear system which is solved by the extreme learning machine . This paper gives the mathematical derivation of solving the asset pricing model using the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine, which can be adapted to solve various types of integral equations. Subsequently, the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine is employed to solve the one-dimensional discrete-time asset pricing model. Simulation results demonstrate the high precision of the proposed method, which leads to less error in the approximate equity price and illustrates the feasibility of the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine. Furthermore, when the improved trigonometric extreme learning machine is compared with other related methods, the numerical simulations verify the efficiency and superiority of the proposed algorithm in solving the asset pricing model.},

  abstract     = {The main result of this paper is the generalization of the concept of variational splitting proposed by Behnoudfar et al. (2018) into higher-order time-stepping schemes. The key novelty of the technique proposed here is the following: when using the isogeometric finite elements, one can factorize the matrix of the linear system and obtain the linear complexity. This matrix has the form M+ηK , where M is the mass matrix, K is the stiffness matrix . Following the technique of Behnoudfar et al. (2018), and factorizing M+ηK one would get the additional error of order η2 . We propose the technique to couple the possibility of factorization of M+ηK with the higher-order time-stepping schemes and preserve this higher order. Thus, we introduce a variational splitting for implicit, linear multistep methods of order s for parabolic partial differential equations . Our technique exploits the tensor-product structure of the discretization in space (mesh and basis functions) to derive an update strategy with a linear cost regarding the total number of degrees of freedom for multi-dimensional problems. As an example, we consider two popular methods: Adams–Moulton (AM) and backward differentiation formulae (BDF). We derive the corresponding coefficients for AM and BDF methods. We present a C++ implementation of the time-integration schemes, targeting shared-memory Linux clusters. We present numerical results for the heat transfer problem and advection–diffusion problem. We also discuss the limitations of the method and possible extensions overcoming this limitation by using our method as a preconditioner for an iterative solver.},

  abstract     = {The tasks scheduling problem is about mapping tasks to resources so that the objectives related to both users and service providers are satisfied. In this paper, three improvements are presented to enhance the ability of the Red Fox Optimization (RFO) algorithm. Firstly, a Quasi-Opposition Based Learning method is employed for generating the initial population and a Levy flight method is used to enhance the exploration ability of newly generated foxes. Secondly, two fuzzy control systems are used to provide a balance between exploration and exploitation activities. Thirdly, a cornu-spiral movement is considered to enhance the local search capability. In addition, an efficient task scheduling using the Fuzzy Improved RFO (FIRFO) algorithm and game theory named EGFIRFO is presented considering four conflicting objectives (i.e., resource utilization, load balancing, makespan, and execution time). As a global optimization, the proposed method is compared with Bat algorithm (BA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Antlion Optimizer (ALO), and Red Fox Optimizer (RFO) in terms of a set of qualitative parameters (i.e., convergence curve, trajectory, average fitness, and search history). The experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm could improve the fitness value by 24.18\%, 12.81\%, 15.65\%, 33.49\%, and 14.73\% compared with the BA, GWO, PSO, ALO, and RFO, respectively. As a scheduler, EGFIRFO is compared to three scheduling algorithms (i.e., MSDE, EMVO, and HGSWC).},

These characteristics of block methods are the primary reasons for the one-step optimized block method devised in the present research study with three off-grid points. Theoretical analysis, including the order of convergence, consistency, zero-stability, A A -stability, order stars, and the local truncation error , are considered. The obtained method may be categorized as the well-known Lobatto IIIA Runge–Kutta method. The superiority of the devised method over various existing approaches having similar features is proved via numerical simulations of stiff and nonlinear differential systems. Furthermore, a suitable reformulation of the devised method results in considerable savings in computation time, as revealed through the efficiency plots. This turns out in a strategy to reformulate Runge–Kutta type methods in order to get a better performance.},

State-of-the-art generalized gradient approximation is used by adding Hubbard correction (GGA+ U ) to treat exchange-correlation potential of the electronic system. From the energy band structures, we observed that NaNdTiNbO 6 F (3.7 eV) and NaNdZrNbO 6 F (4.0 eV) are direct and indirect band gap materials, respectively. However, NaNdCoNbO 6 F and NaNdNiNbO 6 F are halfmetallic compounds having energy band gaps in spin (↑) (spin (↓)) channel of 2.2 (1.75) and 2.5 (3.6) eV, respectively. Effective contributions of different compounds and electronic states are analyzed by studying total and partial density of states. These compounds are potential candidates to be utilized in spintronic devices as they have significant values of magnetic moments, shown in Table 1. We have used an energy range of 0–14 eV to calculate and explain important optical characteristics of NaNdANbO 6 F (A= Ti, Zr, Co, Ni). These material falls in the category of optically active materials as their values of n ( ω ) n(ω) lie between 1.0 and 2.0. These compounds are also potential candidates for the anti-reflective coating applications as they reflect maximum of 45\% of incident photons in upper UV region. Finally, optical parameters are also used to explain contributions of inter-band electronic transitions in these compounds. This study might be considered as first quantitative theoretical study of magnetic, electronic and optical behavior in the tetragonal phases of these Nb based complex materials.},

To avoid singularity at x = 0 x=0 , the Emden–Fowler equation is converted into a Volterra integral equation. This allows the mathematical computation to be reduced due to single evaluations of the integral present in the problem. The optimal decomposition method is then applied to the resulting integral equations to compute closed-form and approximate numerical solutions. Some theorems are provided for the existence of a unique solution corresponding to integral equations. The mathematical formulation is further supported by conducting the convergence analysis of the proposed method. The accuracy and efficiency of the new approach is examined by working out several examples, and the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a reliable approach to compute the approximate series solutions and the exact solutions. The new approach resolves the issue of the existing method, which allows only to capture the solutions for smaller values of x x (less than equal to 1).},

Federated Learning (FL) solves the problem of data islands in machine learning and protects the privacy of participants by enabling further encryption through Differential Privacy (DP). In Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), edge devices also suffer from data islands, which are addressed by applying FL to AIoT. However, the privacy and efficiency of existing FL needs to be further improved, and the integration with edge computing is not yet high enough. In this paper, first, we propose a novel edge FL architecture based on edge devices in mesh network architecture ; next, we exploit the mesh networking features to address the problem of possible internal attacks from edge devices and design a Dynamic Local Differential Privacy (DLDP) algorithm; then, according to the communication characteristics of mesh network, we design Edge-FedAvg algorithm to reduce the communication cost; finally, to enhance the response to untrusted center servers, embed watermark in the model to further enhance the privacy protection capability. The Dynamic Local Differential Privacy Federated Learning (DLDP-FL) framework designed in this paper is used for FL of edge devices under mesh network, which can improve communication efficiency and enhance privacy protection capabilities at the same time.},

The coefficient of each objective and constraint function is assumed to be triangular intuitionistic fuzzy parameters and the crisp MO-MLP problems are obtained using the accuracy function method. To avoid decision lock, the top levels set tolerance limits for decision variables to control the lower levels. The problem is modeled in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment using membership and non-membership functions for each objective function at all levels and decision variables controlled by the top levels. Then, we proposed an IFGP algorithm to achieve the highest degree of each membership and non-membership goal by minimizing unwanted deviational variables and generating compensatory solutions for all decision-makers at all levels. Moreover, in the proposed approach, two-phase IFGP is modeled to yield a compromise solution that satisfies both the MN-Pareto optimal solution and the Pareto optimal solution at each level.

  abstract     = {Time series analysis (TSA) comprises methods for extracting information in domains as diverse as medicine, seismology, speech recognition and economics. Matrix Profile (MP) is the state-of-the-art TSA technique, which provides the most similar neighbor to each subsequence of the time series. However, this computation requires a huge amount of floating-point (FP) operations, which are a major contributor ( ≈ ≈ 50\%) to the energy consumption in modern computing platforms. In this sense, Transprecision Computing has recently emerged as a promising approach to improve energy efficiency and performance by using fewer bits in FP operations while providing accurate results. In this work, we present TraTSA , the first transprecision framework for efficient time series analysis based on MP. TraTSA allows the user to deploy a high-performance and energy-efficient computing solution with the exact precision required by the TSA application. To this end, we first propose implementations of TraTSA for both commodity CPU and FPGA platforms. Second, we propose an accuracy metric to compare the results with the double-precision MP. Third, we study MP’s accuracy when using a transprecision approach. Finally, our evaluation shows that, while obtaining results accurate enough, the FPGA transprecision MP (i) is 22.75 × × faster than a 72-core server, and (ii) the energy consumption is up to 3.3 × × lower than the double-precision executions.},

For classification, different parameters viz DEM, subsoil clay content, subsoil silt content, subsoil sand content, subsoil organic content, type of soil, and LULC were considered. Pearson correlation exhibited a positive and a negative relation between considered parameters and arsenic occurrence. Parameters obtained were considered for the classification of arsenic, and various evaluation criteria, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, were used to analyze models’ performance. Among the models, the Random Forest classifier outperforms other classifier models in terms of performance.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the performance of meshfree Radial Basis Functions (RBF) based numerical methods in providing dependable and precise solutions to a multitude of situations, this investigation explores the possibility of employing RBF based schemes to determine the solution of thin film flows involving interface/free surface through depth-averaged momentum integral model. As a first step towards this goal, thin film flow (two and three dimensional) over substrates featuring topographies (trench, peak, step-up, step-down) is considered. The assessment is based on how well the steady-state solutions, encapsulated by RBF scheme, agree with the available solutions of the model equations based on lubrication approximation (LUB) and depth averaged forms (DAF) and solved by conventional grid-based methods and experimental observations. In order to gain confidence in our approach, RBF based meshfree scheme is applied to LUB and DAF models after confirming the qualitative and quantitative agreement of the predicted solutions for the lid-driven cavity problem with the benchmark solutions. The striking agreement of the steady state film thickness profiles obtained by the meshfree RBF scheme with the solutions predicted by grid based schemes and experimental observations demonstrate the expected efficiency of RBF based schemes in capturing the dynamics of the film thickness that is a characteristic for a film over the chosen topography. The study reveals the scope for extending the extent of free surface flows or flows involving interfaces that can be addressed using meshfree RBF based schemes. It is hoped that the study would throw more light on the advantages of employing RBF based meshfree schemes in fluid flow problems involving interfaces in order to keep up with the rapidly changing computational environment.},

  abstract     = {Early detection of ovarian cancer is crucial for a good outlook. Different machine learning methods have already proven useful to that effect, but using many features and samples often yields a complex structure of classifier algorithms. This study investigates the effect of four different manifold learning methods prior to well-known classification algorithms to reduce the number of features and compares the achieved results with the well-known principal component analysis method. The NCI PBSII dataset, which consists of 253 samples with 15154 features, is used in this study. We tested nine distinct classifiers: k-nearest neighbors, decision tree , support vector machines , stochastic gradient descent , random forest , multi-layer perceptron, Naive Bayes, logistic regression , and AdaBoost. Among these classifiers, the logistic regression gives a maximum of 99.2\% accuracy using these features. These classifiers were rerun for five distinct reduced feature sets obtained using principal component analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, Locally Linear Embedding, Isometric Feature Mapping, and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding methods. Among these feature reduction methods, Locally Linear Embedding hit the maximum classifier performance five times (of nine classifiers) with an average of 15.4 components. Both the logistic regression classifier with 28 Multidimensional Scaling components and the stochastic gradient descent classifier with 30 Locally Linear Embedding components achieved the maximum accuracies of 99.8\%. On the other hand, the commonly used principal component analysis resulted in a maximum of 99.7\% accuracy using stochastic gradient descent with 30 principles. In conclusion, although principal component analysis is the most commonly used feature reduction method, the Locally Linear Embedding (a manifold learning method) may give higher classifier performances with fewer components in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.},

  abstract     = {The study of multiphase flow is essential for designing chemical reactors such as fluidized bed reactors (FBR), as a detailed understanding of hydrodynamics is critical for optimizing reactor performance and stability. An FBR allows scientists to conduct different types of chemical reactions involving multiphase materials, especially interaction between gas and solids. During such complex chemical processes, the formation of void regions in the reactor, generally termed as bubbles , is an important phenomenon. The study of these bubbles has a deep implication in predicting the reactor’s overall efficiency. But physical experiments needed to understand bubble dynamics are costly and non-trivial due to the technical difficulties involved and harsh working conditions of the reactors. Therefore, to study such chemical processes and bubble dynamics, a state-of-the-art computational simulation MFIX-Exa is being developed. Despite the proven accuracy of MFIX-Exa in modeling bubbling phenomena, the large-scale output data prohibits the use of traditional post hoc analysis capabilities in both storage and I/O time. To address these issues and allow the application scientists to explore the bubble dynamics in an efficient and timely manner, we have developed an end-to-end analytics pipeline that enables in situ detection of bubbles, followed by a flexible post hoc visual exploration methodology of bubble dynamics. The proposed method enables interactive analysis of bubbles, along with quantification of several bubble characteristics, enabling experts to understand the bubble interactions in detail. Positive feedback from the experts has indicated the efficacy of the proposed approach for exploring bubble dynamics in very-large-scale multiphase flow simulations.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new approach to calculating optimal therapy for the treatment of chronic diseases. For all patients, this approach can calculate drug combinations with the best probability of achieving treatment goals. This approach is based on the combination of machine learning methods, probability graph models, classical statistical modeling tools, and the authors’ algorithms. The paper shows the advantages of the proposed approach for the practical medical task of selecting drug combinations for type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment. The authors created useful tools for calculating drug combinations for compensating carbohydrate metabolism for diabetes patients. For treatment goals and values, the research team used the main carbohydrate metabolism indicator – glycated hemoglobin, the lipid profile indicator – low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and also arterial blood pressure which is an important indicator of a patient’s condition. In the virtual implementation, the method showed higher quality in comparison to results obtained without using this approach. For validation, classic metrics and experts’ knowledge were used. Both types of validation showed that the method was of high quality and did not contradict fundamental medicine knowledge. Therefore, this method can be used as part of a decision support system for medical specialists who work with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. This paper is an extended version of the investigation [1] . The short version also proposed an approach for calculating optimal therapy. Although this approach is of good quality, it had some drawbacks, so some improvements were made in the new version of the algorithm. The authors used Bayesian networks to reduce the search space by selecting only essential groups of drugs. Moreover, a genetic algorithm was used to find a more accurate solution.},

To this end, the diffusive fluxes in the electrokinetic model by Capuani et al. (2004) are supplemented with thermal fluctuations. Chemical reactions are included via an additional source term in the mass balance equation. The diffusion–reaction model is then coupled to a solver for fluctuating hydrodynamics based on the lattice Boltzmann method. This combination is particularly useful for soft matter simulations, due to the ability to couple particles to the lattice-Boltzmann fluid. These could, e.g., be charged colloids or polymers, which then interact with an ion distribution. We describe one implementations based on the automatic code generation tools pystencils and lbmpy , and another one that is contained in the molecular dynamics package ESPResSo and that allows for an easy coupling of particles to the density fields. We validate our implementations by comparing to several known analytic results. Our method can be applied to coarse-grained catalysis problems as well as to many other multi-scale problems that require the coupling of explicit-particle simulations to flow fields, diffusion, and reaction problems in arbitrary geometries.},

Herein, we developed two novel algorithms: linearized spectral method (LSM) and semi-discrete method (SDM). We successfully applied them to investigate the fractional-order MHD Jeffery fluid model&#39;s solution over a vertically moving surface with constant heat flux. The model consists of a nonlinear coupled differential equation, which is solved with proposed techniques. To attain the influence of emerging parameters on velocity and temperature distributions, emerging parameters, namely: nonlinear thermal radiation, time-dependent thermal conductivity and diffusivity, are variates for numerical values. Viable dimensionless variables are used to nondimensionalized the governing problem. Linearized spectral scheme based on function approximation and operational-matrices of fractional and integer order derivatives using shifted Gegenbauer polynomials (SGPs). Picard-iterative method is adopted to linearize the governing set of equations. The time-based derivative is estimated utilizing a forward difference scheme while spatial derivatives are evaluated with operational matrices&#39; help to present the semi-discrete method. The significant part of the proposed method is to convert the highly nonlinear problems into a set of linear equations that surely help to deal efficiently. Nusselt number exhibits a direct relation with temperature ratio and heat absorption parameters. Numerical justification provided of the proposed algorithms through convergence and error bound. Furthermore, the established algorithms can inspect the accurate solution of more fractional problems which is highly nonlinear of physical nature.},

Spirometry is a popular lung investigation that is performed in the early diagnostic stages to understand the mechanics of lungs. This work aims to develop machine learning models to classify obstructive and non-obstructive pulmonary diseases on the basis of spirometry data. Supervised learning models were developed with support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. Models were trained with spirometry data of 1163 patients using 5-fold cross validation (CV) and further validated with a blind dataset of 151 patients for external validation. The MLP model performed optimally with an accuracy of 83.7\% and Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.682 with 5-fold CV. All the models performed well while validating the blind dataset. The disease-specific prediction of COPD and DPLD, as obstructive and non-obstructive respectively, achieved ~90\% accuracy in the training dataset. The MLP model was stored in a web server for use in a web application. The machine learning models were able to predict obstructive and non-obstructive pulmonary diseases with good accuracy, based on spirometry data. The web application can be used by clinicians and patients as a tool for early prediction.},

The competitive performance with other state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms , innate simplicity, and the requirement of only two user-defined parameters are the primary reason behind the popularity of this algorithm. However, due to the inherent nature of the Teaching Learning Based Optimization, it is not amenable to parallel computing for the multiple evaluations of the fitness function, thereby limiting its application to computationally intensive problems. This article considers the Teaching Learning Based Optimization algorithm without the duplicate removal step as Sanitized Teaching Learning Based Optimization. In this work, three competitive parallelized strategies of Sanitized Teaching Learning Based Optimization are suggested that can harness the benefits of parallel computing . The efficacies of the proposed strategies are demonstrated on 14 benchmark problems and the CEC’14 real parameter benchmark test suite. Additionally, the impact on the computational time with respect to the computational complexity of the objective function and the number of resources has been studied. It is observed that the proposed strategies can lead up to a 90\% reduction in computational time over Sanitized Teaching Learning Based Optimization algorithm .},

Multiresponse optimization enables us to address this concern and find a compromise solution of design factors that leads to desirable quality outputs. This problem becomes complicated when some degree of uncertainty affects the result of the experiments. In this paper, two sources of uncertainty are included in multi-response optimization problems . The first is experimental errors related to unknown variables, also called environmental nuisances, creating response surface modeling errors. The second source is errors in implementation. In the experimentation, the controllable factors are mainly set at some predefined levels, but after the optimal design has been found, it oscillates around that value during the implementation phase. To handle this problem, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming is developed in which desirability functions are aggregated to form the final objective function. Scenarios are generated by sampling from probability distribution functions of the response surfaces&#39; coefficients under normality assumptions. The numerical results show that joint consideration of the error sources leads to a smaller range of desirability values among the different scenarios and a higher value of the total desirability index.},

The Optimal Homotopy Analysis Method (OHAM) has been employed here to handle governing coupled nonlinear Differential Equations (DEs). An efficient approach has been used to calculate the convergence controller parameters used in OHAM, which minimizes the complexity of the calculations. Convergence of the present method is observed numerically from the obtained numerical results for the different number of terms in the series solution. For validation, present results have been compared with the numerical results obtained from benchmark MATLAB solver BPV4C. Also, the Nusselt number and coefficient of skin friction obtained from the present method have been compared with the previously published results. Further, the accuracy of the obtained results has been seen by calculating residual errors for successive approximations . Computations show that the obtained results converge up to three decimal places, and residual errors are close enough to zero in four terms of approximations . Finally, the effects of different physical parameters on velocity and temperature profiles are illustrated graphically by varying a single parameter with fixed values of the remaining ones. All possible combinations are considered, such as shrinking wall/convergent channel, shrinking wall/divergent channel, stretching wall/convergent channel, and stretching wall/divergent channel.

  abstract     = {Analysis of rhythmicity in count data has become an important aspect in different fields from science and engineering to economy and process planning. Several methods have recently been implemented to investigate the rhythmicity of continuous data. However, in most cases, these need to be manually adapted to work with count data as well. Namely, non-negative integer data that are usually obtained by counting of specific events. Herein, we describe the implementation of RhythmCount, an open-source Python module specifically devoted to rhythmicity analysis of count data. RhythmCount combines the cosinor regression model with different count data models. The proposed implementation allows automatic identification of the most suitable model for a given dataset, assessment of different measures and parameters of the rhythmicity of the dataset, and production of publication-ready figures that can be used for a straightforward interpretation of the obtained results. We demonstrate an application of the proposed module in the analysis and comparison of the daily traffic trends during the COVID-19 epidemic with the daily traffic trends in normal (non-epidemic) conditions. RhythmCount is available at https://github.com/ninavelikajne/RhythmCount under the MIT license. The implementation reported in this paper corresponds to the software release v1.1.},

  abstract     = {We present two simplified gas kinetic models for the computation of the Navier–Stokes equations for compressible flows. Upon starting from the non-linear BGK kinetic model, we derive a simplified procedure for computing the normalized particle velocity distribution function, ψ ψ . From a first-order approximation in time and a directional splitting of the BGK equation, the function ψ ψ is computed over each time-step and at each cell interface of a finite-volume algorithm, as a convex combination between its value at the beginning of each time-step and an equilibrium state of the gas. Hence, depending on the definition of this equilibrium state, we can generate two kinetic theory inspired schemes. The first scheme (SCG scheme), is designed by computing the initial equilibrium state from two Maxwellian distributions of the gas, at each cell interface. The second scheme (ASCGE scheme) is designed by introducing acoustic principles into the definition of this initial equilibrium state. Then, the resulting flux function for convective terms is computed from the gas distribution function, ψ ψ , at each time-step. Viscous fluxes are weakly coupled with convective fluxes by using kinematic features coming from both sides of the generic cell face. Finally, these convective and diffusive fluxes are introduced into a fourth-order MUSCL-like finite-volume procedure for modeling compressible flows. These two resulting simplified gas kinetic models are tested and compared with an HLLC Riemann solver scheme and recent simplified gas kinetic schemes over a variety of physical problems including inviscid/viscous and steady/unsteady problems for a compressible flow.},

The estimator enables the efficient implementation of the stochastic gradient descent method for the maximum likelihood estimation. The second contribution is that we propose a specific neural network for the non-parametric estimation of the underlying kernels of the MHP. We evaluate the proposed model on synthetic and natural datasets and find the method has comparable or better performance than existing estimation methods. The use of neural networks for modelling the excitation kernel ensures that we do not compromise on the Hawkes model’s interpretability .

  abstract     = {Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm for solving both single-objective and many-objective optimizations. The search within DE can be either local or global. The local search (LS) can significantly improve the accuracy of the solution while the global search (GS) has the capability of jumping out from local optima. Most existing algorithms focus more on the exploration capability. This paper proposes an objective-oriented local segmenting (OLS) mechanism to improve the exploitability of algorithms. OLS mechanism uses different strategies to divide population based on different characteristics of objective space. To further balance exploitation and exploration, an effective segment strategy for the fusion of OLS and GS is proposed. In the proposed strategy, the evolution process is divided into non-overlap segments with OLS and GS alternately assigned using pre-defined generation intervals. The proposed method was incorporated into several popular DE variants and further tested on a set of 30 benchmark functions for single-objective optimization (SOP). The experimental results show that the proposed strategy significantly enhances the considered algorithms. For many-objective optimization (MOP), a many-objective optimizer, named many-objective local global DE (MOLG-DE) was constructed with the proposed mechansims and shows competitive performance against several state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on widely used benchmark functions .},

Localized compensator phase unwrapping method (LC) has a good accuracy to regularize singularity for noisy wrapped phase data. Since the LC method can compensate the singularity in limited area to local region around singular points (SPs). However, the LC method has two big problems; firstly it requires large amounts of computational time to produce its unwrapped results. Secondly, this method has limitation of memory shortage if the limited area size including SPs is large, hence the LC method cannot produce unwrapped results. Most of the computational time in LC method is exhausted in the process of fixing numerical error of the compensators that are computed from accumulating the solution of Poisson’s equation using boundary element method and fix errors using singular valued decomposition method . In order to solve the LC method’s problems and improve its performance, we propose a new phase unwrapping algorithm based on computing the compensators of singularity cluster regions directly. In the proposed algorithm, the process of fixing the errors is unnecessary, since it considers the compensators as flux of potential vectors and computes them from solving Poisson’s equation directly. The applicability of the proposed method is tested and evaluated on both simulated and experimental phase data. The unwrapped results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computational time; meanwhile, it maintains the same accuracy of unwrapped results as the original algorithm with the localized compensator does.},

  abstract     = {We outline the development of a general-purpose Python-based data analysis tool for OpenFOAM. Our implementation relies on the construction of OpenFOAM applications that have bindings to data analysis libraries in Python. Double precision data in OpenFOAM is cast to a NumPy array using the NumPy C-API and Python modules may then be used for arbitrary data analysis and manipulation on flow-field information. We highlight how the proposed wrapper may be used for an in-situ online singular value decomposition (SVD) implemented in Python and accessed from the OpenFOAM solver PimpleFOAM. Here, ‘in-situ’ refers to a programming paradigm that allows for a concurrent computation of the data analysis on the same computational resources utilized for the partial differential equation solver. In addition, to demonstrate parallel deployments, we deploy a distributed SVD, which collects snapshot data across the ranks of a distributed simulation to compute the global left singular vectors . Crucially, both OpenFOAM and Python share the same message passing interface (MPI) communicator for this deployment which allows Python objects and functions to exchange NumPy arrays across ranks. Subsequently, we provide scaling assessments of this distributed SVD on multiple nodes of Intel Broadwell and KNL architectures for canonical test cases such as the large eddy simulations of a backward facing step and a channel flow at friction Reynolds number of 395. Finally, we demonstrate the deployment of a deep neural network for compressing the flow-field information using an autoencoder to demonstrate an ability to use state-of-the-art machine learning tools in the Python ecosystem.},

Firstly, the original equation is split into two one-dimensional equations. Then, the fourth-order compact difference formulas and the Crank–Nicolson method are used to approximate the space and time derivatives, respectively. The nonlinear source term is linearized based on the Taylor expansions . So we only need to solve two one-dimensional tri-diagonal systems at each time level, which makes the computation efficient. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the current LOD method produces a splitting error. Therefore, although this method has advantages for source term symmetry problems, it loses accuracy for source term asymmetry problems. The convergence and stability of the proposed scheme are proved by energy analysis method. Finally, several numerical examples are given to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, it is also applied in simulation of the quenching and blow-up phenomena.},

  abstract     = {A tailored finite point method, using a minimal machinery algorithm yet utilizing the initial conditions and local properties of the solution to the hilt, is proposed to serve as a global platform to solve the generalized Burgers’ equation. On an explicit centred 4-point stencil, the nodal solutions at the advanced time level are written as a linear combination of the nodal solutions at the preceding level. The scalars in this linear combination are determined using a set of basis functions. The extraction of these basis functions is through the fundamental solutions derived via the method of separation of variables. This, in turn, brings in the influence of the local properties of the general solution. The nodal maximum of the initial conditions is chosen as the separation constant to actuate continuous dependence on the initial conditions. Withal this separation constant works well for the generalized Burgers’ equation, thereby instituting a common platform to solve these class of equations. The non-linearity is taken care of through an iterative technique where the non-linear term is replaced by an anterior temporal level iterated value. Conditional stability is established through the von-Neumann stability analysis. The method is consistent with second-order convergence in spatial variables and first-order convergence in the temporal variable. Numerical experiments are conducted on multifarious examples, and the obtained results are very much in accordance with the available exact solutions. The numerical results of examples with no useable closed-form representation of the exact solution are vindicated through the double meshing principle. Also, the error analysis establishes that the method works pretty well on coarse meshes, wherefore cutting the computational cost and increasing rapidity. Despite being a simple and straightforward algorithm with no usage of elite techniques, the method stands on par with quite a few methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Organ transplantation network design is a critical issue for continuing human life. This paper presents a new tri-objective robust optimization model for the design of transplantation networks that are adaptable to disruption scenarios. This paper presents a new mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to construct a scenario-based transplantation supply chain. In this regard, objective functions of the proposed scenario-based model are developed to minimize the delivery time of the organs after disruption and maximize the quality of organs and the compatibility of blood types. Afterward, the queue of people in health facilities with limiting capacity may reduce the surgeries and lead to death risk. Therefore, it is necessary to examine a queue system that reflects the situation and changes over time. The risk of climate change over the network can be created from the queue and affects the quality of organs. When the risk of climate change makes delay receiving the organs by transplant centers, the compatibility of blood types is a helpful method to handle surgery rates and decrease the mortality rate. Moreover, one of the other issues that have an impact on the decisions of the managers in the transplant process is related to making an appropriate decision by respecting uncertain conditions. For this reason, this paper has proposed a new hybrid solution approach based on the scenario-based robust optimization approach and the compromise solution method to tackle different uncertainties in an optimization model. In addition, the proposed model is NP-hard, and this paper utilizes two metaheuristic optimization algorithms to solve the problem, including genetic algorithm (GA) and black widow optimization (BWO). The empirical examples are provided to validate the performance of the proposed model, and these represent the advantage of BWO over GA. After introducing essential analyses, the comparative analysis and managerial insights are explained.},

Identifying critical nodes can help analyze the topological characteristics of the network, such as vulnerability and robustness. This work considers a well-known critical node detection problem variant, Maximize the Number of Connected Components Problem, which aims to find a set of nodes whose removal maximizes the number of connected components and compares the centrality measures for detecting these nodes. While the existing literature focused only on small datasets, this work analyzes the widely used topology-based centrality measures on several synthetic and real-world networks. Our findings show that degree-like centralities are more relevant measures than path-like centralities for disconnecting networks into several connected components. However, our results also indicate that the traditional centrality measures cannot detect the most vital critical nodes. To overcome this drawback, a new centrality measure, namely Isolating Centrality, that aims to identify the nodes that significantly impact network connectedness is presented. The comprehensive computational study demonstrates that the proposed measure outperforms traditional measures in identifying critical nodes.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic networks are social networks in which node-to-node links contain a temporal component, i.e., node-to-node interactions over a specific time interval. As a result, the dynamic network’s structure changes over time, and previously connected nodes may or may not have an edge connecting them at any one time. The link prediction issue in dynamic networks aims to identify future network linkages based on the relative behavior of previous network updates. We present a feature-based solution that considers both individual snapshots and the overall network throughout the full-time span to answer the link prediction problem. We present a novel feature called Cost-based feature for link prediction ( C F L P CFLP ) for estimating edge behavior throughout the entire network, which uses a reward and penalty structure to summarize node activity across the entire network. We use similarity indices, classified into four major categories: local similarity, global similarity, quasi-local similarity, and clustering coefficient-based similarity, to measure edge activity in individual snapshots. We have also selected fourteen different snapshot-based features to find the most excellent combination of minimum features for link prediction. We used regression and mutual information-based scoring for feature selection to correctly quantify the relative effect of features among themselves and the overall link prediction problem. In order to give the best feasible solution to the link prediction problem, these individual features and their combinations were examined with five machine learning models. We employed five performance matrices – AUC, AUPR, Average Precision, F1, and Balance Accuracy Score – to compare the performance of our method to those of state-of-the-art approaches, and found that our method outperformed all.},

  abstract     = {Physarum polycephalum inspired algorithm (PPA) has attracted immense attention recently. By modeling real-world problems into a graph and adopting proper adaption equation, PPA could solve system optimization or user equilibrium problems. However, few PPA-based algorithms can tackle problems with capacity constraints, lacking the ability to control link flows in the PPA. To tackle this problem, a novel framework, the capacitated PPA (CPPA), is proposed to allow capacity constraints toward link flow in the PPA. To demonstrate the validity of the CPPA, we have developed three applications of the CPPA, i.e., the CPPA for the maximum-flow problem (CPPA-MF), the CPPA for the minimum-cost–maximum-flow problem (CPPA-MCMF), and the CPPA for the link-capacitated traffic assignment problem (CPPA-CTAP). In the experiments, the CPPA-MF shows competitive performance among four baseline algorithms; the CPPA-MCMF is approximately 50\% faster than the baseline algorithms; the CPPA-CTAP reduce the oversaturated degree from approximately 40\% to 1.5\% compared to the original algorithm. The experimental results prove the validation of the CPPA framework. The CPPA is also robust since it have been successfully applied in three different scenarios. The proposed CPPA extends the PPA’s application to capacity-constrain problems and might shed some lights on its future applications in complex real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {As lattice Boltzmann simulation codes require updating several million floating point values thousands of times, optimized implementation and efficient data structure are crucial to minimize memory consumption and use all the available computational power. In this paper, a new lattice Boltzmann algorithm is proposed, suitable for the simulation of large-scale systems by avoiding storing the data of solid nodes. As a structure-of-array memory layout is used, the streaming step is performed by a simple shift operation. The advantages of this algorithm are the simplicity of the memory layout and streaming function implementation. Because the algorithm utilizes an indirect addressing scheme, particularly for low void fraction geometries the memory resources are used efficiently. As no computation is carried out for solid nodes, a good performance for irregular geometries with low void fractions is also achieved. To verify the implementation of the proposed algorithm several academic benchmarks are studied, including Poiseuille flow, Cavity flow, and Cylinder flow. A theoretical estimation of the memory consumption is carried out for different void fractions. Then the performance of the implemented code is investigated by simulating flow around two complex geometries and the memory usage and computational performance compared to the Palabos code.},

However, previous GIM constructions have been limited to only bistable nonlinear transfer functions with low noise intensity condition. To provide a new insight and broaden the potential design of GIMs, we construct a nonbistable rectified linear unit-based gain-dissipative Ising spin network (RISN). In contrast to the traditional GIM, spin dynamics analysis in the uncoupled state proves that RISN is nonbistable. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed RISN can effectively solve combinatorial optimization problems with a high noise level, which can be regarded as a stochastic resonance phenomenon. The proposed configuration, which does not comply with known conclusions, can become a stepping-stone for new GIM designs.},

  abstract     = {Although the reception of Internet of Things (IoT) services increased efficiency and allowed companies to automate the production through remote and intelligent control , it also increases the risk of potential threats and security attacks. The attackers can compromise the security of the IoT node and join it to a botnet , manipulate sensitive data or take control of a full network. Securing the IoT nodes from security attacks remains a challenge, especially under the multiple attack models where several attacks can be launched simultaneously. The objective of this paper is to prevent a type of multiple attacks that are the foundation to manipulate sensor nodes’ data that are: clone attack, tamper attack, false data injection, node malfunctioning, and physical layer attack. A solution is proposed to secure the IoT nodes against these attacks. The proposed solution is based on a novel sensor pairing approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of IoT nodes’ sensor data using multiple machine learning models. In particular, we propose a threat model and the pairing algorithm to pair each sensor node with the sensor node located in the neighbor. We compare the performance of three machine learning models, which are decision tree , Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) by using two publically available real-world datasets in terms of attack detection accuracy, training time, and testing time. Our proposed system achieved up to 100\% accuracy rate and nearly twice faster training and testing time as compared to the existing solutions. We provide the memory and energy consumption analysis to show that the proposed method has lower communication and memory overhead on IoT nodes than previous solutions against IoT security attacks. Our dataset just contains the data of a pair of sensors and is reduced up to eight times smaller in size than the actual dataset.},

The results show that the mean RCS of the cavity decreases with the increasing blade number in the smaller detection angle range. The mean RCS of the cavity increases with the increasing blade stage which changes the transmission path of the incident electromagnetic wave inside the cavity. And compared with the cavity with only one blade, the mean RCS with three-stage blades increases by more than 55\%. With the angle between the two-stage blades increasing, the mean RCS of the cavity decreases first and then increases.},

  abstract     = {Random fields are among the mathematical models used in the study of non-deterministic and non-linear complex systems. A fundamental aspect in the characterization of such models is to define intrinsic properties and to understand how these measures change over time. In this paper, we propose an information-geometric framework to analyze Gaussian–Markov random fields (GMRF’s) by the definition of a Fisher information based space. With this approach, it is possible to measure the variations in each component of the metric tensor that equips the underlying parametric space, when visiting different entropic states. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we propose a method based on infinitesimal displacements to compute distances between two systems operating in different regimes using the Fisher metric. Moreover, we derive an expression for the KL-divergence (relative entropy) between two GMRF models , showing that, it symmetrized version works reasonably well as a replacement for the Fisher information based distance. Finally, information cycles that relate components of the metric tensor and the system’s entropy reveal an asymmetric pattern of evolution when the system moves towards different entropic states, indicating that the simple interaction between several Gaussian random variables can lead to the emergence of an intrinsic notion of time in the evolution of a random field, based in the geometric properties of its parametric space.},

In this paper, we detail the SmartSim architecture and provide benchmarks including online inference with a shared ML model, EKE-ResNet, on heterogeneous HPC systems. We demonstrate the capability of SmartSim by using it to run a 12-member ensemble of global-scale, high-resolution ocean simulations, each spanning 19 compute nodes, all communicating with the same ML architecture at each simulation timestep. In total, 970 billion inferences are collectively served by running the ensemble for a total of 120 simulated years. The inferences are used to predict the oceanic eddy kinetic energy (EKE), which is a variable that is used to tune different turbulence closures in the model and thus directly affects the simulation. The root-mean-square of the error in EKE (as compared to an eddy-resolving simulation) is 20\% lower when using the ML-prediction than the previous state of the art.

In the numerical experiments, the models of arterial systems with twenty and thirty-seven vessels are considered. It is demonstrated, that for the vessels near the heart the effect of viscosity can be considered as inessential, and an inviscid model can be used. The main effect on the relative deviations of solutions, obtained by different models, is realized by the velocity profile. The effect of non-Newtonian viscosity is not so essential, but can be taken into account for the models with peripheral vessels.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a lattice-Boltzmann model for advection-diffusion equation is presented, built upon the regularized model. In the regularized collision model of this paper, the coefficients in the reconstruction process of the off-equilibrium distribution are evaluated through two different methods. The first method arises from direct projection of off-equilibrium distribution, while the second method is computed as to best approximate the scalar diffusion flux. By combining the two methods and introducing proportional coefficients, a hybrid regularized collision model is obtained. In terms of model validations, test cases of smooth problems and discontinuous problems are selected. The results are compared with those obtained by the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook model and the projection reconstruction model. First, the calculation accuracy of the model in solving the smooth distribution problem is verified by the periodic one-dimensional problem and the advection-diffusion process of the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Then, the cases of discontinuous problems are considered for the demonstration of the numerical stability of the model. The results show that the hybrid regularization lattice Boltzmann model retains the advantages of the regularization model in terms of calculation accuracy, and at the same time has good numerical stability in solving discontinuous problems.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with mathematical modeling of the electroosmotically boosted peristaltic propulsion of water-based silver nanofluid through an asymmetric channel. The inherent Joule heating phenomenon is also included in the mathematical modeling of the flow problem. The no-slip boundary conditions are utilized for velocity and temperature of the fluid and conditions of zero mass flux are considered for nanoparticle volume fraction. The electric potential generated by electroosmosis is formulated by Poisson-Boltzmann ionic distribution. The aim here is to compare the properties of nanofluid flow as predicted by the modified Buongiorno model in combination with the Corcione model for thermal conductivity and that estimated by a combination of the traditional Tiwari-Das model and the Corcione model under the same physical conditions. The numerical solution is computed for the emerging set of nonlinear coupled equations through the built-in command in Maple 17 which uses the finite difference technique in combination with Richardson extrapolation to solve a boundary value problem . Important attributes of electroosmotically controlled peristaltic fluid flow are illustrated subject to variation in different physical parameters. The analysis exhibits that under the same physical conditions, the modified Buongiorno model predicts the nanofluid properties more efficiently than the Tiwari-Das model. It is found that for larger temperature differences within a fluid medium, the Nusselt number declines in the case where the modified Buongiorno model is utilized whereas the Tiwari-Das model does not include the effect of temperature difference. Moreover, peristaltic pumping is boosted by forwarding electric field and opposed by backward electroosmosis, and the magnitude of the Nusselt number tends to raise for larger Joule heating parameter.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become one of the indispensable tools to learn from graph-structured data, and their usefulness has been shown in wide variety of tasks. In recent years, there have been tremendous improvements in architecture design, resulting in better performance on various prediction tasks. In general, these neural architectures combine node feature aggregation and feature transformation using learnable weight matrix in the same layer. This makes it challenging to analyze the importance of node features aggregated from various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers . As different graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in features and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which features are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information. In this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph neural network, and empirically analyze how different aggregated features play a role in prediction performance. We show that not all features generated via aggregation steps are useful, and often using these less informative features can be detrimental to the performance of the GNN model. Through our experiments, we show that learning certain subsets of these features can lead to better performance on wide variety of datasets. Based on our observations, we introduce several key design strategies for graph neural networks. More specifically, we propose to use softmax as a regularizer and ”soft-selector” of features aggregated from neighbors at different hop distances; and L2-Normalization over GNN layers. Combining these techniques, we present a simple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph Neural Network (FSGNN), and show empirically that the proposed model achieves comparable or even higher accuracy than state-of-the-art GNN models in nine benchmark datasets for the node classification task, with remarkable improvements up to 51.1\%.

AGVs are also a huge source of information that can be utilised by the data mining algorithms that support the new generation of manufacturing. This paper focuses on data preprocessing, aggregation, and clustering in the new generation of manufacturing systems that use the agile manufacturing paradigm and utilise AGVs. This paper presents a method by which it is possible to automatically detect the types of work performed by an AGV based on streaming information. The paper presents a comparison of results obtained with two different classical clustering algorithms: K-Means and DBScan. As the results show, using at least one of the proposed algorithms, it is possible to automatically detect the types of work performed by AGVs and to detect new, previously unknown types. Additionally, to a limited extent, it is possible to identify anomalies using this method. The proposed methodology can be used as the initial step for production optimisation, predictive maintenance activities, production technology verification, or as a source of models for the simulation tools that are used in virtual factories.

  abstract     = {The herein coined Optimal Decomposition Method (ODM) is presented; an analytic decomposition approach to solve nonlinear problems that circumvents the well-known convergence barrier within nonlinear decomposition methods, e.g., Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) and Duan –Rach ADM. ODM initially concerns removing the unknown coefficients from the recursion scheme. In addition, it is powered by multiple Convergence-Control Parameters (CCP) through insertion of an ‘artificial’ parameter. The series of CCPs results in the deployment of the entire convergence potential of the decomposition method. It is shown, in a detailed manner, that ADM and Duan-Rach ADM, i.e., a modified approach preventing the appearance of the unknown coefficients in the Adomian recursion scheme for an l l -point BVP ( l ≥ 2 l≥2 ), can be generalized only as the special cases of ODM. Therefore, ODM, by itself, moves beyond generalization of the aforementioned methods. The CCPs are computed by minimizing the universal system error. For this purpose, a gradient-based contraction search is exploited together with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to facilitate procuring the CCPs in strongly divergent examples involving several CCPs. Indeed, through examples, namely, a generalized Boundary Value Problem (BVP) test case, the Falkner-Skan equation, a two-state optimal control problem , the Burgers’ equation and a strongly nonlinear problem governing electrohydrodynamic flow of a fluid in a circular cylindrical conduit, it is exemplified that CCPs expand the radius of convergence substantially. In the considered examples, ADM and D-R ADM are strictly divergent with the addition of series terms; on the contrary, ODM serves as a successful remedy on these occasions. In practice, it was found that for most of the nonlinearities, minimizing the system error containing CCPs for lower orders of approximation gives rise to a natural minimization of the system error in higher orders of approximation , i.e., natural convergence.},

  abstract     = {Combining different existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, a framework is obtained to assess a set of metrics in computational physics problems, in general, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), in particular. The metrics include accuracy, sensitivity and robustness of the simulator’s outputs with respect to uncertain inputs and parameters. These inputs and parameters are divided into two groups: based on the variation of the first group (e.g. numerical/computational parameters such as grid resolution), a computer experiment is designed, the data of which may become uncertain due to the parameters of the second group (e.g. finite time-averaging). To construct a surrogate model based on uncertain data, Gaussian process regression (GPR) with observation-dependent (heteroscedastic) noise is used. To estimate the propagated uncertainties in the simulator’s outputs from the first group of parameters, a probabilistic version of the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is employed Global sensitivity analysis is performed using probabilistic Sobol indices. To illustrate its capabilities, the framework is applied to the scale-resolving simulations of turbulent channel and lid-driven cavity flows using the open-source CFD solver Nek5000. It is shown that at wall distances where the time-averaging uncertainty is high, the quantities of interest are also more sensitive to numerical/computational parameters. In particular for high-fidelity codes such as Nek5000, a thorough assessment of the results’ accuracy and reliability is crucial. The detailed analyses and the resulting conclusions can enhance our insight into the influence of different factors on physics simulations, in particular the simulations of high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows including wall turbulence.},

Being sometimes the bottleneck of making the most of the computational resources, assembly operation is of great significance to be implemented in a highly efficient manner. The proposed algorithm employs just nodes to construct the compressed global stiffness matrix leading to the optimized assembly procedure in problems containing several unknowns per node. Moreover, Discrete Least Squares Meshless Method is presented in which producing time-consuming background cells for performing Gaussian integration is avoided. However, it takes significant CPU time to construct the coefficient matrix (like other meshless methods) instead of the computationally demanding process of generating FEM meshes. Unlike the finite element method, meshless methods with their optimal radius of support domain (2.0–3.0 times of nodal spacing) contain numerous collisions and low sparsity rate in the assembly operation, hence, the assembly of meshless methods is targeted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. This study compares sparse and dense assembly between meshless and finite element method probably for the first time. The current paper also introduces and evaluates an open-source Parallel Nodal Sparse Assembly package in shared memory architecture which can be easily extended to other parallel schemes. The proposed algorithm not only is compatible with problems including high sparsity rate but also can be highly effective in cases with a large number of collisions and low sparsity rate.},

Explainable data analysis or explainable data analytics is a new concept recently appearing in the literature within the machine learning community. The research on data explainability has become important in various fields where machine learning techniques are used. In this paper, we have extended this concept to the analysis of agent-based simulations. We refer to the explainability in the context of improving visualization and analysis of such type of simulation data, so that, a better understanding of nature of a complex system can be achieved. In this work, principal component analysis was first used as a feature extractor to reduce the dimension of the input data matrix to extract the feature vector, which consists of a set of low dimensional principal component scores. The K K -means clustering method is then applied to cluster the principal component scores, so that, different treatments can be grouped to identify their similarity. Since it is crucial to determine the number of clusters in a clustering analysis , in order to improve the clustering results and meet our objective of reducing the number of treatments, two new algorithms are proposed to identify the optimal K K value. The proposed methods are illustrated by applying them to data from an agent-based simulation model, and the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed methods are promising in determining the optimal number of clusters in K K -means clustering and that they outperform the traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Undirected, high-dimensional and sparse network is often encountered in industrial engineering and described by symmetric, high-dimensional and sparse (SHiDS) matrix for academic investigation. Latent factor (LF) models have shown an arguably promising yet whelming capability of extracting knowledge from so little known information in the SHiDS matrix. However, most of the LF models in the form of matrix factorization (a.k.a. matrix decomposition) focus exclusively on a single domain and struggle to meet the requirements of symmetry and non-negativity of the SHiDS matrix. To address these issues, a symmetric and non-negative collective factorization (SNCF) transfer framework in the form of collective-matrix (co-matrix) decomposition is proposed. SNCF transfers a great deal of knowledge from the auxiliary domain to mitigate the sparsity of the target domain. To solve the SNCF efficiently and guarantee the symmetry and non-negativity of the target matrix, a collective batch-based non-negative optimization approach (SNCF-CBN) is put forward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SNCF-CBN by comparing it with several state-of-the-art models on public datasets, including Protein Networks, Sonar Mines and Sonar Rocks datasets with different sparsities in cross-domain.},

Two test cases are considered: a one-dimensional impedance tube and a two-dimensional grazing incidence tube. The impact of the liner on the pressure field is tuned through various TDIBC parameters imposed at the boundary where the liner surface is located. Automatic differentiation of the direct numerical simulation (DNS) code yields the gradients of the time-integrated pressure perturbations with respect to the TDIBC parameters. The gradients are subsequently used in an iterative process that minimizes the perturbations at a given location. In both test cases considered, TDIBC parameters are found which are more effective at attenuating perturbation frequencies other than those the initial TDIBC is designed to cancel. Finally, a sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of the choice of the initial TDIBC parameters for finding optimized settings. Our results pave the way to a wider application of the presented procedure in more complex problems with bulk flow motion and larger perturbation amplitudes.},

In this solver, the coupling between velocity and pressure is solved using the IDEAL algorithm, which was first proposed by the present author. Then, two test cases are performed to verify the performance superiority of the developed solver. The results indicate that the IDEAL algorithm can converge to the steady-state solution at a much larger time step. Compared with the PISO and PIMPLE algorithms, the IDEAL algorithm can save the computational time by 34.9–88.8\% and 19.8–94.1\%, respectively. The developed solver has all the advantages of OpenFOAM software, which has a significant benefit in simulating the unsteady incompressible flows of engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Multilayer networks are one type of complex systems that have multiple types of interactions among their nodes. Through the development and extension of the real-world networks, especially social and biological networks , understanding the structure and organization of multilayer systems become more significant. In this paper, we propose a new computational model based on learning automata to overcome the problems related to multilayer networks. In our proposed model, the whole network is modeled as a set of layers in which an irregular cellular learning automata (ICLA) is assigned to each node in a layer. The functionality of cellular learning automata (CLA) is dependent on two important features: local and global environments. In this model, the information from the other layers is evaluated as the global environments, and update rules are performed based on the information from the other layers. Finally, by the convergence of CLA in each layer the global environments cause the multilayer cellular learning automata (MLCLA) to cover all possible states in all nodes of layers. We apply this model to community detection in multilayer networks as an example of the application of the proposed model. To solve this, each CLA by the depth-first search algorithm detects the optimal community in a layer and then sends the information about the identified community to the next layer as a feature vector. The simulation results on multiple well-known multilayer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of similarity and modularity measures, and the analysis results of the proposed algorithm in terms of Precision, Recall, and F1-score are higher than the other available community detection methods.},

The methodology is based on the concepts of model order reduction and domain decomposition to construct a multi-block approach. A generic block model is built to represent a group of interconnect blocks that are used to wire standard cells in the integrated circuits (ICs). The blocks in this group possess identical geometry with various metal/via routings. The data-driven model reduction method is thus applied to learn material property variations induced by different metal/via routings in the blocks, in addition to the variations of heat sources and BCs. The approach is investigated in two very different settings. It is first applied to thermal simulation of a single interconnect block with similar BCs to those in the training of the generic block. It is then implemented in multi-block thermal simulation of a FinFET IC, where the interconnect structure is partitioned into several blocks each modeled by the generic block model. Accuracy of the generic block model is examined in terms of the metal/via routings, BCs and thermal discontinuities at the block interfaces.},

The use of GPUs allows simulations to run on desktop computers in a few minutes or hours, while still simulating an accurate number of cells to replicate infection experiments.

Some variants of this virus were detected, including the Delta, which caused new waves of infections. This work uses an extended version of a SIRD model that includes vaccination effects to measure the impact of the Delta variant in three countries: Germany, Israel and Brazil. The calibrated models were able to reproduce the dynamics of the above countries. In addition, hypothetical scenarios were simulated to quantify the impact of vaccination and mitigation policies during the Delta wave. The results showed that the model could reproduce the complex dynamics observed in the different countries. The estimated increase of transmission rate due to the Delta variant was highest in Israel (7.9), followed by Germany (2.7) and Brazil (1.5). These values may support the hypothesis that people immunised against COVID-19 may lose their defensive antibodies with time since Israel, Germany, and Brazil fully vaccinated half of the population in March, July, and October. The scenario to study the impact of vaccination revealed relative reductions in the total number of deaths between 30\% and 250\%; an absolute reduction of 300 thousand deaths in Brazil due to vaccination during the Delta wave. The second hypothetical scenario revealed that mitigation policies saved up to 300 thousand Brazilians; relative reductions in the total number of deaths between 24\% and 120\% in the three analysed countries. Therefore, the results suggest that both vaccination and mitigation policies were crucial in decreasing the spread and the number of deaths during the Delta wave.},

Hence, all integrals appearing in the regularized PIES formulation are non-singular and can be evaluated numerically with a standard low order Gauss–Legendre quadrature rule. Using this formulation, the stability of solutions for different distances between collocation points and quadrature nodes is investigated. The influence of the number of integration and collocation points on the accuracy and stability of solutions for the proposed regularization in comparison with dedicated procedures for evaluation of strongly and weakly singular integrals is also studied. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the regularization in PIES on the results compared with other methods for evaluating singular integrals in non-regularized PIES.},

It is crucial to understand the topology and dynamic processes of multilayer networks. Nodes in interdependent networks have strong coupling effect which implies that the whole is not the same that the sum of its parts, so it will reduce the collective influence of nodes. Most methods of influential node identification have some defects in that they do not consider coupling between nodes. In this paper, we use Supra-matrix to represent interdependent networks, and propose a novel nodes identification method (SLE) based on Supra-Laplacian Laplacian energy. This method selects a set of influential nodes with minimal coupling effect to maximize the collective influence. The monolayer networks and multilayer networks are used to evaluate the performance of the SLE. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is a good alternative index to identify real important nodes. Compared with monolayer network, SLE algorithm is sensitive in interdependent networks in terms of connected component number, size of giant component , shortest distance and so on.},

  abstract     = {Indoor localization systems have become more and more popular. Several technologies are intensively studied with application to high precision object localization in such environments. Ultra-wideband (UWB) is one of the most promising, as it combines relatively low cost and high localization accuracy, especially compared to Beacon or WiFi. Nevertheless, we noticed that the leading UWB systems’ accuracy is far below the values declared in the documentation. To achieve high localization accuracy, low fingerprinting complexity, and tolerance to significant random errors, we propose a Multiple Hypothesis Tracker with Direction Motion Constraint (MHT-MDC) algorithm followed by a transfer learning approach. We perform fingerprinting using a dense grid in a controlled environment to train the neural network . Thanks to transfer learning , full fingerprinting is not necessary to obtain high localization accuracy when the UWB system is deployed in a new localization. We demonstrate that thanks to transfer learning, high localization accuracy can be maintained when only 7\% of fingerprinting samples from a new localization are used to update the neural network , which is very important in practical applications. It is also worth noticing that our approach can be easily extended to other localization technologies. This is an extended version of the conference paper published in [1].},

  abstract     = {The exponential growth of the quantity of data that circulates on the web led to the emergence of the big data phenomenon. This fact is a natural consequence of the proliferation of social media, mobile devices , the abundance of free online storage, and new technologies like the internet of things . Subsequently, big data has created several challenges to the computer science community, among which the large size of data is the most challenging. Traditional machine learning algorithms used mostly for insight extraction find themselves inadequate, even on high-performance computer architectures . For instance, big data analytics algorithms can overcome the size issue by either: (1) adapting the existing machine learning techniques to the scale of the big data; or, (2) by sampling big datasets, choosing randomly much smaller subsets of the data population, to meet what current algorithms can handle. In the present work, we aim to proceed through the second alternative to address the size challenge in the big data context. We propose intelligent sampling techniques based on Scalable Simple Random Sampling (ScaSRS) and Subsampled Double Bootstrap (SDB). Test results carried out on public generic datasets show that our proposal is able to address the size dimension efficiently. The proposed algorithms were evaluative on a classification task where the obtained results provided significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art.},

This paper proposes hybridizing the artificial bee colony with the Fibonacci indicator algorithm to achieve strong exploration and highly efficient exploitation capabilities. We show that the hybrid algorithm is better than ABC and FIA and delivers superior outcomes for various optimization functions widely used in the literature, including 20 scalable basic and ten complex CEC2019 test functions.},

  abstract     = {Dispatching rules are fast and simple procedures for creating schedules for various kinds of scheduling problems. However, manually designing DRs for all possible scheduling conditions and scheduling criteria is practically infeasible. For this reason, much of the research has focused on the automatic design of DRs using various methods, especially genetic programming . However, even if genetic programming is used to design new DRs to optimise a particular criterion, it will not give good results for all possible problem instances to which it can be applied. Due to the stochastic nature of genetic programming, the evolution of DRs must be performed several times to ensure that good DRs have been obtained. However, in the end, usually only one rule is selected from the set of evolved DRs and used to solve new scheduling problems. In this paper, a DR selection procedure is proposed to select the appropriate DR from the set of evolved DRs based on the features of the problem instances to be solved. The proposed procedure is executed simultaneously with the execution of the system, approximating the properties of the problem instances and selecting the appropriate DR for the current conditions. The obtained results show that the proposed approach achieves better results than those obtained when only a single DR is selected and used for all problem instances.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer researchers are very interested in studying and analyzing the survival time of patients. However, choosing the appropriate model for survival time analysis is the main challenge in the survival analysis of these patients. Using a dataset of patients with breast cancer, a new survival analysis model is proposed in this study. First, using the Cox-PH model, the whole selected data was categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups. The classified data was given to the AFT model in the next step to estimate the survival time. In some instances, the value of the metabolic status of the Tamoxifen feature was missing. Next, using the information obtained from the first and second steps, in the proposed Manifold-based semi-supervised learning module, the value of missing data was estimated. Using all labeled data, the final survival analysis was performed, and the relative hazard obtained. The comparison of the proposed model via other previous models in survival analysis demonstrates that the proposed model is 26\% more accurate than when only the Cox-PH model was used and 28\% more accurate than when only the AFT model was used in the testing set. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that when the Manifold-based SSL model was used in the learning module, the accuracy was 19\% higher than the Co-training SSL method and 12\% higher than the SVMSSL method. The advantages of the proposed survival analysis method are high capability for identifying the survival risk classes of the patient and high predictive accuracy for the relative hazard.},

  abstract     = {Most parallel applications suffer from load imbalance, a crucial performance degradation factor. In particle simulations, this is mainly due to the migration of particles between processing elements, which eventually gather unevenly and create workload imbalance. Dynamic load balancing is used at various iterations to mitigate load imbalance, employing a partitioning method to divide the computational space evenly while minimizing communications. In this paper, we propose a novel partitioning methodology called “informed partitioning”. It uses information based on the evolution of the computation to reduce the load balancing growth and the number of load balancing calls. In this paper, we illustrate informed partitioning by proposing a new geometric partitioning technique for particles simulations. This technique is derived from the well-known recursive coordinate bisection and employs the velocity of the particles to guide the bisection axis. To properly compare the performance of our new method with existing partitioning techniques during application execution, we introduce an effort metric based on a theoretical model of load balanced parallel application time. We propose a proof-of-concept of informed partitioning, through a numerical study, on three N-Body simulations with various particle dynamics, and we discuss its performance against popular geometric partitioning techniques. Moreover, we show that our effort metric can be used to rank partitioning techniques by their efficiency at any time point during the simulation. Eventually, this could be used to choose the best partitioning on the fly. In the numerical study, we report that our novel concept increases the performance of two experiments out of three by up to 76\% and 15\%, while being marginally slower by only 3\% in one experiment. Also, we discuss the limitations of our implementation of informed partitioning and our effort metric.},

  abstract     = {Developing interdisciplinary undergraduate courses is challenging at all levels; it requires involving trained faculty who can successfully cover more than one discipline and creating a new curriculum that crosses discipline boundaries. While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy , and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. This study expands on Oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results. This study also includes more recent approaches to teaching computational neuroscience using cloud computing .},

Adequate data may be synthetically imputed to replace missing values – a technique known as missing data imputation – avoiding deletion of incomplete observations.

In this extended version of our work presented at the International Conference on Computational Science Neves et al.

We further studied how data imputation methods can be used to generate fully synthetic datasets . Among other benefits, the generation of synthetic data can help to mitigate legal, ethical, and data privacy issues, as well as to augment original data. In this context, we introduce tabulator , which is a novel meta-method for synthetic data generation that uses the data imputation methods as back-end engines for tabular data generation. We evaluated our data imputation methods using datasets with different amputation rates following the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) setting. The results show that our methods are en-par or outperform state-of-the-art imputation methods in terms of response time and the quality of imputed data. We further evaluated and compared our data generation methods, which were derived from tabulator , with a state-of-the-art approach, the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN). The evaluation results show that our tabulator methods outperform CTGAN in many cases, for example regarding the accuracy of machine learning tasks (e.g., prediction or classification) performed on the synthetic output data.},

  abstract     = {Fire is a recurring event that usually causes a lot of social, environmental, ecological, and economic damage in different environments. Therefore, machine vision-based fire detection can be one of the most important tasks in modern surveillance systems. Most of the existing computer vision-based fire detection methods are only able to detect a single case of flame or smoke. In this research, a unified flame and smoke detection approach, termed “UFS-Net,” based on deep learning is proposed. An efficient and tailored convolutional neural network architecture is designed to detect both fire flames and smoke in video frames. UFS-Net is capable of identifying fire hazards by classifying video frames into eight classes: 1) flame, 2) white smoke, 3) black smoke, 4) flame and white smoke, 5) flame and black smoke, 6) black smoke and white smoke, 7) flame, white smoke and black smoke, and 8) normal status. To further increase the reliability of UFS-Net, a decision module based on a voting scheme is applied. In addition, a rich annotated dataset named “UFS-Data” that includes 849,640 images and 26 videos, captured/collected from various data sources and artificial images made in this research, is prepared for training and evaluation of UFS-Net. Extensive experiments conducted on “UFS-Data” and other benchmark datasets (i.e., “Mivia,” “BoWFire,” and “FireNet”), and the comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, confirm the high performance of UFS-Net.

  abstract     = {In this article, an improved variant of the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) named gaze cues learning-based grey wolf optimizer (GGWO) is proposed. The main intentions are to reduce the existing high selective pressure and low diversification of the GWO algorithm, which results in premature convergence, local optima trapping, and stagnation problems. The GGWO algorithm benefits from two new search strategies: neighbor gaze cues learning (NGCL) and random gaze cues learning (RGCL) inspired by the gaze cueing behavior in wolves. The NGCL strategy enhances the exploitation ability and local optima avoidance. The RGCL, however, boosts the population diversity and balance between exploration and exploitation. The cooperation among three search strategies GWO, NGCL, and RGCL, improves diversification, exploration, and exploitation. The GGWO algorithm performance was evaluated by conducting CEC&#39;18 test functions. Furthermore, the results of GGWO were compared with nine metaheuristic algorithms KH, iwPSO , WOA, GWO, GWO-EPD, HGWOSCA, EEGWO, BOA , and VAGWO. Moreover, the experimental results were statistically analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests. Additionally, four real engineering design problems and two problems of optimal power flow (OPF) for the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus are optimized to verify the applicability of the GGWO in practice. The results show that the GGWO algorithm has been able to provide competitive and superior results to the compared algorithms, and it is capable of solving engineering problems.},

The improvement plan adds the consideration of the speed difference between the front and rear vehicles, and introduces the safe distance parameter of the most dangerous situation when the vehicle is braking. The comparison with the actual measurement results after simulation and conversion shows that the improved car following model is effective and the vehicle lane change rules are improved. The improvement of lane changing rules allows different lane changing rules to be obtained in different situations. The lane-changing rules are coupled with the improved car-following model to obtain a two-lane model based on different rules. The corresponding programming simulation is compared with the measured road results to verify the practicability of the model. The simulation result shows that the new model can still reproduce the road traffic flow under different lane changing rules. After the introduction of mixed traffic, the model can reproduce the maximum flow of the road within the error tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Community detection in complex networks has been one of the major research areas since last one decade. Most of the community detection algorithms are non-deterministic, thus yielding different community structures in different iterations of an algorithm for a certain network. However, recent research has showed the existence of Constant Communities (CCs) — the core of a community structure, whose members always remain consistent irrespective of any iteration of the algorithm. Therefore, from an adversarial point of view, disintegrating such CCs requires thorough understanding of the internal connectivity among nodes as it is even harder to break a CC compared to breaking a community. Here we focus on how small disruption of the structure of a CC can cause major disintegration of its structure. Specifically, we propose a novel ranking scheme of edges forming a CC based on several factors: size and cliquishness of the CC as well as number of fragments and evenness of splits caused by the removal of an edge. We use several (and diverse) networks and compare the proposed ranking scheme with state-of-the-art edge-based ranking schemes to show that our ranking scheme is different from others and highly effective. Moreover, to understand the physical significance of edges forming CCs, we interpret our results on real-world networks and observe that edges that are ranked higher by our scheme are highly vulnerable to the attack that can cause maximum disintegration of the CCs.},

  abstract     = {This paper shows that the prediction capability of wildfire progression can be improved by estimation of a single prevailing wind vector parametrized by a wind speed and a wind direction to drive a wildfire simulation created by FARSITE. Estimations of these wind vectors are achieved in this work by a gradient-free optimization via a grid search that compares wildfire model simulations with measured wildfire perimeters, where noisy observations are modeled as uncertainties on the locations of the vertices of the measured wildfire perimeters. Two optimizations are established to acquire the optimal wind speed and wind direction. To formulate a perimeter optimization, an uncertainty-weighted least-squares error is computed between the vertices of the simulated and measured wildfire perimeter. The challenge in this approach is to match the number of vertices on the simulated and measured wildfire perimeter via interpolation of perimeter points and their uncertainties. For a surface area optimization, an uncertainty-weighted surface area error is introduced to capture the surface of the union minus the intersection of the simulated and measured wildfire perimeter. The challenge in this approach is to formulate a surface area error, weighted by the uncertainties on the locations of the vertices of the measured wildfire perimeter. The optimization in this paper is based on an iterative refinement of a grid of the wind vector and provides robustness to intermittent erroneous results produced by FARSITE, while allowing parallel execution of wildfire model calculations. This paper is an extension of the work in Tan et al., (2021). Results on wind vector estimation are illustrated on two historical wildfire events: the 2019 Maria Fire that burned south of the community of Santa Paula in the area of Somis, CA, and the 2019 Cave Fire that started in the Santa Ynez Mountains of Santa Barbara County.},

Observations conclude that there is a need to pay more attention to drivers for an approaching emergency vehicle by implementing new technologies in cars and road infrastructure and educating drivers. One way to present valuable results is to use mathematical and computer simulation methods. Various macroscopic and microscopic road traffic models allow traffic flow analysis. However, it should be emphasised that standard traffic flow models do not include emergency vehicle traffic. We propose a multi-agent microscopic model for analysing the traffic flow of emergency vehicles in an urban environment, with some limitations to the distance between vehicles and their proper distribution (“corridor of life”) to leave a free passage for a privileged vehicle. Real data was used to calibrate and validate the model. Our simulation studies show the importance of certain aspects of road traffic (distance between cars, “corridor of life”, size and type of roadside, frictional conflict, etc.) to increase/decrease the traffic flow considering the approaching emergency vehicle.},

  abstract     = {Performing exploratory analysis and visualization of large-scale time-varying computational science applications is challenging due to inaccuracies that arise from under-resolved data. In recent years, Lagrangian representations of the vector field computed using in situ processing are being increasingly researched and have emerged as a potential solution to enable exploration. However, prior works have offered limited estimates of the encumbrance on the simulation code as they consider “theoretical” in situ environments. Further, the effectiveness of this approach varies based on the nature of the vector field, benefitting from an in-depth investigation for each application area. With this study, an extended version of Sane et al. (2021), we contribute an evaluation of Lagrangian analysis viability and efficacy for simulation codes executing at scale on a supercomputer . We investigated previously unexplored cosmology and seismology applications as well as conducted a performance benchmarking study by using a hydrodynamics mini-application targeting exascale computing . To inform encumbrance, we integrated in situ infrastructure with simulation codes, and evaluated Lagrangian in situ reduction in representative homogeneous and heterogeneous HPC environments. To inform post hoc accuracy, we conducted a statistical analysis across a range of spatiotemporal configurations as well as a qualitative evaluation. Additionally, our study contributes cost estimates for distributed-memory post hoc reconstruction. In all, we demonstrate viability for each application — data reduction to less than 1\% of the total data via Lagrangian representations, while maintaining accurate reconstruction and requiring under 10\% of total execution time in over 90\% of our experiments.},

  abstract     = {Learning from imbalanced data streams is one of the challenges associated with classification algorithms and learning classifiers. The goal of this paper is to propose and validate a new approach for learning from data streams, with reference to the problem of class-imbalanced data. A hybrid approach for changing the class distribution towards a more balanced dataset using over-sampling and instance selection techniques is discussed. The proposed approach is based on the integration of a weighted ensemble classification and a technique to deal with the problem of class imbalance, and is called Weighted Ensemble with one-class Classification and Over-sampling and Instance selection (WECOI). Our approach assumes that classifiers are induced from incoming blocks of instances, called data chunks. These data chunks consist of incoming instances from different classes, and a balance between them is reached through our hybrid approach. These data chunks are then used to induce classifier ensembles . The proposed approach is validated experimentally using several selected benchmark datasets, and the results of computational experiments are presented and discussed. The results show that the proposed approach for eliminating class imbalance in data streams can help increase the performance of online learning algorithms. This is an extended version of a paper that was presented at the International Conference on Computational Science in 2021 (ICCS-2021) (Czarnowski, 2021).

Our paper is an extended version of our previously published paper in the International Conference on Computational Science 2021. Our method considers converting an image into a virtual environment, which maps to the original image and consists of HIV+ and HIV− female agents depending on the distribution of the pixels. Then, the algorithm introduces HIV+ male agents the purpose of which is to move around and infect other HIV− female agents. The movements of the HIV+ male agents are designed in a way that follows the relative coding approach, utilized in different chain coding projects. The relative coding increases the likelihood of generating consecutive codes that are encoded in a similar manner, and therefore, helps in providing better compression ratios. The algorithm tracks certain HIV+ male movements and uses them along with other pieces of information to reconstruct the original image back. As the literature shows, agent-based modeling can be advantageous over mathematical techniques and it can be effectively applied in some domains. The outcomes revealed that we could outperform standardized benchmarks used by researchers in the image processing community. Additionally, the paired samples t-tests reveal that the mean differences between our results and the ones generated by the other benchmarks (e.g. JBIG2) are statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {Sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) appears in many application domains, and performance is the key consideration when implementing SpMV kernels. At the same time, accuracy is also important because rounding errors can drastically change the computed result. Multiple-precision arithmetic is a common approach to improve the accuracy of results. In this paper, we implement and evaluate multiple-precision SpMV kernels in the CSR, JAD, ELLPACK, and DIA matrix storage formats for graphics processing units . In the proposed implementation, the matrix is represented in double precision, while the input and output vectors are in multiple precision and internal computations are also performed in multiple precision. Our underlying floating-point arithmetic algorithms are based on the residue number system, which is attractive because of its carry-free nature and provides an arbitrary level of precision determined by the set of moduli that comprise the base of the system. In particular, we apply sets from 8 to 64 moduli, reaching precision values from 106 to 848 bits, and demonstrate how higher precision reduces the rounding errors in the SpMV kernel. We also conduct a thorough analysis of the CSR kernel in terms of roofline performance, occupancy and memory bandwidth , and evaluate the performance and memory consumption for all the proposed kernels. Numerical experiments on matrices from real-world applications show that ELLPACK offers the highest performance in many examples, while JAD is a good trade-off between performance and space requirements. Furthermore, our proposed kernels in general substantially improve the efficiency of sparse matrix–vector multiplication compared to implementations built on top of existing multiple-precision CUDA libraries. Finally, we integrate the multiple-precision SpMV into a preconditioned conjugate gradient linear solver and identify test cases where our implementation exhibits superior convergence and numerical robustness.},

The problem addresses the stick transportation by robot pairs from the predefined starting position to the pre-assumed goal position. This paper describes the method of computing collision-free paths for multiple numbers of paired robots called twins using a hybrid algorithm with balanced local exploitation and global exploration. The hybrid algorithm is designed by combining the individual benefits of the improved Q-Learning (IQ) and democratic robotics particle swarm optimization (DRPSO). The main intention of IQ is to produce the best position with collision avoidance by executing the best state-action pair. DRPSO algorithm computes the optimal trajectory for the twin robot using the distributed democratic approach and enhances the intensification capability. The twin robots are synchronized to the number of steps, turns, the direction of movement, and distance between both of them in the proposed approach. Computer simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in both paths travelled and runtime. The experimental and VREP simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm offers better synchronization, cooperation, and performance in terms of several parameters such as path length, path deviation, run time, and path smoothness as a replica of the number of turns made. The comparative study with artificial bee colony optimization (ABCO) and imperialist competitive firefly algorithm (ICFA) witnesses the superiority of the hybrid IQ-DRPSO algorithm. Experiments that have been conducted through Arduino bots in a real environment prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {In multiplex networks, nodes can have multiple types of relationships (links) encoded into different layers such that each layer represents a single type of link. Even though the nature of links in different layers may differ, the nodes themselves remain the same, and so do their underlying relations among themselves. Combining the information in all the layers into one single network such that link prediction can be performed using all the available information is an ongoing research problem. In this work, we theorize that to accurately perform this link prediction, we have to take into account the relevance of both the edges as well as the nodes that connect two directly unconnected nodes. First, we utilize an aggregation model that encodes the information from different layers into one summarized weighted static network, taking into account the relative density of the layers themselves. Then, we propose an algorithm, M N E R L P − M U L MNERLP−MUL , which first calculates node and edge relevance based on the summarized graph, and then we combine both these factors to perform link prediction on unconnected pairs of nodes. The edge relevance is calculated using the information from the immediate vicinity of the edge (local information), while node relevance is calculated based on the node’s importance to the overall structure of the graph (global information). We use this methodology to model our method on quasi-local link prediction approaches, which attempt to inculcate properties of both local and global properties for increased accuracy. We compare our method with classical link prediction methods for weighted graphs , and the results indicate its superior performance, both on the summarized weighted graph and original layers.},

  abstract     = {Studying complex phenomena in detail by performing real experiments is often an unfeasible task. Virtual experiments using simulations are usually used to support the development process. However, numerical simulations are limited by their computational cost. Metamodeling techniques are commonly used to mimic the behavior of unknown solver functions, especially for expensive black box optimizations. If a good correlation between the surrogate model and the black box function is obtained, expensive numerical simulations can be significantly reduced. The sampling strategy, which selects a subset of samples that can adequately predict the behavior of expensive black box functions, plays an important role in the fidelity of the surrogate model. Achieving the desired metamodel accuracy with as few solver calls as possible is the main goal of global surrogate modeling. In this paper, exploration-oriented adaptive sampling strategies are compared with commonly used one-stage sampling approaches, such as Latin Hypercube Design (LHD). The difference in the quality of approximation is tested on benchmark functions from 2 up to 30 variables. Two novel sampling algorithms to get fine-grained quasi-LHDs will be proposed and an improvement to a well-known, pre-existing sequential input algorithm will be discussed. Finally, these methods are applied to a crash box design to investigate the performance when approximating highly non-linear crashworthiness problems. It is found that adaptive sampling approaches outperform one-stage methods both in terms of mathematical properties and in terms of metamodel accuracy in the majority of the tests. A proper stopping algorithm should also be employed with adaptive methods to avoid oversampling.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) of dynamical systems with a surrogate model is difficult as the surrogate model parameters often need to be computed at each time step. For that reason, a different kind of surrogate model is presented in this article by representing the stochastic response quantity using lower number of bases. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to project the response quantity with low number of POD bases and the uncertainty is propagated using the Kriging model. The combined POD–Kriging model is used for UQ of four dynamical systems and all the results are compared with the Monte Carlo simulation results. The first three problems are long time integration problems and the time-dependent statistical moments are predicted well by the POD–Kriging model using low number of model evaluations. For the last example (a building subjected to Gaussian white noise base acceleration), the prediction accuracy of the POD–Kriging model is also high as compared to a similar surrogate model.},

  abstract     = {Cuckoo Search (CS), a population based meta-heuristic technique is motivated by the breeding characteristics of cuckoos. The main disadvantage of CS is its local stagnation due to weak exploration capability. To improve the exploration capacity and maintain appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation, this paper proposes a new variant of Cuckoo Search algorithm , namely, Perturbation and Repository based Diversified Cuckoo Search (PRDCS). It incorporates two modifications: Memorisation of the set of best solutions and four single-component successive Perturbations. For Memorisation, PRDCS uses a Repository to store solutions of the population having the same best Cost value. Any member (best solution) from the Repository is selected randomly for applying four single-component successive Perturbations on it. PRDCS has been applied to CEC2005 benchmark suit for performance validation. The computational experiment on CEC 2005 benchmarks suit has established that PRDCS is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in respect of the performance metrics used. Furthermore, PRDCS has been applied to Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) reconstruction using Recurrent Neural Network (PRDCS-RNN) model and Pearson Correlation Coefficient has been computed for the reconstructed GRN to remove the false positive edges. Application of the Proposed PRDCS-RNN on two real life gene expression datasets, IRMA-OFF and IRMA-ON reveals that, it is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in respect of performance metrics like F-score, Sensitivity, Specificity and Precision in producing well reconstructed GRN.},

Unlike the original SSA, DSSA-R accepts half of the population as the leader instead of using a single leader salp strategy. Nevertheless, the suggested algorithm includes two different equations to update the positions of the leader salps and follower salps. Furthermore, Refreshing Gap strategy was included in DSSA-R to avoid the algorithm from being stuck in the local optimum. The final improvement made on the original SSA was the addition of ”Linear Population Reduction Strategy” to strengthen the exploitation aspect of the algorithm. The performance of the DSSA-R algorithm was tested using the functions of the CEC 2014 and CEC 2015 benchmark suites and compared with five SSA variants and four state-of-the-art algorithms. Test results show that DSSA-R obtained better and competitive results compared to the algorithms it was compared with.},

  abstract     = {Despite the popularity of the Ti6Al4V alloy in many biomedical applications owing to its lightweight and mechanical properties, the applications of sheet metal-formed parts are often limited to simple shapes due to their poor strainability exhibited at room temperature. To overcome the present limits, new processes have been developed, among which the Hot Single Point Incremental Forming (HSPIF) appears as one of the most promising solutions to improve the formability as well as the shape complexity. However, there are some obstacles to its practical implementation including instability in material deformation and achievable accuracy. The present paper provides the most recent finding in the investigation of the SPIF process at a high temperature of a titanium acetabular cup by Finite Element (FE) simulations and optimization procedure. FE models were developed using ABAQUS software and the constitutive parameters, both of the material and the process were calibrated to inspect the minimum geometric errors and to avoid damage in the final component. Based on effective strategies of metamodeling, an application of four recent meta-heuristic algorithms Multi-verse MVO , Moth-flame MFO, Harris Hawk HHO, and Marine Predictor MPA is presented. The computational results prove that the evaluated techniques are very competitive in geometry optimization. Among these four optimizers, MPA is the best one that quickly estimates the pillow defect in HSPIF.},

As FFT is a frequently used algorithm in signal processing applications , the architecture of the FFT has to be optimized in terms of area, power, and delay. An innovative method has been introduced to implement FFT using QCA named Stack-Type Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (STQCA). This novel architecture reduces the area by half that of conventional approaches. The proposed FFT layout yields better performance, with number of quantum cells and size as, 32,534 and 87.23 µm 2 respectively. The latency between input and output is about 0.116 ns which is quite low. The layout&#39;s power dissipation has also been extracted using the QCADesignerE-2.2 tool, which is merely 17.12nW.

  abstract     = {In the presence of strong heterogeneities, it is well known that the use of explicit schemes for the transport of species in a porous medium suffers from severe restrictions on the time step. This has led to the development of implicit schemes that are increasingly favored by practitioners for their computational efficiency. The transport equation requires knowledge of the velocity field, which results from an elliptic problem (Darcy problem) that is the most expensive part of the computation. When considering large reservoirs, a cost-effective way of approximating the Darcy problems is using multiscale domain decomposition (MDD) methods. They allow for the pressure and velocity fields to be computed on coarse meshes (large scale), while detailed basis functions are defined locally, usually in parallel, in a much finer grid (small scale). In this work we adopt the Multiscale Robin Coupled Method (MRCM, Guiraldello et al., 2018; Rocha et al., 2020), which is a generalization of previous MDD methods that allows for great flexibility in the choice of interface spaces. In this article we investigate the combination of the MRCM with implicit transport schemes. A sequentially implicit strategy is proposed, with different trust-region algorithms ensuring the convergence of the transport solver. The method is assessed on several very stringent 2D two-phase problems, demonstrating its stability even for large time steps. It is also shown that the best accuracy is achieved by considering recently introduced non-polynomial interface spaces, since polynomial spaces are not optimal for high-contrast channelized permeability fields.},

Edges in networks are vital communication channels in the information spreading process, many existing methods for identifying influential nodes are established via employing characteristics of nodes, but most of them consider the edges equally in unweighted networks . In this paper, we introduce a novel potential edge weight to distinguish the influence of each edge by utilizing the H-index, k-shell iteration factor and clustering coefficient of its connection nodes. A novel potential edge weight method, called the HIC centrality (HIC), is proposed to identify influential nodes in complex networks. The key idea of HIC is to incorporate neighborhood, position, and topological structure features to identify influential nodes. To evaluate the performance of HIC, we adopt the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model and the susceptible–infected (SI) model for simulation and conduct a series of comparative experiments on nine real-world networks and three artificial networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to seven contrast methods in terms of accuracy, effectiveness and distinguishing ability, including five centrality measures and two popular potential edge weight methods. The HIC centrality has low computational complexity , allowing it to be applied to sparse large-scale networks.},

  abstract     = {In game theory, the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of Stability (PoS) are excellent tools for characterizing the loss of competition’s efficiency. This paper investigates the PoA and PoS for incomplete information in Bayesian-Markov games. The development of computationally effective optimization tools is essential for the investigation of these equilibria. To attain this goal, the difficulty of computing the PoA and PoS is presented as a tractable nonlinear programming problem. We look at regularized cost-minimization issues and present a framework for building projection-gradient algorithms that have near-optimal a priori performance guarantees. For the constrained Lagrange technique, we use Tikhonov’s regularization approach, for which the original problem converges to a single solution. Then we suggest a framework for computing the difference between the ‘best equilibrium’ and the ‘optimal solution’, as well as the ratio between the ‘worst equilibrium’ and the ‘optimal solution’. To solve these issues, we use a game-theoretic method, assigning agents cost functions to maximize (PoA) or minimize (PoS) the equilibrium efficiency. After the agents’ regularized-cost functions have been established, every algorithm capable of discovering a Nash equilibrium of the system inherits a performance guarantee matching the PoA and Pos. The convergence of the suggested projection-gradient method under mild conditions is established. Finally, we consider the implications of our findings when this paradigm is applied to convex systems.},

In this investigation, a graph is considered with an associated set of matrices. The entries of each of the matrix correspond to a different weight of an arc. A multi-objective Hamiltonian cycle problem is addressed here by computing a Pareto set of solutions that minimize the sum of the weights of the arcs for each objective. Our heuristic approach extends the Branch-and-Fix algorithm, an exact method that embeds the problem in a stochastic process . To measure the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with a multi-objective genetic algorithm in graphs of a different number of vertices and density. The results show that the density of the graphs is critical when solving the problem. The multi-objective genetic algorithm performs better (quality of the Pareto sets) than the proposed approach in random graphs with high density; however, in these graphs it is easier to find Hamiltonian cycles, and they are closer to the multi-objective traveling salesman problem . The results reveal that, in a challenging benchmark of Hamiltonian graphs with low density, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the multi-objective genetic algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Breast Cancer is a disease with high risk and mortality rate associated with female health. The multi-omics data having genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome data, and pathological images are available for analysis. Artificial intelligence has huge scope in developing models to predict the occurrence, reoccurrence, and survival in breast cancer. In this paper, we proposed a parallel Bayesian hyperparameter optimized Stacked ensemble (BSense) model. The model is developed using stacking of machine learning models, i.e., Deep Neural Network (DNN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Distributed Random Forest (DRF). Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Processes is used to find the best hyperparameters for the machine learning models. The parallelism is coupled with Bayesian optimization to address the high computational time. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is used to select the most effective features from a dataset. The proposed model is evaluated on breast cancer dataset available on the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) portal and is validated on the METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium), Metabolomics, and RNA-seq datasets. It is evident from the experimental results that proposed BSense model outperforms DNN, GBM, and DRF models for breast cancer survival prediction. The BSense model achieved 83.9\%, 87.3\%, 91.1\%, and 80.1\% Area Under Curve (AUC) for TCGA, METABRIC, Metabolomics, and RNA-seq dataset, respectively, which is more in comparison to the existing models taken into consideration.},

In cases of minimally invasive spinal fusion surgeries, the internal tissue deformation cannot be visually perceived.

Hence, this paper proposes a high-speed and accurate algorithm designed specifically to exploit this opportunity. Experimental cadaveric data were curve fitted then employed to generate force feedback .

  abstract     = {Vector Particle-In-Cell (VPIC) is one of the fastest plasma simulation codes in the world, with particle numbers ranging from one trillion on the first petascale system, Roadrunner, to ten trillion particles on the more recent Blue Waters supercomputer . As supercomputers continue to grow rapidly in size, so too does the gap between computing capability and memory capability. Current memory systems limit VPIC simulations greatly as the maximum number of particles that can be simulated directly depends on the available memory. In this study, we present a suite of VPIC memory optimizations (i.e., particle weight, half-precision, and fixed-point optimizations) that enable a significant increase in the number of particles in VPIC simulations. We assess the optimizations’ impact on memory and runtime performance for a suite of cutting-edge computer architectures such has the NVIDIA V100 GPU, the IBM Power9, and the Fujitsu A64FX architectures. Our optimizations enable a 31.25\% reduction in memory usage and up to 40\% increase in the number of particles.

Traditional approaches treat path planning and stable control of the system as a separate problem, or multiple controls are employed to achieve both goals. Therefore, these approaches are complex, computationally, and time-wise expensive. The addition of disturbance to the system makes the control further intricate. In this paper, we proposed an optimization-based approach for the path planning and stable control of the non-linear systems by employing a hybrid controller , which includes BAS and PID. We devised a switching mechanism, where BAS will first perform the trajectory optimization through feedforward control. In the second phase, a disturbance is introduced in the system, and BAS is used to optimize the K K values of PID for the control stability. In the simulation, we applied this technique on three non-linear systems, i.e., 5-link Biped Robot, inverted pendulum, and acrobot, and promising results are obtained. In addition we performed a comparison of dual Beetle Antennae Search algorithm with known swarm algorithms, i.e. PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and GA (Genetic Algorithm). The results showed that BAS and PSO are comparable. For example, in inverted pendulum the objective function converges to 7 . 566 × 1 0 − 4 7.566×10−4 and 0.029 by BAS and PSO respectively. Likewise, in 5-link Biped Robot the objective function converges to 0.0250 and 0.0351 by BAS and PSO respectively. In addition, the number of function evaluations in case of BAS increases linearly, i.e., 3 times of the iterations. However, the function evaluations increase exponentially in case of PSO and GA.},

  abstract     = {The safety factor is a critical indicator in evaluating the slope stability. However, many defects, such as excessive assumptions and insufficient consideration of influencing factors, which resulted in inaccurate calculation results of safety factor. Thus, in order to obtain the safety factor and evaluate the slope stability more accurately, the Stacking ensemble learning model with Bayesian optimization (BOP-Stacking) is proposed. It was built with the first-level regression algorithms including Decision Tree , Support Vector Machine and Nearest Neighbor and the secondary including Random Forest algorithm. Furthermore, to improve the prediction accuracy of slope safety factor, Bayesian optimization algorithm is adopted to optimize the hyperparameters of these four regression algorithms. In the study, the datasets, consist of 210 groups slope data which include density, cohesion, friction angle, slope angle, slope height and pore water pressure ratio, are established. It will be considered as the input layer indexes for ensemble learning model and every single regression algorithm to complete the prediction of slope safety factor. By comparing and analyzing mean square error and fitting situation between the predicted value and true value. It shows that the fitting is better, and mean square error (0.0916) is smaller than single models. It concludes that the prediction accuracy of slope safety factor can be improved effectively with BOP-Stacking. It not only avoids the complicated calculation, but also can provide a reference for the establishment of intelligent decision-control platform for slope stability.},

In order to achieve this, a modified LMD based on cubic spline interpolation is used to analyze the recorded audio signals during machining. Further, these decomposed chatter signals are explored to ascertain chatter severity in terms of a new dimensionless chatter indicator (CI). Total 27 experiment based on full factorial design are performed considering 3 levels of each machining parameters viz. axial depth of cut (D), feed rate (F) and spindle speed (N). CI and MRR are calculated for these 27 tests. Further, regression models of CI and MRR are developed using RSM (Response Surface Methodology) approach. Finally, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is invoked to optimize these regression models for obtaining best possible range of input parameters for minimal chatter and maximum MRR. Moreover, to validate the presented methodology, more tests are performed considering the ascertained optimal set of parameters. Verification results proved that the developed optimal solution is feasible and can be used for higher productivity with chatter free milling.},

However, some quantum algorithms and the corresponding quantum circuits can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer if the input quantum state is a low rank tensor and all intermediate states of the quantum algorithm can be represented or approximated by low rank tensors. In this paper, we examine the possibility of simulating a few quantum algorithms by using low-rank canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition to represent the input and all intermediate states of these algorithms. Two rank reduction algorithms are used to enable efficient simulation. We show that some of the algorithms preserve the low rank structure of the input state and can thus be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. However, the rank of the intermediate states in other quantum algorithms can increase rapidly, making efficient simulation more difficult. To some extent, such difficulty reflects the advantage or superiority of a quantum computer over a classical computer. As a result, understanding the low rank structure of a quantum algorithm allows us to identify algorithms that can benefit significantly from quantum computers.},

Such an approach requires making minimal changes to the original code and enables a smooth migration of large-scale nuclear structure simulations from a distributed-memory many-core CPU system to a distributed GPU system. However, in order to make the OpenACC based eigensolver run efficiently on GPUs, we need to take into account the architectural differences between a many-core CPU and a GPU device. Consequently, the optimal way to insert OpenACC directives may be different from the original way of inserting OpenMP directives. We point out these differences in the implementation of sparse matrix–vector multiplications with multiple vectors, which constitutes the main cost of the eigensolver, as well as other differences in the preconditioning step and dense linear algebra operations . We compare the performance of the OpenACC based implementation executed on multiple GPUs with the performance on distributed-memory many-core CPUs, and demonstrate significant speedup achieved on GPUs compared to the on-node performance of a many-core CPU. We also show that the overall performance improvement of the eigensolver on multiple GPUs is more modest due to the communication overhead among different MPI ranks.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a rich variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) that involves pickup and delivery activities, customer time windows, heterogeneous fleet, multiple products and the possibility of splitting a customer demand among several routes. This variant generalizes traditional VRP variants by incorporating features that are commonly found in practice. We present two mixed-integer programming models and propose a metaheuristic based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for the addressed problem. Additionally, to facilitate the use of the proposed approaches in real-world decision-making, we develop an open-source, publicly available web interface that allows one to set and solve VRP variants with the mentioned features. Computational experiments using benchmark instances with up to 150 customers show that the approaches can be used to obtain good-quality solutions in a reasonable time frame in practice.},

  abstract     = {It is widely acknowledged that, under the frame of sustainable farming, using the minimum water resources is a relevant requirement. In order to do that, precision irrigation aims at identifying the irrigation needs of plantations and irrigate accordingly. Artificial intelligence is a promising solution in this field as intelligent models are able to learn the soil moisture dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and then generating appropriate irrigation scheduling. This is a complex task as the phenology of plants and its water demand vary with soil properties and weather conditions. The present research contributes to this challenging task by proposing the application of neural networks in order to learn the time-series evolution of irrigation needs associated to a potato plantation. Several of such models are thoroughly compared, together with different interpolation methods, in order to find the best combination for accurately forecasting water needs.

  abstract     = {Sleep disorders are very widespread in the world population and suffer from a generalized underdiagnosis, given the complexity of their diagnostic methods. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in developing simpler screening methods. Pulse oximeter is an ideal device for sleep disorder screenings, since it is a portable, low-cost and accessible technology. This device can provide an estimation of the heart rate (HR), which can be useful to obtain information regarding the sleep stage. In this work, we developed a network architecture in order to classify the sleep stage in awake or asleep using only HR signals from a pulse oximeter. The proposed architecture has two fundamental parts. The first part has the aim of obtaining a representation of the HR by using temporal convolutional networks . Then, the obtained representation is used to feed the second part, which is based on transformers, a model built solely with attention mechanisms . Transformers are able to model the sequence, learning the transition rules between sleep stages. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on the Sleep Heart Health Study dataset, composed of 5000 healthy and pathological subjects. The dataset was split into three subsets: 2500 for training, 1250 for validating and 1250 for testing. The overall accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient were 90.0\%, 94.9\%, 78.1\%, and 0.73.},

Despite many existing commercial solutions, there are still some problems that need to be solved to improve the quality of obtained materials as well as overall process performance. For example, an irregularity of the electric field intensity distribution along the collector surface, resulting in an irregular distribution of nanofibers decreases the efficiency of the electrospinning process. Moreover, it also leads to the generation of coarser nanofibers from the middle part of the cylinder surface in comparison to those produced at the cylinder ends. The numerical simulations of the electrospinning process applying infinite domains using the finite element method presented in this paper provide effective methods to improve the distribution of the electric field intensity on the collector, which has a direct impact on the obtained structure of nanofibers.},

Also, we develop an algorithm to compute the persistence diagrams for the independent cycles in the pore space, which quantitatively characterizes the changes in the pore space topology. Moreover, we speed up this algorithm by using the original digital image reduction approach. Applying the clustering technique to the persistence diagrams, we show that different matrix dissolution scenarios can be distinguished based on the persistence homology. These scenarios depend on the flow rate, reaction rate, and species concentration at the inlet. At the same time, the samples from the different clusters illustrate utterly different behavior of the cross-property (porosity-permeability) relations.

Limited signal-to-noise ratio and significant partial volume effect due to the low resolution of ASL images make an accurate CBF estimation difficult. This work proposes a deep learning based ASL enhancement algorithm (Deep-ASL ENHANCE), based on the principle of single image super resolution and multi-loss joint strategy with two reconstruction modules and one weighted fusion module that employ residual dense block as the basic building block. Lack of huge amount of low quality and high quality images for training this deep learning network, is addressed by generating simulated ASL images from structural images of ADNI2. The experiment is conducted and results are evaluated on a simulated dataset in terms of different metrics such as RMSE, PSNR and SSIM. The model is also validated using clinical ASL images with the help of two independent radiologists and the results are compared using Visual Quality Score (VQS). The deep learning model trained by using simulated ASL images shows more promising results on clinical ASL data. The effectiveness of using Deep-ASL ENHANCE as a preprocessing step to the partial volume correction technique with Linear Regression algorithm (LR) has been investigated using RMSE score and it is found that CBF quantification accuracy is improved compared to the standalone LR algorithm.},

For instance, in the maritime domain, models that classify the types of ships based on their trajectories and other features perform well, but give no further explanation for their predictions. To gain the trust of human operators responsible for critical decisions, the reason behind the classification is crucial. In this paper, we introduce explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches to the task of classification of ship types. This supports decision-making by providing explanations in terms of the features contributing the most towards the prediction, along with their corresponding time intervals. In the case of the LIME explainer, we adapt the time-slice mapping technique (LimeforTime), while for Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and path integrated gradient (PIG), we represent the relevance of each input variable to generate a heatmap as an explanation. In order to validate the XAI results, the existing perturbation and sequence analyses for classifiers of univariate time series data is employed for testing and evaluating the XAI explanations on multivariate time series. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation technique to assess the quality of explanations yielded by the chosen XAI method.},

The relationship between the pseudo-differential propagation operator, variations of the refractive index, and the maximum propagation angle is established. It is proposed to use a rational approximation of the exponential propagation on an interval instead of the Padé approximation in a vicinity of a point. It is shown that using the approximation on an interval is more natural for this problem and allows using a more sparse computational grid than when using the local Padé approximation. Three variants of rational approximation on interval was considered: Chebyshev–Padé, rational interpolation and AAA method. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are analyzed in the context of the problem under consideration. The proposed method differs from the existing ones only in the coefficients of the numerical scheme and does not require any significant changes in the implementations of the existing numerical schemas. Stability and error analysis of the proposed approach was carried out. The application of the proposed approach to the tropospheric radio-wave propagation and underwater acoustics is provided. Numerical examples and comparison with alternative methods quantitatively demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. Python 3 implementation of the proposed method is freely available.

DA incorporates observational data into a prediction model to improve forecasted results.

Nevertheless, these approaches are incapable of fully overcoming their unrealistic assumptions. Machine Learning (ML) shows great capability in approximating nonlinear systems and extracting meaningful features from high-dimensional data. ML algorithms are capable of assisting or replacing traditional forecasting methods. However, the data used during training in any Machine Learning (ML) algorithm include numerical, approximation and round off errors, which are trained into the forecasting model. Integration of ML with DA increases the reliability of prediction by including information with a physical meaning. This work provides an introduction to Data Learning, a field that integrates Data Assimilation and Machine Learning to overcome limitations in applying these fields to real-world data. The fundamental equations of DA and ML are presented and developed to show how they can be combined into Data Learning.

  abstract     = {The rise of longitudinal single-cell sequencing experiments on patient-derived cell cultures, xenografts and organoids is opening new opportunities to track cancer evolution, assess the efficacy of therapies and identify resistant subclones. We introduce LACE, the first algorithmic framework that processes single-cell mutational profiles from samples collected at different time points to reconstruct longitudinal models of cancer evolution. The approach maximizes a weighted likelihood function computed on longitudinal data points to solve a Boolean matrix factorization problem, via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. On simulations, LACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both bulk and single-cell sequencing data with respect to the reconstruction of the ground-truth clonal phylogeny and dynamics, also in conditions of unbalanced datasets, significant rates of sequencing errors and sampling limitations. As the results are robust with respect to data-specific errors, LACE is effective with mutational profiles generated by calling variants from (full-length) scRNA-seq data, and this allows one to investigate the relation between genomic and phenotypic evolution of tumors at the single-cell level. Here, we apply LACE to a longitudinal scRNA-seq dataset of patient-derived xenografts of BRAF V600E/K V600E/K mutant melanomas, dissecting the impact of BRAF/MEK-inhibition on clonal evolution, also in terms of clone-specific gene expression dynamics. Furthermore, the analysis of breast cancer PDXs from longitudinal targeted scDNA-sequencing experiments delivers a high-resolution temporal characterization of intra-tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Finding the minimum vertex cover of a given graph is a well-known NP-Hard problem that has many applications in various fields. In this paper, we propose a distributed localized algorithm for detecting vertex cover using 2-hop local neighborhood information in the distributed systems. We propose a scoring based policy and add the 1-hop neighbors of nodes with the highest score among their 2-hop neighbors to the vertex cover. The score of nodes is calculated by dividing the number of uncovered edges in their local subgraph by the number of their 1-hop neighbors. In this way, the score of each node determines the average coverage ratio by each neighbor of that node. The time and bit complexities of the proposed algorithm are O ( n / Δ ) O(n/Δ) and O ( n 2 × l o g n ) O(n2×logn) respectively, where Δ Δ is the maximum node degree and n n is the number of nodes. The comprehensive simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm could find up to 11\% smaller solutions than the existing distributed algorithms with less than 1\% difference of optimum solutions in most of the evaluated graphs.},

  abstract     = {A key task of data science is to identify relevant features linked to certain output variables that are supposed to be modeled or predicted. To obtain a small but meaningful model, it is important to find stochastically independent variables capturing all the information necessary to model or predict the output variables sufficiently. Therefore, we introduce in this work a framework to detect linear and non-linear dependencies between different features. As we will show, features that are actually functions of other features do not represent further information. Consequently, a model reduction neglecting such features conserves the relevant information, reduces noise and thus improves the quality of the model. Furthermore, a smaller model makes it easier to adopt a model of a given system. In addition, the approach structures dependencies within all the considered features. This provides advantages for classical modeling starting from regression ranging to differential equations and for machine learning . To show the generality and applicability of the presented framework 2154 features of a data center are measured and a model for classifying faulty and non-faulty states of the data center is set up. This number of features is automatically reduced by the framework to 161 features. The prediction accuracy for the reduced model even improves compared to the model trained on the total number of features. A second example is the analysis of a gene expression data set where from 9513 genes 9 genes are extracted from whose expression levels two cell clusters of macrophages can be distinguished.},

The framework evaluates the system&#39;s RUL based on multi-scale sequences and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. First, the sliding time window method is used to prepare training samples, and the degradation features are directly mapped to RUL predictions. In addition, the model parameters are adjusted through the input multi-scale sequence to obtain the best prediction performance. This method integrates the application of time window, multi-scale sequence, and LSTM structure to improve prediction accuracy. The proposed method is validated using the NASA C-MAPSS data set, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework.},

Many studies have been carried out to improve the reconstruction quality, but the discrepancy between ground-truth imaging prototypes and recovered tomograms is still significant. To address the challenge, the regularization by denoising (RED) is introduced in this work, turning the denoising algorithm into a regularizer. Measurement physics, RED and sparsity prior are coupled into a new imaging model. A new numerical method is developed to solve the established imaging model by integrating the split Bregman algorithm and the forward backward splitting technique. To improve the performance of RED, the multiple output least squares support vector machine is combined with the low-dimensional representation method, and the training problem is solved by a new distributed computational method. The nonnegative matrix factorization method is extended into a new low-dimensional representation method, and a powerful optimizer is developed to solve the model. The performance evaluations clearly imply that the new method achieves more significant reconstruction performance gain and better robustness than popular imaging algorithms. This study improves the measurement physics based imaging method by machine learning techniques, and provides new perspectives and insights into the development of the image reconstruction paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Simulating the interaction of fluids with immersed moving solids is playing an important role for gaining a better quantitative understanding of how fluid dynamics is altered by the presence of obstacles and, vice versa, which forces are exerted on the solids by the moving fluid. Such problems appear in various contexts, ranging from numerous technical applications such as e.g. turbines to medical problems such as the regulation of cardiovascular hemodynamics by valves. Typically, the numerical treatment of such problems is posed within a fluid structure interaction (FSI) framework. General FSI models are able to capture bidirectional interactions, but are challenging to solve and computationally expensive. Simplified methods offer a possible remedy by achieving better computational efficiency to broaden the scope to demanding application problems with focus on understanding the effect of solids on altering fluid dynamics. In this study we report on the development of a novel method for such applications. In our method rigid moving obstacles are incorporated in a fluid dynamics context using concepts from porous media theory. Based on the Navier–Stokes–Brinkman equations which augments the Navier–Stokes equation with a Darcy drag term our method represents solid obstacles as time-varying regions containing a porous medium of vanishing permeability. Numerical stabilization and turbulence modeling is dealt with by using a residual based variational multiscale (RBVMS) formulation. The additional Darcy drag term and its respective stabilization are easily accommodated in any existing finite-element based Navier–Stokes solver. The key advantages of our approach – computational efficiency and ease of implementation – are demonstrated by solving a standard benchmark problem of a rotating blood pump posed by the Food and Drug Administration Agency (FDA). Validity is demonstrated by conducting a mesh convergence study and by comparison against the extensive set of experimental data provided for this benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Link prediction is the process of detecting new or missing links in any network. This work focuses on link prediction in dynamic networks. One of the major challenges of the link prediction problem is to achieve high accuracy. One of the well-known methods for link prediction is the similarity-based method, which uses similarity-based score. The three widely used similarity-based indices are Local (L), Global (G), and Quasi-local (Q) for calculating similarity scores. In this work, we have proposed a model, namely the LGQ model. In our LGQ model, the wide categories of indices are used in different combinations(L, G, Q, LG, LQ, GQ, LGQ) for feature set generation that can be used with various machine learning techniques for link prediction. In local similarity indices, we have considered Common Neighbors (CN), Adamic/Adar Index (AA), Jaccard Coefficient (JC), and Preferential Attachment (PA). In global similarity indices, we have considered cos+, Average Commute Time (ACT), Shortest Path (SP), MFI (Matrix Forest Index), and in quasi-local indices, local path Index (LP), Path of Length 3 (L3). We have tested and validated our proposed model by conducting numerical simulations on six well-known dynamic network datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed LGQ model and its variations outperform several baseline algorithms in terms of AUPR, F1 score, Balanced accuracy score (BAC), and AUC. We also demonstrate and contrast the preference of Neural Network and Xgboost based prediction models for different variations of proposed feature sets.},

  abstract     = {We present an autotuning approach for compile-time optimization of numerical discretization methods in simulations of partial differential equations . Our approach is based on data-driven regression of performance models for numerical methods. We use these models at compile time to automatically determine the parameters (e.g., resolution, time step size, etc.) of numerical simulations of continuum spatio-temporal models in order to optimize the tradeoff between simulation accuracy and runtime. The resulting autotuner is developed for the compiler of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for numerical simulations. The abstractions in the DSL enable the compiler to automatically determine the performance models and know which discretization parameters to tune. We demonstrate that this high-level approach can explore a large space of possible simulations, with simulation runtimes spanning multiple orders of magnitude. We evaluate our approach in two test cases: the linear diffusion equation and the nonlinear Gray-Scott reaction–diffusion equation. The results show that our model-based autotuner consistently finds configurations that outperform those found by state-of-the-art general-purpose autotuners. Specifically, our autotuner yields simulations that are on average 4.2x faster than those found by the best generic exploration algorithms, while using 16x less tuning time. Compared to manual tuning by a group of researchers with varying levels of expertise, the autotuner was slower than the best users by not more than a factor of 2, whereas it was able to significantly outperform half of them.},

These flights are simulated in the developed algorithm as movements of artificial search agents. Hunting flight of the artificial predator, plays the role of search intensification; while the escaping prey explores new places in the space by flying in the opposite direction or making a turn. The method adaptively tunes the flight lengths in each pair of the prey/predator agents to avoid use of extra control parameters. It takes advantage of swarm intelligence and opposition-based learning. Twelve test functions as well as seven engineering problems in discrete, continuous and mixed discrete-continuous types are successfully solved by the proposed Escaping Bird Search ; exhibiting its high convergence rate and competitive performance in comparison with the other treated meta-heuristics.},
