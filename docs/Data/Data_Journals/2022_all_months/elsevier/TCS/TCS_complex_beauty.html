  abstract     = {Consider an ordinal tree T on n nodes, each of which is assigned a category from an alphabet [ σ ] = { 1 , 2 , … , σ } [σ]={1,2,…,σ} . We preprocess the tree T in order to support categorical path counting queries , which ask for the number of distinct categories occurring on the path in T between two query nodes x and y . For this problem, we propose a linear-space data structure with query time O ( n lg ⁡ lg ⁡ σ lg ⁡ w ) O(nlg⁡lg⁡σlg⁡w) , where w = Ω ( lg ⁡ n ) w=Ω(lg⁡n) is the word size in the word-RAM. As shown in our proof, from the assumption that matrix multiplication cannot be solved in time polynomially faster than cubic (with only combinatorial methods), our result is optimal, save for polylogarithmic speed-ups. For a trade-off parameter 1 ≤ t ≤ n 1≤t≤n , we propose an O ( n + n 2 t 2 ) O(n+n2t2) - word, O ( t lg ⁡ lg ⁡ σ lg ⁡ w ) O(tlg⁡lg⁡σlg⁡w) query time data structure . We also consider c - approximate categorical path counting queries, which must return an approximation to the number of distinct categories occurring on the query path, by counting each such category at least once and at most c times. We describe a linear-space data structure that supports 2- approximate categorical path counting queries in O ( lg ⁡ n / lg ⁡ lg ⁡ n ) O(lg⁡n/lg⁡lg⁡n) time. Next, we generalize the categorical path counting queries to weighted trees. Here, a query specifies two nodes x , y x,y and an orthogonal range Q . The answer to thus formed categorical path range counting query is the number of distinct categories occurring on the path from x to y , if only the nodes with weights falling inside Q are considered. We propose an O ( n lg ⁡ lg ⁡ n + ( n / t ) 4 ) O(nlg⁡lg⁡n+(n/t)4) - word data structure with O ( t lg ⁡ lg ⁡ n ) O(tlg⁡lg⁡n) query time, or an O ( n + ( n / t ) 4 ) O(n+(n/t)4) - word data structure with O ( t lg ϵ ⁡ n ) O(tlgϵ⁡n) query time. For an appropriate choice of the trade-off parameter t , this implies a linear-space data structure with O ( n 3 / 4 lg ϵ ⁡ n ) O(n3/4lgϵ⁡n) query time. We then extend the approach to the trees weighted with vectors from [ n ] d [n]d , where d is a constant integer greater than or equal to 2. We present a data structure with O ( n lg d − 1 + ϵ ⁡ n + ( n / t ) 2 d + 2 ) O(nlgd−1+ϵ⁡n+(n/t)2d+2) words of space and O ( t lg d − 1 ⁡ n ( lg ⁡ lg ⁡ n ) d − 2 ) O(tlgd−1⁡n(lg⁡lg⁡n)d−2) query time. For an O ( n ⋅ polylog n ) O(n⋅polylogn) - space solution, one thus has O ( n 2 d + 1 2 d + 2 ⋅ polylog n ) O(n2d+12d+2⋅polylogn) query time. The inherent difficulty revealed by the lower bound we proved motivated us to consider data structures based on sketching . In unweighted trees, we propose a sketching data structure to solve the approximate categorical path counting problem which asks for a ( 1 ± ϵ ) (1±ϵ) - approximation (i.e. within 1 ± ϵ 1±ϵ of the true answer) of the number of distinct categories on the given path, with probability 1 − δ 1−δ , where 0 0&amp;lt;ϵ,δ&amp;lt;1 are constants. The data structure occupies O ( n + n t lg ⁡ n ) O(n+ntlg⁡n) words of space, for the query time of O ( t lg ⁡ n ) O(tlg⁡n) . For trees weighted with d - dimensional weight vectors ( d ≥ 1 d≥1 ), we propose a data structure with O ( ( n + n t lg ⁡ n ) lg d ⁡ n ) O((n+ntlg⁡n)lgd⁡n) words of space and O ( t lg d + 1 ⁡ n ) O(tlgd+1⁡n) query time. All these problems generalize the corresponding categorical range counting problems in Euclidean space R d + 1 Rd+1 , for respective d , by replacing one of the dimensions with a tree topology .},

  abstract     = {The online car-sharing problem finds many real-world applications. The problem, proposed by Luo, Erlebach and Xu in 2018, mainly focuses on an online model in which there are two locations: 0 and 1, and k total cars. Each request which specifies its pick-up time and pick-up location (among 0 and 1, and the other is the drop-off location) is released in each stage a fixed amount of time before its specified start (i.e. pick-up) time. The time between the booking (i.e. released) time and the start time is enough to move empty cars between 0 and 1 for relocation if they are not used in that stage. The model, called k S2L-F, assumes that requests in each stage arrive sequentially regardless of the same booking time and the decision (accept or reject) must be made immediately. The goal is to accept as many requests as possible. In spite of only two locations, the analysis does not seem easy and the (tight) competitive ratio (CR) is only known to be 2 for k = 2 k=2 and 1.5 for a restricted value of k , i.e., a multiple of three. In this paper, we remove all the holes of unknown CR&#39;s; namely we prove that the CR is 2 k k + ⌊ k / 3 ⌋ 2kk+⌊k/3⌋ for all k ≥ 2 k≥2 . Furthermore, if the algorithm can delay its decision until all requests have come in each stage, the CR is improved to roughly 4/3. We can take this advantage even further; precisely we can achieve a CR of 2 + R 3 2+R3 if the number of requests in each stage is at most Rk , 1 ≤ R ≤ 2 1≤R≤2 , where we do not have to know the value of R in advance. Finally we demonstrate that randomization also helps to get (slightly) better CR&#39;s, and prove some lower bounds to show the tightness.},

More precisely, a k -ary n -cube is a graph with k n kn vertices associated to the k -ary words of length n . Given a k -ary word f , the k-ary n-cube avoiding f is the subgraph obtained deleting those vertices which contain f as a factor. When such a subgraph is isometric to the cube, for any n ≥ 1 n≥1 , the word f is said isometric . A binary word f is isometric if and only if it is Ham-isometric , i.e., for any pair of f -free binary words u and v , u can be transformed in v by complementing the bits on which they differ and generating only f -free words. The case of a k -ary alphabet, with k ≥ 2 k≥2 , is here investigated. From k ≥ 4 k≥4 , the isometricity in terms of cubes is no longer captured by the Ham-isometricity, but by the Lee-isometricity . Then, Ham-isometric and Lee-isometric k -ary words are characterized in terms of their overlaps with errors. The minimal length of two words which witness the non-isometricity of a word f is called its index . The index of f is bounded in terms of its length and the bounds are shown tight by examples.},

  abstract     = {Traditional online algorithms are designed to make decisions online in the face of uncertainty to perform well compared to the optimal offline algorithm for the worst-case inputs. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms try to extrapolate the pattern from the past inputs to predict the future and take decisions online based on the predictions to perform well for the average-case inputs. Recent studies have augmented traditional online algorithms with machine learning oracles to get better performance for all the possible inputs. The machine learning augmented online algorithms perform provably better than the traditional online algorithms when the error of the machine learning oracle is low for the worst-case inputs and all other average-case inputs. Even when the advice from the machine learning oracle is poor, the machine learning advised algorithms are robust, hence do not degrade abruptly with worst-case inputs. In this article, we integrate the advantages of traditional online algorithms and machine learning algorithms in the context of a novel variant of the ski rental problem. Firstly, we propose the ski rental problem with a discount: in this problem, the rent of the ski, instead of being fixed over time, varies as a function of time. Secondly, we discuss the design and performance evaluation of the online algorithms with machine learning advice to solve the ski rental problem with a discount. Finally, we extend this study to the situation where multiple independent machine learning advice is available. This algorithm design framework motivates redesigning several online algorithms by augmenting them with one or more machine learning oracles to improve their performance.},

We establish an Ω ( m ) lower bound on the competitive ratio of any algorithm for optimizing average flow time in both models without resource augmentation. With resource augmentation, we give a ( 1 + ϵ ) -speed O ( 1 ϵ 2 k + 1 ) -competitive algorithm in the DAG model for the ℓ k -norms of flow time. This essentially matches the best-known result in the speed-up curve model for the ℓ k -norms of flow time. Finally, we show an O ( 1 ) -competitive algorithm for minimizing the maximum flow time in the speed-up curves model.},

A good example is the Online Bin Stretching problem, in which the task is to pack the incoming items online into bins while minimizing the load of the largest bin. Additionally, the optimal load of the entire instance is known in advance. The contribution of this paper is twofold. We use the Coq proof assistant to formalize the Online Bin Stretching problem and provide a program certifying lower bounds of this problem. Because of the size of the certificates, previously claimed lower bounds were never formally proven. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a formal verification toolkit to certify a lower bound for an online problem. We also provide the first non-trivial lower bounds for Online Bin Stretching with 6, 7 and 8 bins, and increase the best known lower bound for 3 bins. We describe in detail the algorithmic improvements which were necessary for the discovery of the new lower bounds, which are several orders of magnitude more complex.},

We say that ℓ is irregular if no two distinct vertices of G are incident to the same sum of labels. The irregularity strength of G , denoted by s ( G ) s(G) , is the smallest k such that irregular k -labellings of G exist. These notions were introduced in the late 1980s as an alternative way to deal with an optimisation problem where one aims at making a graph irregular by multiplying its edges in an optimal way. Since then, the irregularity strength has received a lot of attention, focusing mainly on proving bounds and investigating side aspects and variants. In this work, we consider the algorithmic complexity of determining the irregularity strength of a given graph. We prove that two close variants of this problem are NP -hard, which we suspect might indicate that the original problem is hard too. Namely, we prove that determining the distant irregularity strength, where only vertices within a certain distance are required to be incident to different sums of labels, and the multiset irregularity strength, where any two distinct vertices are required to be incident to different multisets of labels, are NP -hard problems.},

Due to various reasons, some systems lack of formal specifications. Compared with CTL and LTL, Propositional Projection Temporal Logic (PPTL) has a full regular expressive power . Accordingly, a pattern-library-based PPTL specification mining tool PPTLMiner [1] is able to dig out a better expression of system specification. However, there&#39;s still some room for improvement in PPTLMiner, such as deep recursion, high time complexity and space complexity, which limit the use of PPTLMiner in practical applications. Therefore, in this paper, a new PPTL specification mining approach based on Labeled Normal Form Graph (LNFG) is proposed and a supporting tool PPTLMiner+ is also developed. Finally, a specification mining example using PPTLMiner+ is given to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the new approach. In this example, a typical algorithm in Swarm Intelligence-Bee Colony Algorithm is selected as a target program, and the working order of EmployedBees, OnlookerBees and ScoutBees is obtained using PPTLMiner+.

  abstract     = {Self-stabilization is a promising paradigm for designing highly adaptive distributed systems. However, it cannot be realized when the communication between processes is unreliable with some constant probability . To circumvent such impossibility, this paper adopts the concept of loose-stabilization for the first time, which is a practical alternative of self-stabilization, and proposes three systematic approaches to realize loose-stabilization in the atomic-state model with probabilistically erroneous communications , namely, the redundant-state approach, the step-up approach, and the repetition approach. Further, we apply these approaches to design three corresponding loosely-stabilizing algorithms for the maximal independent set problem.},

  abstract     = {A multi-labeled tree (or MUL-tree) is a rooted tree in which every leaf is labeled by an element from some set X X , but in which more than one leaf may be labeled by the same element of X X . MUL-trees have applications in many fields. In phylogenetics, they can represent the evolution of gene families, where genes are represented by the species they belong to, the non-uniqueness of leaf-labels coming from the fact that a given genome may contain many paralogous genes (genes related through duplication). In this paper, we consider two problems related to the leaf-pruning (leaf removal) of MUL-trees leading to single-labeled trees. First, given a set of MUL-trees, the MUL-tree Set Pruning for Consistency ( MULSETPC ) Problem asks for a pruning of each tree leading to a set of consistent trees, i.e. a collection of label-isomorphic single-labeled trees. Second, processing one tree at a time, the MUL-tree Pruning for Reconciliation ( MULPR ) Problem asks for a pruning that minimizes a “reconciliation” cost, i.e. an evolutionary cost of the gene family through duplication, given a known species tree. We show that MULSETPC is NP-hard and that MULPR is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the duplication cost, NP-hard when the number of occurrences of each label in a MUL-tree is bounded by two and that the optimization version of MULPR is hard to approximate within factor ( 1 − o ( 1 ) ) ln ⁡ | X | 1−o(1))ln⁡|X| . We then develop a polynomial-time heuristic for MULPR and show its accuracy by comparing it to a brute-force exact method on a set of gene trees from the Ensembl Genome Browser.},

In particular, a chapter in the monograph of Bang-Jensen and Gutin, Digraphs: Theory, Algorithms and Application, Ed. 2, 2009 is wholly devoted to branchings. The well-known Edmonds Branching Theorem provides a characterization for the existence of k arc-disjoint out-branchings rooted at the same vertex. A short proof of the theorem by Lovász (1976) leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for finding such out-branchings. A natural related problem is to characterize digraphs having an out-branching and an in-branching which are arc-disjoint. Such a pair of branchings is called a good pair. Bang-Jensen, Bessy, Havet and Yeo (2022) pointed out that it is NP-complete to decide if a given digraph has a good pair. They also showed that every digraph of independence number at most 2 and arc-connectivity at least 2 has a good pair, which settled a conjecture of Thomassen for digraphs of independence number 2. Then they asked for the smallest number n n g p nngp of vertices in a 2-arc-strong digraph which has no good pair. They proved that 7 ≤ n n g p ≤ 10 7≤nngp≤10 . In this paper, we prove that n n g p = 10 nngp=10 , which solves the open problem.},

In 1992, Heath and Rosenberg conjectured that every planar graph admits a mixed 1-stack 1-queue layout. In 2017, Pupyrev disproved this conjecture by demonstrating a planar partial 3-tree that does not admit a mixed 1-stack 1-queue layout. In this work, we strengthen Pupyrev&#39;s result by showing that the conjecture does not hold even for 2-trees, also known as series-parallel graphs. We conclude this by means of a stronger result, stating that the conjecture does not hold, even in the more general union and local settings . In the former, crossings (nestings) are allowed in the stack (queue) as long as the involved edges belong to different connected components of the subgraph induced by its edges, while in the latter several stacks and queues may form the layout, but locally every vertex is incident to edges from only one stack and one queue.},

It is known since the 1980s that the problem of deciding whether a given spanning tree of a graph is a BFS-tree or a DFS-tree can be solved in linear time. Here, we will show that swapping the search-tree paradigms between these searches makes the problem hard, i.e., it is NP NP -complete to decide whether a spanning tree of a graph is a first-in-tree of a DFS or a last-in-tree of a BFS. To the best of our knowledge the latter result is the first hardness result for the recognition of last-in-trees for some graph search.

  abstract     = {Owing to the massive growth in the storage demands of big data, cloud storage systems emerge at a historic moment, among which block-based cloud storage systems (BCSSs) are typical. Compared with traditional storage systems, BCSSs have many advantages, such as higher capacity, lower cost, and better scalability. BCSSs are also much more complex and error prone than traditional systems, and therefore, their reliability is a significant concern. Correctness is the most basic requirement for reliability. Therefore, it is of great significance to study BCSS program correctness verification to establish the theoretical basis for cloud storage systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on separation logic (SL) to verify the correctness of BCSS management programs. We first construct a two-tier heap structure as the formal model of the storage architecture for BCSSs and present a modelling language based on this structure to describe the program execution. We then define assertion pairs to describe the properties of the two-tier structure. The two components of an assertion pair affect each other, producing several interesting properties. Finally, we propose a Hoare-style proof system to reason about BCSS programs and establish its soundness. We also demonstrate our proof system&#39;s uniqueness, usability, and scalability by verifying several real-world BCSS sample programs. In summary, this work presents a systematic approach that can be used to effectively solve BCSS program verification problems, and provides an SL-based logical modelling strategy, specifically to build its consistency with the actual behaviour of BCSSs.},

  abstract     = {For a connected graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , a matching M ⊆ E M⊆E is a matching cut of G if G − M G−M is disconnected. It is known that for an integer d , the corresponding decision problem Matching Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter at most d if d ≤ 2 d≤2 and NP -complete if d ≥ 3 d≥3 . We prove the same dichotomy for graphs of bounded radius. For a graph H , a graph is H -free if it does not contain H as an induced subgraph . As a consequence of our result, we can solve Matching Cut in polynomial time for P 6 P6 -free graphs, extending a recent result of Feghali for P 5 P5 -free graphs. We then extend our result to hold even for ( s P 3 + P 6 ) (sP3+P6) -free graphs for every s ≥ 0 s≥0 and initiate a complexity classification of Matching Cut for H -free graphs.},

  abstract     = {In a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) with an edge coloring ℓ : E → C ℓ:E→C and two distinguished vertices s and t , a colored ( s , t ) (s,t) -cut is a set C ˜ ⊆ C C˜⊆C such that deleting all edges with some color c ∈ C ˜ c∈C˜ from G disconnects s and t . Motivated by applications in the design of robust networks, we introduce colored cut games . In these games, an attacker and a defender choose colors to delete and to protect, respectively, in an alternating fashion. The attacker wants to achieve a colored ( s , t ) (s,t) -cut and the defender wants to prevent this. First, we show that for an unbounded number of alternations, colored cut games are PSPACE-complete even on subcubic graphs. We then show that, even on subcubic graphs, colored cut games with i alternations are complete for classes in the polynomial hierarchy whose level depends on i . To complete the dichotomy, we show that all colored cut games are polynomial-time solvable on graphs with maximum degree at most 2. Next, we show that all colored cut games admit a polynomial kernel for the parameter k + κ r k+κr where k denotes the total attacker budget and, for any constant r , κ r κr is the number of vertex deletions that are necessary to transform G into a graph where the longest path has length at most r . For κ 1 κ1 , which is the vertex cover number vc of the input graph, the kernel has size O ( vc 2 k 2 ) O(vc2k2) . Moreover, we introduce an algorithm solving the most basic colored cut game, Colored ( s , t ) (s,t) - Cut , in 2 vc + k n O ( 1 ) 2vc+knO(1) time.},

In this paper we present a theory of minimisation for event structures. Working in a class of event structures that generalises many stable event structure models in the literature (e.g., prime, asymmetric, flow and bundle event structures), we study a notion of behaviour-preserving quotient, referred to as a folding, taking (hereditary) history-preserving bisimilarity as a reference behavioural equivalence. We show that for any event structure a folding producing a uniquely determined minimal quotient always exists. We observe that each event structure can be seen as the folding of a prime event structure, and that all foldings between general event structures arise from foldings of (suitably defined) corresponding prime event structures. This gives a special relevance to foldings in the class of prime event structures, which are studied in detail. We identify folding conditions for prime and asymmetric event structures, and show that also prime event structures always admit a unique minimal quotient (while this is not the case for various other event structure models).},

  abstract     = {Consistent query answering (CQA) is a widely accepted paradigm for querying inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs). A consistent answer to a query is a tuple that is an answer to the query over every repair of the KB, which is in turn a consistent KB whose extensional knowledge “minimally” differs from the original one&#39;s. This coarse-grained classification of answers into consistent and non-consistent ones lacks any information about their degree of consistency, i.e., how likely it is that a tuple is an answer to the query, when considering all the repaired KBs. To overcome this limitation, we consider a fine-grained notion of repair for KBs with equality-generating dependencies (EGDs), based on attribute-level updates, and exploit this notion to propose a probabilistic CQA approach, which associates a confidence to each answer, thereby providing more informative query answers. We first show that computing the query answer confidence is # P -hard #P-hard . Then, in the light of this intractability result, we study the existence of efficient randomized, approximation schemes . In particular, we show that absolute error approximation schemes always exist in the general case, while more refined relative error approximation schemes, i.e., fully polynomial-time, randomized approximation schemes (FPRAS) exist when assuming that the constraints of the knowledge base are primary keys. Finally, we extend our framework to knowledge bases with tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and generalize our approximability results to the new setting, and prove additional inapproximability results.},

  abstract     = {We study the expressive power of the Lara language – a recently proposed unified model for expressing relational and linear algebra operations – both in terms of traditional database query languages and some analytic tasks often performed in machine learning pipelines. Since Lara is parameterized by a set of user-defined functions which allow to transform values in tables, known as extension functions , the exact expressive power of the language depends on how these functions are defined. We start by showing Lara to be expressive complete with respect to a syntactic fragment of relational algebra with aggregation (under the mild assumption that extension functions in Lara can cope with traditional relational algebra operations such as selection and renaming). We then look further into the expressiveness of Lara based on different classes of extension functions, and distinguish two main cases depending on the level of genericity that queries are enforced to satisfy. Under strong genericity assumptions the language cannot express matrix convolution , a very important operation in current machine learning pipelines. This language is also local, and thus cannot express operations such as matrix inverse that exhibit a recursive behavior. For expressing convolution , one can relax the genericity requirement by adding an underlying linear order on the domain. This, however, destroys locality and turns the expressive power of the language much more difficult to understand. In particular, although under complexity assumptions some versions of the resulting language can still not express matrix inverse , a proof of this fact without such assumptions seems challenging to obtain.},

In this paper, we consider the model of quantum Markov chain (QMC), in which transitions are weighted by super-operators to characterize quantum operations and the initial quantum state is left parametric . A quantum analogy of probabilistic computation tree logic, called QCTL, is introduced to take into account fidelity, instead of probability measure, over QMC. The key to the model checking problem lies in computing the fidelity of the super-operator valued measure specified by a path formula in QCTL. It is minimized over all initial quantum states , which is intended for analyzing the system performance in the worst case. We achieve it by a reduction to quantifier elimination in the existential theory of the reals. The method is absolutely exact, so that model checking QCTL formulas against QMCs is proved to be decidable in exponential time .},

Despite this undecidability result, a lot of effort has been spent on improving algorithms that prove termination of loops, which is one of the fundamental aspects of software reliability analysis. These algorithms usually focus on finding an appropriate ranking function for the loop, which proves its termination. In this paper, we focus on handling the synthesis problem of nested ranking functions and multi-phase ranking functions for loop programs. We first reduce the problem of a nested ranking function synthesis to the existence problem of a hyperplane separating classes of data. This allows us to leverage Support-Vector Machines (SVM) techniques for the synthesis of nested ranking functions. SVM are supervised learning algorithms that are used to classify data; they work by finding a hyperplane separating data points parted into two classes. We show how to carefully define the data points so that the separating hyperplane gives rise to a nested ranking function for the loop. Then we use this algorithm for nested ranking functions synthesis as a subprocedure to devise a sound algorithm which incrementally synthesizes multi-phase ranking functions. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our SVM-based synthesis of nested and multi-phase ranking functions.},

The problem was proven NP -hard [3] and was found to admit a quadratic kernel when parameterized by the size of the desired solution [8] . Following recent trends, for the first time, we study Tracking Paths with respect to structural parameters of the input graph, parameters that measure how far the input graph is, from an easy instance. We prove that Tracking Paths admits fixed-parameter tractable ( FPT ) algorithms when parameterized by the following parameters: ( i ) size of a 2-dominating set, ( ii ) size of cluster vertex deletion set, and ( iii ) size of split deletion set. En route we also look at Vertex Cover parameterized by the size of edge clique cover and show it fixed-parameter tractable.},

If we only care about the status of a particular vertex, instead of doing global diagnosis, Hsu and Tan introduced the concept of local diagnosis and proposed two structures to diagnose a vertex. The local diagnosability of a vertex is upper bounded by its degree in the system. If the local diagnosability of a vertex is equal to its degree then we say it is locally optimal diagnosable. Usually, there is a gap between the local diagnosability and the lower bound guaranteed by the two structures mentioned above. Herein, we propose a new testing structure and corresponding diagnosis algorithm to diagnose a vertex under PMC model to better evaluate the local diagnosability. And this diagnosis algorithm takes linear time. Based on this new structure, we give a sufficient condition for a vertex to be locally optimal diagnosable. As its applications, we consider the sufficient and necessary condition for a vertex of hypercubes (resp. folded hypercubes) with faulty edges to be locally optimal diagnosable.},

  abstract     = {A digraph D is singly connected if for all ordered pairs of vertices u , v ∈ V ( D ) u,v∈V(D) , there is at most one path in D from u to v . In this paper, we study the Singly Connected Vertex Deletion (SCVD) problem: Given an n -vertex digraph D and a positive integer k , does there exist a set S ⊆ V ( D ) S⊆V(D) such that | S | ≤ k |S|≤k and D − S D−S is singly connected? This problem may be seen as a directed counterpart of the (Undirected) Feedback Vertex Set problem, as an undirected graph is singly connected if and only if it is acyclic. SCVD is known to be NP -hard on general digraphs. We study the complexity of SCVD on various classes of digraphs such as tournaments, and various generalisations of tournaments such as digraphs of bounded independence number, in- and out-tournaments and local tournaments. We show that unlike the Feedback Vertex Set on Tournaments (FVST) problem, SCVD is polynomial-time solvable on tournaments. In addition, we show that SCVD is polynomial-time solvable on digraphs of bounded independence number, and on the class of acyclic local tournaments. We also study the parameterized complexity of SCVD, with k as the parameter, on the class of in-tournaments. And we show that on in-tournaments, SCVD admits a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm and a quadratic vertex kernel. We also show that on the class of local tournaments, which is a sub-class of in-tournaments, SCVD admits a linear vertex kernel.},

In the concept, the quality is measured by a real-valued function that can be chosen from a certain class of functions. The concept is applied to a multi-robot pattern formation problem in which a group of autonomous mobile robots move from their respective initial positions to the goal positions like a marching band. We solve the problem by presenting two monotonic self-stabilizing pattern formation algorithms, one of which is for FSYNC model and the other is for SSYNC model. The considered real-valued functions to measure the quality take into account both the distance to the goal location and the accuracy of the formation.

We also construct a FPAUS and FPRAS for standard set-valued tableaux when either the size of the partition or the difference between the maximum value and the size of the partition is fixed.

  abstract     = {Multi-signature is an important technology to compress multiple signatures on the common message into a compact one, thereby reducing the consumption of storage space and transmission bandwidth . Such a cryptographic primitive is widely used in financial applications such as blockchain which requires multiple keys to authorize a transaction. With the advent of quantum computers , traditional multi-signature schemes may no longer be secure as their underlying security assumptions (e.g. RSA or discrete logarithm problems) may not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a novel identity-based multi-signature (IBMS) scheme over NTRU lattices , which is secure against the attacks of quantum computers . To the best of our knowledge, it is the first lattice-based IBMS scheme. We show that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model based on the ring version of the short integer solution assumption (Ring-SIS). Compared with the closely related works in the literature, our scheme enables the signer to select its system identity (such as email address, physical IP address, and etc.) as the public key , which effectively alleviates the certificate management problem in the PKI setting, and takes the advantage of discrete Gaussian distribution instead of uniform distribution to generate secret signing keys and multi-signatures. Besides, our scheme does not require all the system users to setup a trusted common string, which further simplifies the deployment of our scheme in practice.},

Enright and Meeks (Algorithmica, 2018) gave an algorithm to solve F F -Free Edge Deletion whose running time on an n -vertex graph G of treewidth tw ( G ) tw(G) is bounded by 2 O ( | F | tw ( G ) r ) n 2O(|F|tw(G)r)n , if every graph in F F has at most r vertices. We complement this result by showing that F F -Free Edge Deletion is W[1]-hard when parameterized by tw ( G ) + | F | tw(G)+|F| . We also show that F F -Free Edge Deletion is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the combined parameters solution size, the feedback vertex set number and pathwidth of the input graph. A special case of particular interest is the situation in which F F is the set T h + 1 Th+1 of all trees on h + 1 h+1 vertices, so that we delete edges in order to obtain a graph in which every component contains at most h vertices. This is desirable from the point of view of restricting the spread of a disease in transmission networks [5] . We prove that T h + 1 Th+1 -Free Edge Deletion is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the vertex cover number of the input graph. We also prove that it admits a kernel with 2 k h 2kh vertices and 2 k h 2 + k 2kh2+k edges, when parameterized by k + h k+h .},

At each time step t ∈ [ 1 , τ ] t∈[1,τ] , for every entity e ∈ E e∈E , there is a restriction list L t ( e ) Lt(e) that prescribes the subset of players to whom e can be assigned and a non-negative value v t ( e , p ) vt(e,p) of e to every player p ∈ P p∈P . The sets P and E are fixed beforehand. The sets L t ( ⋅ ) Lt(⋅) and values v t ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) vt(⋅,⋅) are given in an online fashion. An allocation is a distribution of E among P , and we are interested in the minimum total value of the entities received by a player according to the allocation. In the static case, it is NP-hard to find an optimal allocation the maximizes this minimum value. On the other hand, ρ -approximation algorithms have been developed for certain values of ρ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] ρ∈(0,1] . We propose a w -lookahead algorithm for the multistage online maxmin allocation problem for any fixed w ⩾ 1 w⩾1 in which the restriction lists and values of entities may change between time steps, and there is a fixed stability reward for an entity to be assigned to the same player from one time step to the next. The objective is to maximize the sum of the minimum values and stability rewards over the time steps 1 , 2 , … , τ 1,2,…,τ . Our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of ( 1 − c ) ρ (1−c)ρ , where c is the positive root of the equation w c 2 = ρ ( w + 1 ) ( 1 − c ) wc2=ρ(w+1)(1−c) .

In the last few decades a myriad of alternative solutions have been proposed, based on very different techniques. However, automata have always played a very important role in the design of efficient string matching algorithms . In this paper we present the Range Automaton , a weak yet efficient variant of the non-deterministic suffix automaton of a string whose configuration can be encoded in a very simple form and which is particularly suitable to be used for solving a multitude of text-searching problems. We will firstly develop our approach in the case of exact string matching and present an efficient algorithm, named Backward Range Automaton Matcher, which turns out to be very fast in many practical cases. Later, we will show how the Range Automaton can be adapted in an effective way also to non-standard string matching problems such as swap matching and multiple string matching . Experimental results suggest that our approach is flexible and effective for all three search problems addressed, especially in the case of long patterns.},

Words which are not Hamming-isometric have been characterized as words having a border with two mismatches. We derive from this characterization a linear-time algorithm to check whether a word is Hamming-isometric. It is based on pattern matching algorithms with k mismatches. Lee-isometric words over a four-letter alphabet have been characterized as words having a border with two Lee-errors. We derive from this characterization a linear-time algorithm to check whether a word over an alphabet of size four is Lee-isometric.},

  abstract     = {Two strings x and y over Σ ∪ Π Σ∪Π of equal length are said to parameterized match ( p-match ) if there is a renaming bijection f : Σ ∪ Π → Σ ∪ Π f:Σ∪Π→Σ∪Π that is identity on Σ and transforms x to y (or vice versa). The p-matching problem is to look for substrings in a text that p-match a given pattern. In this paper, we propose parameterized suffix automata ( p-suffix automata ) and parameterized directed acyclic word graphs ( PDAWGs ) which are the p-matching versions of suffix automata and DAWGs. While suffix automata and DAWGs are equivalent for standard strings, we show that p-suffix automata can have Θ ( n 2 ) Θ(n2) nodes and edges but PDAWGs have only O ( n ) O(n) nodes and edges, where n is the length of an input string. We also give an O ( n | Π | log ⁡ ( | Π | + | Σ | ) ) O(n|Π|log⁡(|Π|+|Σ|)) -time O ( n ) O(n) -space algorithm that builds the PDAWG in a left-to-right online manner. As a byproduct, it is shown that the parameterized suffix tree for the reversed string can also be built in the same time and space, in a right-to-left online manner. This duality also leads us to two further efficient algorithms for p-matching: Given the parameterized suffix tree for the reversal T ‾ T‾ of the input string T , one can build the PDAWG of T in O ( n ) O(n) time in an offline manner; One can perform bidirectional p-matching in O ( m log ⁡ ( | Π | + | Σ | ) + occ ) O(mlog⁡(|Π|+|Σ|)+occ) time using O ( n ) O(n) space, where m denotes the pattern length and occ is the number of pattern occurrences in the text T .},

  abstract     = {The tiling systems define the family of recognizable picture languages as the projection of local picture languages, i.e., strictly-locally-testable (SLT) languages of order 2. A basic measure of the descriptive complexity of a picture language is given by the so-called alphabetic ratio, i.e., the size of the local alphabet divided by the size of the picture alphabet. The family of recognizable picture languages does not change when defined by the projection of SLT languages of order k &gt; 2 k&amp;gt;2 , which use k by k tiles. In such a case, the natural question is how the alphabetic ratio changes We obtain the following main result: any recognizable picture language over an alphabet of size n is the projection of an SLT language over an alphabet of size 2 n . Moreover, two is the minimal alphabetic ratio possible in general. The proof relies on a new family of comma-free picture, i.e., 2D, codes, for which a lower bound on numerosity is established; and on the relation between languages of encoded pictures and SLT languages. Our result reproduces in two dimensions a similar property (known as Extended Medvedev&#39;s theorem) of the regular word languages, concerning the minimal alphabetic ratio needed to define a language by means of a projection of an SLT word language.},

Each message is initially placed on a source vertex of G and needs to be delivered to a target vertex of G . Each agent can move along the edges of G and carry at most one message at any time. Each agent has a rate of energy consumption per unit of traveled distance and the goal is that of delivering all messages using the minimum overall amount of energy. This problem has been shown to be NP-hard even when k = 1 k=1 , and is 4 ρ -approximable where ρ is the ratio between the maximum and minimum energy consumption of the agents. In this paper, we provide approximation algorithms with approximation ratios independent of the energy consumption rates. First, we design a polynomial-time 8-approximation algorithm for k = O ( log ⁡ n ) k=O(log⁡n) , closing a problem left open in [Bärtschi et al., ATMOS&#39;17]. This algorithm can be turned into an O ( k ) O(k) -approximation algorithm that always runs in polynomial-time, regardless of the values of k . Then, we show that HWD problem is 36-approximable in polynomial-time when each agent has one of two possible consumption rates. Finally, we design a polynomial-time O ˜ ( log 3 ⁡ n ) O˜(log3⁡n) -approximation algorithm for the general case.},

  abstract     = {A vertex coloring of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is called an exact square coloring of G if any two vertices at distance exactly 2 receive different colors. The minimum number of colors required by an exact square coloring is called the exact square chromatic number of G and is denoted by χ [ # 2 ] ( G ) χ[#2](G) . Given a graph G and a positive integer k , the Exact Square Coloring Problem is to decide whether G admits an exact square coloring using k colors. It is known that Exact Square Coloring Problem is NP-complete for chordal graphs . In this paper, we strengthen this result by proving that this problem remains NP-complete for undirected path graphs, which is a proper subclass of chordal graphs . However, we give linear time algorithms for computing the exact square chromatic number of proper interval graphs and threshold graphs, which are proper subclasses of chordal graphs. Moreover, for a proper interval graph G , we show that χ [ # 2 ] ( G ) ≤ 3 χ[#2](G)≤3 . We also propose a polynomial time algorithm to produce an exact square coloring of a block graph G using at most χ [ # 2 ] ( G ) + 1 χ[#2](G)+1 colors. Next, we study a lower bound of χ [ # 2 ] ( G ) χ[#2](G) . A subset S of vertices of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is called an exact square clique of G if the distance between any two vertices in S is exactly 2. The cardinality of the maximum exact square clique of G is called the exact square clique number of G and is denoted by ω [ # 2 ] ( G ) ω[#2](G) . Clearly, ω [ # 2 ] ( G ) ≤ χ [ # 2 ] ( G ) ω[#2](G)≤χ[#2](G) . Given a graph G and a positive integer k , the problem of deciding whether ω [ # 2 ] ( G ) ω[#2](G) is at least k , is known to be NP-complete for bipartite graphs and chordal graphs. In this paper, we strengthen these results by proving that this problem remains NP-complete for undirected path graphs, perfect elimination bipartite graphs , star-convex bipartite graphs and comb-convex bipartite graphs. We also compute the exact value of ω [ # 2 ] ( G ) ω[#2](G) for proper interval graphs , threshold graphs, block graphs and convex bipartite graphs.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the dual-role-facility location game with generalized service costs, in which every agent plays a dual role of facility and customer, and is associated with a facility opening cost as his private information. The agents strategically report their opening costs to a mechanism which maps the reports to a set of selected agents and payments to them. Each selected agent opens his facility, incurs his opening cost and receives the payment the mechanism sets for him. Each unselected agent incurs a services cost that is determined by the set of selected agents in a very general way. The mechanism is truthful if under it no agent has an incentive to misreport. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for mechanisms of the game to be truthful. This characterization particularly requires an invariant service cost for each unselected agent, which is a remarkable difference from related work in literature. As applications of this truthfulness characterization, we focus on the classic metric-space setting, in which agents&#39; service costs equal their distances to closest open facilities. We present truthful mechanisms that minimize or approximately minimize the maximum cost among all agents and the total cost of all agents, respectively. Moreover, when the total payment cannot exceed a given budget, we prove, for both cost-minimization objectives, lower and upper bounds on approximation ratios of truthful mechanisms that satisfy the budget constraint.},

One of these measures is the energy complexity , which is related to the number of gates that output true in a circuit for an assignment. The idea behind energy complexity comes from the counting of ‘firing’ neurons in a natural neural network . The initial model is based on threshold circuits, but recent works also have analyzed the energy complexity of traditional Boolean circuits . In this work, we discuss the time complexity needed to compute the best-case energy complexity among satisfying assignments of a monotone Boolean circuit, and we call such a problem as MinEC M + M+ . In the MinEC M + M+ problem, we are given a monotone Boolean circuit C , a positive integer k and asked to determine whether there is a satisfying assignment X for C such that E C ( C , X ) ≤ k EC(C,X)≤k , where E C ( C , X ) EC(C,X) is the number of gates that output true in C according to the assignment X . We prove that MinEC M + M+ is NP-complete even when the input monotone circuit is planar. Besides, we show that the problem is W[1]-hard but in XP when parameterized by the size of the solution. In contrast, we show that when the size of the solution and the genus of the input circuit are aggregated parameters, the MinEC M + M+ problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable.},

The k-burning number of G is the minimum number of steps b k ( G ) bk(G) such that all the vertices can be burned within b k ( G ) bk(G) steps. Note that the last step may have smaller than k unburnt vertices available, where all of them are burned. The 1-burning number coincides with the well-known burning number problem, which was proposed to model the spread of social contagion. The generalization to k -burning number allows us to examine different worst-case contagion scenarios by varying the spread factor k . In this paper we prove that computing k -burning number is APX-hard, for any fixed constant k . We then give an O ( ( n + m ) log ⁡ n ) O((n+m)log⁡n) -time 3-approximation algorithm for computing k -burning number, for any k ≥ 1 k≥1 , where n and m are the number of vertices and edges, respectively.

  abstract     = {The inefficiency of polynomial-time ( PTIME ) algorithms in the context of big data indicates a departure from the traditional view on tractability. In recent years, sublinear-time algorithms have been regarded as the new standard for tractability of big data computing problems. Based on the prior work on sublinear-time complexity classes [1] , this paper focuses on designing appropriate reductions specialized for big data computing problems. In particular, a series of pseudo-sublinear-time reductions are proposed, and their properties are systematically investigated. It is proved that PsT is properly contained in P , and any PsT -complete problem and PsPL i PsPLi -complete problem that is not P -complete must be a witness in P ∖ NC P∖NC . Several examples are also given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed reductions. Then, to cope with problems that are intractable in sublinear time even after a PTIME preprocessing, the L -reduction is extended to pseudo-sublinear time. Finally, it is proved that there is no PPL -complete problem under DLOGTIME reduction.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical system (CPS) integrates cyber systems and the corporal world to perform critical processes that are begun from the developments in digital electronics. The sensor placed in CPS is used to monitor and control processes that are vulnerable to anomalies (reliability failures and cyber-attacks). For the detection of anomalies and prevention of destructive issues, Abnormality Detection System (ADS) is introduced. But ADS suffered from a false alarm rate and missed detection rate, which has resulted in the degraded performance in CPS applications. A novel deep learning approach for detecting Anomalous Behavior in sensor-based CPS is presented in this study. Preprocessing is used in the conceptual scheme to remove noisy data. CPS irregularity is then detected using a DL-based deep belief network (DBN) framework. Furthermore, the number of hidden layers, number of iterations, period frequency, and learning rate of DBN are all tuned using a squirrel search algorithm (SSA). Several tests were conducted with the help of data from device CPS to validate the performance of the SSA-DBN model. To assure the SSA-DBN framework&#39;s appropriate detection accuracy, a complete comparable study is conducted, and the produced extensive experiments confirmed the framework&#39;s outstanding quality on the applicable information over the comparable approaches.},

  abstract     = {A linear layout of a graph typically consists of a total vertex order, and a partition of the edges into sets either of non-crossing edges, called stacks , or of non-nested edges, called queues . The stack ( queue ) number of a graph is the minimum number of required stacks (queues) in any linear layout of it. Mixed linear layouts combine these layouts by allowing each set of edges to form either a stack or a queue. In this work we initiate the study of the mixed page number of a graph, which corresponds to the minimum number of such sets. First, we study the edge density of graphs with bounded mixed page number. Then, we focus on complete and complete bipartite graphs , for which we derive lower and upper bounds on their mixed page number. Our findings indicate that combining stacks and queues is more powerful in various ways compared to the two traditional layout models.},

To overcome the issues, this paper proposes an Intelligent Multi-Agent design that utilizes Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) to extricate more pertinent site pages with high coverage rate and less slithering time. Three intelligent agents, specifically, Trajectory pattern mining agent, Query clustering agent and Web page classification agent are employed to track the relevancy of the pages, hidden web links and classify the searchable and non-searchable forms respectively. The extrication of relevant pages is optimized by the DEA algorithm. DEA calculation like selection, crossover and mutation are utilized for optimizing the extraction process. In any case, in Genetic Algorithm (GA) determination of chromosome depends on the wellness esteem, where the low quality chromosomes don&#39;t get by in the future. The Differential Evolutionary activity help the helpless chromosome to get by in the opposition and it will create the upgraded results.

This drastic change has invariably kept the users connected to the Internet uninterruptedly. The adversaries might exploit this “always-on” Internet connection and would jeopardize the network infrastructure through malicious activities using the networks&#39; hardware and software vulnerabilities. However, the network traffic volume poses difficulties for the cyber analyst to monitor, detect, identify, and quickly respond to the network attacks. Therefore it is paramount to protect the integrity, availability, confidentiality of the network infrastructure, and its digital assets by deploying Intrusion Detection Systems . However, augmenting new techniques avoids overwhelming the analysts from a myriad of events. This research aims to analyze the traffic for the significant features that assist in reliable intrusion detection and minimize the resource requirements and computational complexity of the detection process. The proposed method uses Recursive Feature Elimination technique to rank features based on feature importance and Random Forest algorithm performs the attack classification. The experimental findings show these significant 21 features are useful in anomaly detection with an accuracy of 99.83\% for binary attack detection, 99.69\% for multiclass classification with an execution time of 20 seconds, and 39 seconds respectively on the NSL-KDD dataset.},

This problem includes some previously studied problems as special cases, such as the submodular+supermodular maximization problem when γ =1, and the γ -weakly submodular function maximization problem when the supermodular function is void.

The tree is embedded in an unknown space and we have access to an oracle that, when queried on a pair of vertices u and v , reports the weight of the shortcut ( u , v ) (u,v) in constant time. Previously, the problem was solved in O ( n 2 log 3 ⁡ n ) O(n2log3⁡n) time for general weights [Oh and Ahn, ISAAC 2016], in O ( n 2 log ⁡ n ) O(n2log⁡n) time for trees embedded in a metric space [Große et al. , Int.

  abstract     = {In this paper we study stable multicommodity flows, stable hypergraph matchings and some related problems, like the Hospital-Resident-Couple ( hrc ) problem. We give a simpler proof of the existence of a stable multicommodity flow by reducing it to scarf . We show that finding a stable fractional solution of a hrc or a 3-dimensional stable matching (stable family) instance is PPAD-complete. Then we derive from these results that the Fractional hypergraph matching problem is PPAD-complete even if all hyperedge sizes and vertex degrees are at most 3. Furthermore, we prove that computing stable multicommodity flows is PPAD-complete even if the number of commodities is 3, the sum of in and out degrees is at most 3 at each vertex and all terminals and sources are the same. We also show that deciding if there exists a stable integer multicommodity flow is NP-complete even with only two commodities and similar restrictions.},

We show that this and many other problems are a particular case of the Activation Edge-Cover problem. Here we are given a multigraph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , a set R ⊆ V R⊆V of terminals, and thresholds { t u e , t v e } {tue,tve} for each uv -edge e ∈ E e∈E . The goal is to find an assignment a = { a v : v ∈ V } a={av:v∈V} to the nodes minimizing ∑ v ∈ V a v ∑v∈Vav , such that the edge set E a = { e = u v : a u ≥ t u e , a v ≥ t v e } Ea={e=uv:au≥tue,av≥tve} activated by a covers R .

  abstract     = {We study various discrete nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems in an online learning framework. In the first part, we address the computational complexity of designing vanishing regret (and vanishing approximate regret) algorithms. We provide a general reduction showing that many (min-max) polynomial time solvable problems not only do not have a vanishing regret, but also no vanishing approximation α -regret, for some α , unless N P = R P NP=RP . In particular, for the min-max version of the vertex cover problem, which is solvable in polynomial time in the offline case, our reduction implies that there is no ( 2 − ϵ ) (2−ϵ) -regret online randomized algorithm unless Unique Game is in RP . Besides, we prove that the bound is tight by providing an online efficient algorithm based on the online gradient descent method . In the second part, we turn our attention to online learning algorithms that are based on an offline optimization oracle that, given a set of multiple instances of the problem, is able to compute the optimum static solution that performs best on the set of instances overall. We show that for several min-max (nonlinear) discrete optimization problems , it is strongly NP -hard to solve the offline optimization oracle, even for problems that can be solved in polynomial time in the single-instance static case (e.g. min-max vertex cover, min-max perfect matching , etc.). This also provides a useful insight into the connection between the non-linear nature of some problems and the drastic change of their computational hardness when moved to an online learning setting.},

In the finite case, the constructible graphs are precisely the cop-win graphs, but for infinite graphs the situation is not well understood. One of our aims in this paper is to give a graph that is cop-win but not constructible. This is the first known such example. We also show that every countable ordinal arises as the rank of some constructible graph, answering a question of Evron, Solomon and Stahl. In addition, we give a finite constructible graph for which there is no construction order whose associated domination map is a homomorphism , answering a question of Chastand, Laviolette and Polat. Lehner showed that every constructible graph is a weak cop win (meaning that the cop can eventually force the robber out of any finite set). Our other main aim is to investigate how this notion relates to the notion of ‘locally constructible’ (every finite graph is contained in a finite constructible subgraph). We show that, under mild extra conditions, every locally constructible graph is a weak cop win. But we also give an example to show that, in general, a locally constructible graph need not be a weak cop win. Surprisingly, this graph may even be chosen to be locally finite. We also give some open problems.},

  abstract     = {A dominating set of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is a subset of vertices S ⊆ V S⊆V such that every vertex v ∈ V ∖ S v∈V∖S has at least one neighbor in S . Finding a dominating set with the minimum cardinality in a connected graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is known to be NP-hard. A polynomial-time approximation algorithm for this problem, described here, works in two stages. At the first stage a dominant set is generated by a greedy algorithm , and at the second stage this dominating set is purified (reduced). The reduction is achieved by the analysis of the flowchart of the algorithm of the first stage and a special kind of clustering of the dominating set generated at the first stage. The clustering of the dominating set naturally leads to a special kind of a spanning forest of graph G , which serves as a basis for the second purification stage. We expose some types of graphs for which the algorithm of the first stage already delivers an optimal solution and derive sufficient conditions when the overall algorithm constructs an optimal solution. We give three alternative approximation ratios for the algorithm of the first stage, two of which are expressed in terms of solely invariant problem instance parameters, and we also give one additional approximation ratio for the overall two-stage algorithm. The greedy algorithm of the first stage turned out to be essentially the same as the earlier known state-of-the-art algorithms for the set cover and dominating set problem Chvátal [6] and Parekh [31] . The second purification stage results in a significant reduction of the dominant set created at the first stage, in practice. The practical behavior of both stages was verified for randomly generated problem instances. The computational experiments emphasize the gap between a solution of Stage 1 and a solution of Stage 2.},

  abstract     = {Hub labeling schemes are popular methods for computing distances on road networks and other large complex networks, often answering to a query within a few microseconds for graphs with millions of edges. In this work, we study their algorithmic applications beyond distance queries. Indeed, several implementations of hub labels were reported to have good practical performances, both in terms of pre-processing time and maximum label size. There are also a few relevant graph classes for applications for which we know how to compute hub labelings with sublinear labels in quasi linear time. These positive results raise the question of what can be computed efficiently given a graph and a hub labeling of small maximum label size as input. We focus on eccentricity queries and distance-sum queries , for several versions of these problems on directed weighted graphs , that is in part motivated by their importance in facility location problems. On the negative side, we show conditional lower bounds for these above problems on unweighted undirected sparse graphs , via standard constructions from “Fine-grained” complexity. Specifically, under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), answering to these above queries requires Ω ( | V | 2 − o ( 1 ) ) Ω(|V|2−o(1)) pre-processing time or Ω ( | V | 1 − o ( 1 ) ) Ω(|V|1−o(1)) query time, even if we are given as input a hub labeling of maximum label size in ω ( log ⁡ | V | ) ω(log⁡|V|) . However, things take a different turn when the hub labels have a sublogarithmic size. Indeed, for every ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 there exists a δ ε &gt; 0 δε&amp;gt;0 such that the following hold, being given a hub labeling of maximum label size ≤ k : after pre-processing the labels in total O ( 2 δ ε ⋅ k ⋅ | V | 1 + ε ) O(2δε⋅k⋅|V|1+ε) time, we can compute both the eccentricity and the distance-sum of any vertex in O ( 2 δ ε ⋅ k ⋅ | V | ε ) O(2δε⋅k⋅|V|ε) time. Our data structure is a novel application of the orthogonal range query framework of Cabello and Knauer (2009) [17] . It can also be applied to the fast global computation of some topological indices . Finally, as a by-product of our approach, on any fixed class of unweighted graphs with bounded expansion , we can decide whether the diameter of an n -vertex graph in the class is at most k in f ε ( k ) ⋅ n 1 + ε fε(k)⋅n1+ε time for any ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 , for some “explicit” function f ε fε that depends on ε and the graph class considered. This result is further motivated by the empirical evidence that many classes of complex networks have bounded expansion (Demaine et al., 2019 [24] ), and that some of these networks, such as the online social networks , have a relatively small diameter.},

  abstract     = {Huffman coding is known to be optimal under certain constraints, yet its dynamic version, which constantly alters the Huffman tree as a function of the already processed characters, may be even more efficient in practice. A new forward looking variant of Huffman compression has been proposed recently, that provably always performs better than static Huffman coding by at least m − 1 m−1 bits, where m denotes the size of the alphabet, and has a better worst case size than the standard dynamic Huffman coding. This paper introduces a new generic coding method, extending the known static and dynamic variants and including them as special cases. In fact, the generalization is applicable to all statistical methods, including arithmetic coding . This leads then to the formalization of a new double-pass coding method that is adaptive in the sense that it uses changing statistics depending on the current position within the processed file, yet it behaves like static coding, as it assumes the knowledge of the distribution in the entire file; this is contrary to online variants that rely only on the text seen so far and adapt the model dynamically. We call the new method positional coding, and its compression performance , using global statistics , is provably always at least as good as that of the best dynamic variants known to date. Moreover, we present empirical results that show improvements by positional coding and its extensions over static and dynamic Huffman and arithmetic coding , even when the encoded file includes the model description.},

  abstract     = {WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) have attracted interest because of ease of maintenance, scalability, and self-configurations. WSNs encompass many tiny SNs (sensor nodes) or sensors that are capable of participating in IoTs (Internet of Things). WSNs are used to monitor and record environmental conditions or changes. The evolution of DLTs (Deep learning techniques) and next-generation communication networks have addressed sustainable developments in multiple domains including healthcare, agriculture, and transportation. Development of WSNs face challenges in sensor designs, communication latencies , and security. SNs have limitations in data storages, processing powers, energy managements, transmissions and security. Data is vulnerable when SNs are compromised. This work proposes SEAMHR (Secure Energy-Aware Meta-Heuristic Routing) protocol for WSNs with the aim to improve security and network performance. The proposed protocol initially uses Meta-Heuristic analysis based on MEHO (Mutation Elephant Herding Optimization) to achieve a trustworthy and intelligent learning. The protocol uses hop counts, link integrity parameters, and aggregated residual energy to learn the routing decisions. Counter Mode Cryptography method is also used by the protocol using AEs (Auto encoders) called CTR-AEDL for securing data with encryptions and authenticates inter-routing to increase the algorithm&#39;s security. Improved and secure data transmissions are achieved by CTR-AEDL which generates keys using five essential components: secret keys, counter bits, data packets, classifier&#39;s weights and biases. The encryption method generates four-factor unique patterns for counter blocks, and cipher texts are generated by softmax operations between data packets and counter blocks. The actual data packets are obtained using decryptions with the same key. In addition, traffic explorations reduce link failures and network disconnections as part of route maintenance strategies. When compared to previous methods, the suggested SEAMHR protocol improves energy consumptions, network throughputs, PDRs (packet drop ratios), network/computational overhead, and identification of faulty routes in low-powered SNs which is compared with Secure and Energy-Aware Heuristic based Routing (SEHR), Sec Trust-RPL and Heuristic-Based Energy-Efficient Routing (HBEER).},

  abstract     = {For a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , a subset D of vertex set V , is a dominating set of G if every vertex not in D is adjacent to at least one vertex of D . A dominating set D of a graph G with no isolated vertices is called a paired dominating set (PD-set) , if the subgraph induced by D in G has a perfect matching . The Min-PD problem requires to compute a PD-set of minimum cardinality. The decision version of the Min-PD problem is NP-complete even when G belongs to restricted graph classes such as bipartite graphs , chordal graphs etc. On the other side, the problem is efficiently solvable for many graph classes including interval graphs , strongly chordal graphs , permutation graphs etc. In this paper, we study the complexity of the problem in AT-free graphs and planar graphs . The class of AT-free graphs contains cocomparability graphs, permutation graphs, trapezoid graphs, and interval graphs as subclasses . We propose a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a minimum PD-set in AT-free graphs. In addition, we also present a linear-time 2-approximation algorithm for the problem in AT-free graphs. Further, we prove that the decision version of the problem is NP-complete for planar graphs , which answers an open question asked by Lin et al. (2015) [19] and (2020) [20] . Alvarado et al. (2015) [1] conjectured that given a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , it is NP-hard to decide whether γ ( G ) = γ p r ( G ) γ(G)=γpr(G) . In this paper we settle this conjecture affirmatively.},

  abstract     = {A natural way of increasing our understanding of NP -complete graph problems is to restrict the input to a special graph class. Classes of H -free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain some graph H as an induced subgraph , have proven to be an ideal testbed for such a complexity study. However, if the forbidden graph H contains a cycle or claw, then these problems often stay NP -complete. A recent complexity study (MFCS 2019) on the k -Colouring problem shows that we may still obtain tractable results if we also bound the diameter of the H -free input graph. We continue this line of research by initiating a complexity study on the impact of bounding the diameter for a variety of classical vertex partitioning problems restricted to H -free graphs. We prove that bounding the diameter does not help for Independent Set , but leads to new tractable cases for problems closely related to 3 -Colouring . That is, we show that Near-Bipartiteness , Independent Feedback Vertex Set , Independent Odd Cycle Transversal , Acyclic 3 -Colouring and Star 3 -Colouring are all polynomial-time solvable for chair-free graphs of bounded diameter. To obtain these results we exploit a new structural property of 3-colourable chair-free graphs.},

The goal is to either maximize, or minimize the sum of the weights of the edges whose both endpoints are in the same subset. In this paper, we define the p Max - m DWM and p Min - m DWM problems, respectively, by considering the vertices of the graph as points in an arbitrary Euclidean space and defining the edge weights using the ℓ p ℓp -norm. We present NP-hardness proofs of the maximization problem for m ≥ 3 m≥3 and p ≥ 2 p≥2 , and of the minimization problem for m ≥ 3 m≥3 and p ≥ 1 p≥1 .

We characterize a necessary and sufficient condition when the equality holds for the case where X is a shift of finite type. Additionally, two novel phenomena have been revealed for tree-shifts. There is a gap in the set of topological entropy of hom tree-shifts of finite type, making such a set not dense. Last but not least, the topological entropy of a reducible hom tree-shift of finite type can be strictly larger than that of its maximal irreducible component.},

More specifically, we can compute a vertex subset in G with conductance O ( ϕ G ) O(ϕG) , where ϕ G ϕG is the minimum conductance of G . It has recently been shown that Cheeger&#39;s inequality can be extended to hypergraphs . However, as the normalized Laplacian of a hypergraph is no longer a matrix, we can only approximate its eigenvectors; this causes a loss in the conductance of the obtained subset. To address this problem, we here consider the heat equation on hypergraphs , which is a differential equation exploiting the normalized Laplacian. We show that the heat equation has a unique global solution and that we can extract a subset with conductance ϕ G ϕG from the solution under a mild condition. An analogous result also holds for directed graphs .},

  abstract     = {Consider a group of autonomous mobile computational entities, called agents, arbitrarily placed at some nodes of a dynamic but always connected ring. The agents neither have any knowledge about the size of the ring nor have a common notion of orientation. We consider the Exploration problem where the agents have to collaboratively explore the graph and terminate, with the requirement that each node has to be visited by at least one agent. It has been shown by Luna et al. (2020) [22] that the problem is solvable by two anonymous agents if there is a single observably different node in the ring called landmark node. The problem is unsolvable by any number of anonymous agents in absence of a landmark node. We consider the problem with non-anonymous agents (agents with distinct identifiers) in a ring with no landmark node. The assumption of agents with distinct identifiers is strictly weaker than having a landmark node as the problem is unsolvable by two agents with distinct identifiers in absence of a landmark node. This setting has been recently studied by Mandal et al. (2020) [6] . There it is shown that the problem is solvable in this setting by three agents assuming that they have edge crossing detection capability. Edge crossing detection capability is a strong assumption which enables two agents moving in opposite directions through an edge in the same round to detect each other and also exchange information. In this paper we give an algorithm that solves the problem with three agents without the edge crossing detection capability.},

To address this issue, existing works focus more on UAV&#39;s offline path planning with designated system vehicles providing charging service. Nevertheless, in some emergency cases and rural areas where system vehicles are not available, public vehicles can provide more cost-saving and feasible service in UAV travelling. In this paper, we explore how a single UAV can save flying distance by exploiting public vehicles for the purpose of minimizing the overall travel time of the UAV, which is from the perspective of online algorithm . For the offline setting where the information of future vehicles is known far ahead of time, we present an O ( n 2 ) O(n2) -time shortest-path-like optimal solution by delicately transforming the problem into a graph capturing both time and energy constraints. For the online setting where public vehicles appear in real-time and only inform the UAV of their trip information some certain time Δ t beforehand, we first construct lower bounds on the competitive ratio for different Δ t . Then, we propose two online algorithms, including a greedy algorithm MyopicHitching that greedily hitches truck rides and an improved algorithm Δ t - Adaptive that further tolerates a waiting time in hitching a ride. Our theoretical analysis shows that Δ t - Adaptive is asymptotically optimal in the sense that its ratio approaches the proposed lower bounds as Δ t increases.},

  abstract     = {As cloud computing has developed rapidly, outsourcing data to cloud servers for remote storage has become an attractive trend. However, when cloud clients store their data in the cloud, the security and privacy of cloud data would be threatened due to accidental corruptions or purposive attacks caused by a semi-trusted cloud server. The widely used method of addressing the security and privacy of cloud data is to store encrypted data instead of plain data. As the resulting system is unusable, since the cloud can no longer search throughout the data, new cryptographic primitive such as public-key encryption with equality test (PKEET) has been introduced. PKEET has many interesting applications such as keyword search on encrypted data , encrypted data partitioning for efficient encrypted data management, personal health record systems, spam filtering in encrypted email systems and so forth. PKEET allows checking whether two ciphertexts encrypted under different public keys contain the same message or not. However, unrestricted access to equality tests can reveal information about the underlying data. This is not acceptable in respect of users&#39; privacy. In 2015, Ma et al. introduce the notion of PKEET with flexible authorization (PKEET-FA) which strengthens privacy protection. Since 2015, there are several follow-up works on PKEET-FA. However, all are secure in the random oracle model and vulnerable to quantum attacks. In this paper, we provide two constructions of quantum-safe PKEET-FA secure in the standard model based on the hardness assumptions of integer lattices and ideal lattices . Finally, we implement the PKEET-FA scheme over ideal lattices.},

  abstract     = {Proportions of web users are becoming more and more. To secure their information they create their own login identification and password. Secret word confirmation is a cycle that includes a client contributing an ID and key that is then checked against certifications. They are probably been approached to make or potentially enter a secret key to access an individual record, regardless of whether that is a web-based portal or applications. In general the password will be in the form of string with the characters. Securing the information has become a challenging factor for web users . When the user creates a highly secured password it takes time for the hackers to crack it with the help of available tools. Cracking the password has created a serious challenge to the users to provide a highly secured password. Many authentication methods have been proposed to secure their data. Password authentication using Petri nets , Colored Petri nets have been used to create a secured login password . In this paper, we proposed and developed the application of Interval Timed colored Petri nets to generate password which will be more secured. This research work provides a new platform for the web users to create a matrix type password in a secured way. This helps them to secure their information more than ever before.

  abstract     = {Internet has evolved into a promising technology after going through various transitional phases in the past decades. It was invented in the early nineties, with the web being static, public and shared. The final transitional phase is the internet of services, where the content, web services, Extensible Markup Language (XML), productivity and commerce tools were created by the user bringing improved websites and services. Later on, with affordable mobile broadband , Android phones and tablets, people could access the internet and be in touch with the world through social media platforms and mobile applications. IoT is a network of physical components, vehicles, household appliances and other items embedded with devices, software, sensor systems, actuators and connectivity, connecting and transferring data. The process of gathering data from heterogeneous sensors for preventing recurrent transmissions simultaneously offering quality aggregated information at the sink node is collectively called as data aggregation and routing process. There is a transmission of only most complex information to the sink node. The continuous use of data aggregation and routing technique increases the energy, bandwidth and memory requirements. The challenging aspects in IoT WSN are energy consumption, bandwidth and memory utilized for data aggregation and routing process. So, it is very much important to focus on these parameters so that the network has a greater lifetime and Quality of service. The tradeoff between energy saving , precision of data and latency can be achieved only by utilizing data redundancy , data similarity, data aggregation and routing algorithms . The aim of the research is to do the analysis of the IoT WSNs on the basis of the architecture, framework, and challenges related to security, data aggregation and routing techniques. This research work motivates the researchers to know about the challenges in data aggregation and routing in IoT WSNs. An efficient data aggregation and routing technique in IoT WSNs help to improve the QoS parameters namely, throughput, end to end delay , routing overhead, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption. Data aggregation technique in IoT WSNs help in saving the energy of the nodes in the network. Thus makes the network efficient in terms of energy and other QoS parameters. Because of the high density of nodes in IoT WSNs, same data is sensed by a lot of nodes, which results in redundancy. Using data aggregation technique, the redundancy can be eliminated while routing packets from source nodes to base station.},

  abstract     = {Smoking is the major cause for lung carcinoma (LC) resultsin two major types likenon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). As such, it is malignant in nature and the mortality rate is very high. The main aim is to evaluate the risk factor of the patient with LC being ranked towards the priority treatment for the longevity of life. In the article, the hesitant fuzzy VIKOR methodology is proposed to determine the severity of the patient disease through the ranking methods, based on the ranking the treatment should be given accordingly. The sampling data set was deployed and applied in the above said methodology which provides higher outcomes. In India, the survey (up to Globocan 2018) gives the detailed pictures towards patient with malignant LC in which 48,198 male new cases were found, out of which 45,363 patients diseased due to the severity of the disease. In particular, 19,097 females were affected and 18,112 were dead. The mean value of the mortality rate was calculated as 54.6\%. Especially it affects the person who is having the age 65 years and above. The smoker and Non-smoker ratio is 20:1 available in making various studies. Normally smokers will get LC than the non- smokers. The study reveals that the second-hand smokers one who inhales the other smoke will also get affected. From the above facts, persons far away from the tobacco smokes will not get affected from the chronic mortality. The novelty of the work exhibits, VIKOR has a great situation in giving a situating procedure to positive qualities and negative attributes when it is used and examined in decision making.},

On the other hand, we design polynomial-time algorithms for the BCS problem on the interval, circular-arc, and permutation graphs.

  abstract     = {The well-known secretary problem in sequential analysis and optimal stopping theory asks one to maximize the probability of finding the optimal candidate in a sequentially examined list under the constraint that accept/reject decisions are made in real-time. The problem has received significant interest in the mathematics community and is related to practical questions arising in online search, data streaming , daily purchase modeling and multi-arm bandit mechanisms. A version of the problem is the so-called postdoc problem, for which the question of interest is to devise a strategy that identifies the second-best candidate with highest possible probability of success. We study the postdoc problem in its combinatorial form. In this setting, a permutation π of length N is sampled according to some distribution over the symmetric group S N SN and the elements of π are revealed one-by-one from left to right so that at each step, one can only determine the relative orders of the elements revealed so far. At each step, one must decide to either accept or reject the currently presented element and cannot recall the decision in the future. The question of interest is to find the optimal strategy for selecting the position of the second-largest value. We solve the postdoc problem for the untraditional setting where the candidates are not presented uniformly at random but rather according to permutations drawn from the Mallows distribution. The Mallows distribution assigns to each permutation π ∈ S N π∈SN a weight θ c ( π ) θc(π) , where the function c represents the Kendall τ distance between π and the identity permutation (i.e., the number of inversions in π ). To identify the optimal stopping criteria for the significantly more challenging postdoc problem, we adopt a combinatorial methodology that includes new proof techniques and novel methodological extensions compared to the analysis first introduced in the setting of the secretary problem. The optimal strategies depend on the parameter θ of the Mallows distribution and can be determined exactly by solving well-defined recurrence relations .},

  abstract     = {The concept of puncturable encryption ( PE PE ) was introduced by Green and Miers at IEEE S&amp;P, 2015. PE PE allows recipients to update their decryption keys to revoke decryption capability for selected messages without communicating with senders. From the first instantiation, PE PE shows its essence for many interesting applications, such as asynchronous messaging systems , group messaging systems , public-key watermarking schemes , secure cloud emails, and many more. To eliminate the necessity of having a costly certificate verification process , Wei et al. introduced puncturable identity-based encryption ( PIBE PIBE ) at ESORICS, 2019. Unfortunately, till today, there is no PIBE PIBE , which can withstand quantum attack. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap in the literature by presenting the first constructions of PIBE PIBE , for both selective and adaptive identity, which are secure in the standard model based on the hardness of learning with errors problem. Finally, we extend the design idea of selectively secure PIBE PIBE to provide the first construction of lattice-based puncturable key-policy attribute-based encryption ( KP - PABE KP-PABE ), which can facilitate fine-grained access mechanism with decryption revocation. Design ideas of proposed constructions can, also, be useful to construct other lattice-based expressive PE PE .},

Assuming that every mobile sensor has to be linked to some base station, and the number of base stations is upper bounded by a constant, we present a 5-LMP (Lagrangian Multiplier Preserving) algorithm.

In the case of limited resources, it&#39;s crucial to design a collaborative sweep coverage scheme for the fewest UAVs to achieve the 100\% on-time coverage rate. In this paper, we first propose a novel problem named TSCM. Under the constraints of time sensitivity and the endurance of UAVs, the objective of the TSCM problem is to minimize the number of required UAVs to cover all POIs on time. We prove that the TSCM problem is NP-hard. Accordingly, we propose the GCS algorithm for the TSCM problem. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations and the experimental results demonstrate GCS can achieve the minimum number of required UAVs and improve the performance by 14\% compared with the best existing algorithms.},

We present an algorithm that, given P P , finds the locations for a set of refueling stations whose cardinality is at most the optimal plus one. The time complexity of this algorithm is O ( n 2 + L d n ) O(n2+Ldn) , where L is the length of P P . We also present an algorithm that returns an additive ϵ -approximation for the problem of minimizing the fuel capacity required for the drones when we are allowed to place k base stations around the boundary of the island; this algorithm also finds the locations of these refueling stations.

The degree query reports the number of incident edges to a given vertex, the adjacency query asks if there is an edge between two given vertices, and the neighborhood query enumerates all the neighbors of a given vertex. We first prove a general lower bound for these intersection graph classes, and then present a uniform approach that lets us obtain matching lower and upper bounds for representing each of these graph classes. More specifically, our lower bound proofs use a unified technique to produce tight bounds for all these classes, and this is followed by our data structures which are also obtained from a unified representation method to achieve succinctness for each class. In addition, we prove a lower bound of space for representing trapezoid graphs, and give a succinct navigational oracle for this class of graphs.},

  abstract     = {The influence maximization problem aims to find some seeds which can cause the maximum influence spread results in a social network. Most researches focus on the non-adaptive strategies, in which all seeds are selected at once. For the non-adaptive strategies, the seeds may influence other seeds in the influence spread process and make the waste of budget. This paper considers the adaptive strategies and studies the adaptive influence maximization and adaptive stochastic influence maximization in the general feedback model. These problems select seeds adaptively, and it completes each selection after the fixed observation time-step. In this paper, we utilize the adaptive greedy to solve these problems and propose a theoretical analysis by introducing a comparative factor. In addition, we present the feasible approximation algorithm using the reverse sampling technique. Finally, we carry out experiments on three networks to show the efficiency of adaptive strategies.},

Scheduling mobile chargers to charge sensor nodes has been widely studied due to its efficiency and flexibility. However, most existing works focus on maximizing the charging utility or charging efficiency, which ignores the task performing functions of sensor nodes. In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling a mobile charger to maximize the task utility achieved by sensor nodes. We consider two different scenarios where sensor nodes are deployed on a line road and a ring road, respectively. We prove the NP-Hardness of our problems and design two approximation algorithms with guaranteed performance. We also investigate how to jointly schedule two mobile chargers in the line road scenario, and design a corresponding approximation algorithm to address the problem. We prove the approximation ratio of our algorithms through theoretical analysis, and conduct extensive simulations to validate the performance of our algorithms. Simulation results show that our algorithms always outperform the baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Edge intelligence is getting in the spotlight to enable time-critical applications with the support of next-generation mobile networks. In edge intelligence, real-time image classification and object detection services powered by deep neural networks (DNN) are expected to play an important part. However, signal attenuation and device mobility inevitably lead to unreliability in mobile networks. Additionally, most services adopt transport protocols with fewer error correction mechanisms like user datagram protocol (UDP) to guarantee low latency. These two factors result in data perturbation in mobile networks, which further causes degradation in service reliability. In this paper, we aim to retain high reliability in such scenarios by minimizing the impact of distortion. When researching into image compression , our experiment in the frequency domain reflects that low-frequency coefficients in images are more significant in DNN inference. Progressive encoding provides higher priority to the low-frequency components therefore it is likely to help realize more reliable edge intelligence. We propose a novel transmission process based on progressive encoding. To test its effectiveness compared to other processes, we conduct experiment on state-of-the-art inference models in object detection and image classification . The proposed process reaches a considerable result in normalized reliability in unreliable networks.},

  abstract     = {Travel providers such as airlines are becoming more and more interested in understanding how passengers choose among alternative products, especially the purchasing preferences of passengers. Getting information of air passenger choice behavior helps them better display and adapt their offer. Discrete choice models are appealing for airline revenue management (RM). In this paper, we apply latent class multinomial logit model (LC-MNL) to passenger choice behavior. The analysis based on actual sales transaction data reveals the purchase preferences of different passenger types. According to the distribution of the market, we divide passengers into three groups: low-price oriented, high-price oriented and no specific price preference. The low-price oriented passengers only choose products from the set which consists of the lowest price cabin classes of each flight, while the high-price oriented passengers do the opposite. Considering that the passenger types in the transaction sales data are unknown, the latent class passenger choice model can better represent their heterogeneous purchasing preference. An improved EM algorithm is applied to solve the LC-MNL. In the improved EM algorithm , an indicator function containing both the type of passengers and the first choice information in period t is devised, the iterative process of the EM algorithm is more effective consequently. The proposed model and algorithm are evaluated on actual aviation sales transaction data in China. Experimental results show that the passenger choice behavior analysis based on the specific purchasing preferences performs well on actual aviation sales transaction data.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the Online Food Delivery Problem (OFDP) to model the delivery problem commonly encountered in online food-ordering-and-delivery platforms. In the OFDP the requests (orders) are submitted online, and the depot (restaurant) needs to decide when to send out a server to serve the submitted requests. In addition, the server has to return to the depot (to pickup foods) before serving new requests. The objective is to minimize maximum flow time, i.e., the maximum time between the submission and completion of a request. This problem can also be viewed as a variant of the Online Dial-a-Ride problem, for which however the max flow time objective is inapproximable in general. We study the OFDP on star graphs , and give both algorithmic and hardness results. We analyze a natural greedy strategy and show that it achieves the optimal competitive ratio 3 among all myopic algorithms, which are algorithms that immediately send out the server whenever there are unserved requests. Then we prove that a far-sighted (i.e., non-myopic) algorithm with proper waiting strategy can achieve 8/3-competitive ratio. On the negative side, we give a simple lower bound example that excludes the possibility of any ( 2 − ϵ ) (2−ϵ) -competitive algorithms.},

Our goal is to make the sum of completion times as small as possible. For this problem, we testify that there is no online algorithm with a competitive ratio of less than 2.

In this paper, we study a basic and natural extension of string indexing called the string indexing for top- k close consecutive occurrences problem ( Sitcco ). Here, a consecutive occurrence is a pair ( i , j ) (i,j) , i i&amp;lt;j , such that P occurs at positions i and j in S and there is no occurrence of P between i and j , and their distance is defined as j − i j−i . Given a pattern P and a parameter k , the goal is to report the top- k consecutive occurrences of P in S of minimal distance. The challenge is to compactly represent S while supporting queries in time close to the length of P and k . We give three time-space trade-offs for the problem. Let n be the length of S , m the length of P , and ϵ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] ϵ∈(0,1] . Our first result achieves O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) space and optimal query time of O ( m + k ) O(m+k) . Our second and third results achieve linear space and query times either O ( m + k 1 + ϵ ) O(m+k1+ϵ) or O ( m + k log 1 + ϵ ⁡ n ) O(m+klog1+ϵ⁡n) .

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has subsequently been applied to a variety of sectors, including smart grids, farming, weather prediction, power generation, wastewater treatment, and so on. So if the Internet of Things has enormous promise in a wide range of applications, there still are certain areas where it may be improved. Designers had focused our present research on reducing the energy consumption of devices in IoT networks, which will result in a longer network lifetime. The far more suitable Cluster Head (CH) throughout the IoT system is determined in this study to optimize energy consumption. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is indeed a mixed meta-heuristic algorithm used during the suggested study. Various quantifiable metrics, including the variety of adult nodes, workload, temperatures, remaining energy, and a target value, were utilized IoT network groups. The suggested method then is contrasted to several cutting-edge optimization techniques, including the Artificial Bee Colony method, Neural Network , Adapted Gravity Simulated annealing. The findings show that the suggested hybrid method outperforms conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Following Stolarsky, we say that a natural number n is flimsy in base b if some positive multiple of n has smaller digit sum in base b than n does; otherwise it is sturdy . When n is proven flimsy by multiplier k , we say n is k-flimsy . We study computational aspects of sturdy and flimsy numbers. We provide some criteria for determining whether a number is sturdy. We study the computational problem of checking whether a given number is sturdy, giving several algorithms for the problem, focusing particularly on the case b = 2 b=2 . We find two additional, previously unknown sturdy primes. We develop a method for determining which numbers with a fixed number of 0&#39;s in binary are flimsy. Finally, we develop a method that allows us to estimate the number of k -flimsy numbers with n bits, and we provide explicit results for k = 3 k=3 and k = 5 k=5 . Our results demonstrate the utility (and fun) of creating algorithms for number theory problems, based on methods of automata theory .},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSN) have become an integral part of human society. OSN has become an important and crucial mode of interaction among people around the world. For the past two decades, the need for data privacy security among the participants of an OSN has been challenged as technological advances have provided a lot of benefits and exposure to all active members sharing content in various online communities. Large amounts of data are usually stored on different network nodes, which can lead to malicious data security and privacy issues. When OSN users share any private content with the other participants of same network like with their friends and colleagues, their information may be inadvertently leaked to various other individuals to whom it is not supposed to be shared. Those individuals may include one&#39;s enemies, social robots, and users with fake credentials, spammers or data cutters. In addition, the spread of malicious through OSN can lead to massive damage to the network and privacy leakage . To overcome this problem, we propose a hybrid soft computing with big data analytics based protection and recovery strategy (HSBD-PR) for security enhancement in large scale OSNs. First, we introduce a modified teaching-learning with fish swarm optimization (MTL-FS) technique to classify the abnormal network users as five classes are susceptive, contagious, doubt, immune and recoverable users. Second, we fuse a block window optimization with Bayesian belief network (BWB 2 ) for analyze the propagation mechanism of abnormal users in network. After that, deep belief neural network (DBNN) based protection and recovery strategy is developed to improve the immunity of abnormal users and reduce the count of it. Finally, the performance of proposed HSBD-PR approach evaluate by standard benchmark datasets is Enron email, Epinions and Facebook. The results of this proposed method are compared with the existing state-of-art methods in terms of different performance metrics are detection failure rate, detection success rate, marginal detection gain and detection accuracy respectively.},

DTNP-DS systems possess three recognizable features: spiking mechanism, dynamic threshold mechanism, and delay mechanism on synapses. Based on the three mechanisms, we develop a novel algorithm based on DTNP-DS systems for solving shortest path problems . In principle, the three mechanisms provide a parallel search way for the shortest path in a given network, and they can effectively control the speed and direction of the search. Simulation results demonstrate that DTNP-DS systems can provide an effective solution for the shortest path problems .},

It remains open how to design universal asynchronous HSNP systems. In this work, we introduce local rule synchronization into asynchronous HSNP systems, and such systems are abbreviated as AHSNPR systems. Specifically, a family of the rule sets is specified; a rule in a specified rule set is applied synchronously with all the other rules in the same set, and a rule not in any specified rule set is applied asynchronously. We investigate the number generating power of AHSNPR systems. It is proved that general and unbounded AHSNPR systems are universal, and bounded AHSNPR systems are only able to characterize the semilinear sets of numbers achieving the corresponding properties of decidability and closure. The results show that the local rule synchronization is useful in constructing universal asynchronous HSNP systems.},

Driven by the needs of various applications which can be encoded by DQBFs in a natural, compact, and elegant way, research on DQBF solving has emerged in the past few years. However, research focused on closed DQBFs in prenex form (where all quantifiers are placed in front of a propositional formula), while non-prenex DQBFs have almost not been studied in the literature. In this paper, we provide a formal definition for syntax and semantics of non-closed non-prenex DQBFs and prove useful properties enabling quantifier localization. Moreover, we make use of our theory by integrating quantifier localization into a state-of-the-art DQBF solver. Experiments with prenex DQBF benchmarks, including all instances from the QBFEVAL&#39;18–&#39;20 competitions, clearly show that quantifier localization pays off in this context.},

  abstract     = {Simon&#39;s problem is an essential example demonstrating the faster speed of quantum computers than classical computers for solving some problems. The optimal separation between exact quantum and classical query complexities for Simon&#39;s problem has been proved by Cai &amp; Qiu. Generalized Simon&#39;s problem can be described as follows. Given a function f : { 0 , 1 } n → { 0 , 1 } m , with the property that there is some unknown hidden subgroup S such that f ( x ) = f ( y ) iff x ⊕ y ∈ S , for any x , y ∈ { 0 , 1 } n , where | S | = 2 k for some 0 ≤ k ≤ n ( m ≥ n − k ) . The goal of generalized Simon&#39;s problem is to find S . For the case of k = 1 , it is Simon&#39;s problem exactly. In this paper, we propose an exact quantum algorithm with O ( n − k ) queries and an non-adaptive deterministic classical algorithm with O ( k 2 n − k ) queries for solving the generalized Simon&#39;s problem. Also, we prove that their lower bounds are Ω ( n − k ) and Ω ( k 2 n − k ) , respectively. Therefore, we obtain a tight exact quantum query complexity Θ ( n − k ) and an almost tight non-adaptive classical deterministic query complexities Ω ( k 2 n − k ) ∼ O ( k 2 n − k ) for this problem.},

They are based on the notion of individual tokens that can be connected together via bonds. In this paper we extend RPNs by allowing multiple tokens of the same type to exist within a net and we implement a notion of local reversibility for the model based on the collective token interpretation of Petri nets . The resulting framework allows us to model a form of out-of-causal-order reversibility, a type of reversibility that arises most notably in biological systems. Furthermore, it is lightweight in the sense that it requires no global control and no history needs to be preserved. Furthermore, we provide a mechanism for controlling reversibility by associating transitions with conditions, which guard their execution. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by modelling the functioning of the sodium-potassium pump, a system where transition execution is governed by activation conditions and featuring reversible behaviour.},

Recent results in the area of runtime analysis have pointed out that algorithms such as the ( 1 + 1 1+1 ) EA and Global SEMO can efficiently reoptimize linear functions under a dynamic uniform constraint. Motivated by this study, we investigate single- and multi-objective baseline evolutionary algorithms for the classical knapsack problem where the capacity of the knapsack varies over time. We establish different benchmark scenarios where the capacity changes every τ iterations according to a uniform or normal distribution . Our experimental investigations analyze the behavior of our algorithms in terms of the magnitude of changes determined by parameters of the chosen distribution, the frequency determined by τ , and the class of knapsack instance under consideration. Our results show that the multi-objective approaches using a population that caters for dynamic changes have a clear advantage on many benchmarks scenarios when the frequency of changes is not too high. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the diversity mechanisms used in popular evolutionary multi-objective algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA2 do not necessarily result in better performance and even lead to inferior results compared to our simple multi-objective approaches.},

One finding was that in the numerical setting, addition, subtraction and bit-wise Boolean operations of numbers preserve polynomial time while incorporating concatenation or multiplication allows to solve all PSPACE problems in polynomially many steps. Therefore we propose to use updates and comparisons with automatic functions as primitive operations and use constantly many registers; the resulting model covers all primitive operations of Hartmanis and Simon as well as Floyd and Knuth, but the model remains in polynomial time.

Computers are connected with sensors that measure physical quantities such as distance, electric current, mass, pressure, temperature, etc, interfering in the environment as experimenters. In this paper, we consider the experimenter (e.g. the experimental physicist) as a Turing machine – the digital component – and the experiment of measurement – the analog component – as an oracle to the Turing machine . The algorithm running in the machine abstracts the method of measurement (encoding the recursive structure of experimental actions) chosen by the experimenter. The interaction between the machine and the sensors is mediated by a protocol, that specifies the experimental error, and a schedule, that determines its running time. We then overview the computational complexity classes related to diverse protocols between the digital and the analogue parts of the digital-analogue machine.},

  abstract     = {Delegated quantum computing enables a client with weak computational power to delegate quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that the integrity of the server can be efficiently verified by the client. Recently, a new model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational delegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the server, the client pays a reward to the server depending on the server&#39;s messages and the client&#39;s random bits. The rational server sends messages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the classical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational quantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational delegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational sumcheck protocol. An advantage of our protocols is that they are gate-set independent: the construction of the previous rational protocols depends on gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any local gate set (each of whose elementary gates can be specified with a polynomial number of bits). Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward function satisfies natural requirements (the reward is non-negative, upper-bounded by a constant, and its maximum expected value is lower-bounded by a constant). We also discuss the reward gap. Simply speaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the server&#39;s reward incurred by the server&#39;s behavior that makes the client accept an incorrect answer. The reward gap should therefore be large enough to incentivize the server to behave optimally. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only exponentially small reward gaps as in the previous protocols, we show that a constant reward gap can be achieved if two noncommunicating but entangled rational servers are allowed. We also discuss whether a single rational server is sufficient under the (widely believed) assumption that the learning-with-errors problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing. Apart from these results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence between rational and ordinary delegated quantum computing protocols. This equivalence then serves as a basis for a reward-gap amplification method.},

In other words, the reaction system is allowed to evolve subject to some transformation rule that preserves a new kind of equivalence of reaction systems, called enabling equivalence. Partly motivated by the reachability problem , in this work, we propose the evolvability problem that asks given two reaction systems, whether one can evolve into another. We also provide a shorter proof of the Invisibility Theorem by Ehrenfeucht et al. above and study an invisible version of the evolvability problem. Our main results provide an almost complete characterization of the evolvability problem for the class of reactantless reaction systems. However, the computational complexity of the evolvability problem is wide open. This study initiates a natural research direction pertaining to the dynamics of evolving reaction systems.},

Furthermore, the concept of identifiability , which is an essential prerequisite for the successful application of our method, but also a more general design characteristic inspired from the testing practice, is introduced and investigated in the context of spiking neural P systems. Identifiability of system&#39;s components (modules, methods, etc.) is a fundamental criterion used for assessing a system&#39;s testability since it allows the components of a system to be identified from the behaviour produced in response to the inputs received and, consequently, maximizes the effectiveness of the testing process.},

  abstract     = {Given a weighted graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) with weight functions c : E → R + c:E→R+ and π : V → R + π:V→R+ , and a subset U ⊆ V U⊆V , the normalized cut value for U is defined as the sum of the weights of edges exiting U divided by the weight of vertices in U . The mean isoperimetry problem , ISO 1 ( G , k ) ISO1(G,k) , for a weighted graph G is a generalization of the classical uniform sparsest cut problem in which, given a parameter k , the objective is to find k disjoint nonempty subsets of V minimizing the average normalized cut value of the parts. The robust version of the problem seeks an optimizer where the number of vertices that fall out of the subpartition is bounded by some given integer 0 ≤ ρ ≤ | V | 0≤ρ≤|V| . The problem may also be considered as the normalized version of the classical k -multiway cut problem on edge-weighted graphs. Our main result states that ISO 1 ( G , k ) ISO1(G,k) , as well as its robust version, CRISO 1 ( G , k , ρ ) CRISO1(G,k,ρ) , subjected to the condition that each part of the subpartition induces a connected subgraph , are solvable in time O ( k 2 ρ 2 π ( V ( T ) ) 3 ) O(k2ρ2π(V(T))3) on any weighted tree T , in which π ( V ( T ) ) π(V(T)) is the sum of the vertex-weights. This result implies that ISO 1 ( G , k ) ISO1(G,k) is strongly polynomial-time solvable on weighted trees when the vertex-weights are polynomially bounded and may be compared to the fact that the problem is NP-hard for weighted trees in general. As far as applications are concerned, the connectivity requirement may be interpreted as an approach to model the practical consistency of the parts, which together with having control on the size of the outlier set and applying a smooth “mean” cost function (as opposed to, say, the “max” version), characterizes our solution to CRISO 1 ( G , k , ρ ) CRISO1(G,k,ρ) on trees as one of the most flexible and accurate procedures within the framework of isoperimetry-based clustering. Also, using this, we show that both mentioned problems, ISO 1 ( G , k ) ISO1(G,k) and CRISO 1 ( G , k , ρ ) CRISO1(G,k,ρ) as well as the ordinary robust mean isoperimetry problem RISO 1 ( G , k , ρ ) RISO1(G,k,ρ) , admit polynomial-time O ( log 1.5 ⁡ | V | log ⁡ log ⁡ | V | ) O(log1.5⁡|V|log⁡log⁡|V|) -approximation algorithms for weighted graphs with polynomially bounded weights, using the Räcke-Shah tree cut sparsifier.},

  abstract     = {Counting dominating sets in a graph is a #P-complete problem even for bipartite graphs . This paper concerns the class of tree convex bipartite graphs, which is a subclass of bipartite graphs. A bipartite graph G with bipartition ( X , Y ) (X,Y) is called tree convex, if a tree T defined on X exists such that for every vertex y in Y , the neighbors of y form a subtree in T . For each y in Y , when the neighbors of y form a path or a rooted directed path in T , the tree convex bipartite graph is called path-tree bipartite or rooted path-tree bipartite, respectively. This work proves that the problem of counting dominating sets remains #P-complete for path-tree bipartite graphs but admits a polynomial-time solution for the more tightly constrained subclass of rooted path-tree bipartite graphs.},

This problem is called the connected p -centdian problem on block graphs. In the scope of this paper, we always focus on unweighted block graphs. For block graphs with two different edge lengths, the problem is NP-complete. For block graphs with uniform edge lengths, we focus on a special case of the connected p-centdian problem, namely where the median and the center functions receive equal weight. Concerning this specific problem, we consider a lexicographic order based on certain labels of the vertices and prove that there exists a connected p -centdian that contains a predetermined 1-centdian on the underlying graph. Applying this result, we develop a linear time algorithm for the problem. Finally, the problem under the general convex combination of the median and the center functions is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In the ( s , d ) (s,d) -spy game over a graph G , k guards and one spy occupy some vertices of G and, at each turn, the spy may move with speed s (along at most s edges) and each guard may move along one edge. The spy and the guards may occupy the same vertices. The spy wins if she reaches a vertex at distance more than the surveilling distance d from every guard. This game was introduced by Cohen et al. (2016) [15] and is related to two well-studied games: Cops and Robber game and Eternal Dominating game. The guard number g n s , d ( G ) gns,d(G) is the minimum number of guards such that the guards have a winning strategy (of controlling the spy) in the graph G . In 2018, it was proved that deciding if the spy has a winning strategy is NP-hard for every speed s ≥ 2 s≥2 and distance d ≥ 0 d≥0 . In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the guard number in grids and in graph products. We obtain a strict upper bound on the strong product of two general graphs and obtain examples with King grids that match this bound and other examples for which the guard number is smaller. We also obtain the exact value of the guard number in the lexicographical product of two general graphs for any distance d ≥ 2 d≥2 . From the algorithmic point of view, we prove a positive result: if the number k of guards is fixed, the spy game is solvable in polynomial XP time O ( n 3 k + 2 ) O(n3k+2) for every speed s ≥ 2 s≥2 and distance d ≥ 0 d≥0 . In other words, the spy game is XP when parameterized by the number of guards. This XP algorithm is used to obtain an FPT algorithm on the P 4 P4 -fewness of the graph. As a negative result, we prove that the spy game is W[2]-hard even in bipartite graphs when parameterized by the number of guards, for every speed s ≥ 2 s≥2 and distance d ≥ 0 d≥0 , extending the hardness result of Cohen et al. in 2018.},

We study the complexity of parameterized algorithms for Upper Dominating Set , as well as its sub-exponential approximation . First, we prove that, under the ETH, Upper Dominating Set cannot be solved in time O ( n o ( k ) ) O(no(k)) (improving on O ( n o ( k ) ) O(no(k)) ), and in the same time we show under the same complexity assumption that for any constant ratio r and any ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 , there is no r -approximation algorithm running in time O ( n k 1 − ε ) O(nk1−ε) . Then, we settle the problem&#39;s complexity parameterized by pathwidth by giving an algorithm running in time ⁎ O ⁎ ( 6 p w ) O⁎(6pw) (improving the current best ⁎ O ⁎ ( 7 p w ) O⁎(7pw) ), and a lower bound showing that our algorithm is the best we can get under the SETH. Furthermore, we obtain a simple sub-exponential approximation algorithm for this problem: an algorithm that produces an r -approximation in time n O ( n / r ) nO(n/r) , for any desired approximation ratio r r&amp;lt;n . We finally show that this time-approximation trade-off is tight, up to an arbitrarily small constant in the second exponent: under the randomized ETH, and for any ratio r &gt; 1 r&amp;gt;1 and ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 , no algorithm can output an r -approximation in time n ( n / r ) 1 − ε n(n/r)1−ε .

We prove that this problem is strongly NP-hard and inapproximable on general graphs and is polynomial-time solvable on graphs with bounded treewidth and with unit connection costs. Further, we prove the NP-hardness of the problem with arbitrary connection costs over trees and series-parallel graphs and derive dynamic programming algorithms . We extend our results to the problem variants that consider the minimisation of the largest connected component and the maximisation of the number of connected components (also called K-way Vertex Cut Problem).

  abstract     = {The chromatic number , which refers to the minimum number of colours required to colour the vertices of graphs properly, is one of the most central notions of the graph chromatic theory. Several of its aspects of interest have been investigated in the literature, including variants for modifications of proper colourings. These variants include, notably, the achromatic number of graphs, which is the maximum number of colours required to colour the vertices of graphs properly so that each possible combination of distinct colours is assigned along some edge. The behaviours of this parameter have led to many investigations of interest, bringing to light both similarities and discrepancies with the chromatic number . This work takes place in a recent trend aiming at extending the chromatic theory of graphs to the realm of signed graphs, and, in particular, at investigating how classic results adapt to the signed context. Most of the works done in that line to date are with respect to two main generalisations of proper colourings of signed graphs, attributed to Zaslavsky and Guenin. Generalising the achromatic number to signed graphs was initiated recently by Lajou, his investigations being related to Guenin&#39;s colourings. We here pursue this line of research, but with taking Zaslavsky&#39;s colourings as our notion of proper colourings. We study the general behaviour of our resulting variant of the achromatic number, mainly by investigating how known results on the classic achromatic number generalise to our context. Our results cover, notably, bounds, standard operations on graphs, and complexity aspects.},

  abstract     = {We study the effect of limiting the number of different messages a node can transmit simultaneously on the verification complexity of proof-labeling schemes (PLS). In a PLS, each node is given a label, and the goal is to verify, by exchanging messages over each link in each direction, that a certain global predicate is satisfied by the system configuration. We consider a single parameter r that bounds the number of distinct messages that can be sent concurrently by any node: in the case r = 1 r=1 , each node may only send the same message to all its neighbors (the broadcast model), in the case r ≥ Δ r≥Δ , where Δ is the largest node degree in the system, each neighbor may be sent a distinct message (the unicast model), and in general, for 1 ≤ r ≤ Δ 1≤r≤Δ , each of the r messages is destined to a subset of the neighbors. We show that message compression linear in r is possible for verifying fundamental problems such as the agreement between edge endpoints on the edge state. Some problems, including verification of maximal matching , exhibit a large gap in complexity between r = 1 r=1 and r &gt; 1 r&amp;gt;1 . For some other important predicates, the verification complexity is insensitive to r , e.g., the question whether a subset of edges constitutes a spanning-tree. We also consider the congested clique model. We show that the crossing technique [1] for proving lower bounds on the verification complexity can be applied in the case of congested clique only if r = 1 r=1 . Together with a new upper bound, this allows us to determine the verification complexity of MST in the broadcast clique. Finally, we establish a general connection between the deterministic and randomized verification complexity for any given number r .},

  abstract     = {Let G be a vertex-colored connected graph . A subset X of the vertex-set of G is called proper if any two adjacent vertices in X have distinct colors. The graph G is called proper vertex-disconnected if for any two vertices x and y of G , there exists a vertex subset S of G such that when x and y are nonadjacent, S is proper and x and y belong to different components of G − S G−S ; whereas when x and y are adjacent, S + x S+x or S + y S+y is proper and x and y belong to different components of ( G − x y ) − S (G−xy)−S . For a connected graph G , the proper vertex-disconnection number of G , denoted by p v d ( G ) pvd(G) , is the minimum number of colors that are needed to make G proper vertex-disconnected. In this paper, we firstly characterize the graphs of order n with proper vertex-disconnection number k for k ∈ { 1 , n − 2 , n − 1 , n } k∈{1,n−2,n−1,n} . Secondly, we give some sufficient conditions for a graph G such that p v d ( G ) = χ ( G ) pvd(G)=χ(G) , and show that almost all graphs G have p v d ( G ) = χ ( G ) pvd(G)=χ(G) and p v d ( G ‾ ) = χ ( G ‾ ) pvd(G‾)=χ(G‾) . We also give an equivalent statement of the famous Four Color Theorem. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the proper disconnection number p d ( G ) pd(G) of G and the proper vertex-disconnection number p v d ( L ( G ) ) pvd(L(G)) of the line graph L ( G ) L(G) of G . Finally, we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a given vertex-colored graph is proper vertex-disconnected, and it is NP-hard to decide for a fixed integer k ≥ 3 k≥3 , whether the pvd-number of a graph G is no more than k , even if k = 3 k=3 and G is a planar graph with Δ ( G ) = 12 Δ(G)=12 . We also show that it is solvable in polynomial time to determine the proper vertex-disconnection number for a graph with maximum degree less than four.},

  abstract     = {The numbers of spanning connected unicyclic subgraphs and spanning connected bicyclic subgraphs are essential parameters in studying network reliability. However, these two parameters have hardly been studied. Only in 1983, Liu studied the enumeration of spanning connected unicyclic(bicyclic) subgraphs, which is mainly calculated by the determinant of the cycle adjacency matrix . But for large networks, the calculation of the determinant of cycle adjacency matrix is extremely complex. In this paper, we present a reduction method to compute the number of spanning connected unicyclic(bicyclic) subgraphs of 2-separable networks. As an application, we enumerate the number of spanning connected unicyclic(bicyclic) subgraphs in fractal scale-free networks by linear algorithm. The exact expression of the number of spanning connected unicyclic(bicyclic) subgraphs is obtained. On this basis, the entropy of the number of spanning connected unicyclic(bicyclic) subgraphs is determined. This research provides helpful guidance for computing the number of spanning connected unicyclic(bicyclic) subgraphs of general 2-connected networks.},

  abstract     = {We study here algorithmic aspects of modular decomposition of hypergraphs . In the literature one can find three different definitions of modules: standard modules [25] , k -subset modules [6] , and Courcelle&#39;s modules [12] . Using fundamental tools from combinatorial decompositions such as partitive and orthogonal families, we directly derive a linear time algorithm for Courcelle&#39;s decomposition. We then introduce a general algorithmic tool for weakly partitive families and apply it for the three definitions of modules to derive polynomial time algorithms. For standard modules, we give an O ( n 3 ⋅ l ) O(n3⋅l) time algorithm (where n is the number of vertices and l the sum of the size of the edges). For k -subset modules, we obtain an O ( n 3 ⋅ l ) O(n3⋅l) runtime. This is an improvement from the best known algorithm for k -subset modular decomposition, which was not polynomial w.r.t. n and m , and is in O ( n 3 k − 5 ) O(n3k−5) time [6] where k denotes the maximal size of an edge, and m the number of hyperedges . Finally we focus on applications of orthogonality to modular decompositions of tournaments, simplifying the algorithm from [24] . The question of designing a O ( n ⋅ l ) O(n⋅l) time algorithm for the standard modular decomposition of hypergraphs remains open.},

The game ends once all the edges have been coloured. A player captures a vertex if more than half of its incident edges are coloured by that player, and the player that captures the most vertices wins. Using classical arguments from the field, we first prove general properties of this game. Namely, we prove that there is no graph in which Bob can win (if Alice plays optimally), while Alice can never capture more than 2 more vertices than Bob (if Bob plays optimally). Through dedicated arguments, we then investigate more specific properties of the game, and focus on its outcome when played in particular graph classes. Specifically, we determine the outcome of the game in paths, cycles, complete bipartite graphs , and Cartesian grids, and give partial results for trees and complete graphs.},

A partition of V ( G ) V(G) is connected if every part induces a connected subgraph . In many applications, it is desirable to obtain parts of roughly the same size, possibly with some slack s . A Balanced Connected k -Partition with slack s , denoted ( k , s ) (k,s) -BCP , is a partition of V ( G ) V(G) into k nonempty subsets, of sizes n 1 , … , n k n1,…,nk with | n i − n / k | ≤ s |ni−n/k|≤s , each of which induces a connected subgraph (when s = 0 s=0 , the k parts are perfectly balanced, and we call it k -BCP for short). A recombination is an operation that takes a ( k , s ) (k,s) -BCP of a graph G and produces another by merging two adjacent subgraphs and repartitioning them. Given two k -BCPs, A and B , of G and a slack s ≥ 0 s≥0 , we wish to determine whether there exists a sequence of recombinations that transform A into B via ( k , s ) (k,s) -BCPs. We obtain four results related to this problem: (1) When s is unbounded, the transformation is always possible using at most 6 ( k − 1 ) 6(k−1) recombinations. (2) If G is Hamiltonian , the transformation is possible using O ( k n ) O(kn) recombinations for any s ≥ n / k s≥n/k , (3) there exist negative instances for s ≤ n / ( 3 k ) s≤n/(3k) , and (4) we show that determining whether a sequence of recombination that connects two ( k , s ) (k,s) -BCP of a graph G exists is PSPACE-complete when k ∈ O ( n ε ) k∈O(nε) and s ∈ O ( n 1 − ε ) s∈O(n1−ε) , for any constant 0 0&amp;lt;ε≤1 .

Our coloring algorithm runs in O ( 1 ϵ log ⁡ n ) O(1ϵlog⁡n) rounds, and our independent set algorithm has a runtime of ⁎ O ( 1 ϵ log ⁡ ( 1 ϵ ) log ⁎ ⁡ n ) O(1ϵlog⁡(1ϵ)log⁎⁡n) rounds. For coloring, existing lower bounds imply that the dependencies on 1 ϵ 1ϵ and log ⁡ n log⁡n are best possible. For independent set, we prove that Ω ( 1 ϵ ) Ω(1ϵ) rounds are necessary. Both our algorithms make use of a tree decomposition of the input chordal graph. They iteratively peel off interval subgraphs, which are identified via the tree decomposition of the input graph, thereby partitioning the vertex set into O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) layers. For coloring, each interval graph is colored independently, which results in various coloring conflicts between the layers. These conflicts are then resolved in a separate phase, using the particular structure of our partitioning. For independent set, only the first O ( log ⁡ 1 ϵ ) O(log⁡1ϵ) layers are required as they already contain a large enough independent set. We develop a ( 1 + ϵ ) (1+ϵ) -approximation maximum independent set algorithm for interval graphs, which we then apply to those layers.

The LCPS problem was first proposed by Chowdhury et al.

This paper proposes a diagonal-based algorithm for solving the LCPS problem with O ( L ( m − L ) R log ⁡ n ) O(L(m−L)Rlog⁡n) time and O ( R L ) O(RL) space, where R denotes the number of match pairs between A and B , and L denotes the LCPS length. In our algorithm, the 3-dimensional minima finding algorithm is invoked to overcome the domination problem. As experimental results show, our algorithm is efficient practically compared with some previously published algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The study of monotone Boolean functions (MBFs) has a long history. We explore a connection between MBFs and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of gene regulation, and, in particular, a problem of the realization of an MBF as a function describing the state transition graph of an ODE . We formulate a problem of joint realizability of finite collections of MBFs by establishing a connection between the parameterized dynamics of a class of ODEs and a collection of MBFs. We pose a question of what collections of MBFs can be realized by ODEs that belong to nested classes defined by increased algebraic complexity of their right-hand sides. As we progressively restrict the algebraic form of the ODE , we show by a combination of theory and explicit examples that the class of jointly realizable functions strictly decreases. Our results impact the study of regulatory network dynamics, as well as the classical area of MBFs. We conclude with a series of potential extensions and conjectures.},

[3] recently. A set of two-stage jobs are selected and scheduled on parallel two-stage flowshops to achieve the maximum total profit while maintaining the given makespan constraint. We give a positive answer to an open question about its approximability proposed by Chen et al. [3] . More specifically, based on guessing strategies and rounding techniques for linear programs , we present a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the case when the number of flowshops is a fixed constant. As the case with two flowshops is already strongly NP-hard, our PTAS achieves the best possible approximation ratio.},

We examine this so-called call admission problem in tree networks. The focus is on the quality of solutions achievable in an advice setting, that is, when the central authority has a certain amount of information on the incoming requests. We show that O ( m log 2 ⁡ d ) O(mlog2⁡d) bits of additional information are sufficient for an online algorithm run by the central authority to perform as well as an optimal offline algorithm, where m is the number of edges and d is the largest degree in the tree network. In the case of a star tree network, we show that Ω ( m log 2 ⁡ d ) Ω(mlog2⁡d) bits are also necessary (note that d = m d=m ). We also present a lower bound on the advice complexity for small constant competitive ratios and an algorithm whose competitive ratio gradually improves with added advice bits to 2 ⌈ log 2 ⁡ n ⌉ 2⌈log2⁡n⌉ , where n is the number of nodes in the network.},

How to ensure fast routing in sparse topology and after node failure how to ensure that the network keeps topology properties are challenging problems. In this paper, we propose a Self-stabilizing dIrected t-Spanner for Autonomous nodes problem (SISA) and give intuitive solutions in both 2D and 3D space. In the topology construction phase, sparse directed t-spanner topologies, without substantially degrading the path connecting any pair of nodes in the original network, are constructed with a minimum number of messages. In the topology maintenance phase, the self-stabilizing algorithms run in the background to update locally for keeping t-spanner property when some nodes fail. In particular, our solutions have not any central daemon and are completely distributed. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solutions.},

The advent of cloud computing provides unparallelled opportunities to explore this problem, but also to develop infrastructures that support distributed investigations and relevant computational evidence for all results obtained, such as a list of all machines of a given size together with their classifications. This list can then be used for variants of the problem or related ones such as the placid platypus problem. We investigate how to generate classes of machines to be considered for the busy beaver problem, which involves separating the generation of machines from their analysis. We discuss the relationship between quadruple and quintuple variants of Turing machines , and show that the latter are more general than the former. We give some formal results to justify our strategy for minimising the number of machines generated, and define a process reflecting this strategy for generating machines. We describe our implementation, and the results of generating various classes of machines with up to 5 states or up to 5 symbols, all of which (together with our code) are available on the author&#39;s website.},

This construction has been so widely used in literature to build networks in which fault diagnosability can be studied, that it is worth to study their connectivity in detail, this is the main purpose of this paper. In this paper, we determine (1) κ ( G ) = δ ( G ) κ(G)=δ(G) if κ ( G 0 ) + κ ( G 1 ) ≥ δ ( G ) κ(G0)+κ(G1)≥δ(G) ; otherwise, κ ( G ) ≥ κ ( G 0 ) + κ ( G 1 ) κ(G)≥κ(G0)+κ(G1) , and (2) κ ( H ) = δ ( H ) κ(H)=δ(H) if ∑ i = 0 m − 1 κ ( G i ) ≥ δ ( H ) ∑i=0m−1κ(Gi)≥δ(H) ; otherwise, κ ( H ) ≥ ∑ i = 0 m − 1 κ ( G i ) κ(H)≥∑i=0m−1κ(Gi) . Examples show those bounds are tight. We then generalize these examples to a general composition using matchings on which we propose a conjecture on the connectivity and prove it for an important particular case.},

Approximate submodularity arises in many settings, especially in machine learning , where the function evaluation might not be exact. In this paper we study how close such approximately submodular functions are to truly submodular functions. We show that an approximately submodular function defined on a ground set of n elements is O ( n 2 ) O(n2) pointwise-close to a submodular function. This result also provides an algorithmic tool that can be used to adapt existing submodular optimization algorithms to approximately submodular functions. To complement, we show an Ω ( n ) Ω(n) lower bound on the distance to submodularity. These results stand in contrast to the case of approximate modularity, where the distance to modularity is a constant, and approximate convexity, where the distance to convexity is logarithmic.},

This method has already been successfully developed to handle unordered trees. If the literature proposes solutions to enumerate singletons of trees, we study in this article a more general problem, the enumeration of sets of trees – forests. Specifically, we mainly study irredundant forests, i.e., where no tree is a subtree of another. By compressing each such forest into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), we develop a reverse search like method to enumerate DAGs compressing irredundant forests. Remarkably, we prove that these DAGs are in bijection with the row-Fishburn matrices, a well-studied class of combinatorial objects. In a second step, we derive our irredundant forest enumeration to provide algorithms for tackling related problems: (i) enumeration of forests in their classical sense (where redundancy is allowed); (ii) the enumeration of “subforests” of a forest, and (iii) the frequent “subforest” mining problem. All the methods presented in this article enumerate each item uniquely, up to isomorphism.},

A k -coloring Π = { S 1 , S 2 , ⋯ , S k } Π={S1,S2,⋯,Sk} is said to be a (metric-)locating coloring, (an ML-coloring), if for every pair of distinct vertices u , v u,v , with same color, there exists a color class S j Sj such that d ( u , S j ) ≠ d ( v , S j ) d(u,Sj)≠d(v,Sj) . Minimum k for ML -coloring of a graph G , is called (metric-)locating chromatic number χ L ( G ) χL(G) of G .

In [1] the authors posed three conjectures and we study these conjectures. We show that, for each pair h , k h,k of integers with 3 ≤ h ≤ k 3≤h≤k , there exists a connected graph G such that χ L ( G ) = h χL(G)=h and χ N L ( G ) = k χNL(G)=k , which proves the first conjecture. If G and H are connected graphs, then χ N L ( G [ H ] ) ≤ χ N L ( G □ H ) χNL(G[H])≤χNL(G□H) , that disproves the second conjecture. Finally, we investigate for a family of graphs G , χ N L ( μ ( G ) ) = χ N L ( G ) + 1 χNL(μ(G))=χNL(G)+1 , where μ ( G ) μ(G) is the Mycielski graph of G , that proves the third conjecture for some families of graphs.},

This object models an attempt of the processes to agree on some common value, and precisely captures the cost of the fast path a process takes during a solo run. In this paper, we address the problem of implementing an adopt-commit object in the shared memory model in the minimal number of write operations. We consider that the number of processes ( n ), their identities ( c ), as well as the size of the input set ( m ) may all vary. Our first contribution is an algorithm that executes three write operations, a value we show optimal in the general case. We also prove that this number reduces to two when either m is known and bounded, or n identities are available. In the corner case where n = 2 n=2 , and either c = 2 c=2 or the input set is finite, a single write suffices. Further, we introduce Janus, an elegant adopt-commit implementation that executes O ( n ) O(n) shared memory operations, including O ( n ) O(n) writes. Building upon Janus, we explain how to design an adopt-commit object that executes O ( n − c + 1 ) O(n−c+1) write operations. We prove that this last value is tight when the number of registers in use is bounded and m is unknown.},

  abstract     = {Dragonfly networks have been widely used in the current High Performance Computing (HPC) computers due to lower global network diameter and other advantages of communication performance such as modularity and cost-effectiveness. The original definition of the dragonfly network was very loose on account of its uncertain and diversified global link arrangements. In this paper, we study the logical structure of the dragonfly network which can be treated as a compound graph of complete graphs. Firstly, we give the general definition of the dragonfly network, named D F ( n , h , g ) DF(n,h,g) , and the specific definition of the dragonfly network under the relative global link arrangement, named D ( n , h ) D(n,h) . Then, we prove that the connectivity of D ( n , h ) D(n,h) is n − 1 + h n−1+h . In the end, we propose an O ( n ) O(n) algorithm to give the disjoint path between any two distinct vertices in D ( n , h ) D(n,h) and analyze the maximum length of these disjoint paths which is no more than 7.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem on a grid based terrain where the movements of the robots are restricted only along the grid lines and only to a neighboring grid point in each step. The robots operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles under an asynchronous scheduler. They have no agreement in coordinate system and do not know the total number of robots in the team. We assume the luminous robots model where each robot is equipped with an externally visible light which can assume a constant number of predefined colors. These colors serve both as memory and as a form of communication. We give an algorithm that solves the problem from any initial configuration using 9 colors.},

In this paper, we introduce a charging planning problem for multiple chargers, namely Charging Energy Efficiency Maximization problem for Multi-Chargers in WRSNs (CEEM-MC Problem), and prove its NP-hardness. The problem aims to maximize the charging energy efficiency of the charging process by assigning the charging amount and planning the charging path. To balance the charging consumption among multiple chargers, we propose two algorithms which are different on the charging path planning , Ring-Wandering Algorithm and Eight-Wandering Algorithm.

The R g Rg -conditional diagnosability t R g ( G ) tRg(G) of a system G is a generalization of conditional diagnosability, which requires at least g fault-free neighbors for each node. In this paper, we explore the relationships between the non-inclusive g -good-neighbor diagnosability and the R g Rg -conditional diagnosability of G under the PMC and MM* models. We first show t N g ( G ) ≤ t R g ( G ) tNg(G)≤tRg(G) for g ≥ 1 g≥1 , and also give some conditions for equality. Next, we discuss the non-inclusive g -good-neighbor diagnosability of hypercubes , ( n , k ) (n,k) -star graphs and ( n , k ) (n,k) -bubble-sort graphs. We show that the non-inclusive g -good-neighbor diagnosability of n -dimensional hypercubes is less that its R g Rg -conditional diagnosability for 2 ≤ g ≤ n − 2 2 2≤g≤n−22 , and determine the non-inclusive g -good-neighbor diagnosability of ( n , k ) (n,k) -star graphs and ( n , k ) (n,k) -bubble-sort graphs.

The database uniquely defines a pure Horn function h , representing the functional dependencies . If the knowledge of the attribute values in set A determines the value for attribute v , then A → v A→v is an implicate of h . If K is a key of the database, then K → v K→v is an implicate of h for all attributes v . Keys of small sizes play a crucial role in various problems. We present structural and complexity results on the set of minimal keys of pure Horn functions. We characterize Sperner hypergraphs for which there is a unique pure Horn function with the given hypergraph as the set of minimal keys. Furthermore, we show that recognizing such hypergraphs is co- NP NP -complete already when every hyperedge has size two. On the positive side, we identify several classes of graphs for which the recognition problem can be decided in polynomial time . We also present an algorithm that generates the minimal keys of a pure Horn function with polynomial delay, improving on earlier results. By establishing a connection between keys and target sets, our approach can be used to generate all minimal target sets with polynomial delay when the thresholds are bounded by a constant. As a byproduct, our proof shows that the Minimum Key problem is at least as hard as the Minimum Target Set Selection problem with bounded thresholds.},

This conjecture is known to hold for d ∈ { 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 } d∈{5,6,7,8,9,10} . We refute this conjecture by showing that the picture is different for bigger alphabets. We prove that critical exponents of balanced sequences over an alphabet of size d ≥ 11 d≥11 are lower bounded by d − 1 d − 2 d−1d−2 and this bound is attained for all even numbers d ≥ 12 d≥12 . According to this result, we conjecture that the least critical exponent of a balanced sequence over d letters is d − 1 d − 2 d−1d−2 for all d ≥ 11 d≥11 .},

The present work offers the architecture of a cloud model for secure intellectual property protection of arithmetic expressions in a source code . The data obfuscation techniques are meant to be applied on different types of arithmetic operators in an arithmetic expression, “The required algorithms proposed in this paper are named as i) ‘Adaptive Number Generation’ obfuscation to be applied on all operators ii) Obfuscation by ‘Carry Padding’ to be applied on ‘+’ operator iii) Three Obfuscations by ‘Mixed Boolean Arithmetic’ to be applied on ‘+’, ‘-’ and ‘*’ operators and iv) ‘ A-RSA +′ obfuscation to be applied on ‘+’ operator.” Experimentations are conducted to validate their functionality and performance metrics measurements in terms of Cyclomatic complexity , Time complexity, Space complexity and Potency analysis are carried out on a set of benchmark source codes and it has been found that there is only a very slight increase of 6.57\% number of lines of code in the obfuscated codes compared to the corresponding original, the average increase in the obfuscated code&#39;s execution time is 29\% and the estimated average potency given by the proposed obfuscation techniques is 1.06\% which is also greater than one. Also, a mathematical model is developed to estimate the Mean Obfuscated Source Code Cloud Delay (MOSCD), which is the time duration in which the obfuscated source code is available physically at the cloud server to face any possible Man-At-The-End ( MATE ) attacks. An attacker may build a control flow graph (CFG) out of the source code to perform attacks based on static and dynamic analysis-based reverse engineering. The time required to generate a CFG is also estimated and in comparison, with the MOSCD, it is observed that the minimum CFG build time is almost three multiples of the maximum MOSCD value we received in our experimentations it is proved that our model is strong to thwart away any possible MATE attacks.},

However, while the quantum sample complexity of the problem has been studied, a full characterization of the classical sample complexity of HSP HSP seems to be absent, which will thus be the topic in this paper. HSP HSP over a finite group is defined as follows: For a finite group G and a finite set V , given a function f : G → V f:G→V and the promise that for any x , y ∈ G , f ( x ) = f ( x y ) x,y∈G,f(x)=f(xy) iff y ∈ H y∈H for a subgroup H ∈ H H∈H , where H H is a set of candidate subgroups of G , the goal is to identify H .

This paper studies the Hotelling game in fault-prone settings. Two fault models are studied: line faults and player faults. The first model assumes that the environment is prone to failure: with some probability , a disconnection occurs at a random point on the line, splitting it into two separate segments and modifying each player&#39;s Voronoi cell accordingly. A complete characterization of the Nash equilibria of this variant is provided for every n . Additionally, a one to one correspondence is shown between equilibria of this variant and of the Hotelling game with no faults. The second fault model assumes the players are prone to failure: each player is removed from the game with some probability , changing the payoffs of the remaining players accordingly. It is shown that for n ≥ 3 n≥3 this variant of the game has no Nash equilibria .},

  abstract     = {Consider the following natural variation of the degree realization problem. Let G=(V,E) be a simple undirected graph of order n . Let f∈R≥0n be a vector of vertex requirements , and let w∈R≥0n be a vector of provided services at the vertices. Then w satisfies f on G if the constraints ∑j∈N(i)wj=fi are satisfied for all i∈V , where N(i) denotes the neighbourhood of vector i . Given a requirements vector f , the Vertex-Weighted Graph Realization problem asks for a suitable graph G and a vector w of provided services that satisfy f on G . In this paper, we consider two avenues. We initiate a study that focuses on weighted realizations where the graph is required to be of a specific class by providing a full characterization of realizable requirement vectors for paths and acyclic graphs. However, checking the respective criteria is shown to be NP-hard. In the second part, we advance the study in general graphs which was started in [2] . For the unsolved cases, the question of whether a vector f is realizable can be formulated as whether its largest requirement lies within certain intervals. We describe several new, realizable intervals and show the existence of an interval that cannot be realized. The complete classification for general graphs is an open problem.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of treasure hunt in a graph by a mobile agent. The nodes in the graph are anonymous and the edges at any node v of degree d e g ( v ) deg(v) are labeled arbitrarily as 0 , 1 , … , d e g ( v ) − 1 0,1,…,deg(v)−1 . A mobile agent, starting from a node, must find a stationary object, called treasure that is located on an unknown node at a distance D from its initial position. The agent finds the treasure when it reaches the node where the treasure is present. The time of treasure hunt is defined as the number of edges the agent visits before it finds the treasure. The agent does not have any prior knowledge about the graph or the position of the treasure. An Oracle, that knows the graph, the initial position of the agent, and the position of the treasure, places some pebbles on the nodes, at most one per node, of the graph to guide the agent towards the treasure. We target to answer the question: what is the fastest possible treasure hunt algorithm regardless of the number of pebbles are placed? We show an algorithm that uses O ( D log ⁡ Δ ) O(Dlog⁡Δ) pebbles to find the treasure in a graph G in time O ( D log ⁡ Δ ) O(Dlog⁡Δ) , where Δ is the maximum degree of a node in G and D is the distance from the initial position of the agent to the treasure. We show a matching lower bound of Ω ( D log ⁡ Δ ) Ω(Dlog⁡Δ) on time of the treasure hunt using any number of pebbles.},

  abstract     = {As a measurement parameter of the reliability about interconnection networks of parallel and distributed systems , the h -extra edge-connectivity λ h ( G ) λh(G) is a better alternative compared with the classical Menger&#39;s theorem of the edge-connectivity. Recently, Li and Yang (2013) [7] determined the values of the h -extra edge-connectivity of hypercube Q n Qn for each h ≤ 2 ⌊ n 2 ⌋ h≤2⌊n2⌋ . Because of easy scalability, the interconnection networks based on cartesian product operation are extensively investigated. This paper focuses on the h -extra edge-connectivity of the n -th cartesian product of complete graph K 4 K4 with exponentially many faulty links. For a sufficiently large positive integer n , about 60 percent of positive integers h in the interval 1 ≤ h ≤ 2 ⋅ 4 n − 1 1≤h≤2⋅4n−1 corresponding h -extra edge-connectivity of K 4 n K4n , λ h ( K 4 n ) λh(K4n) , presents a concentration phenomenon, that is, these exact values of λ h ( K 4 n ) λh(K4n) concentrate on 3 ⋅ 4 n − 1 3⋅4n−1 and 4 n 4n for each ⌈ 3 ⋅ 4 n − 1 / 5 ⌉ ≤ h ≤ 4 n − 1 ⌈3⋅4n−1/5⌉≤h≤4n−1 and ⌈ 6 ⋅ 4 n − 1 / 5 ⌉ ≤ h ≤ 2 ⋅ 4 n − 1 ⌈6⋅4n−1/5⌉≤h≤2⋅4n−1 , respectively. And the lower and upper bounds of h are sharp. Furthermore, the values of λ h ( K 2 n ) λh(K2n) also have this phenomenon. We obtain λ h ( K 4 n ) = 3 2 λ h ( K 2 2 n ) = 3 ⋅ 4 n − 1 λh(K4n)=32λh(K22n)=3⋅4n−1 or λ h ( K 4 n ) = 2 λ h ( K 2 2 n ) = 4 n λh(K4n)=2λh(K22n)=4n in the subintervals where the concentration phenomenon occurs simultaneously.},

We analyse the average-case complexity of these algorithms and derive non-trivial time bounds. These are the first results on the average-case complexity of pattern matching with wildcards which provide a provable separation in time complexity between exact pattern matching and pattern matching with wildcards. We introduce the wc-period of a string which is the period of the binary mask x b xb where x b [ i ] = a xb[i]=a iff x [ i ] ≠ ϕ x[i]≠ϕ and b otherwise.

  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are a kind of wireless network, transmitting data utilizing the multi-hop radio relaying technique, and with no fixed infrastructure. WSN has the ability to function as network host for transmission and reception of data. The unique characteristics of WSN include distributed routing; frequent path breaks due to mobility, packet switching, and self-organization. The energy restriction is an important aspect to consider while designing a sensor network in order to increase the network&#39;s survivability. Clustering is an essential approach for overcoming energy limits and increasing network longevity. In the LEACH-technique, simulated annealing optimization is employed to generate the optimal cluster construction. This approach consumes more energy in order to build the best clustering, and the sensor nodes quickly lose energy, reducing the network&#39;s survivability. So, Neuro Fuzzy-Clonal Selection Optimization (NF-CSO) model is constructed for minimizing the energy consumption, to identify the optimal position for multi-sink placement and to improve the network survivability. Initially Clonal Selection (CSO) algorithm does the task of determining the optimal position for placing the multi-sink and the Neuro Fuzzy algorithm were utilized to determine the best cluster head, resulting in less energy usage and an increase in network survivability. WSN&#39;s energy consumption has been decreased by about 58\%, and the network life cycle has been increased by 65\% compared to LEACH. The network simulator is used to implement the existing and proposed techniques. From the simulation analysis, it has been proven that the proposed NF- CSO algorithm performs better in selecting the optimal position of the multi-sink, and also reduces the energy consumption and increases network survivability. The proposed approach outperforms the existing LEACH, PSO and BFO techniques.},

Motivated by the same applications, the current paper studies the problem of scheduling multiple two-stage flowshops with a deadline, with the objective of maximizing the profit of the jobs that can be completed by the deadline. Algorithms and complexity of the problem are investigated. For the case where the number of two-stage flowshops is part of the input, we present an efficient approximation algorithm with a constant ratio. The approximation ratio is improved via a study of the relationship between the problem and the multiple knapsack problem, combined with the recent progresses in the research in approximation algorithms for the multiple knapsack problem. By integrating techniques in the study of the classical Knapsack problem and the classical Makespan problem on multiple processors, plus additional new techniques, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a further improved approximation ratio is developed for the case where the number of flowshops is a fixed constant.},

Bezáková and Searns [ISAAC 2018] give an oracle which, given u and v in a planar graph , answers ns ( u , v ) ns(u,v) in O ( n ) O(n) time and O ( n 1.5 ) O(n1.5) memory space. Applying this oracle directly, it takes O ( n ) O(n) time to answer whether there is a unique shortest path from u to v . We propose an oracle which answers ns ( u , v ) ns(u,v) in O ( n ) O(n) time and O ( n 1.5 ) O(n1.5) space. Our oracle answers whether there is a unique shortest path from u to v in O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) time. Computational studies show that our oracle is faster than the oracle of Bezáková and Searns for large graphs. A key technique to speed up the query time of our oracle is applying Voronoi diagrams on planar graphs, an advanced data structure widely used in shortest distance oracles. Based on Voronoi diagrams on planar graphs, significant theoretical improvements have been made for distance oracles. Our studies confirm that Voronoi diagrams are efficient data structures for distance oracles in practice.},

Most of the related work on viral marketing focuses on the spread of single information, while a product may associate with multiple attributes in real life. Information about multiple attributes of a product propagates in the social networks simultaneously and independently. The attribute information that a user receives will determine whether he would purchase the product or not. We extend the traditional single information influence maximization problem to the multi-attribute based influence maximization problem. We also present the Multi-dimensional IC model (MIC model) for the proposed problem, then formulate the problem as the Multi-attribute based Influence Maximization Problem (MIMP).

  abstract     = {In the article we propose a novel version of the hidden logarithm problem (HLP), the peculiarity of which is using the local units instead of the global unit in the HLP proposed earlier for designing post-quantum signature schemes. Two different 4-dimensional finite associative algebras with non-commutative multiplication operation are proposed as carriers of the introduced version of the HLP. One of the proposed algebras contains the global two-sided unit. The second algebra contains only local units (single-sided and two-sided ones). In the first algebra, every non-invertible element, which is not a zero-divisor, defines many local single-sided (the right-sided and the left-sided) and many local two-sided units. The both types of the single-sided units play an important role for defining the HLP of the proposed version. Formulas describing the local units of different types are derived and used to generate the public key of a developed HLP-based signature algorithm that is resistant to quantum attacks. Design criterion and security discussion of the introduced signature scheme are presented.},

  abstract     = {Stability is an important issue in order to characterize the performance of a network, and it has become a major topic of study in the last decade. Roughly speaking, a communication network system is said to be stable if the number of packets waiting to be delivered (backlog) is finitely bounded at any one time. In this paper we introduce a number of routing scheduling algorithms which, making use of certain knowledge about the network&#39;s structure, guarantee stability for certain injection rates . First, we introduce two new families of combinatorial structures , which we call universally strong selectors and generalized universally strong selectors , that are used to provide a set of transmission schedules. Making use of these structures, we propose two local-knowledge packet-oblivious routing scheduling algorithms. The first proposed routing scheduling algorithm only needs to know some upper bounds on the number of links and on the network&#39;s degree, and is asymptotically optimal regarding the injection rate for which stability is guaranteed. The second proposed routing scheduling algorithm is close to be asymptotically optimal, but it only needs to know an upper bound on the number of links. For such algorithms, we also provide some results regarding both the maximum latencies and queue lengths. Furthermore, we also evaluate how the lack of global knowledge about the system topology affects the performance of the routing scheduling algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Several fault tolerant models have been investigated in order to study the fault-tolerance properties of self-diagnosable interconnection networks, which are often represented with a connected graph G . In particular, a g-extra cut of a non-complete graph G , g ≥ 0 G,g≥0 , is a set of vertices in G whose removal disconnects the graph, but every component in the survival graph contains at least g + 1 g+1 vertices. The g -extra diagnosability of G then refers to the maximum number of faulty vertices in G that can be identified when considering these g -extra faulty sets only. Enhanced hypercubes, denoted by Q n , k , n ≥ 3 , k ∈ [ 1 , n ] Qn,k,n≥3,k∈[1,n] , is another variant of the hypercube structure.

  abstract     = {Catalytic P systems and purely catalytic P systems are among the first variants of membrane systems ever considered in this area. These variants of systems also feature some prominent computational complexity questions, and in particular the problem if only one catalyst in catalytic P systems and two catalysts in purely catalytic P systems are enough to allow for generating all recursively enumerable sets of multisets. Several additional ingredients have been shown to be sufficient for obtaining such results. Previously, we could show that using the derivation mode m a x o b j e c t s maxobjects , where we only take those multisets of rules which affect the maximal number of objects in the underlying configuration, one catalyst is sufficient for obtaining computational completeness without any other ingredients in catalytic P systems. In this paper we investigate the question whether we can obtain a similar result for purely catalytic P systems, i.e., we show that two catalysts in purely catalytic P systems are enough to allow for generating all recursively enumerable sets of multisets when using specific variants of the maximally parallel derivation mode: we take only those applicable multisets of rules which (i) generate the maximal number of objects, or (ii) yield the maximal difference in the number of objects between the newly generated configuration and the current configuration. In addition, we also consider non-extendable multisets of rules which (i) generate the minimal number of objects, or (ii) yield the minimal difference in the number of objects between the newly generated configuration and the current configuration. In all cases, we have also shown that register machines with n decrementable registers can be simulated by simple purely catalytic P systems working in any of these derivation modes using only n catalysts. Hence, simple purely catalytic P systems working in any of these derivation modes are computationally complete.},

However, these semantics fail to effectively specify the distinct properties of reversible languages at the metalevel, even including the central question of whether the defined language is reversible. In this paper, we build a metalanguage foundation for reversible languages from categorical principles, based on the category of sets and partial injective functions. We exemplify our approach by a step-by-step development of the full semantics of an r-Turing complete reversible while-language with recursive procedures. The use of the metalanguage leads to a formalization of the reversible semantics. A language defined in the metalanguage is guaranteed to have reversibility and inverse semantics. Also, program inverters for this language are obtained for free. We further discuss applications and directions for reversible semantics.},

  abstract     = {Maximal identifiability was recently introduced in boolean network tomography to measure the maximal number of corrupted nodes which can be uniquely localized in sets of end-to-end measurement paths on networks ( [1] , [2] ). We contribute to the study of maximal identifiability proving upper and lower bounds on this measure for sets of end-to-end paths defined on different network topologies . First we show some results relating maximal identifiability to structural graph measures like the minimal degree or the number of nodes of the network connected to external monitors. For trees we show that the maximal identifiability is upper bounded by 1. We define a property ( monitor balanced ) on the monitor placement (that is deciding what nodes in the graph to link to external monitors) which guarantees on trees a maximal identifiability of 1. We also describe a strategy using a minimal number of monitors to always define a monitor-balanced placement. In search for topologies better than trees from the point of view of failure identifiability we consider the case of grids. We prove that choosing any 4 nodes to link to monitors, maximal identifiability on 2-dimensional grids is at least 1 and at most 2. Moreover we prove that this result is optimal, namely that using less than 8 monitors we cannot always reach an identifiability of 2. We also consider the case of directed and acyclic graph. For directed 2-dimensional grids we define a monitor placement on 4 ( k − 1 ) 4(k−1) nodes obtaining that maximal identifiability is exactly 2. We show that this monitor placement is unique and optimal. Finally we explore how maximal identifiability grows under order-isomorphisms, that is bijective embeddings of directed graphs . Using these results we prove that under the operation of transitive closure maximal identifiability grows linearly.},

In this paper, we explore the fragile complexity of algorithms adaptive to various restrictions on the input, i.e., algorithms with a fragile complexity parameterized by a quantity other than the input size n . We show that searching for the predecessor in a sorted array has fragile complexity Θ ( log ⁡ k ) Θ(log⁡k) , where k is the rank of the query element, both in a randomized and a deterministic setting. For predecessor searches, we also show how to optimally reduce the amortized fragile complexity of the elements in the array. We also prove the following results: Selecting the k th smallest element has expected fragile complexity O ( log ⁡ log ⁡ k ) O(log⁡log⁡k) for the element selected. Deterministically finding the minimum element has fragile complexity Θ ( log ⁡ ( Inv ) ) Θ(log⁡(Inv)) and Θ ( log ⁡ ( Runs ) ) Θ(log⁡(Runs)) , where Inv is the number of inversions in a sequence and Runs is the number of increasing runs in a sequence. Deterministically finding the median has fragile complexity O ( log ⁡ ( Runs ) + log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡(Runs)+log⁡log⁡n) and Θ ( log ⁡ ( Inv ) ) Θ(log⁡(Inv)) .

The partial representation extension problem for rectangular duals asks whether a given partial rectangular dual can be extended to a rectangular dual, that is, whether there exists a rectangular dual where some vertices are represented by prescribed rectangles. The simultaneous representation problem for rectangular duals asks whether two (or more) given graphs that share a subgraph admit rectangular duals that coincide on the shared subgraph. Combinatorially, a rectangular dual can be described by a regular edge labeling (REL), which determines the orientations of the rectangle contacts. We describe linear-time algorithms for the partial representation extension problem and the simultaneous representation problem for rectangular duals when each input graph is given together with a REL. Both algorithms are based on formulations as linear programs , yet they have geometric interpretations and can be seen as extensions of the classic algorithm by Kant and He that computes a rectangular dual for a given graph.},

In such a system, clients request for a ride from an origin station to a destination station, and a fleet of capacitated vehicles must satisfy all requests. The goal is to minimize the number of pick-up/drop-off operations. In this paper we focus on a constrained unitary variant, called Unit Stop Number Problem, where each client requests for a single seat in the vehicles. This variant was recently conjectured to be NP-Hard. In this regard, we show how this problem relates to other problems known in the literature in order to derive some polynomial-time solvable variants. Moreover, we provide a positive answer to the conjecture by showing that the problem is NP-Hard for any fixed capacity greater than or equal to 2, even for the case where the graph of requests is restricted to the class of planar bipartite graphs . Our proof of NP-Hardness also improves the complexity results known in the literature for the related problems identified.},

  abstract     = {In the Group Testing problem, the objective is to learn a subset K of some much larger domain N , using the shortest-possible sequence of queries Q . A feedback to a query provides some information about the intersection between the query and subset K . Several specific feedbacks have been studied in the literature, often proving different formulas for the estimate of the query complexity of the problem, defined as the shortest length of queries&#39; sequence solving Group Testing problem with specific feedback. In this paper we study what are the properties of the feedback that influence the query complexity of Group Testing and what is their measurable impact. We propose a generic framework that covers a vast majority of relevant settings considered in the literature, which depends on two fundamental parameters of the feedback: input capacity α and output expressiveness β . They upper bound the logarithm of the size of the feedback function domain and image, respectively. To justify the value of the framework, we prove upper bounds on query complexity of non-adaptive, deterministic Group Testing under some “efficient” feedbacks, for minimum, maximum and general expressiveness, and complement them with a lower bound on all feedbacks with given parameters α , β . Our upper bounds also hold if the feedback function could get an input twisted by a malicious adversary , in case the intersection of a query and the hidden set is bigger than the feedback capacity α . We also show that slight change in the feedback function may result in substantial worsening of the query complexity. Additionally, we analyze explicitly constructed randomized counterparts of the deterministic results. Our results provide some insights to what are the most useful bits of information an output-restricted feedback could provide, and open a number of challenging research directions.},

We are particularly interested in examining how much information about future requests a central authority needs in order to compute an optimal solution or a solution of some given quality; we quantify this information by studying the advice complexity of the problem. Our results show that, without additional information, the central authority cannot perform satisfactorily well, and we establish a lower bound linear in | E | |E| for the number of advice bits needed for near-optimal solutions, where | E | |E| denotes the number of edges in the grid. Furthermore, concerning optimality , we are able to prove nearly tight bounds of at least 0.94 | E | 0.94|E| and at most 3 | E | 3|E| advice bits.

Although the studies in this direction are successful, we still need a systematic way for further investigations because the graphs of bounded vertex cover number form a rather small subclass of graphs of bounded treedepth. To fill this gap, we use another graph parameter, vertex integrity, which is placed between the two parameters mentioned above. For several graph problems, we generalize fixed-parameter tractability results parameterized by vertex cover number to the ones parameterized by vertex integrity.

  abstract     = {When there is no constraint on the length, efficient algorithms are known for the minmax regret path center, path median, and path centdian problems on trees. In a recent review on location problems, these problems with length constraint were considered as open. The focus of this paper is the minmax regret path center problem with length constraint on a tree. Efficient algorithms are presented for both the continuous and discrete models, which require, respectively, O ( n lg 2 n nlg2n ) and O ( n lg n nlgn ) time. Our algorithms are based on an approach introduced by Averbakh and Berman for solving the minmax regret p -center problem. To apply their approach, we give a sufficient condition under which the approach works. This result is of independent interest. According to the condition, polynomial algorithms are obtained immediately for the minmax regret versions of many other center location problems, for which no algorithms were known before.},

  abstract     = {Online social network has deeply changed our lives, such as the style of communication and business, and hence promotes a lot of researches in social influence. The prior works in social influence mainly consider the influence from the view of individuals. However, in many cases, influencing the most of members of an important group such as the board of directors in a company can bring bigger profit than directly influencing the individuals of the company. We call such high profit group which obeys the vote rule as an union, different from existed targeted influence model, we consider such scenarios to make union acceptable and propose the union acceptable profit problem (UAPM) to choose seeds to maximize the union-acceptable profit, i.e., maximize the probability of the union being acceptable. The objective of profit in UAPM is #P-hard, and not submodularity or supmodularity. To solve the problem, we propose an efficient estimation method for the objective and design a heuristic algorithm and further a data-driven β ( 1 − 1 ϵ ) β(1−1ϵ) -approximation algorithm where β is the data-driven parameter which is related to the input data. At last we evaluate the performance of the algorithms we proposed on effectiveness and efficiency by the experiments in real-world social network datasets.},

We explore two fault-tolerant variants of locating-dominating sets, namely redundant locating-dominating (RED:LD) and error-correcting locating-dominating (ERR:LD) sets. The problems of determining the minimum cardinality of RED:LD and ERR:LD sets in arbitrary graphs are known to be NP-complete.

The NAE 3-SAT and 1-in-3-SAT are two variants of 3-SAT that remain NP-complete even when they are positive. The positive 1-in-3-SAT problem remains NP-complete under planarity constraint, but planar NAE 3-SAT is solvable in O ( n 1.5 log ⁡ n ) O(n1.5log⁡n) time, where n is the number of vertices. In this paper we prove that a positive planar NAE 3-SAT is always satisfiable when the underlying SAT graph is 3-connected, and a satisfiable assignment can be obtained in linear time. We also show that without 3-connectivity constraint, existence of a linear-time algorithm for positive planar NAE 3-SAT problem is unlikely as it would imply a linear-time algorithm for finding a spanning 2-matching in a planar subcubic graph. We then prove that positive planar 1-in-3-SAT remains NP-complete under the 3-connectivity constraint, even when each variable appears in at most 4 clauses.

This measure is based on the evolutionary distance among the species in the collection. Loosely speaking, if T T is a rooted phylogenetic tree whose leaf set X represents a set of species and whose edges have real-valued lengths (weights), then the PD score of a subset S of X is the sum of the weights of the edges of the minimal subtree of T T connecting the species in S . In this paper, we define several natural variants of the PD score for a subset of taxa which are related by a known rooted phylogenetic network. Under these variants, we explore, for a positive integer k , the computational complexity of determining the maximum PD score over all subsets of taxa of size k when the input is restricted to different classes of rooted phylogenetic networks.},

  abstract     = {Sorting permutations by block moves is a fundamental combinatorial problem in genome rearrangements. The classic block move operation is called transposition , which switches two adjacent blocks, or equivalently, moves a block to some other position. But large blocks movement rarely occurs during real evolutionary events. A natural restriction of transposition is to bound the length of the blocks to be switched. In this paper, we investigate the problem called sorting by bounded singleton moves, where one of the switched blocks is exactly a singleton while the other is of length at most c . This problem generalizes the sorting by short block moves problem proposed by Heath and Vergara [11] , which requires the total length of blocks switched bounded by 3. When c = 3 c=3 , we devise a 9 5 95 -approximation algorithm for an arbitrary permutation, and a 12 7 127 -approximation algorithm for a woven double-strip permutation. Our algorithms can be slightly extended to solve the sorting by c -bounded singleton moves problem for any constant c ≥ 3 c≥3 , guaranteeing an approximation factor of 3 c 5 3c5 and 4 c 7 4c7 for arbitrary permutations and woven double-strip permutations respectively, just by exploiting a new lower bound of sorting by c -bounded singleton moves.},

  abstract     = {Holant problems provide a novel framework to study the complexity of counting problems. It is a refinement to counting constraint satisfaction problems (#CSP) with a more explicit role for the constraint functions. Both graph homomorphisms and #CSP can be viewed as special cases of Holant problems. For approximation algorithms on Holant problems, the attention is focused on proving zero-freeness of the partition functions and establishing fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS) using the Taylor expansion method. In this paper, we study the Holant problems defined by a real constraint function satisfying a generalized second-order recurrence. We present fully polynomial-time (deterministic or randomized) approximation schemes for the Holant problems except for a couple of cases. Our algorithms are established in two ways: 1) we construct holographic transformations from the Holant problems to the Ising model, and obtain the algorithms using the approaches with respect to the Ising model; 2) we prove the zero-freeness of the Holant problems, and present an algorithm based on the Taylor expansion method. In addition, for most of the other cases, there exist approximation-preserving reductions between the Holant problems and the problem of counting perfect matchings , which is a central open problem in approximate counting.},

Our algorithm supports the all three operations in constant worst-case time, that is, it runs in-place using at most constant number of words O ( w ) O(w) bits during each operation. The time and space complexities are optimal since it was already proven that there is no implementation of an initializable array with no extra bit supporting all the operations in constant worst-case time (Hagerup and Kammer, 2017 [12] ). Our algorithm significantly improves upon the best algorithm presented in the earlier studies (Navarro, 2014 [5] ) which uses N + o ( N ) N+o(N) extra bits to support all the operations in constant worst-case time.},

  abstract     = {For some k &gt; 0 k&amp;gt;0 , the k-circle formation problem asks a swarm of autonomous mobile robots to form disjoint circles. Each such circle is restricted to be centered at one of the pre-fixed points given in the plane. Each circle must contain exactly k robots at distinct positions. The k-circle formation problem has already been studied under one axis agreement. In this work, the robots are assumed to be completely disoriented, i.e., they neither have any agreement on a global coordinate system nor have any agreement on a common chirality. The robots are identical, anonymous, oblivious, and homogeneous. They operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles under a fair asynchronous scheduler. In this setting, all the initial configurations and values of k for which the k-circle formation problem is deterministically unsolvable have been characterized. A deterministic distributed algorithm has been proposed that deterministically solves the k-circle formation problem for the remaining configurations and values of k .},

  abstract     = {In recent years, data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become increasingly massive. The amount of data stored in the cloud is also enormous and needs to be processed in a timely, efficient, secure, and private manner. While data stored on the cloud is guaranteed to be available, this does not mean that the secrecy and privacy of the sender are guaranteed. Moreover, sharing data on the cloud may sometimes lead to unpleasant surprises, such as undeniable disputes due to the shared content. Our certificateless signcryption (CLSC) scheme is proposed to address the above issues. It provides unforgeability, indistinguishability , non-transferability, and privacy of sender identity to ensure secrecy and privacy of the sender. Our contributions are not only limited to solving the aforementioned issues. The security model of non-transferability and privacy of sender identity for the signcryption scheme is first proposed. This is followed by a concrete simulation of the proof. In addition, our CLSC scheme does not use bilinear pairing , which is significantly lowers its computational cost and makes it suitable for IoT devices in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).},

The public-key cryptography under MP-LWE assumption gets an equilibrium between “efficiency” and “security”. However, the hardness of MP-LWE has not been sufficiently explored since its introduction. So in this paper, we focus on the hardness of MP-LWE . By the axiomatic method , we first investigate the essential attributes about the middle product in MP-LWE . Then we present the formal definition of universal product and the corresponding universal product learning with errors problem ( UP-LWE ). In this sense, MP-LWE can be viewed as an instance of UP-LWE . Then we proved that for more polynomials than those have been proved in the literature, PLWE ( f ) PLWE(f) can be reduced to MP-LWE . In other words, we improve the result about the hardness of MP-LWE . Furthermore, we define the asymmetric middle product which can be viewed as a construction of universal product. The corresponding UP-LWE is discussed. It provides much more flexible parameter setting than MP-LWE .},

They studied parameterized complexity of Resolute Control for voting rules Borda (both addition and deletion), Maximin (addition), and Copeland (both addition and deletion). They primarily consider | J | |J| as parameter. In this paper we study Resolute Control parameterized by the other natural parameters viz., the number of candidates added or deleted. We show that the Resolute Control for Borda (both addition and deletion), Maximin (addition) and Copeland (deletion) are W[2]-hard . We complement this by showing that when the number of voters is odd, Copeland (deletion) is FPT parameterized by the sum of the number of deleted candidates and the size of the feedback arc set of the majority graph of the election.},

  abstract     = {Hard counting problems with easy decision version, like computing the permanent and counting independent sets, are of particular importance in counting complexity theory. TotP is the class of all self-reducible problems in #P with decision version in P . It has been a long standing open question to determine TotP -complete problems under strong reductions that preserve exactly the values of the functions (Karp), since Cook reductions blur structural differences between counting classes, specifically under Cook reductions TotP -complete problems are also #P -complete. In this paper we present the first such problems and we show some implications of these results to counting complexity. The problems that we prove to be TotP -complete under Karp reductions are: (a) #Tree-Monotone-Circuit-SAT , which further implies that it is hard to compute, both exactly and approximately, the number of satisfying assignments of monotone circuits, where the monotonicity is defined by a partial order which is given as part of the input. (b) Max-Lower-Set-Size , which implies that given a poset it is hard to compute and approximate the size of a principal upper set, and the size of the maximum lower set all elements of which share a given property P. (c) Size-of-Subtree , which directly implies that every problem in TotP admits a polynomial-time approximation algorithm the error of which depends on the amount of imbalance of the respective self-reducibility tree of the problem. We settle the worst case complexity of this problem, we provide a family of instances that are hard to approximate, and we show exponential time hardness results under variants of the exponential time hypothesis (ETH). (d) #Clustered-Monotone-SAT , which implies that approximating #SAT remains hard even on instances for which some kind of navigation among solutions is possible. Thus we narrow down any further research regarding the polynomial-time approximability of #SAT to instances with the aforementioned property. Among other implications, our results show that all these problems do not admit an FPRAS, unless NP=RP , something that we would not be able to conclude by showing them to be TotP -complete under Cook reductions. 1},

For considering system-level diagnosis, Lian and Zhou proposed the ( f 1 , f 2 ) (f1,f2) -BPMC model which is a novel testing model and is the generalization of the PMC model and the BGM model. For measuring the fault diagnosis capability of a multiprocessor system with faulty links, Zhu et al.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the problems of finding minimum stopping sets and trapping sets in Tanner graphs, using integer linear programming . These problems are important for establishing reliable communication across noisy channels. Indeed, stopping sets and trapping sets correspond to combinatorial structures in information-theoretic codes, which lead to errors in decoding once a message is received. In particular, these sets correspond to variables that are not eventually corrected by the decoder, thus causing failures in decoding when using iterative algorithms . We present integer linear programs (ILPs) for finding stopping sets and several trapping set variants. Furthermore, we prove that two of these trapping set problem variants are NP-hard for the first time. Additionally, we analyze these variants from the parameterized perspective. Finally, we model stopping set and trapping set problems as Integer Linear Programs (ILPs). The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by finding stopping sets of size up to 48 in the ( 4896 , 2474 ) (4896,2474) Margulis code. This compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art, which finds stopping sets of size up to 26. For the trapping set problems, we show for which cases an ILP produces solutions efficiently and for which cases it performs poorly. The proposed approach is applicable to codes represented by regular and irregular graphs alike. 1},

  abstract     = {Inner product functional encryption (IPFE) is a primitive which produces, from a master secret key , decryption keys sk k skk associated to vectors k over some specified base ring. Decrypting an encryption of vector m with sk k skk only reveals 〈 k , m 〉 〈k,m〉 . Benhamouda et al. [7] provided a generic construction for CCA-secure IPFE from projective hash functions (PHFs), unfortunately their security reduction suffers an exponential loss. Their only instantiation capable of decrypting inner products of large sizes, which relies on the decisional composite residuosity ( DCR DCR ) assumption, is impractical due to the large size of ciphertexts , decryption keys, and the prohibitive speed of the scheme. Our core contribution is a new approach to proving CCA security. Our constructions maintain the genericity of [7] , while our security proof relaxes the requirements on the underlying PHFs and gains in reduction tightness. We instantiate these constructions from the DCR DCR assumption, an assumption in class groups ( HS M CL HSMCL ) and the decision Diffie Hellman ( DDH DDH ) assumption. Our CCA-secure constructions from DCR DCR and HS M CL HSMCL are the first such schemes to efficiently decrypt inner products of large size, improving by multiple orders of magnitude upon the work of [7] . A single-core C implementation of these schemes shows that, for a 112 bit security, and 100-dimensional vectors, their DCR DCR -based scheme takes 1 h 20 min to encrypt, and over 5 min to decrypt, whereas our slowest scheme takes 5.2 s to encrypt and 0.5 s to decrypt. Similarly a ciphertext for their scheme is of 283 MB; those of our HS M CL HSMCL -based scheme are of 30 kB.},

This problem is known to be NP-hard, hence we study ( 1 − δ ) (1−δ) -approximation algorithms. The previous Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for this problem, due to Chen and Har-Peled (2008), runs in time n O ( d d / δ ) 2 ( d / δ ) O ( d ) nO(dd/δ)2(d/δ)O(d) , and improving on this time bound was left as an open problem. Our main contribution is a PTAS with a significantly improved time complexity of n O ( 1 / δ ) 2 ( d / δ ) O ( d ) nO(1/δ)2(d/δ)O(d) . A known technique for approximating the orienteering problem is to reduce it to solving 1 / δ 1/δ correlated instances of rooted k -TSP (a k -TSP tour is one that visits at least k points). However, the k -TSP tours in this reduction must achieve a certain excess guarantee (namely, their length can surpass the optimum length only in proportion to a parameter of the optimum called excess) that is stronger than the usual ( 1 + δ ) (1+δ) -approximation. Our main technical contribution is to improve the running time of these k -TSP variants, particularly in its dependence on the dimension d . Indeed, our running time is polynomial even for a moderately large dimension, roughly up to d = O ( log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) d=O(log⁡log⁡n) instead of d = O ( 1 ) d=O(1) .},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, wildfires have become wider and more destructive. Climate change and the growth of urban areas are among the main factors that increase the risk of large-scale fires. This risk can be lowered with preventive measures. Among them, firefighting lines are used to stop the fire spread and to offer a safe corridor where firefighting resources can be deployed. Due to their high cost of installation and maintenance, the placement of these lines must be carefully planned. In this work, we address this problem from a theoretical perspective. The land is modeled by a mixed graph in which vertices represent areas subject to burn while edges model the possibility of fire spreading from one area to another. Vertices are associated with probabilities of ignition and edges with probabilities of spread. We consider the problem of positioning firefighting lines such that the risk is reduced under a budget constraint. We call this problem Firebreak Location . We study its complexity and prove in particular its NP-hardness even when the graph is planar, bipartite, with a maximum degree four and the probabilities of propagation are equal to one. Planarity and low degree are indeed natural properties of real instances. We also show an efficient polynomial time algorithm for particular instances on trees.},

  abstract     = {A two-party coin-flipping protocol is ε -fair if no efficient adversary can bias the output of the honest party (who always outputs a bit, even if the other party aborts) by more than ε . Cleve [STOC &#39;86] showed that r -round o ( 1 / r ) o(1/r) -fair coin-flipping protocols do not exist. Awerbuch, Blum, Chor, Goldwasser, and Micali [Manuscript &#39;85] constructed a Θ ( 1 / r ) Θ(1/r) -fair coin-flipping protocol, assuming the existence of one-way functions. Moran, Naor, and Segev [Journal of Cryptology &#39;16] constructed an r -round coin-flipping protocol that is Θ ( 1 / r ) Θ(1/r) -fair (thus matching the aforementioned lower bound of Cleve [STOC &#39;86]), assuming the existence of oblivious transfer. The above gives rise to the intriguing question of whether oblivious transfer, or more generally “public-key primitives,” is required for an o ( 1 / r ) o(1/r) -fair coin-flipping protocol. Towards answering this intriguing question, Maji and Wang [Crypto &#39;18] have recently showed that in the random oracle model (ROM) , any coin-flipping protocol can be biased by Ω ( 1 / r ) Ω(1/r) . This implies that o ( 1 / r ) o(1/r) -fair coin-flipping protocol cannot be constructed from one-way function, or from a family of collision-resistant hash functions , in a black-box way. This result does not rule out, however, non black-box constructions, and black-box constructions based on primitives that cannot be realized in the ROM. We make a different progress towards answering above question by showing that, for any constant r ∈ N r∈N , the existence of an 1 / ( c ⋅ r ) 1/(c⋅r) -fair, r -round coin-flipping protocol implies the existence of an infinitely-often key-agreement protocol, where c denotes some universal constant (independent of r ). Our reduction is non black-box and makes a novel use of the recent dichotomy for two-party protocols of Haitner, Nissim, Omri, Shaltiel, and Silbak [SICOMP &#39;20] to facilitate a two-party variant of the recent attack of Beimel, Haitner, Makriyannis, and Omri [FOCS &#39;18] on multi-party coin-flipping protocols.},

If L is a set of four-vertex graphs, then the complexity of VERTEX COLORING for L -free graphs is known with three exceptions: L 1 L1 = {claw, 4 K 1 4K1 }, L 2 L2 = {claw, 4 K 1 4K1 , co-diamond}, and L 3 L3 = { 4 K 1 4K1 , C 4 C4 }. In this paper, we study a problem arising from the class L 3 L3 . A hole is an induced cycle with at least four vertices. A hole-twin is the graph obtained from a hole by adding a vertex that forms true twins with some vertex of the hole. A 5-wheel is the graph obtained from a C 5 C5 by adding a vertex that is adjacent to all vertices of the C 5 C5 . We prove that a ( 4 K 1 4K1 , hole-twin, 5-wheel)-free graph is perfect or has bounded clique width. As consequence we obtain a polynomial time algorithm for VERTEX COLORING for ( 4 K 1 4K1 , hole-twin, 5-wheel)-free graphs.},

The job can only be processed by the machine that is in calibrated status. Given a set of jobs arriving online, each of the jobs is characterized by a release time, a processing time, and a deadline. We assume that there is an infinite number of machines for usage. The objective is to minimize the total number of calibrations while feasibly scheduling all jobs. For the case that all jobs have unit processing times, we propose an O ( λ ) O(λ) -competitive algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal. When λ = 0 λ=0 , the problem is degraded to rent minimization, where our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of 3 e + 7 ( ≈ 15.16 ) 3e+7(≈15.16) which improves upon the previous results for such problems.},

It builds upon asynchronous message-passing (liberating senders from waiting) and unique message-routing (using unique Actor addresses), which enables relatively simple distributed implementations. The Actor model shares these principles with the model of computation underlying JoCaml, which supports the distributed implementation of OCaml components. In this paper, we support the distributability of the two models on theoretical grounds. For this, we investigate three refined variants of the π -calculus that can be understood as the essence of the two models. We show that neither of the three calculi is able to express a synchronization pattern that is known from the world of Petri nets and that was used by us as one criterion in a distributability hierarchy of process calculi. Moreover, we exhibit three encodings between the three calculi and prove that they each preserve the degree of distributability between source and target terms.},

We solve the first problem by defining a notion of SL-information systems. This is a special case of the continuous information systems. We also discuss the morphism part of SL-information systems, which corresponds to Scott-continuous functions between continuous semi-lattices.

Programming language researchers have invested much efforts to invent new frameworks and paradigms, to aid the development of complex bidirectional transformations. However, these frameworks are not always applicable due to certain subtleties in the problem specification; some bidirectional programs become too complicated and unstructured to verify their correctness, not to mention their poor efficiency. In this paper, we propose a collection of generic recursion patterns for bidirectional transformations, and develop corresponding calculation laws. With these generic recursion patterns, we can develop structured bidirectional transformations, which are easy to understand and maintain. With these calculation laws, we can effectively optimize bidirectional programs, while preserving its very semantics. We demonstrate, through calculation of bidirectional transformations on trees, the expressiveness of the combinators and the effectiveness of the calculation laws.},

Typically, the properties are specified by quantum computation tree logic (QCTL), in which reachability analysis plays a central role. However, safety as the dual problem is known little. Motivated by this, we propose a more expressive logic — QCTL + (QCTL plus), which extends QCTL by allowing the conjunction in path formulas and the negation in the top level of path formulas. The former can be adopted to express conditional events, and the latter can express safety. To deal with conjunction, we present a product construction of classical states in the QMC and the tri-valued truths of atomic path formulas; to deal with negation, we develop an algebraic approach to compute the safety of the bottom strongly connected component subspaces with respect to a super-operator under some necessary and sufficient convergence conditions. Thereby we conditionally decide QCTL + formulas over QMCs; without the convergence conditions the safety problem still remains open. The complexity of our method is provided in terms of the size of both the input QMC and the QCTL + formula.},

  abstract     = {GPUs are an important part of any High Performance Computing (HPC) architecture. To make optimal use of the specifics of a GPU architecture, we need programming models that naturally support the parallel execution model of a GPU. CUDA and OpenCL are two widely used examples of such programming models. Furthermore, we also need to redesign algorithms such that they adhere to this parallel programming model , and we need to be able to prove the correctness of these redesigned algorithms. In this paper we study two examples of such parallelized algorithms, and we discuss how to prove their correctness (data race freedom and (partial) functional correctness) using the VerCors program verifier. First of all, we prove the correctness of two parallel algorithms solving the prefix sum problem. Second, we show how such a prefix sum algorithm is used as a basic block in a stream compaction algorithm, and we prove correctness of this stream compaction algorithm, taking advantage of the earlier correctness proof for the prefix sum algorithm. The proofs as described in this paper are developed over the CUDA implementations of these algorithms. In earlier work, we had already shown correctness of a more high-level version of the algorithm. This paper discusses how we add support to reason about CUDA programs in VerCors, and it then shows how we can redo the verification at the level of the CUDA code. We also discuss some practical challenges that we had to address to prove correctness of the actual CUDA-level verifications.},

  abstract     = {Software-intensive systems can have thousands of interdependent configuration options across different subsystems. Feature models (FMs) allow designers to organize the configuration space by describing configuration options using interdependent features: a feature is a name representing some functionality and each software variant is identified by a set of features. Attributed feature models (AFMs) extend FMs to describe the, possibly constrained, choice of a value from domains such as integers or strings: each attribute is associated to one feature, and when the feature is selected then the attribute brings some additional information relative to the selected features. Different representations of FMs and AFMs have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we focus on the logical representation (which works well in practice) and the extensional representation (which has been recently shown well suited for theoretical investigations). We provide an algebraic and a logical characterization of operations and relations on FMs and AFMs, and we formalize the connection between the two characterizations as monomorphisms from lattices of logical FMs and AFMs to lattices of extensional FMs and AFMs, respectively. This formalization sheds new light on the correspondence between the algebraic and logical characterizations of operations and relations for FMs and AFMs. It aims to foster the development of a formal framework for supporting practical exploitation of future theoretical developments on FMs, AFMs and multi software product lines.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new symbolic trace semantics for register automata (extended finite state machines) which records both the sequence of input symbols that occur during a run as well as the constraints on input parameters that are imposed by this run. Our main result is a generalization of the classical Myhill-Nerode theorem to this symbolic setting. Our generalization requires the use of three relations to capture the additional structure of register automata. Location equivalence ≡l captures that symbolic traces end in the same location, transition equivalence ≡t captures that they share the same final transition, and a partial equivalence relation ≡r captures that symbolic values v and v′ are stored in the same register after symbolic traces w and w′ , respectively. A symbolic language is defined to be regular if relations ≡l , ≡t and ≡r exist that satisfy certain conditions, in particular, they all have finite index. We show that the symbolic language associated to a register automaton is regular, and we construct, for each regular symbolic language, a register automaton that accepts this language. Our result provides a foundation for grey-box learning algorithms in settings where the constraints on data parameters can be extracted from code using e.g. tools for symbolic/concolic execution or tainting. Moving to a grey-box setting may overcome the scalability problems of state-of-the-art black-box learning algorithms.},

We propose a framework, based on analytic combinatorics, allowing to analyse their quantitative aspects such as the average number of execution paths induced by the choice operator, or the proportion of executions of a process with respect to its number of execution prefixes. Building on this theoretical investigation, we develop efficient algorithms aimed at the statistical exploration of their state-space. The first algorithm is a uniform random sampler of bounded executions, providing a good default exploration strategy. The second algorithm is a uniform random sampler of execution prefixes of a given bounded length, allowing to bias the exploration in a controlled manner. The fundamental characteristics of these algorithms is that they work on the syntax of the programs and do not require the explicit construction of the state-space.},

In a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , an unknown source node v ⁎ ∈ V v⁎∈V is drawn uniformly at random, and unknown edge weights w ( e ) w(e) for e ∈ E e∈E , representing the propagation delays along the edges, are drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution of mean 1 and variance σ 2 σ2 . An algorithm then attempts to identify v ⁎ v⁎ by querying nodes q ∈ V q∈V and being told the length of the shortest path between q and v ⁎ v⁎ in graph G weighted by w . We consider two settings: non-adaptive , in which all query nodes must be decided in advance, and adaptive , in which each query can depend on the results of the previous ones. Both settings are motivated by an application of the problem to epidemic processes (where the source is called patient zero), which we discuss in detail. We characterize the query complexity when G is an n -node path. In the non-adaptive setting, Θ ( n σ 2 ) Θ(nσ2) queries are needed for σ 2 ≤ 1 σ2≤1 , and Θ ( n ) Θ(n) for σ 2 ≥ 1 σ2≥1 . In the adaptive setting, somewhat surprisingly, only Θ ( log ⁡ log 1 / σ ⁡ n ) Θ(log⁡log1/σ⁡n) are needed when σ 2 ≤ 1 / 2 σ2≤1/2 , and Θ ( log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) + O σ ( 1 ) Θ(log⁡log⁡n)+Oσ(1) when σ 2 ≥ 1 / 2 σ2≥1/2 .

To find out the local structures common to the strings under this similarity metric, we need a fast calculation of the LCS length of any pair of substrings of the two strings. For supporting such queries, it makes sense to preprocess the two strings in a quadratic time , because it takes about the same amount of time to compute the LCS length of the entire strings from scratch. We propose a quadratic-time constructible data structure that supports sublinear-time queries of the LCS length for any pair of substrings. The query time is O ( l log 1 + ϵ ⁡ l ) O(llog1+ϵ⁡l) , where ϵ is a positive constant arbitrarily small and l is the sum of the substring lengths.},

The border of the region, modeled as a unit line segment, consists of high priority segments that require the highest level of protection separated by low priority segments that require to be visited infinitely often. We study the problem of patrolling the border with a set of k robots. The goal is to obtain strategies that minimize the maximum idle time (the time that a point is left unattended) of each point of the high priority segments while visiting each point of the low priority segments infinitely often. We use the concept of single lid cover (segments of fixed length) where each high priority point is covered with at least one lid, and then we extend it to strong double-lid cover where each high priority point is covered with at least two lids, and the unit line segment is fully covered. Let λ k − 1 λk−1 be the minimum lid length that accepts a single λ k − 1 λk−1 -lid cover with k − 1 k−1 lids and Λ 2 k Λ2k be the minimum lid length that accepts a strong double Λ 2 k Λ2k -lid cover with 2 k lids. We show that 2 min ⁡ ( Λ 2 k , λ k − 1 ) 2min⁡(Λ2k,λk−1) is the lower bound of the idle time when the max speed of the robots is one. To compute Λ 2 k Λ2k and λ k − 1 λk−1 , we present an algorithm with time complexity O ( max ⁡ ( k , n ) log ⁡ n ) O(max⁡(k,n)log⁡n) where n is the number of high priority segments. Our algorithm improves by a factor of min ⁡ ( n , k ) min⁡(n,k) the previous O ( k n log ⁡ n ) O(knlog⁡n) running time algorithm. For the upper bound, first we present a strategy with idle time λ k − 1 λk−1 where robot k patrols the unit line segment, and robot i patrols the i -lid of a single λ k − 1 λk−1 -lid cover with k − 1 k−1 lids. Then, we present a simple strategy with idle time 3 Λ 2 k 3Λ2k that splits the unit line into not-disjoint k segments of equal length that robots synchronously cover, i.e., reaching the leftmost and rightmost point simultaneously. Then, we present a complex strategy that splits the unit line into k non-disjoint segments that robots asynchronously cover. We show that the combination of strategies one and two attains an approximation of 1.5 the optimal idle time and combining strategies one and third attains an optimal idle time.},

  abstract     = {One of the most studied models of SAT is random SAT . In this model, instances are composed from clauses chosen uniformly randomly and independently of each other. This model may be unsatisfactory in that it fails to describe various features of SAT instances, arising in real-world applications. Various modifications have been suggested to define models of industrial SAT. Here, we focus mainly on the aspect of community structure. Namely, here the set of variables consists of a number of disjoint communities, and clauses tend to consist of variables from the same community. Thus, we suggest a model of random industrial SAT, in which the central generalization with respect to random SAT is the additional community structure. There has been a lot of work on the satisfiability threshold of random k -SAT, starting with the calculation of the threshold of 2-SAT, up to the recent result that the threshold exists for sufficiently large k . In this paper, we endeavor to study the satisfiability threshold for the proposed model of random industrial SAT. Our main result is that the threshold in this model tends to be smaller than its counterpart for random SAT. Moreover, under some conditions, this threshold even vanishes.},

  abstract     = {In computation, sorting is highly essential to access and manipulate data efficiently. High-performance sorting algorithms have always been in demand so that computers may process data more quickly. Since the computer has become a vital tool in various domains of human life, the various researchers have investigated and presented numerous sorting algorithms to sort elements of list with minimal execution time and least space. As the volume of data increases, the urgency for efficient data processing algorithms also increases. In this novel work, we present a comparison-based sorting algorithm titled “2 mm” which is a modification of the sorting algorithm Min-Max Bidirectional Parallel Selection Sort (MMBPSS). The proposed algorithm follows divide and conquers method and uses constant space complexity i.e. O ( n ) O(n) . Although 2 mm sort differs slightly from MMBPSS sort, its computational cost is very low and it reduces more than 50\% comparison cost hence presents a more efficient solution to the sorting problems in the modern era. For performance evaluation and comparison, extensive experimentation has been performed that shows the better performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Secret sharing was proposed primarily in 1979 to solve the problem of key distribution. In recent decades, researchers have proposed many improvement schemes. Among all these schemes, verifiable multi-secret sharing (VMSS) schemes are studied sufficiently, which share multiple secrets simultaneously and perceive malicious dealer as well as participants. By pointing out that the schemes presented by Dehkordi and Mashhadi in 2008 cannot detect some vicious behaviors of the dealer, we propose two new VMSS schemes by adding new validity check in the verification phase to overcome this drawback. Our new schemes are based on XTR public key system, and can realize G F ( p 6 ) GF(p6) security by computations in G F ( p 2 ) GF(p2) without explicit constructions of G F ( p 6 ) GF(p6) , where p is a prime. Compared with the VMSS schemes using RSA and linear feedback shift register (LFSR) public key cryptosystems, we can achieve the same security level with shorter parameters by using trace function . What&#39;s more, our schemes are much simpler to operate than those schemes based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). In addition, our two schemes are dynamic and threshold changeable, which means that it is efficient to implement our schemes when participants, secrets or the threshold needs to be changed.},

We show that the threshold of the ratio for this equivalence to hold is exactly 2. Furthermore, we prove that if the ratio is less than 2, say α , then a lexicographically maximal solution achieves ( α / 2 ) (α/2) -approximation, and this bound is tight.},

Knots are important graph structures in Computer Science because they characterize the existence of deadlocks in a classical distributed computation model, the so-called OR-model. Given a directed graph G , and a positive integer k , the Knot-Free Vertex Deletion (KFVD) problem consists of determining whether G has a subset S ⊆ V ( G ) S⊆V(G) with size at most k such that G [ V ∖ S ] G[V∖S] contains no knot. KFVD is an NP-complete graph problem with natural applications in deadlock resolution. In this paper, we present a parameterized complexity analysis of KFVD . We prove that: KFVD is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the solution; it can be solved in 2 k log ⁡ φ ⋅ n O ( 1 ) 2klog⁡φ⋅nO(1) time, but assuming SETH , it cannot be solved in ( 2 − ϵ ) k log ⁡ φ ⋅ n O ( 1 ) (2−ϵ)klog⁡φ⋅nO(1) time, where φ is the size of the largest strongly connected subgraph of G ; it can be solved in 2 ϕ ⋅ n O ( 1 ) 2ϕ⋅nO(1) time, but assuming ETH, it cannot be solved in 2 o ( ϕ ) ⋅ n O ( 1 ) 2o(ϕ)⋅nO(1) time, where ϕ is the number of vertices with out-degree at most k ; it can be solved in 2 O ( t w log ⁡ t w ) ⋅ n O ( 1 ) 2O(twlog⁡tw)⋅nO(1) time, but assuming ETH it cannot be solved in 2 o ( t w ) ⋅ n O ( 1 ) 2o(tw)⋅nO(1) time, where tw is the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph; and, it can be solved in FPT time when parameterized by the clique-width of the directed graph.

  abstract     = {This article explores an interplay between process crash failures and concurrency. Namely, it aims at answering the question, “Is it possible to cope with more crash failures when some number of crashes occur before some predefined contention point happened?”. These crashes are named λ-constrained crashes , where λ is the predefined contention point (known by the processes). Hence, this article considers two types of process crashes: λ -constrained crashes and classical crashes (which can occur at any time and are consequently called any-time crashes). Considering a system made up of n asynchronous processes communicating through atomic read/write registers, the article focuses on the design of two agreement-related algorithms. Assuming λ = n − 1 λ=n−1 and no any-time failure, the first algorithm solves the consensus problem in the presence of one λ -constrained crash failure, thereby circumventing the well-known FLP impossibility result. The second algorithm considers k -set agreement for k ≥ 2 k≥2 . It is a k -set agreement algorithm such that λ = n − ℓ λ=n−ℓ and ℓ ≥ k = m + f ℓ≥k=m+f that works in the presence of up to ( 2 m + ℓ − k ) (2m+ℓ−k) λ -constrained crashes and ( f − 1 ) (f−1) any-time crashes, i.e., up to t = ( 2 m + ℓ − k ) + ( f − 1 ) t=(2m+ℓ−k)+(f−1) process crashes. It follows that considering the timing of failures with respect to a predefined contention point enlarges the space of executions in which k -set agreement can be solved despite the combined effect of asynchrony, concurrency, and process crashes. The paper also presents agreement-related impossibility results for consensus and k -set agreement in the context of λ -constrained process crashes (with or without any-time crashes).},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of programming a robotic panda gardener to keep a bamboo garden from obstructing the view of the lake by your house. The garden consists of n bamboo stalks with known daily growth rates and the gardener can cut at most one bamboo per day. As a computer scientist, you found out that this problem has already been formalized in [Gąsieniec et al., SOFSEM&#39;17] as the Bamboo Garden Trimming (BGT) problem , where the goal is that of computing a perpetual schedule (i.e., the sequence of bamboos to cut) for the robotic gardener to follow in order to minimize the makespan , i.e., the maximum height ever reached by a bamboo. Two natural strategies are Reduce-Max and Reduce-Fastest ( x ). Reduce-Max trims the tallest bamboo of the day, while Reduce-Fastest ( x ) trims the fastest growing bamboo among the ones that are taller than x . It is known that Reduce-Max and Reduce-Fastest ( x ) achieve a makespan of O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) and 4 for the best choice of x = 2 x=2 , respectively. We prove the first constant upper bound of 9 for Reduce-Max and improve the one for Reduce-Fastest ( x ) to 3 + 5 2 3+52&amp;lt;2.62 for x = 1 + 1 5 x=1+15 . Another critical aspect stems from the fact that your robotic gardener has a limited amount of processing power and memory. It is then important for the algorithm to be able to quickly determine the next bamboo to cut while requiring at most linear space. We formalize this aspect as the problem of designing a Trimming Oracle data structure , and we provide three efficient Trimming Oracles implementing different perpetual schedules, including those produced by Reduce-Max and Reduce-Fastest ( x ).},

We obtain efficient results for several variations of the problem, in particular we obtain O ( 1 ) O(1) time per command for the offline version and O ( α ( n ) ) O(α(n)) amortized time for the online version, where α ( n ) α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function and n the number of values in the sequence.

A total k -coloring of a graph G is a coloring of its vertices and edges such that no two adjacent or incident elements receive the same color. The Total Coloring Conjecture, in short, TCC, states that every simple graph G is totally ( Δ + 2 ) (Δ+2) -colorable, where Δ is the maximum degree of G . In this paper, we prove that TCC holds for recursive maximal planar graphs , especially, a main class of recursive maximal planar graphs, named (2,2)-recursive maximal planar graphs, are totally ( Δ + 1 ) (Δ+1) -colorable. Moreover, we give linear time algorithms for total coloring of recursive maximal planar graphs and (2,2)-recursive maximal planar graphs, respectively.},

Preferences may be intransitive and agents may even have cycles in their preferences; e.g. an agent a may prefer b to c , c to d , and d to b , all with probability one. If an instance has such a cycle, then there may not exist any matching that is stable with positive probability . We focus on the computational problems of checking the existence of possibly and certainly stable matchings, i.e., matchings whose probability of being stable is positive or one, respectively. We show that finding possibly stable matchings is NP-hard, even if only one side can have cyclic preferences. On the other hand we show that the problem of finding a certainly stable matching is polynomial-time solvable if only one side can have cyclic preferences and the other side has transitive preferences, but that this problem becomes NP-hard when both sides can have cyclic preferences.},

The specification of the behaviour of a gals system comes very often in the form of a transition system. Automated synthesis based on the regions of transition systems is an approach that allows to construct Petri net models from their transition system specifications. In this paper we focus on developing algorithms and tool support for the synthesis of the enl -systems from transition systems, where transitions are labelled by steps (sets) of executed actions. We pay special attention to the subclass of enl -systems with localised conflicts where there is no conflict between events belonging to different localities.

The main results of the paper are the following: (1) Satisfactory Partition is polynomial-time solvable for block graphs, (2) Satisfactory Partition and Balanced Satisfactory Partition are fixed parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by neighbourhood diversity.

  abstract     = {Graph spanners are well-studied and widely used both in theory and practice. In a recent breakthrough, Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen [10] improved the state-of-the-art for light spanners by constructing a ( 2 k − 1 ) ( 1 + ε ) (2k−1)(1+ε) -spanner with O ( n 1 + 1 k ) O(n1+1k) edges and O ε ( n 1 k ) Oε(n1k) lightness. Soon after, Filtser and Solomon [18] showed that the classic greedy spanner construction achieves the same bounds. The major drawback of the greedy spanner is its running time of O ( m n 1 + 1 k ) O(mn1+1k) (which is faster than [10] ). This makes the construction impractical even for graphs of moderate size. Much faster spanner constructions do exist but they only achieve lightness Ω ε ( k n 1 k ) Ωε(kn1k) , even when randomization is used. The contribution of this paper is deterministic spanner constructions that are fast, and achieve similar bounds as the state-of-the-art slower constructions. Our first result is an O ε ( n 2 + 1 k + ε ′ ) Oε(n2+1k+ε′) time spanner construction which achieves the state-of-the-art bounds. Our second result is an O ε ( m + n log ⁡ n ) Oε(m+nlog⁡n) time construction of a spanner with ( 2 k − 1 ) ( 1 + ε ) (2k−1)(1+ε) stretch, O ( log ⁡ k ⋅ n 1 + 1 k ) O(log⁡k⋅n1+1k) edges and O ε ( log ⁡ k ⋅ n 1 k ) Oε(log⁡k⋅n1k) lightness. This is an exponential improvement in the dependence on k compared to the previous result with such running time. Finally, for the important special case where k = log ⁡ n k=log⁡n , for every constant ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 , we provide an O ( m + n 1 + ε ) O(m+n1+ε) time construction that produces an O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) -spanner with O ( n ) O(n) edges and O ( 1 ) O(1) lightness which is asymptotically optimal. This is the first known sub-quadratic construction of such a spanner for any k = ω ( 1 ) k=ω(1) . To achieve our constructions, we show a novel deterministic incremental approximate distance oracle. Our new oracle is crucial in our construction, as known randomized dynamic oracles require the assumption of a non-adaptive adversary. This is a strong assumption, which has seen recent attention in prolific venues. Our new oracle allows the order of the edge insertions to not be fixed in advance, which is critical as our spanner algorithm chooses which edges to insert based on the answers to distance queries. We believe our new oracle is of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {We examine the Online Facility Location problem in an extended version. Fotakis showed a lower bound of Ω ( log ⁡ n log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) Ω(log⁡nlog⁡log⁡n) for the original Online Facility Location problem, where n is the number of clients. This bound holds even on the real line and for randomized algorithms against oblivious adversaries. We propose randomized online algorithms in the following setting: We consider the Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension and allow the facilities to either move arbitrarily or to move at most a constant distance m in each time step. The costs for moving a facility from a to b is D ⋅ d ( a , b ) D⋅d(a,b) where D ≥ 1 D≥1 is a constant. Clients are assigned to facilities instantly and irreversibly. The cost for serving the clients is either calculated as soon as a client arrives or at the end of the computation. The algorithms for these two cost models achieve the same competitiveness on the line, which, in contrast to the original Online Facility Location problem, is independent of n . In the case of arbitrary movement, it only depends on D . In the case of a limited movement distance m , it additionally depends on m and the opening costs of the facilities. We show that our results are asymptotically tight on the real line. For the Euclidean space of higher dimensions , we give an algorithm for the model where costs for clients are evaluated immediately. The competitive ratio of our algorithm depends on the above parameters and additionally on the number of optimal facilities.},

  abstract     = {In an edge-colored graph G , a subgraph is rainbow if all its edges have different colors. A strongly edge-colored graph is an edge-colored graph in which each path of length three is rainbow. A cycle C in an edge-colored graph G of order n is called a rainbow Hamiltonian cycle if the cycle is rainbow and its length is n . An edge-colored graph G of order n is rainbow vertex(edge)-pancyclic if each vertex(edge) of G is contained in a rainbow cycle of length k for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n 3≤k≤n . Cheng et al. in 2019 showed that every strongly edge-colored graph G of order n with minimum degree δ ≥ 2 n 3 δ≥2n3 contains a rainbow Hamiltonian cycle. Later in 2021, Wang et al. extended this result and showed that every strongly edge-colored graph G of order n with minimum degree δ ≥ 2 n 3 δ≥2n3 is rainbow vertex-pancyclic. In this paper, we further show that every strongly edge-colored graph G of order n with minimum degree δ ≥ 2 n + 1 3 δ≥2n+13 is rainbow edge-pancyclic. Moreover, from the proof we get a polynomial time algorithm for every given edge e in any such graph G to find a rainbow l -cycle for each 3 ≤ l ≤ n 3≤l≤n that contains the edge e .},

Since these put the codes into canonical form , however, they can only be used when we can choose the order in which codewords are assigned to symbols. In this paper we first show how, given a probability distribution over an alphabet of σ symbols, we can store an optimal alphabetic prefix-free code in O ( σ lg ⁡ L ) O(σlg⁡L) bits such that we can encode and decode any codeword of length ℓ in O ( min ⁡ ( ℓ , lg ⁡ L ) ) O(min⁡(ℓ,lg⁡L)) time, where L is the maximum codeword length . With O ( 2 L ϵ ) O(2Lϵ) further bits, for any constant ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 , we can encode and decode O ( lg ⁡ ℓ ) O(lg⁡ℓ) time. We then show how to store a nearly optimal alphabetic prefix-free code in o ( σ ) o(σ) bits such that we can encode and decode in constant time. We also consider a kind of optimal prefix-free code introduced recently where the codewords&#39; lengths are non-decreasing if arranged in lexicographic order of their reverses. We reduce their storage space to O ( σ lg ⁡ L ) O(σlg⁡L) while maintaining encoding and decoding times in O ( ℓ ) O(ℓ) . We also show how, with O ( 2 ϵ L ) O(2ϵL) further bits, we can encode and decode in constant time. All of our results hold in the word-RAM model.},

We first introduce a novel rounding scheme, tailored for multistage problems, that accounts for the moving cost (or stability revenue) of adjacent solutions. Using this rounding scheme, we propose improved approximation algorithms for the multistage variants of Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree and Prize-Collecting Traveling Salesman problems . Furthermore, we introduce a 2-approximation algorithm for multistage Multi-Cut on trees, and we also show that our general scheme can be extended to maximization problems, by providing a 0.75-approximation algorithm for the multistage variant of MaxSat.},

A local-equitable k-coloring of G is an assignment of k colors to the vertices of G such that, for every maximal clique of G , the coloring of this clique forms an equitable k -partition of itself. The local-equitable coloring of G is a stronger version of clique-coloring of graphs. Chordal graphs are 2-clique-colorable but not necessarily local-equitably 2-colorable. In this paper, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide the local-equitable 2-colorability in chordal graphs and even in split graphs. In addition, we prove that claw-free split graphs are local-equitably k -colorable when k ≤ 4 k≤4 , but not necessarily local-equitably k -colorable when k ≥ 5 k≥5 . A sufficient and sharp condition of local-equitably k -colorability is also given in claw-free split graphs. Secondly, we show that, given a split graph G , deciding the local-equitable k -colorability of G is solvable in polynomial time when k = ω ( G ) − 1 k=ω(G)−1 , where ω ( G ) ω(G) is the clique number of G . At last, we prove that the decision problem of local-equitable 2-coloring of planar graphs is solvable in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {A neighbor-sum-distinguishing W -edge-weighting of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is an assignment ω of weights from a set of integers W to the set of edges E of G such that for every pair of adjacent vertices , the incident sums induced by the edge-weighting are different, where the incident sum of a vertex v induced by the edge-weighting ω is σ ( v ) = ∑ u ∈ N ( v ) ω ( u v ) σ(v)=∑u∈N(v)ω(uv) , where N ( v ) N(v) is the set of neighbors of v in G . Whereas, a neighbor-sum- 2 -distinguishing W-edge-weighting of G is a neighbor-sum-distinguishing W -edge-weighting such that the incident sums of every pair of adjacent vertices differ by at least 2. A recently proposed conjecture about neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing { 1 , 3 , 5 } {1,3,5} -edge-weighting states that any graph with no component isomorphic to K 2 K2 admits a neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing { 1 , 3 , 5 } {1,3,5} -edge-weighting. In this paper, we prove that deciding whether there exists a neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing { 1 , 3 } {1,3} -edge-weighting is NP-complete for bipartite graphs . We present an algorithm that computes a neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing { 1 , 3 } {1,3} -edge-weighting of the central graph of any graph in polynomial time and thus proves the above conjecture for the central graph of any graph. Further, we establish that if any pair of graphs G and H admit neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing edge-weightings, then so does their Cartesian product , G □ H G□H . We study another aspect of neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing edge-weighting of a graph G , namely, the minimum number of incident sums used by a neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing { 1 , 3 } {1,3} -edge-weighting, which is denoted by γ Σ &gt; 1 , { 1 , 3 } ( G ) γΣ&amp;gt;1,{1,3}(G) . We prove that the problems of deciding whether there exists a neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing { 1 , 3 } {1,3} -edge-weighting of G from a given set of sums , and deciding whether γ Σ &gt; 1 , { 1 , 3 } ( G ) ≤ k γΣ&amp;gt;1,{1,3}(G)≤k are NP-complete for bipartite graphs . On the positive side, we provide both upper and lower bounds on γ Σ &gt; 1 , { 1 , 3 } ( C ( G ) ) γΣ&amp;gt;1,{1,3}(C(G)) for central graphs of bipartite graphs and split graphs. We also propose an algorithm that computes the optimal neighbor-sum-2-distinguishing { 1 , 3 } {1,3} -edge-weighting of the central graphs of cycles and paths in polynomial time .},

The ultra-wide word RAM model captures (and idealizes) modern vector processor architectures. Our main result is a new in-place data structure for the partial sum problem that only stores a constant number of ultrawords in addition to the input and supports operations in doubly logarithmic time. This matches the best known time bounds for the problem (among polynomial space data structures) while improving the space from superlinear to a constant number of ultrawords. Our results are based on a simple and elegant in-place word RAM data structure , known as the Fenwick tree. Our main technical contribution is a new efficient parallel ultra-wide word RAM implementation of the Fenwick tree, which is likely of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {An impressive hardness theory which can prove compression lower bounds for a large number of FPT problems has been established under the assumption that NP ⊈ coNP/poly. However, there are no problems in FPT for which the existence of polynomial Turing compressions under any widely believed complexity assumptions has been excluded. In this paper, we provide a technique which can be used to prove that some FPT problems have no small Turing compressions under the assumption that there exists a problem in NP which does not have small-sized circuits. These FPT problems, which include edge clique cover parameterized by the number of cliques, integer linear programming and a -choosability parameterized by some structural parameters, etc. have the property that they remain NP-hard under Cook reductions even if their parameter values are small. Moreover, a trade-off between the size of the Turing compression lower bound and the robustness of the complexity assumption is obtained. In particular, we demonstrate that these FPT problems have no polynomial Turing compressions unless every set in NP has quasi-polynomial-sized circuits, and have no 2 o ( k ) 2o(k) Turing compressions unless every set in NP has sub-exponential-sized circuits. Additionally, Turing kernelization lower bounds for these FPT problems are provided under some weaker complexity assumptions. Lastly, compression lower bounds for the above-mentioned FPT problems are proved under some complexity assumptions which are weaker than NP ⊈ coNP/poly, moreover, these results are proved under a method which is different from the previous hardness theory for compression lower bounds.},

  abstract     = {In the field of data science, graph embedding is a vital tool to simulate, visualize and design a parallel architecture . The binary cube is one of the most desirable and reliable network-based architecture with high performance, yet many variations have been proposed on the links of the cube to enhance its computational power. The spined cube is a new efficient variant of the binary cube with a smaller diameter and preserves the advantageous properties of the original cube. Grid embedding is accustomed to study simulation capacity of a parallel and distributed computer system and conjointly designs its VLSI layout. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to embed the spined cube into a grid and compute the minimum wirelength over all possible embeddings using the edge congestion technique.},

The diameter of a cluster is the maximum distance between pairs of points in the cluster, and the split of a cluster is the minimum distance between points of the cluster and ones outside the cluster. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for measuring the goodness of clusters: The ratio of the minimum cluster split to the maximum cluster diameter (abbr. RSD). We study the following two optimization problems: Maximizing RSD without and with cardinality constraints, i.e., each cluster should consist of at least N points. For both problems with k ≥ 3 k≥3 , it is NP-hard to achieve a factor of ( 1 2 + ϵ ) (12+ϵ) approximation for any ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 .

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of cloud storage and cloud computing services , many organizations and users choose to store the data on a cloud server for saving costs. However, due to security concerns, data of users would be encrypted before sending to the cloud. However, this hinders a problem of computation on encrypted data in the cloud, especially in the case of performing data matching in various medical scenarios. Public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) is a powerful tool that allows the authorized cloud server to check whether two ciphertexts are generated by the same message. PKEET has then become a promising candidate for many practical applications like efficient data management on encrypted databases . Lee et al. (Information Sciences 2020) proposed a generic construction of PKEET schemes in the standard model and hence it is possible to yield the first instantiation of post-quantum PKEET schemes based on lattices . At ACISP 2019, Duong et al. proposed a direct construction of PKEET over integer lattices in the standard model. However, their scheme does not reach the CCA2-security. In this paper, we propose an efficient CCA2-secure PKEET scheme based on ideal lattices. In addition, we present a modification of the scheme by Duong et al. over integer lattices to attain the CCA2-security. Both schemes are proven secure in the standard model, and they enjoy the security in the upcoming quantum computer era.},

  abstract     = {The question if a given partial solution to a problem can be extended reasonably occurs in many algorithmic approaches for optimization problems. For instance, when enumerating minimal vertex covers of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , one usually arrives at the problem to decide for a vertex set U ⊆ V U⊆V ( pre-solution ), if there exists a minimal vertex cover S (i.e., a vertex cover S ⊆ V S⊆V such that no proper subset of S is a vertex cover) with U ⊆ S U⊆S ( minimal extension of U ). We propose a general, partial-order based formulation of such extension problems which allows to model parameterization and approximation aspects of extension, and also highlights relationships between extension tasks for different specific problems. As examples, we study a number of specific problems which can be expressed and related in this framework. In particular, we discuss extension variants of the problems dominating set and feedback vertex/edge set. All these problems are shown to be NP NP -complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs of bounded degree, with the exception of our extension version of feedback edge set on undirected graphs which is shown to be solvable in polynomial time. For the extension variants of dominating and feedback vertex set, we also show NP NP -completeness for the restriction to planar graphs of bounded degree. As non-graph problem, we also study an extension version of the bin packing problem. We further consider the parameterized complexity of all these extension variants, where the parameter is a measure of the pre-solution as defined by our framework.},

After an algorithmic study of this k -wise Kemeny aggregation problem, we introduce a k -wise counterpart of the majority graph. This graph reveals useful to divide the aggregation problem into several sub-problems, which enables to speed up the exact computation of a consensus ranking.

In this paper, we study a generalisation of this classical notion. Namely, an instance of our problem is a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) and a partition Π = ( V 1 , … , V k ) Π=(V1,…,Vk) of V . Each subset V i Vi of Π is called an obligation . An Independent Dominating set with Obligations ( IDO ) D in an instance ( G , Π ) (G,Π) is an independent dominating set of G with the additional property that if a vertex u that belongs to the obligation V i Vi is in D , then all the other vertices of V i Vi must also be in D (we say that D respects the obligations). Note that when each obligation of Π is a singleton, an IDO is just an independent dominating set of G that can be constructed with a greedy algorithm. Among other things, we show that the problem of determining whether an instance ( G = ( V , E ) , Π ) (G=(V,E),Π) has an IDO is NP -complete, even if G is a path, if all the obligations are independent sets of G , and if they all have the same constant size λ &gt; 1 λ&amp;gt;1 . We also show that the problem is NP -complete, even if Π is composed of | V | |V| independent obligations each of size | V | |V| or if the diameter of G is three. Our results clearly show that this problem is very difficult, even for extremely restricted instances. Hence, in a second part of the paper, we relax the condition to dominate all the vertices of G . However, we show that determining whether ( G = ( V , E ) , Π ) (G=(V,E),Π) contains an independent set D respecting the obligations and dominating at least 3 | V | − 2 3|V|−2 vertices of G is NP -complete, even if G is a collection of disjoint paths and obligations are all independent sets of G . On the positive side, we propose a greedy algorithm constructing a solution dominating at least 2 | V | − 1 2|V|−1 vertices in any instance ( G = ( V , E ) , Π ) (G=(V,E),Π) if all obligations of Π are independent sets of G .},

An important part of our work comes with representing BNs as while loops in probabilistic programs with polynomial assignments over random variables and parametrised distributions. We prove that closed-form summaries of probabilistic loops precisely characterize higher-order moments of BN variables. As such, we automatically solve several BN-related problems, including exact inference, sensitivity analysis, filtering, and computing the expected number of rejecting samples in sampling-based procedures. We evaluate our work on a number of BN benchmarks, using automated invariant generation within Prob-solvable loop analysis.

  abstract     = {Replicated Data Types ( rdt s) have been introduced as an abstraction for dealing with weakly consistent data stores, which may (temporarily) expose multiple, inconsistent views of their state. In the literature, rdt s are usually presented in set-theoretical terms, and only recently different specification flavours have been proposed. This paper offers a categorical presentation for the specification and implementation of rdt s. This paves the way for a method that allows distilling an operational semantics from a specification, which is then exploited to define a notion of implementation correctness via simulation.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data presents a significant challenge to the capability of traditional storage technologies to collect and manage data. Cloud storage systems (CSSs) have been proposed as a method to improve storage capacity. To safely and effectively manage cloud storage data and improve data service quality, it is necessary to verify the correctness of CSS management programs. However, the complexity of these systems renders program verification difficult. In this paper, we propose a Hoare-style proof system, in conjunction with two languages, to analyze and verify CSS management programs. The first is a modeling language that describes the program execution. The second is an assertion language based on Separation Logic (SL), used to describe the properties of the CSS file-block-location storage structure. The proof system supports modular local reasoning for CSS programs by a set of adaptation rules, which enable the condition of specifications to be applied to broader contexts. A key question that arises is whether the proof system can meet adaptation completeness. If so, arbitrary satisfiable specifications can be adjusted using the adaptation rules. To this end, we developed local predicate transformers and used their domain to interpret all types of commands. By finding the smallest local predicate transformer, we established adaptation completeness. In summary, this work provides a formalization of automatic modular reasoning patterns and lays a theoretical foundation for the compositional program verification of CSSs.},

  abstract     = {The efficient design of safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS) requires the co-modeling and -verification of its physics, architecture and functionalities. Existing co-modeling formalisms do not account for these three design aspects into account uniformly. AADL is a precise formalism for modeling architecture and prototyping real-time hardware platforms, but it delegates co-modeling physical and software behaviors to so-called annexes. By contrast, Simulink/Stateflow (S/S) is strong for modeling interacting physical and software behaviors, but weak for modeling architecture and hardware platforms. To address this issue, this paper considers the combination of AADL and S/S to co-model CPSs and presents a method to uniformly analyze and verify this combination. AADL ⊕ S/S AADL⊕S/S provides a unified graphical co-modeling environment for CPS design and supports simulation through C code generation. We present a formal semantics of AADL ⊕ S/S AADL⊕S/S by translating it to Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes (HCSP), which yields a deductive verification framework for AADL ⊕ S/S AADL⊕S/S models based on Hybrid Hoare Logic (HHL). We also prove the correctness of the translation of AADL ⊕ S/S AADL⊕S/S to HCSP. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated by the realistically-scaled case study of an automatic cruise control system.},

Hence, our algorithm achieves approximation ratios of 9.25/6+o(1) and 3+o(1) . Our algorithm takes linear time and is fully parallelizable, i.e., the tour can be computed in O(n2/p) time using p processors in the CREW PRAM model. We generalize our techniques to rectangular boards, high-dimensional boards, symmetric tours, odd boards with a missing corner, and tours for (1,4) -leapers.

We first prove that the restriction to the future semantics does not suffice to recover decidability . Then, we introduce two semantic variants of TP, called strong minimal and weak minimal semantics, and show that they allow one to express meaningful properties. Both semantics are based on the minimality in the time distances of the existentially-quantified time events from the universally-quantified reference one, but the weak minimal variant distinguishes minimality in the past from minimality in the future. Surprisingly, we show that, despite the (apparently) small differences between the two semantics, the TP problem is still undecidable for the strong minimal one, while it is PSPACE -complete for the weak minimal one. Membership in PSPACE is determined by exploiting a strictly more expressive extension ( ECA + ) of the well-known robust class of Event-Clock Automata ( ECA ), that allows us to encode the weak minimal TP problem and to reduce it to non-emptiness of Timed Automata ( TA ). Finally, an extension of ECA + ( ECA ++ ) is considered, proving that its non-emptiness problem is undecidable. We believe that the two extensions of ECA ( ECA + and ECA ++ ), introduced for technical reasons, are actually valuable per sé in the field of TA . 1},

  abstract     = {In a marketplace where a number of firms produce and sell a homogeneous product, an innovator develops cost-cutting manufacturing technology and decides to sell it to various firms in the form of a license for profit. Given the innovator&#39;s license pricing policy, each firm independently decides whether to purchase the innovation license and how many products to produce. To put it simply, the firms are then in a Cournot market in which the product price is a decreasing function of the total amount of the product on the market. Both the innovator and the firms are acting out of self-interest and look to maximize their utilities. We consider the problem of designing optimal pricing policies for the innovator. A pricing policy could be in the form of a one-off upfront fee , a per-unit royalty fee , or a hybrid of both. Building upon the results of Segal [1] , we first show that in a properly designed pricing policy, it is a strictly dominant strategy for the firms to accept the pricing policy, and that this constitutes the unique Nash equilibrium of the game. For the hybrid-fee policy, we devise an algorithm that computes the optimal price in time O ( n 3 ) O(n3) , where n is the number of firms. For the royalty-fee policy, we show that the problem is captured by convex quadratic programming and can be solved in time O ( n 6 L 2 ) O(n6L2) , where L is the number of input bits. For the upfront-fee policy, we show the optimal policy problem is NP-complete and we devise an FPTAS algorithm. Moreover, we compare the revenue achievable through the above three pricing policies when all firms are identical.},

We seek to minimize the time needed for all receivers to get a message held by all transmitters. We study this Layer Dissemination problem under the Weighted Topological Interference Management (W-TIM) framework, which subsumes previous models of interference. We present randomized and deterministic protocols for Layer Dissemination, based on Selective-with-Interference Families , a combinatorial object related to group testing non-adaptive algorithms and superimposed codes. Our approach combines an engineering solution with theoretical guarantees. We characterize the network with a global measure of interference based on measurements in the specific deployment area. Then, our protocols distributedly produce an ad-hoc transmissions schedule for dissemination. We complement our theoretical study with simulations of a real network-deployment area to compare our protocols with previous work for models that ignore some physical constraints. The striking improvement in performance shown by our simulations with respect to using previous simplified models of interference shows the importance of using W-TIM to develop algorithms.},

  abstract     = {After two decades of research on signcryption, recently a new cryptographic primitive , named higncryption, was proposed at ACM CCS&#39;16. Higncryption can be viewed as privacy-enhanced signcryption, which integrates public key encryption , digital signature and identity concealment (which is not achieved in signcryption) into a monolithic primitive. Here, identity concealment means that the transcript of protocol runs should not leak participants&#39; identity information. In this work, we propose the first identity-based higncryption ( IBHigncryption IBHigncryption , for short). We present the formal security model for IBHigncryption IBHigncryption , under which security proof of the proposed scheme is conducted. The most impressive feature of IBHigncryption IBHigncryption , besides other desirable properties it offers, is its simplicity and efficiency, which might be somewhat surprising in retrospect. Our IBHigncryption IBHigncryption has a much simpler setup stage with smaller public parameters and particularly no need of computing master public key . It is essentially as efficient as (if not more than) the fundamental CCA-secure Boneh-Franklin identity-based encryption scheme [14] , and has significant efficiency advantage over the IEEE 1363.3 standard of identity-based signcryption [8] .},

  abstract     = {The key escrow problem is one of the main barriers to the widespread real-world use of identity-based encryption (IBE). Specifically, a key generation center (KGC), which generates secret keys for a given identity, has the power to decrypt all ciphertexts. At PKC 2009, Chow defined a notion of security against the KGC, that relies on assuming that it cannot discover the underlying identities behind ciphertexts. However, this is not a realistic assumption since, in practice, the KGC manages an identity list, and hence it can easily guess the identities corresponding to given ciphertexts. Chow later amended this issue by introducing a new entity called an identity-certifying authority (ICA) and proposed an anonymous key-issuing protocol . Essentially, this allows the users, KGC, and ICA to interactively generate secret keys without users ever having to reveal their identities to the KGC. Unfortunately, since Chow separately defined the security of IBE and that of the anonymous key-issuing protocol, his IBE definition did not provide any formal treatment when the ICA is used to authenticate the users. Effectively, all of the subsequent works following Chow lack the formal proofs needed to determine whether or not it delivers a secure solution to the key escrow problem. In this paper, based on Chow&#39;s work, we formally define an IBE scheme that resolves the key escrow problem and provide formal definitions of security against corrupted users, KGC, and ICA. Along the way, we observe that if we are allowed to assume a fully trusted ICA, as in Chow&#39;s work, then we can construct a trivial (and meaningless) IBE scheme that is secure against the KGC. Finally, we present two instantiations in our new security model: a lattice-based construction based on the Gentry–Peikert–Vaikuntanathan IBE scheme (STOC 2008) and Rückert&#39;s lattice-based blind signature scheme (ASIACRYPT 2010), and a pairing-based construction based on the Boneh–Franklin IBE scheme (CRYPTO 2001) and Boldyreva&#39;s blind signature scheme (PKC 2003).},

The detection problem is to decide whether a dependency of a certain type and size holds in a given database, the discovery problem asks to enumerate all valid dependencies of that type. We settle the complexity of both of these problems for unique column combinations (UCCs), functional dependencies (FDs), and inclusion dependencies (INDs). We show that the detection of UCCs and FDs is W[2]-complete when parameterized by the solution size. The discovery of inclusion-wise minimal UCCs is proven to be equivalent under parsimonious reductions to the transversal hypergraph problem of enumerating the minimal hitting sets of a hypergraph . The discovery of FDs is equivalent to the simultaneous enumeration of the hitting sets of multiple input hypergraphs. We further identify the detection of INDs as one of the first natural W[3]-complete problems. The discovery of maximal INDs is shown to be equivalent to enumerating the maximal satisfying assignments of antimonotone, 3-normalized Boolean formulas .},

  abstract     = {In the degree-constrained graph orientation problem , the input is an unweighted, undirected graph G=(V,E) and nonnegative integers av and bv (with av≤bv ) for each v∈V , and the objective is to assign a direction to every edge in E in such a way that for each v∈V , the number of outgoing edges in the resulting directed graph lies in the interval [av,bv] . When such an orientation does not exist, it is desirable to find an orientation that best fits the condition instead. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding an orientation that minimizes the total penalty ∑v∈Vcv , where cv is a penalty incurred whenever a vertex v violates its degree constraints . As penalty functions, convex, concave, and step functions are considered in this paper. We show that the problem with any convex penalty function can be solved in O(|E|1.5min⁡{log⁡(|E|⋅C),|E|0.5log⁡Δlog⁡|E|}) time, where Δ and C are the maximum degree and the largest magnitude of a penalty, respectively. In contrast, we show APX-hardness of the problem with step or concave functions . For trees and graphs with treewidth τ , the problem with any penalty function can be solved exactly in O(|V|log⁡Δ) time and O(τ2Δ2τ+2|V|) time, respectively. Finally, we consider the generalization of the problem to edge-weighted graphs and establish strong bounds on its inapproximability that hold even in the special case of stars. On the positive side, we can extend our algorithms for unweighted version of the problem to obtain pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms for the edge-weighted problem variant when restricted to trees and graphs with bounded treewidth. Also, we design a PTAS and a linear-time algorithm for stars with further restrictions on the degree constraints and edge weights.},

We say that a measure μ on the space of infinite bit sequences is Martin-Löf absolutely continuous if the non-Martin-Löf random bit sequences form a null set with respect to μ . We think of this as a weak randomness notion for measures. We begin with examples, and provide a robustness property related to Solovay tests. The initial segment complexity of a measure μ at a length n is defined as the μ -average over the descriptive complexity of strings of length n , in the sense of either C or K . We relate this weak randomness notion for a measure to the growth of its initial segment complexity. We show that a maximal growth implies the weak randomness property, but also that both implications of the Levin-Schnorr theorem fail. We discuss C -triviality and K -triviality for measures and relate these two notions with each other. Here, triviality means that the initial segment complexity grows as slowly as possible. We show that every measure that is Martin-Löf random in the sense of Hoyrup and Rojas is Martin-Löf absolutely continuous; the converse fails because only the latter property is compatible with having atoms. In a final section we consider weak randomness relative to a general ergodic computable measure. We seek appropriate effective versions of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem and the Brudno theorem where the bit sequences are replaced by measures. We conclude with several open questions.},

  abstract     = {The clustering problem , in its many variants, has numerous applications in operations research and computer science (e.g., in applications in bioinformatics, image processing , social network analysis , etc.). As sizes of data sets have grown rapidly, researchers have focused on designing algorithms for clustering problems in models of computation suited for large-scale computation such as MapReduce , Pregel, and streaming models. The k-machine model (Klauck et al., (SODA 2015) [8] ) is a simple, message-passing model for large-scale distributed graph processing. This paper considers three of the most prominent examples of clustering problems: the uncapacitated facility location problem, the p-median problem, and the p-center problem and presents O ( 1 ) O(1) -factor approximation algorithms for these problems running in O ˜ ( n / k ) O˜(n/k) rounds in the k -machine model. These algorithms are optimal up to polylogarithmic factors because this paper also shows Ω ˜ ( n / k ) Ω˜(n/k) lower bounds for obtaining polynomial-factor approximation algorithms for these problems. These are the first results for clustering problems in the k -machine model. We assume that the metric provided as input for these clustering problems is only implicitly provided, as an edge-weighted graph and in a nutshell, our main technical contribution is to show that constant-factor approximation algorithms for all three clustering problems can be obtained by learning only a small portion of the input metric.},

  abstract     = {We identify a tradeoff curve between the number of wheels on a train car, and the amount of track that must be installed in order to ensure that the train car is supported by the track at all times. The goal is to build an elevated track that covers some large distance ℓ , but that consists primarily of gaps, so that the total amount of feet of train track that is actually installed is only a small fraction of ℓ . In order so that the train track can support the train at all points, the requirement is that as the train drives across the track, at least one set of wheels from the rear quarter and at least one set of wheels from the front quarter of the train must be touching the track at all times. We show that, if a train car has n sets of wheels evenly spaced apart in its rear and n sets of wheels evenly spaced apart in its front, then it is possible to build a train track that supports the train car but uses only Θ ( ℓ / n ) Θ(ℓ/n) feet of track. We then consider what happens if the wheels on the train car are not evenly spaced (and may even be configured adversarially). We show that for any configuration of the train car, with n wheels in each of the front and rear quarters of the car, it is possible to build a track that supports the car for distance ℓ and uses only O ( ℓ log ⁡ n n ) O(ℓlog⁡nn) feet of track. Additionally, we show that there exist configurations of the train car for which this tradeoff curve is asymptotically optimal. Both the upper and lower bounds are achieved via applications of the probabilistic method . The algorithms and lower bounds in this paper provide simple illustrative examples of many of the core techniques in probabilistic combinatorics and randomized algorithms. These include the probabilistic method with alterations, the use of McDiarmid&#39;s inequality within the probabilistic method, the algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma, the min-hash technique, and the method of conditional probabilities.},

The task of finding a positive instance of the combinatorial problem P in a potentially infinite given regular set is equivalent to the so called in t Reg intReg -problem of P , which asks for a given DFA A , whether the intersection of P with L ( A ) L(A) is non-empty. The in t Reg intReg -problem generalizes the idea of considering multiple instances at once and connects classical combinatorial problems with the field of automata theory . While the question of decidability of the in t Reg intReg -problem has been answered positively for several NP and even PSPACE -complete problems, we are presenting some natural problems even from LOGSPACE with an undecidable in t Reg intReg -problem. We also discuss alphabet sizes and different encoding-schemes elaborating the boundary between problem-variants with a decidable respectively undecidable in t Reg intReg -problem.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the maximal clique enumeration algorithm cliques by Tomita et al. that appeared in Theoretical Computer Science in 2006. It is known to work in O ( 3 n / 3 ) O(3n/3) -time in the worst-case for an n -vertex graph. This is worst-case optimal with respect to the input size, but there is little knowledge about its performance with respect to the output. In this paper, we extend the time-complexity analysis with respect to the maximum size and the number of maximal cliques, and to its delay, solving issues that were left as open problems since the original paper. In particular, we prove that cliques has Ω ( 3 n / 6 ) Ω(3n/6) delay and that, even if we allow to change the pivoting strategy, a variant having polynomial delay cannot be designed unless P = N P P=NP . These same results apply to the related Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. On the positive side, we show that the complexity of cliques and Bron-Kerbosch is amortized polynomial on graphs with logarithmic clique number. As these algorithms are widely used and regarded as fast “in practice”, we are interested in observing their practical behavior: we run an evaluation of cliques and three Bron-Kerbosch variants on over 130 real-world and synthetic graphs, observing how the clique number almost always satisfies our logarithmic constraint, and that their performance seems far from its theoretical worst-case behavior in terms of both total time and delay. 1},

Our focus is on designing centralised transformations aiming at minimising the total number of moves subject to the constraint of preserving connectivity of the shape throughout the course of the transformation.

This problem is NP -complete for fixed k = 2 k=2 and W [1]-hard with parameter k in DAGs. A few positive results are known under restrictions on the input digraph , such as being planar or having bounded directed tree-width, or under relaxations of the problem, such as allowing for vertex congestion. Positive results are scarce, however, for general digraphs. In this article we propose a novel global congestion metric for the problem: we only require the paths to be “disjoint enough”, in the sense that they must behave properly not in the whole graph, but in an unspecified part of size prescribed by a parameter. Namely, in the Disjoint Enough Directed Paths problem, given an n -vertex digraph D , a set of k requests, and non-negative integers d and s , the task is to find a collection of paths connecting the requests such that at least d vertices of D occur in at most s paths of the collection. We study the parameterized complexity of this problem for a number of choices of the parameter, including the directed tree-width of D . Among other results, we show that the problem is W [1]-hard in DAGs with parameter d and, on the positive side, we give an algorithm in time O ( n d + 2 ⋅ k d ⋅ s ) O(nd+2⋅kd⋅s) and a kernel of size d ⋅ 2 k − s ⋅ ( k s ) + 2 k d⋅2k−s⋅(ks)+2k in general digraphs. This latter result has consequences for the Steiner Network problem: we show that it is FPT parameterized by the number k of terminals and p , where p = n − q p=n−q and q is the size of the solution.},

  abstract     = {Inner product functional encryption (IPFE) is a modern public key paradigm where the master key can derive a secret key s k y sky for a vector y , which can then be used to decrypt a ciphertext of x to get the inner product 〈 x , y 〉 〈x,y〉 as output. In ASIACRYPT 2019, Tomida proposed the first tightly secure IPFE scheme in the multi-user and multi-challenge setting based on the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption. However, the construction achieves CPA security only. Up to now, there is no IPFE scheme with tight CCA security available. In this paper, we construct the first tightly CCA-secure IPFE scheme in the multi-user and multi-challenge setting. The security reduction to the MDDH assumption (including SXDH, k -LIN, etc.) loses only a factor O ( log ⁡ λ ) O(log⁡λ) with λ the security parameter. Moreover, our scheme enjoys full compactness. To support inner product function of dimension m , our SXDH-based IPFE has ( m 2 + 8 m + 14 ) (m2+8m+14) and ( 3 m + 14 ) (3m+14) group elements in the master public key and ciphertext respectively. This is comparable to the tightly CPA-secure IPFE proposed by Tomida based on the DDH assumption, whose master public key and ciphertext contain ( m 2 + 2 ) (m2+2) and 3 m group elements, respectively. Furthermore, we construct the first IPFE with both tight CCA-security and function-hiding property, based on our CCA-secure IPFE. The tight function-hiding CCA security is obtained by adapting the techniques in Lin (CRYPTO 2017) and Gay (PKC 2020) to the multi-user and multi-challenge setting.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the verification of continuous-time polynomial spline trajectories against linear temporal logic specifications (LTL without ‘next’). Each atomic proposition is assumed to represent a state space region described by a multivariate polynomial inequality. The proposed approach samples a trajectory strategically, to capture every one of its region transitions. This yields a discrete word called a trace, which is amenable to established formal methods for path checking. The original continuous-time trajectory is shown to satisfy the specification if and only if its trace does. General topological conditions on the sample points are derived that ensure a trace is recorded for arbitrary continuous paths, given arbitrary region descriptions. Using techniques from computer algebra , a trace generation algorithm is developed to satisfy these conditions when the path and region boundaries are defined by polynomials. The proposed PolyTrace algorithm has polynomial complexity in the number of atomic propositions, and is guaranteed to produce a trace of any polynomial path. Its performance is demonstrated via numerical examples and a case study from robotics.},

  abstract     = {A subclass of finite Petri nets , called BPP nets (acronym of Basic Parallel Processes ), was recently equipped with an efficiently decidable, truly concurrent, bisimulation-based, behavioral equivalence, called team bisimilarity . This equivalence is a very intuitive extension of classic bisimulation equivalence (over labeled transition systems) to BPP nets and it is checked in a distributed manner. This paper has three goals. First of all, we provide BPP nets with various causality-based observational semantics, notably a novel semantics, called causal-net bisimilarity. Then, we define a variant semantics, called h-team bisimilarity, coarser than team bisimilarity, for which we adapt the modal logic characterization and the axiomatization of team bisimilarity. Then, we complete the study about team bisimilarity and h-team bisimilarity, by comparing them with the causality-based semantics we have introduced: the main results are that team bisimilarity coincides with causal-net bisimilarity, while h-team bisimilarity with fully-concurrent bisimilarity.},

  abstract     = {Session types describe patterns of interaction on communicating channels. Traditional session types include a form of choice whereby servers offer a collection of options, of which each client selects exactly one. Mixed choices blur the distinction between servers and clients (that is, external and internal choice) by allowing options to be both offered and selected in the same choice. We introduce mixed choices in the context of session types and argue that they increase the flexibility of program development at the same time that they reduce the number of synchronisation primitives down to exactly one. We present a type system incorporating subtyping and prove preservation and absence of runtime errors for well-typed processes. We further show that classical (conventional) sessions can be faithfully and tightly embedded in mixed choices, and conversely that there is a minimal encoding from mixed choices to classical sessions. Finally, we discuss algorithmic type checking and a runtime system built on top of a conventional (choice-less) message-passing architecture.},

  abstract     = {This paper is a ‘spiritual child’ of the 2005 lecture notes Kindergarten Quantum Mechanics Coecke (2005) [24] , which showed how a simple, pictorial extension of Dirac notation allowed several quantum features to be easily expressed and derived, using language even a kindergartner can understand. Central to that approach was the use of pictures and pictorial transformation rules to understand and derive features of quantum theory and computation. However, this approach left many wondering ‘where&#39;s the beef?’ In other words, was this new approach capable of producing new results, or was it simply an aesthetically pleasing way to restate stuff we already know? The aim of this sequel paper is to say ‘here&#39;s the beef!’, and highlight some of the major results of the approach advocated in Kindergarten Quantum Mechanics, and how they are being applied to tackle practical problems on real quantum computers . Toward that end, we will focus mainly on what has become the Swiss army knife of the pictorial formalism: the ZX-calculus , a graphical tool for representing and manipulating complex linear maps on 2 N 2N dimensional space. First we look at some of the ideas behind the ZX-calculus, comparing and contrasting it with the usual quantum circuit formalism. We then survey results from the past few years falling into three categories: (1) completeness of the rules of the ZX-calculus, (2) state-of-the-art quantum circuit optimisation results in commercial and open-source quantum compilers relying on ZX, and (3) the use of ZX in translating real-world stuff like natural language into quantum circuits that can be run on today&#39;s (very limited) quantum hardware. We also take the title literally, and outline an ongoing experiment aiming to show that ZX-calculus enables children to do cutting-edge quantum computing stuff. If anything, this would truly confirm that ‘kindergarten quantum mechanics’ wasn&#39;t just a joke.},
