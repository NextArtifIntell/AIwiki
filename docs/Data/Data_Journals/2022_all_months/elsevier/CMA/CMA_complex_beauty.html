  abstract     = {The objective of the current work is to define a design optimization methodology in aerodynamics, in which all numerical components are based on a unique geometrical representation, consistent with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) standards. In particular, the design is parameterized by Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), the computational domain is automatically constructed using rational Bézier elements extracted from NURBS boundaries without any approximation and the resolution of the flow equations relies on an adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method based on rational representations. A Bayesian framework is used to optimize NURBS control points, in a single- or multi-objective, constrained, global optimization framework. The resulting methodology is therefore fully CAD-consistent, high-order in space and time, includes local adaption and shock capturing capabilities, and exhibits high parallelization performance. The proposed methods are described in details and their properties are established. Finally, two design optimization problems are provided as illustrations: the shape optimization of an airfoil in transonic regime, for drag reduction with lift constraint, and the multi-objective optimization of the control law of a morphing airfoil in subsonic regime, regarding the time-averaged lift, the minimum instantaneous lift and the energy consumption.},

This paper provides a complete investigation of the inverse problem for fault transmissibility in subsurface flow models, under appropriate assumptions on fault structure. In particular, the following aspects are considered: 1) fault modeling and well-posedness of the forward problem ; 2) finite element (FEM) discretizations of the forward problem and their rigorous a priori convergence analysis ; 3) Well-posedness of the Bayesian inverse problem, FEM discretization of the infinite dimensional Bayesian inverse formulation, and its rigorous a priori analysis. Moreover, computation of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point via fast inexact Newton-conjugate gradient optimization and a Laplace approximation of the Bayesian posterior are also presented. Numerical results illustrate the use of the proposed fault model in forward and inverse problems for subsurface flows in two dimensional domains with multiple faults.},

Under the assumption that the corresponding linear parabolic differential equation without memory term is approximately controllable, it is shown that the set of approximate controls is nonempty. The problem is first viewed as a constrained optimal control problem , and then it is approximated by an unconstrained problem with a suitable penalty function. The optimal pair of the constrained problem is obtained as the limit of the optimal pair sequence of the unconstrained problem. The result is proved by using the theory of strongly continuous semigroups and the Banach fixed point theorem . The approximation theorems , which guarantee the convergence of the numerical scheme to the optimal pair sequence, are also proved.

In this paper, we present a three-field mixed finite-element formulation for fourth-order problems, with a focus on the effective treatment of the different boundary conditions that arise naturally in a variational formulation . Our formulation is based on introducing the gradient of the solution as an explicit variable, constrained using a Lagrange multiplier . The essential boundary conditions are enforced weakly, using Nitsche&#39;s method where required. As a result, the problem is rewritten as a saddle-point system, requiring analysis of the resulting finite-element discretization and the construction of optimal linear solvers. Here, we discuss the analysis of the well-posedness and accuracy of the finite-element formulation. Moreover, we develop monolithic multigrid solvers for the resulting linear systems . Two and three-dimensional numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the discretization and efficiency of the multigrid solvers proposed.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous image denoising and deblurring is a challenging issue because noise and edges are both high-frequency signals, and eliminating noise while enhancing edges counteracts each other. In this paper, we deal with this difficulty by designing a novel coupled time-fractional diffusion along with a fractional shock filter and developing a powerful discretization approach. The discretization process is based on the finite difference and L 1 L1 approximations for integer and fractional order derivatives, respectively. This scheme not only removes noise and sharpens edges efficiently, but also weakens the staircase effect. The stability analysis of the proposed scheme is also investigated. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other related approaches and can be applied to large-scale and chest X-Ray images.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new finite difference unequal-sized Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory (US-HWENO) scheme is proposed for solving multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on structured meshes , which could achieve sixth-order accuracy in one dimension and fifth-order accuracy in two and three dimensions , respectively. The high-order spatial reconstruction procedure uses a convex combination of one quintic polynomial and two linear polynomials defined on three unequal-sized central or biased spatial stencils. Compared with the classical finite difference, finite volume, or mixed finite difference and finite volume HWENO schemes [32] , [33] , the new scheme uses same largest stencil and only three stencils in spatial reconstruction procedures, and the first-order derivative values in auxiliary equations can be obtained directly rather than using complex HWENO-type reconstruction methodologies [32] , [33] . Moreover, the associated viscosity terms could be directly computed from the function values and first-order derivative values by using the characteristic of the WENO-type spatial reconstructions. Meanwhile, the linear weights can be any positive numbers on condition that their summation equals one, which avoids the problem of negative linear weights in classical HWENO schemes [24] , [25] . So the new finite difference US-HWENO scheme is more suitable for solving Navier-Stokes equations, and can be easily implemented to multi-dimensions on structured meshes . Some benchmark viscous examples are illustrated to verify the good performance of this new finite difference US-HWENO scheme.},

  abstract     = {Over the years, energy-dissipation-preserving (EDP) numerical methods (EDP-NMs) for the nonlinear system of energy dissipation have attracted considerable attention because they are good at long-term computations. More recently, the invariant energy quadratization methods (IEQMs) have been proposed by Xiaofeng Yang and his collaborators to construct linearized EDP-NMs for the nonlinear system of energy dissipation , such as gradient flows . However, the system of the linear algebraic equations corresponding to the obtained EDP-NMs involves the variable coefficient matrices in general, thus resulting in complex computations. Besides, most of efficient alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods are not able to preserve the structures of continuous problem, such as, energy dissipation , energy conservation. To overcome these shortcomings, taking two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear Allen-Cahn equation for example, two energy-dissipation-preserving ADI finite difference methods (FDMs) have been developed by using IEQMs. Numerical analyses of them, such as, the discrete energy-dissipation laws, error estimations and stabilities, have been derived in detail. Numerical results support the theoretical analysis, and confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithms.},

The reformulation uses techniques such as tuning of free parameters and augmentation of close-to-rank-deficient operators. It is designed for the eddy current regime and works both for surfaces of genus 0 and 1. Well-conditioned systems and field representations are obtained despite the Maxwell transmission problem being ill-conditioned for genus 1 surfaces due to the presence of Neumann eigenfields. Furthermore, it is shown that these eigenfields, for ordinary conductors in the eddy current regime, are different from the classical Neumann eigenfields for superconductors . Numerical examples , based on the reformulation, give an unprecedented 13-digit accuracy both for transmitted and scattered fields.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on the numerical study of one and two dimensional higher order multi-term time fractional partial differential equations. In the adopted strategy, the temporal fractional derivative is replaced via well known L 1 L1 formula and the integer order space derivatives are approximated by truncated one and two dimensional wavelet series. The fascinating nature of the scheme is to use collocation approach which convert the governing equations to the system of algebraic equations from which the wavelet coefficients can be calculated. Next, stability of the proposed scheme is investigated theoretically which is also the fundamental subject of the current work. Further computational convergence rate is computed which predicts that the order is approximately two. The scheme is applied to solve one dimensional beam models (fourth order partial differential equations) and two dimensional fissured rock models (Sobolev equations). Efficiency of the scheme is examined with the help of various error norms such as I ∞ , I r m s I∞,Irms and I 2 I2 . Simulations indicate pretty much good results from which we can say that the scheme is suitable and robust for both one and two dimensional problems.},

Optimal error estimates and superconvergence of the energy-preserving scheme are proved rigorously without any time-step restriction, which cover a general nonlinearity . There are two ingredients in our analysis. First, a temporal-spatial error splitting argument is employed to split the error into temporal error and spatial error. Second, by use of the cut-off function technique for the nonlinearity, the discrete auxiliary problems are introduced so as to verify the well-posedness of temporal semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes, and to derive the temporal error with order O ( τ 2 ) O(τ2) in H 2 H2 -norm and spatial error with order O ( τ 2 + h 2 ) O(τ2+h2) in H 1 H1 -norm, respectively. In addition, by virtue of the idea of combination between interpolation and projection, as well as the interpolated postprocessing technique, the superclose and superconvergence results of order O ( τ 2 + h 2 ) O(τ2+h2) in H 1 H1 -norm are deduced for the fully-discrete scheme.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel method to calculate the structural sensitivity in non-linear flows. The method is completely data-driven and only uses direct solutions, avoiding the need to calculate the adjoint solution. Moreover, the method can be directly applied to calculate the structural sensitivity in three-dimensional flows. Depending on the nature and the complexity of the data analysed, the methodology presented to calculate this so-called non-linear structural sensitivity, uses dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) or higher order DMD to identify the global modes leading the flow dynamics. The performance of this novel technique has been tested in the two-dimensional wake of a circular cylinder at Reynolds number (Re) 50, 60, 85, 100, 130 and 160, the three-dimensional wake of a circular cylinder at Re = 280 Re=280 and spanwise wavelength L z = 1.67 Lz=1.67 and 6.99, in a Food and Drug and Administration nozzle at Re = 800 Re=800 and in two-concentric jets with similar velocity ratio at Re = 1500 Re=1500 . The results have been compared with the structural sensitivity predicted by the linear theory , finding some similarities and discrepancies between both methods. Nevertheless, the highest structural sensitivity regions identified by this novel algorithm are in good agreement with the literature, where the flow instabilities have been controlled using different mechanisms of passive flow control located in the regions predicted by the non-linear structural sensitivity calculated in this article.},

It has been confirmed that subspace migration is fast, stable, and effective, and can be applied not only to full- but also limited-view inverse problems when a sufficient number of incidents and the corresponding scattered fields are applied and collected. However, the application to the imaging of sound-hard arcs in limited-view problems is somewhat heuristic. Motivated by this, we analyze the imaging functions employed in subspace migration for limited-view inverse scattering problems with and without a priori information of the unit normal vector to the arcs. This is achieved by determining a relationship between an infinite series of Bessel functions with integer order of the first kind and the unit normal vector based on the physical factorization of the multi-static response (MSR), whose elements are measured as a far-field pattern in the presence of arcs. The identified structures explain various intrinsic properties of subspace migration. The results of various numerical simulations with noisy data are exhibited to corroborate the theoretical results.},

However, to allow for lossy materials, we extend the Fokas method to complex wavenumbers. The novel formalism, employing pulse-shaped local basis functions, natively supports combined magnetic and dielectric contrast, accurately captures the skin effect , and is conveniently integrated in traditional boundary integral equation formulations. The correctness and versatility of our technique are verified for various examples by means of analytical validation and through comparison with a Poggio-Miller-Chan-Harrington-Wu-Tsai approach, a volume integral equation method and a commercial solver.},

It consists in training a neural network to approximate the solution of the differential problem, minimizing a suitable cost function built, taking into account the physics constraint given by the model. In particular, since physics laws are injected through a loss function containing integral terms in our case, an approach based on quasi Monte-Carlo integration methods has been implemented. Moreover, an adaptive strategy to increase the model accuracy, exploiting topological information related to the shape of the solution, has been developed. Finally, when available, comparisons with the analytical solutions and studies in the case of non-convex domains assess the reliability of the PINN approach in the examined context.},

In order to improve the parallel efficiency, we propose a new 2D pencil-like parallel configuration with totally 6 different pencil arrangements. A parallel Thomas algorithm is also included to further reduce the communication overhead when solving tridiagonal equations. In addition, we perform an optimal search method in the initializing stage to find the fastest Poisson solver scheme among four alternatives for a specific mesh configuration. The runtime ratio between traditional pencil-like Poisson solver and present solver is about 1.5. An approximate linear strong scaling performance is achieved, and the weak scaling performance is also improved.

In general, the oxide scale layer and skid marks have a huge impact on the temperature distributions of the slab. Thus, an optimal control problem with a 3-dimensional (3D) numerical model is proposed to reduce the generation of skid marks, oxide scale layer and energy losses for the reheating furnace. Firstly, a 3D numerical Partial Difference Equation (PDE) model is built by considering the formation of the oxide scale layer and skid marks. The proposed model is implied by the parallel implementation strategy of GPU to reduce the computational time. Secondly, the 3D PDE-constrained optimal control problem is developed for the reheating furnace and solved by the proposed modified conjugate gradient (MCG) method. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed 3D model is verified by the industry measurement data, and the fast convergence performance of the MCG method is also validated.

The proposed formulation relies on the discrete extension operator proposed in the aggregated finite element method. This formulation is robust with respect to the location of the boundary/interface within the cell. One can prove enhanced stability results, not only on the physical domain, but on the whole active mesh. However, the stability constants grow exponentially with the polynomial order being used, since the underlying extension operators are defined via extrapolation. To address this issue, we introduce a new variant of aggregated finite elements, in which the extension in the physical domain is an interpolation for polynomials of order higher than two. As a result, the stability constants only grow at a polynomial rate with the order of approximation . We demonstrate that this approach enables robust high-order approximations with the aggregated finite element method. The proposed method is consistent, optimally convergent, and with a condition number that scales optimally for high order approximation.},

The finite element discretization is based on mixed conforming elements , where the hydrodynamic unknowns are approximated by stable finite element pairs, and the current density and electric potential are discretized by divergence-conforming face elements and discontinuous volume elements . This fully discrete scheme only needs to solve a linear subsystem at each time step and yields an exactly divergence-free current density directly. We show that the proposed scheme is well-posed and unconditionally energy stable. Under a weak regularity hypothesis on the exact solution, we present the error estimates for velocity, current density and electric potential.

The method is based on the utilization of a new dual-mixed formulation recently introduced for the Navier-Stokes problem, which is coupled with a classical primal formulation for the Maxwell equations . The latter implies that the velocity and a pseudostress tensor relating the velocity gradient with the convective term for the hydrodynamic equations , together with the magnetic field and a Lagrange multiplier related with the divergence-free property of the magnetic field , become the main unknowns of the system. Then the associated Galerkin scheme can be defined by employing Raviart–Thomas elements of degree k for the aforementioned pseudostress tensor, discontinuous piecewise polynomial elements of degree k for the velocity, Nédélec elements of degree k for the magnetic field and Lagrange elements of degree k for the associated Lagrange multiplier . The analysis of the continuous and discrete problems are carried out by means of the Lax–Milgram lemma, the Banach–Nečas–Babuška and Banach fixed-point theorems, under a sufficiently small data assumption. In particular, the analysis of the discrete scheme requires a quasi-uniformity assumption on mesh. We also develop an a priori error analysis and show that the proposed finite element method is optimal convergent.

  abstract     = {Nowadays data is acquiring an indisputable importance in every field including engineering. In the past, experimental data was used to calibrate state-of-the art models. Once the model was optimally calibrated, numerical simulations were run. However, data can offer much more, playing a more important role than calibration or statistical analysis in the modeling/simulation process. Indeed, today data is gathered and used to train models able to replace complex engineering systems. The more and better the training data, the more accurate the model is. However, in engineering experimental data use to be the best data but also the most expensive in time and computing effort. Therefore, numerical simulations, cheaper and faster, are used instead but, even if they are closed to reality, they always present an error related to the ignorance of the engineer over the complex real system. It seems thus coherent to take advantage of each approach. This leads to the “hybrid twin” rationale. On the one hand, numerical simulations are computed as primary data source, assuming their inherent error. On the other hand, some experimental data is gathered to train a machine learning correction model which fills the prediction-measurement gap. However, learning this ignorance gap becomes difficult in some fields such as fluids dynamics, where a regression over the localized solutions can lead to non physical interpolated solutions. Therefore, the “hybrid twin” methodology proposed in this article relies on Optimal Transport theory, which provides a mathematical framework to measure distances between general objects and a completely different interpolation approach between functions.},

Theory and numerical results show that the solution is uniformly convergent with respect to the perturbed parameter ε . From the view of computation, our method is efficient since the fewest number of DOFs are employed and the local stiffness matrix takes less computation time than the usual finite element method due to the special construction of free formula.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining natural and realistic restorations from the noisy images contaminated by multiplicative noise is a challenging task in image processing . To get over this conundrum, by introducing the non-convex potential functions into the total variation and high-order total variation regularizers, we investigate a novel hybrid non-convex optimization model for image restoration. Numerically, to optimize the resulting high-order PDE system, a proximal linearized alternating minimization method, based on the classical iteratively reweighted ℓ 1 ℓ1 algorithm and variable splitting technique , is designed in detail. Meanwhile, the convergence of the constructed algorithm is also established on the basis of convex analysis . The provided numerical experiments point out that our new scheme shows superiorities in both visual effects and quantitative comparison , especially in terms of the staircase aspects suppression and edge details preservation, compared with some popular denoising methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new strategy to establish less time-consuming upwind compact difference method with adjusted dissipation is introduced for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in the streamfunction-velocity form efficiently. By weighted combination of the numerical solutions calculated using the upwind term and the downwind term of the general third-order upwind compact scheme (UCD3), a new fourth-order compact formulation and a third-order upwind compact formulation with adjusted dissipation nature are proposed for computing the first derivatives. Further, they are used to approximate the biharmonic term and the convective terms in the streamfunction-velocity formulation of the N-S equations, respectively. Meanwhile, the first derivatives of the streamfunction (velocities) in the coefficients in the convective terms are solved by the newly proposed fourth-order compact formulation. Temporal discretization for the streamfunction-velocity formulation is addressed with the help of the second-order Crank-Nicolson scheme. Moreover, the newly proposed scheme for the linear models is proved to be unconditionally stable by virtue of the discrete Fourier analysis . Finally, five numerical problems, viz. the analytic solution , Taylor-Green vortex problem, doubly periodic double shear layer flow problem, lid-driven square cavity flow problem and two-sided square cavity flow problem are solved numerically to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the present method. Results solved by the present method match well with the analytic solutions and the existing results proving the accuracy of it. What is more, it is less time-consuming and has lower dissipation than the existing method [20] .},

  abstract     = {A novel adaptive numerical approach is developed for an accurate and computationally efficient phase-field modelling of dendritic solidification. The adaptivity is based on the dynamic quadtree domain decomposition. A quadtree decomposes the computational domain into rectangular sub-domains of different sizes. Each sub-domain is extended to ensure overlap communication between neighbouring sub-domains. In each sub-domain, uniform distribution of computational nodes is generated. The product between the node density and the sub-domain area is fixed to ensure the h-adaptivity. The adaptive approach provides the highest density of computational nodes at the solid-liquid interface and the lowest density in the bulk of the phases. The meshless radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method is applied for the spatial discretisation of the partial differential equations which arise from the phase-field model. The RBF-FD method is especially appealing since it allows straightforward spatial discretisation of partial differential equations on scattered node distributions. The use of scattered node distribution reduces the discretisation-induced anisotropy in the phase-field modelling of dendritic growth. The forward Euler scheme is used for temporal discretisation. The adaptive time-stepping is employed to speed up the calculations further. The performance of the novel numerical approach is tested for dendritic solidification of supercooled pure melts and supersaturated dilute binary alloys at arbitrary preferential growth directions. The impact of the numerical parameters on the accuracy and computational efficiency is thoroughly analysed. It is shown that the RBF-FD method, defined on scattered node distribution, together with the space-time adaptive approach, represents an accurate and efficient technique for solving the phase-field models of dendritic solidification.},

  abstract     = {Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) plays an important role in the analysis of complex nonlinear systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), since it can describe the full-order system in a simplified but representative way using a handful of dominant dynamic modes. However, determining a POD from the results of complex unsteady simulations is often impractical using traditional approaches due to the need to store a large number of high-dimensional solutions. As an alternative, the incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been developed, which can be used to avoid the storage problem by performing the POD analysis on the fly using a single-pass updating algorithm. Nevertheless, the total computing cost of incremental SVD is more than traditional approaches. In order to reduce this total cost, we incorporate POD mode truncation into the incremental procedure, leading to an enhanced algorithm for incremental SVD. Two error estimators are formulated for this enhanced incremental SVD based on an aggregated expression of the snapshot solutions, equipping the proposed algorithm with criteria for choosing the truncation number. The effectiveness of these estimators and the parallel efficiency of the enhanced algorithm are demonstrated using transient solutions from representative model problems. Numerical results show that the enhanced algorithm can significantly improve the computing efficiency for different kinds of datasets, and that the proposed algorithm is scalable in both the strong and weak sense.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an interface-resolved model for simulating the solid-liquid phase transition problems. In the method, the natural convection flow is handled by the recently proposed discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS). Compared with the conventional lattice Boltzmann equation, DUGKS has more advantages on numerical stability and multiscale computation. On the other hand, the ghost-cell (GC) immersed boundary scheme is applied to capturing the solid-liquid interface of pure material. In contrast to the phase-field or enthalpy-based method, the interface here with zero thickness is resolved and explicitly tracked on the fixed Cartesian grid. It is worth noting that due to the adsorption or release of latent heat, the phase front should be evolved according to the Stefan condition. Since compatible with the GC method, the position of the melting front is directly identified by the intersection point, and the complicated treatment of marker inserting and/or deleting in the previous studies is removed.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we report numerical simulations for dynamic fracture and fragmentation problems in brittle materials using a recently developed split strain energy diffusive mass-field damage model in terms of standard finite element method (FEM). The enhanced constitutive laws for mass source and mass flux by means of strain energy decomposition are adopted to overcome certain drawbacks of the original non-split model. We present theoretical formulations in a more general way that is suitable and valid for both small and finite deformation regimes. The coupled system of equations is derived in which the momentum is governed to describe the time-dependent deformation of brittle solids whereas the mass-diffusion balance equations are for the evolution of mass density. We also develop simple techniques for determining crack velocity and estimating amount of mass loss. Numerical examples are considered for both small and finite deformations. The accuracy and performance of the developed theory for dynamic brittle fracture are illustrated through comparison and verification, which are to compare the computed results with respect to experimental data and other numerical methods in terms of crack path trajectories, dynamic response, energy dissipation, and other relevant numerical aspects.},

These new mixed methods are particularly interesting, as with only minor modifications they can be applied to a much broader range of flows, including non-isothermal weakly-compressible flows, and fully-compressible flows. In the main body of this paper, we carefully develop these mixed methods for solving the Boussinesq model equations. Thereafter, we establish the L2-stability of the discrete temperature and velocity fields . In addition, we obtain rigorous error estimates for the temperature and velocity fields .

In the present work, the simulation of transport of two chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin and cisplatin) in electroporated cancerous tissues is carried out using the Global Method of Approximate Particular Solutions (Global MAPS), which is a meshless method having several computational advantages over finite element and finite volume methods commonly used in this kind of problems. Numerical parameters involved in Global MAPS simulations are calibrated by means of validation with results previously published in literature, points-number and time-step dependency analyses, and convergence analysis on a relaxation factor, obtaining satisfactory results. Voltage levels of 300 V, 350 V and 400 V, and pulse spacing of 10 s, 100 s and single pulse are considered as input electroporation parameters, whose influence on the following variables is analyzed: magnitude and distribution of electric field in the pulse stage; extracellular and intracellular concentrations of medicament in the pre-pulse and post-pulse diffusion stages, identifying different transport mechanism (internalization and extracellular diffusion) and the concentration equilibrium condition when reached; and efficiency and aggressiveness of the electroporation protocol. In general, numerical results point out that this influence highly depends on the drug type used during the electrochemotherapy treatment.},

The quasi-area functional is constructed by a balanced sum among the quasi-harmonic functional, Dirichlet functional and a functional which measures isothermality. It improves greatly the approximation efficiency of existing methods. Therefore in this paper, based on the quasi-area functional, we introduce two methods to study the triangular Plateau-Bézier problem. On the one hand, we minimize directly the functional among all the triangular Bézier surfaces with prescribed border determined by the exterior control points. On the other hand, we compute and analyze the Euler-Lagrange equation of the quasi-area functional. Both methods are illustrated by some representative examples to show the effectiveness.},

The lifting operator lifts WG test functions into H ( div ) H(div) -subspaces and removes pressure dependence of velocity errors.

This study thus aims at developing a numerical algorithm that is based on a modified truncated Euler-Maruyama (EM) method and positivity preserving. We first study global positivity for the solution of the SADPS model in a polluted environment. Subsequently, we present a semi-discrete Galerkin finite element method in an age variable, and construct a full-discrete numerical approximation using modified truncated EM scheme on time to preserve positivity. Under certain suitable regularity conditions, estimates of convergence error of the full-discrete and a semi-discrete scheme are presented.

To further simplify its implementation, we introduce a new nonlocal variable and its time evolution equation, so we end up with a fully decoupled scheme. Under the premise of satisfying strict unconditional energy stability, the scheme only needs to solve several completely independent elliptic equations with constant coefficients at each time step. We provide the rigorous energy stability proof, the detailed implementation of the proposed scheme, and further perform some numerical simulations of triblock polymer materials under applied shear flow in 2D and 3D to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed numerical scheme .},

  abstract     = {The paper concerns with accurate evaluation of local fields in problems, like those of fracture mechanics , for which extreme, rather than mean values, are of prime significance. We focus on large-scale problems, solved iteratively by a boundary element method (BEM) with employing the kernel independent fast multipole method (KI-FMM) for decreasing the complexity of matrix-to-vector multiplications. We aim to study the accuracy of individual translations far-fields for the major types of kernels (weakly singular, singular and hypersingular) entering the boundary integral equations (BIE) of harmonic and elasticity problems in 2D and 3D. It is revealed, analytically and numerically, that (i) the accuracy of individual translations of fields, generated by sources involving the normal at a source point , is notably less than that by sources independent on the normal; (ii) the accuracy is notably less for a hypersingular BIE, then for a singular BIE; and (iii) under the same complexity, the accuracy of translations, performed by using smooth (circular in 2D, spherical in 3D) equivalent surfaces (ES), is notably better than that when using non-smooth (square in 2D, cubic in 3D) ES. These conclusions yield recommendations for minimizing the complexity without loss of the accuracy of translated fields.},

  abstract     = {Guided by the von Neumann and non-modal analyses, we investigate the dispersion and diffusion properties of collocated discontinuous Galerkin methods with the summation-by-parts property coupled with the simultaneous approximation technique. We use the linear advection and linear advection-diffusion equations as model problems. The analysis is carried out by varying the order of the spatial discretization, the Péclet number, and looking at the effect of the upwind term. The eigenanalysis is verified to provide insights into the numerical errors based on the behavior of the primary mode. The dispersion and diffusion errors associated with the spatial discretization are shown to behave according to the primary- or physical- mode in the range of low wavenumbers. In this context, the discretization of the model problems is verified to be stable for all flow regimes and independent of the solution polynomial degree. The effect of the upwind term shows that its effect decreases by increasing the accuracy of the discretization. Further, two analyses that includes all modes are used to get better insights into the diffusion and robustness of the scheme. From the non-modal analysis, the short-term diffusion is computed for different flow regimes and solution polynomial degrees. The energy decay or long-term diffusion based on all eigenmodes based on the eigenmodes matrix is analyzed for t &gt; 0 t&amp;gt;0 and different spatial discretizations. The results are validated against under-resolved turbulence simulations of the Taylor–Green vortex at two Reynolds numbers, i.e. , Re = 100 Re=100 and 1600, and a Mach number Ma = 0.1 Ma=0.1 , and the decaying of compressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence at a Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale of Re λ = 100 Reλ=100 and a turbulent Mach number of Ma t = 0.6 Mat=0.6 .},

  abstract     = {Transient nonlinear problems play an important role in many engineering problems. Phase-field equations, including the well-known Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations, fall in this category, and have applications in cutting-edge technologies such as modeling the diffusion of lithium (Li) ions in two-phase electrode particles of Li-ion batteries. In this paper, a local meshless method for solving this category of partial differential equations (PDEs) is proposed. The Newton-Kantorovich scheme is employed to transform the nonlinear PDEs to an iterative series of linear ones which can be solved with the proposed method. The accuracy and performance of the method are examined in various linear and nonlinear problems , such as Laplace equation , three dimensional elasticity as well as some abstract mathematical equations with linear or nonlinear boundary conditions. The main focus of the work is on applying the proposed method in solution of the phase-field equations, including the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations. In addition to homogeneous Neumann boundary condition which has been widely examined in the literature, we also employ a practical nonlinear, inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition formulation specialized for modeling the diffusion of lithium ions in electrode particles of Li-ion batteries. The generalized- α method is used for time integration of diffusion-type equations to overcome the intrinsic stiffness of the phase-field equations. It is shown that the method is capable of capturing the main features of the phase-field models i.e. phase separation, coarsening and energy decay in closed systems .},

Well-posedness of the coupled problem is analyzed and existence along with uniqueness of the weak solution is investigated based on a fixed-point method. An iterative scheme for solving the associated fixed-point problem is proposed and its convergence is studied. Numerical experiments are presented for two examples of coupled convection-diffusion-reaction problems. Applications to radiative heat transfer and propagation of thermal fronts in porous media are also included in this study.

The time dimension is regarded as a pseudo-space dimension to generate the space-time Euler metric r T rT in STRBF, which can be applied to transform the d -dimensional transient governing equation into ( d + 1 ) (d+1) -dimensional steady-state governing equation. Benefiting from merits of the traditional BSM, an accurate numerical solution is available with only a few of computational points.

  abstract     = {The weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) method has been widely used for solving hydrodynamic problems, in which the fluid is assumed to be weakly compressible through limiting the density deviation to a small value. Despite its simplicity and robustness in implementation, the WCSPH method is generally hindered by its poor accuracy and spurious oscillations in the pressure field which may lead to numerical instability . In order to dampen the spurious oscillations without introducing excessive dissipation, a Roe-type approximate Riemann solver with a low-dissipation limiter was proposed and applied to the WCSPH method by Zhang et al. (2017). The present paper aims to extend this low-dissipation Riemann solver to the finite particle method (FPM), which can be referred to an enhanced or modified version of the conventional SPH method, for reducing spurious pressure oscillations and meanwhile achieving higher order of accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate that the Riemann solver based FPM is effective in modeling incompressible flows and it produces a more accurate flow field than the conventional WCSPH and Riemann solver based WCSPH methods.},

The coupling method which is based on taking the advantages of the continuity and boundedness properties of the conservative level-set (LS) function and the mass conservation property of the VOF approach is integrated into a Navier-Stokes solution to build a new free surface solver. The developed solver is then validated with several practical free surface flows of engineering applications . The test cases are selected so that the developed solver is challenged in simulations of flows with a large scale of density ratio, high-nonlinear, and complicated free surface in a wide range of engineering applications to explore its capability. The simulated flow fields are presented and compared with the available experimental data and of other numerical simulations. Good agreement is achieved implying the capability of the developed solver, and also exhibiting the ability to extend to other applications.},

The partial differentials are transformed into the set of nonlinear differential equations through boundary layer estimations and similarity substitutions, then computed by applying a variational finite element strategy. Researchers are looking into tiny nanoparticles because they have amazing properties, such as excellent thermal conduction, which are needed in advanced nanotechnology, heat exchangers, materials engineering, and technologies. The significance of this extensive study is to enhance the heat transition. Various aspects of the aggregation parameters on nanofluid velocity and temperature patterns are investigated and visually illustrated concerning the involved physical parameters. The effect of nanoparticle aggregation on the boundary is descending by the including parameters causes an increment in heat transfer rate. A significant correlation has been observed between the sets of results, which represents the accuracy of the finite element method used herein.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the collocation spectral method (CSM) combined with domain decomposition method is developed to solve the radiative transfer equation in two-dimensional irregular domains. Three benchmark problems consist of the square enclosure, the L-shaped enclosure and the square enclosure with a centered obstruction are solved and compared with the published data to validate the ability of present developed method. The comparison shows good agreements and indicates that the method has a good accuracy for all problems. Then, the performances of influence matrix technique and iterative substructuring technique to exchange the radiative information between subdomains are compared. It is found that, in the serial computations, the computational cost of influence matrix technique is hundreds of times more expensive than that of iterative substructuring technique. The high cost of influence matrix technique is due to that the radiative intensity is a high dimensional variable with angular dependence, and tremendous subproblems have to be solved to construct the influence matrix. Finally, the modified CSM with domain decomposition, in which the radiative intensity is decomposed into three components, the real wall-related one, the virtual shared interface-related one, and the medium-related one, is proposed. The first two components are solved analytically, and the last one is still solved by the CSM. With such treatments, the computational cost is slightly increased, but the ray effect originated from step-change temperature of medium or step-change optical parameters can be effectively mitigated. Besides, the modified CSM with domain decomposition can also avoid the ray effect due to shadowing singularities. But it should be noted that, in such case, the ray effect due to inhomogeneous spatial distribution of source term may emerge. In conclusion, the CSM combined with domain decomposition is a good alternative method for thermal radiation calculation in complex geometry which can be decomposed into regular subdomains.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a class of GPU-based corrected explicit-implicit domain decomposition schemes (GCEIDD) is proposed to accelerate the solution of convection-dominated diffusion problems on GPUs. All of these methods take advantage of the fractional steps and corrected explicit-implicit domain decomposition techniques. In each sweep, the domain is decomposed into many strip-divided subdomains. The aim is to reduce the size and increase the number of tri-diagonal systems to provide enough parallelism to keep the GPU occupied. In different steps of the algorithms, we use low-complexity schemes with a high degree of parallelism. The generic form of GCEIDD allows different schemes for the prediction, correction, and one-dimensional implicit solution. We have proposed two methods based on modified upwind and characteristics finite difference and a combined method that bypasses the limitations of these two. Also, important aspects of CUDA programming, which are critical to the implementation of the GCEIDD algorithm, are discussed in detail. For solving tri-diagonal systems, a three-stage strategy is proposed, which creates a balance between occupancy, cache hit rate, and shared memory usage and reduces cache contentions. Results show that GCEIDD has good accuracy and stability even when the number of subdomains is very large. The proposed method can accelerate the solution by a factor of up to 3 compared with the GPU implementation of the classic fractional step methods.},

Instead of the standard hyperbolic level set reinitialization, the flow of time Eikonal equation is discretized to construct an approximate signed distance function . Using the Eikonal equation removes the regularization parameter in the standard approach which allows more predictable behavior and faster convergence speeds around the interface. This makes our approach very efficient especially for banded level set formulations.

It is a fast algorithm to obtain the stiffness matrix of an arbitrary quadrilateral element . The computation of the stiffness matrix is sampled in two stages over the same domain. For the first approximation with one sub-cell, unstable one-point sampling is applied for the entire element. Then, One-point sampling is applied independently to each of the four sub-squares of the mapped 2-square of the element quadrilateral and assembled. The matrix is recast in terms of its corner node variables using transition-element type adaptation yielding a stable second approximation. Weighted addition of the approximations by Richardson extrapolation produces a stable stiffness matrix, in a third of the time for, and as good as by, Gauss quadrature and smoothed finite element method .

  abstract     = {Thermal-hydraulics safety requirements for the second and third generation of nuclear reactors led to the development of innovative passive safety systems. In particular, new devices must be developed involving numerical simulations for turbulent two-phase flows around complex geometries . To reduce the time-consuming mesh generation phase when testing various geometries, we use a fictitious domain approach. More specifically, we choose the Penalized Direct Forcing Method to take into account inflow obstacles. Following a recent work, involving the resolution of the one-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a projection scheme and the Finite Element Method , this paper focuses on different techniques to recover data from the discrete immersed boundary and different ways to achieve order 2 in space via linear interpolation . Indeed, we investigate two data reconstruction approaches (one based on various weighted averaging, the other based on optimization) and compare their results for cylindrical and NACA0012 airfoil shapes : they provide similar accuracy but the weighting is much faster in terms of execution time . We also investigate three different interpolation types: unidirectional, multi-directional and a new hybrid between the two. The Taylor-Couette flow and the flow around a circular cylinder are used to carry out mesh convergence studies. Globally, order 2 in space is numerically assessed in both L 2 L2 and L ∞ L∞ norms for all the interpolation types, which is consistent with theoretical expectations – even if the space convergence order is a bit higher for the multi-directional approach. For the flow around a circular cylinder, the values of aerodynamic coefficients and Strouhal number are in good agreement with the literature, especially when using directional interpolation. Finally, an industrial case, representative of passive safety systems, is presented to assess the robustness and capability of the method. The simulations tend to show that, here again, the directional interpolation offers the best behavior when dealing with complex geometries and relatively coarse meshes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely used to solve partial differential equations alongside numerical methods because PINNs can be trained without observations and deal with continuous-time problems directly. In contrast, optimizing the parameters of such models is difficult, and individual training sessions must be performed to predict the evolutions of each different initial condition. To alleviate the first problem, observed data can be injected directly into the loss function part. To solve the second problem, a network architecture can be built as a framework to learn a finite difference method. In view of the two motivations, we propose Five-point stencil CNNs (FCNNs) containing a five-point stencil kernel and a trainable approximation function for reaction-diffusion type equations including the heat, Fisher&#39;s, Allen–Cahn, and other reaction-diffusion equations with trigonometric function terms. We show that FCNNs can learn finite difference schemes using few data and achieve the low relative errors of diverse reaction-diffusion evolutions with unseen initial conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FCNNs can still be trained well even with using noisy data.},

  abstract     = {Supersonic combustion ramjet engine involves complex flow physics including shock-turbulent boundary layer interaction (STBLI) and shock-induced separations. The general approach while using an averaged Navier-Stokes equations to capture these flow separation, due to the flow physics and/or geometry accurately, is to use a low-Reynolds turbulence model. This requires the placement of first grid point in the viscous sublayer ( y + ≃ 1 y+≃1 ), which implies a need of finer mesh near the wall leading to an overall increase in number of cells in the computational domain and thus an increase in overall computational time . The wall-function method is a substitute to this approach which allows for the use of a coarser mesh in the region near to the wall. However, the standard wall-function methods are generally not very successful in capturing flow separations. In this work, we have employed a generalized wall function approach which incorporates the effect of both pressure gradient and compressibility in its formulation and have evaluated its performance for complex supersonic flow cases involving shock-turbulence boundary layer interactions (STBLI) and shock induced separations, which have not been done previously. We have shown that this method captures the flow physics accurately even with much coarser meshes near the wall. Further, insensitivity of the method to the placement of first grid point has also been demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Traditional step-size controllers make the tacit assumption that the cost of a time step is independent of the step size. This is true for explicit and implicit integrators that use direct solvers. However, in the context of exponential integrators, an iterative approach such as the Krylov method or polynomial interpolation is often employed to compute the action of the required matrix functions . This renders the assumption of constant cost, for any given step size, invalid. This is a problem for higher-order exponential integrators, as they can take relatively large step sizes based on accuracy considerations. In this manuscript, we consider an adaptive step-size controller for exponential Rosenbrock methods that determines the step size based on the premise of minimizing computational cost. The largest allowed step size, given by accuracy considerations, merely acts as a constraint. We test this approach on a range of nonlinear partial differential equations . Our results show significant improvements (up to a factor of 4 reduction in the computational cost) over the traditional step-size controller for a wide range of tolerances.},

The fractional operator is introduced to material derivative for the first time to obtain a newly defined constitutive equation of Maxwell fluid. The Fourier&#39;s law is modified accordingly. The pressure gradient is innovatively obtained by solving the differential equation, which bases on the momentum equation away from the plate. Furthermore, the numerical solutions are acquired by virtue of the finite difference method combined with L1-algorithm. It turns out to be convergent through constructing numerical example. The influence of related parameters on the velocity and temperature are performed graphically in detail. Results show that the fluid velocity and temperature distributions tend to periodic oscillation near the plate. Both the velocity and the temperature reduce with the augment of fractional derivative parameters, which indicates the velocity and the temperature boundary layer become thinner. The smaller velocity relaxation time parameter leads to enhanced velocity, meaning that the pressure promotes the fluid velocity. It is evident that all the temperature curves have a tendency to increase first and then decrease with the diverse parameters due to the thermal relaxation characteristic.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition of an image into cartoon and texture components is frequently used in many image processing applications. Here, the cartoon component has been characterized by the frequently used total variation norm. However, it becomes very challenging to obtain the texture component due to the varying nature of the texture. In general, the texture component has oscillatory behavior locally or globally. Owing to this oscillatory behavior, the texture component has been characterized via low-rank regularization which is widely used to extract texture component from the image. In the works reported till now, convex nuclear norm has been frequently used as a surrogate of the matrix rank, which is suboptimal because of shrinking each singular value equally, while the non-convex surrogate of the rank treats each singular value adaptively. In this paper, we are introducing a new tightest non-convex surrogate of the rank that assigns different weights to each singular value . The new non-convex image decomposition minimization model provides us cartoon and texture components by minimizing the total variation norm and non-convex function simultaneously. This model can also work best for many image restoration problems such as image deblurring and inpainting. The conventional alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) has been exploited as the solver of the non-convex minimization model. The proposed model works well on both globally patterned and natural images . In the experimental section, we demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.},

The fitted polygonal meshes naturally admit elements with small edges, and standard virtual element methods/finite element methods fail to handle meshes with arbitrary small edges.

For a simple step function, we explicitly compute its continuous and discontinuous piecewise constant or linear projections on discontinuity matched or non-matched meshes. For the simple discontinuity-aligned mesh case, piecewise discontinuous approximations are always good. For the general non-matched case, we explain that the piecewise discontinuous constant approximation combined with adaptive mesh refinements is a good choice to achieve accuracy without overshoots. For discontinuous piecewise linear approximations , non-trivial overshoots will be observed unless the mesh is matched with discontinuity. For continuous piecewise linear approximations, the computation is based on a “far-away assumption”, and non-trivial overshoots will always be observed under regular meshes. We calculate the explicit overshoot values for several typical cases. Numerical tests are conducted for a singularly-perturbed reaction-diffusion equation and linear hyperbolic equations to verify our findings in the paper. Also, we discuss the L 1 L1 -minimization-based methods and do not recommend such methods due to their similar behavior to L 2 L2 -based methods and more complicated implementations.},

  abstract     = {Finite element methods based on cut-cells are becoming increasingly popular because of their advantages over formulations based on body-fitted meshes for problems with moving interfaces. In such methods, the cells (or elements) which are cut by the interface between two different domains need to be integrated using special techniques in order to obtain optimal convergence rates and accurate fluxes across the interface. The adaptive integration technique in which the cells are recursively subdivided is one of the popular techniques for the numerical integration of cut-cells due to its advantages over tessellation, particularly for problems involving complex geometries in three dimensions . Although adaptive integration does not impose any limitations on the representation of the geometry of immersed solids as it requires only point location algorithms, it becomes computationally expensive for recovering optimal convergence rates. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the adaptive integration of cut-cells for applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction. We assess the effect of the accuracy of integration of cut cells on convergence rates in velocity and pressure fields, and then on forces and displacements for fluid-structure interaction problems by studying several examples in two and three dimensions. By taking the computational cost and the accuracy of forces and displacements into account, we demonstrate that numerical results of acceptable accuracy for FSI problems involving laminar flows can be obtained with only fewer levels of refinement. In particular, we show that three levels of adaptive refinement are sufficient for obtaining force and displacement values of acceptable accuracy for laminar fluid-structure interaction problems.},

To investigate the dynamics of phase-field crystal model with a nonlinear vacancy potential on 3D surfaces, we herein propose a simple and practical finite difference method. The surfaces are defined by the zero level-set of signed distance functions and are included in a fully three-dimensional domain. By defining appropriate pseudo-Neumann boundary condition and using closest-point type method, the computation on surfaces are transformed into a three-dimensional narrow band domain containing the surfaces. Therefore, the finite difference method can be adopted to perform the spatial discretization. A linear semi-implicit discretization with stabilization technique in time is considered. In each time step, we only need to solve the elliptic type equations with constant coefficients. The numerical implementation is highly efficient. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method not only has desired accuracy but also works well for the pattern formations on various curved surfaces.},

The direct-forcing immersed boundary method is coupled with the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate this widespread issue numerically. Corresponding boundary conditions are hired to take into account pulsatile flow. Findings were first successfully verified against the existing literature and the accuracy of the results is well-demonstrated. For the first time, a series of proof-of-principal simulations with an increased level of geometric complexity, particle aspect ratio , as well as the number and initial configuration (release positions), is carried out. The force resulting from the particle acceleration is also considered. It is shown that considering such factors, particle settling manners would markedly differ. The collective behavior of particles is also studied, and it is revealed that the presence of neighboring particles makes the influence of the particle shape less clear; however, pulsatile flow presents considerable differences in the settling manners of particles.},

In this paper, we combine PINNs with the homotopy continuation method, a classical numerical method to compute isolated roots of polynomial systems, and propose a new deep learning framework, named homotopy physics-informed neural networks (HomPINNs), for solving multiple solutions of nonlinear elliptic differential equations. The implementation of an HomPINN is a homotopy process that is composed of the training of a fully connected neural network, named the starting neural network, and training processes of several PINNs with different tracking parameters. The starting neural network is to approximate a starting function constructed by the trivial solutions, while other PINNs are to minimize the loss functions defined by boundary condition and homotopy functions, varying with different tracking parameters. These training processes are regraded as different steps of a homotopy process, and a PINN is initialized by the well-trained neural network of the previous step, while the first starting neural network is initialized using the default initialization method. Several numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency of our proposed HomPINNs, including reaction-diffusion equations with a heart-shaped domain.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the implementations of the meshfree-based reduced-order model (ROM) to time-dependent nonlocal models with inhomogeneous volume constraints. Generally, when using ROM for nonlocal models, the projection of nonlocal volume constraints needs to be computed in every time step to handle the nonlocal boundary conditions. Up to now, only finite element methods (FEM) can work well in constructing ROM for nonlocal models, since the interpolation property of the FEM basis functions makes it easy to obtain such a projection. But if one tries to develop ROM based on existing meshfree methods for nonlocal models, the projection in every time step will lead to a full-order discrete system and is highly time-consuming, since the basis functions of these methods do not meet interpolation property . To overcome the above difficulties, we introduce a mixed reproducing kernel (RK) approximation with nodal interpolation property to develop a meshfree collocation method for nonlocal models and use it to construct ROM. Thanks to the nodal interpolation property, the projection of nonlocal boundary conditions can be obtained explicitly. This ROM is developed using numerical results as snapshots by a full-order model in a small time interval [ 0 , t 1 ] [0,t1] . The surrogate model , which is constructed by POD (proper orthogonal decomposition)-Galerkin approach, leads to a discrete system with far fewer degrees of freedom than the original meshfree method. Numerical experiments for nonlocal problems including nonlocal diffusion and peridynamics are presented to show that our method meets almost the same accuracy with a very small computational cost compared with the full-order meshfree approach.},

  abstract     = {A model of viscous gas flows has recently been proposed by Svärd (2018) [27] as a remedy to some physical inconsistencies of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We adopt and simplify the model to handle nearly incompressible flows by neglecting the energy conservation law and imposing the isothermal equation of state. For the sake of accuracy and computational efficiency, the artificial speed of sound and the time step are set adaptively during the simulation. The governing equations are solved using 2nd-order central schemes and the skew-symmetric forms are utilised for the hyperbolic terms. Since the explicit time integration is used and the pressure field is obtained from the density via the equation of state, no linear systems of equations need to be solved. Moreover, the use of two-point stencils for the discretisation of fluxes and ellipticity-free type of the governing equations make the model simple and efficient in the context of computer implementation and parallel execution. The analysis of accuracy, resolving power and compressible effects is done on the basis of two-dimensional flow simulations: the Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) at Re=300, the doubly periodic shear layer at Re = 10 4 Re=104 and the lid-driven cavity at Re = 10 3 Re=103 . The Svärd model, due to the physically-based diffusive term present in the mass conservation equation, reveals to be more accurate than a similar model based on the Navier-Stokes equations, as shown by the error analysis in the 2D TGV case. For the cases studied, the proper value of the Mach number allowing to match the results with those obtained by means of a truly incompressible flow solver is estimated to be approximately 0.05. Direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional TGV at Re = 1600 Re=1600 is performed and shows a good agreement with reference data obtained with truly incompressible solver.},

  abstract     = {We present a new enriched Galerkin (EG) scheme for the Stokes equations based on piecewise linear elements for the velocity unknowns and piecewise constant elements for the pressure. The proposed EG method augments the conforming piecewise linear space for velocity by adding an additional degree of freedom which corresponds to one discontinuous linear basis function per element. Thus, the total number of degrees of freedom is significantly reduced in comparison with standard conforming, non-conforming, and discontinuous Galerkin schemes for the Stokes equation. We show the well-posedness of the new EG approach and prove that the scheme converges optimally. For the solution of the resulting large-scale indefinite linear systems we propose robust block preconditioners, yielding scalable results independent of the discretization and physical parameters. Numerical results confirm the convergence rates of the discretization and also the robustness of the linear solvers for a variety of test problems.},

Through our investigation of connections between ReLU DNNs and the hierarchical basis approximation for x2 and xy , we show that ReLU DNNs with this special structure can be applied only to approximate quadratic functions .

The new idea of the proposed method is as follows. Firstly, the operator splitting method is used to decompose the three-dimensional problem into a series of one-dimensional subproblems that can be solved in parallel in the same direction. Secondly, a temporal p-adaptive strategy, which is based on the extrapolation technique, is proposed to improve the convergence order in time and preserve the computational efficiency simultaneously. Finally, a parallel least distance modification technique is developed to force the discrete maximum bound principle. The proposed method achieves high precision and high efficiency at the same time. Numerical examples include the effectiveness of the p-adaptive method and the bound preserving least distance modification, and a series of complex three-dimensional shape transformation modelings.},

  abstract     = {Reinitialization is essential to maintaining the accuracy of the level set method at capturing interfaces. In this paper, a high-order reinitialization method for the level set function which has previously been developed for structured grids was extended to unstructured grids . The proposed method involves constructing a stencil of an unstructured grid to define a high-order polynomial that approximates a piecewise segment of the interface. Then, the closest point method is adopted to estimate the signed distance function at grid points. The proposed method was validated by solving some benchmark problems of static cases and then the evolution of moving interfacial problems subject to prescribed velocity fields for various grid resolutions consisting of triangular elements. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated for computing geometric quantities such as the normal vector and curvature field. The proposed method proved to have high-order accuracy for estimating not only the signed distance function but also geometric quantities for a smooth interface. Finally, a local correction procedure was developed to apply the proposed method to level set problems involving the interface with kinks. The proposed method can accurately estimate normal vector and curvature fields including singularities both for static cases and for dynamic cases where an interface experiences topological changes.},

  abstract     = {We consider acoustic and elastic wave propagation problems in 2D unbounded domains , reformulated in terms of space-time Boundary Integral Equations (BIEs). For their numerical solution, we employ a weak formulation related to the energy of the system and we discretize the weak problems by a Galerkin-type Boundary Element Method (BEM): this approach, called Energetic BEM, has revealed accurate and stable even on large time intervals of analysis. In particular, it results that, when standard Lagrangian basis functions are considered, the BEM matrices have Toeplitz lower triangular block structure, where blocks for growing time become fully populated; hence the overall memory cost of the energetic BEM is O ( M 2 N ) O(M2N) , M and N being the number of the space degrees of freedom and the total number of performed time steps, respectively. This drawback prevents the application of such method to large scale problems . As a possible remedy, we propose a fast technique based on the Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA). The core of this procedure is the approximation of sufficiently large time blocks of the energetic BEM matrix through the partially pivoted ACA algorithm , which allows to compute only few of the original entries. This leads to reduced assembly time, which for the energetic BEM is generally relevant, coupled with reduced memory storage requirements. Additionally, the consequent acceleration of the matrix/vector multiplication together with a marching on time procedure, leads to remarkable reduction of the computational solution time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is theoretically proved and several numerical results are presented and discussed.},

The solution of governing dimensionless problem is executed by Legendre-based collocation method (LBCM).

Also, the liquid acts as a Newtonian fluid when the Casson parameter increases. Consequently, those parameters contribute to the cooling plate, while others have the opposite effect. Thus, by selecting the appropriate fluid model and adjusting the governing parameters, the cooling/heating mechanism can be created.

The finite difference method and the split-step backward Euler are considered for spatial and temporal, respectively. Motivated from physical applications such as temperature, finance and so on, positivity has real significance, which is volatilized by some common numerical treatments . To this end the numerical positivity is obtained by the properties of M -matrix and the truncated random variables , which overcomes the unboundedness of the random variables. For the investigation of the almost surely exponential stability, a stochastic stability matrix is introduced, and then the stability analysis reduces to the estimation of the eigenvalues and martingales thorough a family of matrices and perturbation theorems. The stabilization ability of the multiplicative noise is verified again from a generalization of the stochastic heat equation. Finally, some numerical experiments are given to validate our numerical results.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation is a fundamental and tedious task of computer vision. Because of inherent noise and intensity inhomogeneity in real-world images, it remains a difficult problem in practical applications such as image analysis, scene understanding, object detection, and many others. Several mathematical models proposed for image segmentation in the past few decades with an effective policy. Among these models, deformable models earned more attention and are widely used techniques due to their accuracy, efficiency, and robust effectiveness. This study reviews and compares various deformable models for the segmentation of digital images available in the literature. First, for a comprehensive study, these deformable models are classified into two classes such as direct partial differential equation (PDE) based approaches and variational based approaches. Beside this, variational based approaches are further classified into parametric and geometric models. Their advantages as well as shortcomings are discussed in detail from an objective viewpoint. Then, to check the robustness of various discussed classes of deformable models, a set of synthetic, natural, and real medical images are considered along with inhomogeneity and noise. Also, to measure the segmentation accuracy, different quantitative metrics based on contour and region are utilized. Numerical experiments with different classes of images, reveal that both direct PDE based and variation based models perform well in clean and noisy images. Whereas, the variational based approaches are superior for images having intensity inhomogeneity with high computational time. The qualitative and quantitative investigations confirm that the subtle change in model assumptions can have a significant impact on segmentation.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a fourth-order compact immersed interface method to solve two-dimensional Poisson equations with discontinuous solutions on arbitrary domains divided by an interface. The compact scheme only employs a nine-point stencil for each grid point on the computational domain. The new approach is based on an implicit formulation obtained from generalized Taylor series expansions , and it is constructed from a few modifications to the central finite difference near the interface. The discretization results in a linear system in which the matrix coefficients are the same as the ones for smooth solutions, and the right-hand side system is modified by adding terms known as jump contributions. These contributions are only calculated at those points where the nine-point stencil cuts the interface. However, the contribution formulas require the knowledge of Cartesian jumps up to fourth-order. In this paper, we derived them using only the principal jump conditions and the jumps coming from the known right-hand function of the Poisson equation. We present numerical experiments in two dimensions to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. Thus, the implicit immersed interface method results in an attractive fourth-order compact scheme that is easy to be implemented and applied to arbitrary interface shapes.},

The approximation error in H 1 H1 is shown to be of order O ( h p ) O(hp) with respect to the element size h and of order O ( p − q ) O(p−q) with respect to the degree p , where q is the spatial regularity of the solution.

This inverse problem is known to be ill-posed and hence a regularization procedure is required. Herein we develop a solver for this problem by exploiting two sources of regularization , namely the smoothing nature of the corresponding direct problems and a priori knowledge on the solution to the inverse problem investigated. Consequently, this inverse problem is reformulated as a control one which reduces to minimising a corresponding functional defined on a fractional Sobolev space on the inaccessible part of the boundary. This approach yields a gradient-based iterative algorithm that consists, at each step, of the resolution of two direct problems and three corresponding adjoint problems in accordance with the function space where the control is sought. The theoretical convergence of the algorithm is studied by deriving an iteration-dependent admissible range for the parameter. Numerical experiments are realized for the two-dimensional case by employing the finite-difference method, whilst the numerical solution is stabilised/regularized by stopping the iterative process based on three criteria.},

  abstract     = {Hyperthermia with laser heating can be a noninvasive treatment for tumors near the body surface. Thermal damage of tissues depends on temperature levels and time of exposure to high temperatures, thus requiring accurate techniques to measure the temperature in the target region of interest. In this computational work, we couple the laser hyperthermia treatment of cancer to the photoacoustic temperature measurement of internal tissues, by solving a state estimation problem with the Kalman filter. The region of interest is considered to be continuously heated by a laser for the hyperthermia treatment, while another laser is sequentially pulsed over the same heated surface to generate acoustic pressure waves. The observation model is derived from the photoacoustic problem, which is linear with respect to the local internal temperatures of the tissues. The evolution model given by the bioheat transfer problem is also supposed linear and uncertainties are modeled as additive and Gaussian. Therefore, the Kalman filter provides the optimal solution of the state estimation problem considered in this work. Simulated nonintrusive acoustic pressure measurements are used in inverse analyses for two test cases, with different dimensions and locations of a tumor in a two-dimensional region. The simulated tumors are supposed loaded with nanoparticles, in order to enhance the local absorption of the laser energy and to reduce thermal damage to healthy cells. The Kalman filter estimated accurate and stable temperature distributions, even in the tumor region that involved large gradients. Moreover, uncertainties in the Kalman filter estimates were smaller than those resulting from the direct simulation of the photoacoustic thermometry problem.},

Implementation aspects are discussed. Finally, two numerical experiments arising from the piezoelectric strip shear deformation problem and the piezoelectric strip bending problem are presented. Numerical results show that the iteration steps of the PCG methods are independent of the number of degrees of freedom and the proposed BST preconditioners perform much better than some existing preconditioning techniques.},

The strategy is to use a penalization function of the form O ( 1 / h 1 + δ ) O(1/h1+δ) , where h denotes the mesh size and δ is a user-dependent parameter. We then quantify its direct impact on the convergence analysis, namely, the (strong) consistency, discrete coercivity and boundedness (with h δ hδ -dependency), and we derive updated error estimates for both discrete energy- and L 2 L2 -norms. The originality of the error analysis relies specifically on the use of conforming interpolants of the exact solution. All theoretical results are supported by numerical evidence.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new fifth-order finite difference mapped unequal-sized weighted essentially non-oscillatory (MUS-WENO) scheme is proposed for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations in multi-dimensions. This new MUS-WENO scheme uses the same widest spatial stencils as that of the classical same order finite difference WENO scheme [19] , and could obtain smaller truncation errors and optimal fifth-order accuracy in smooth regions. The MUS-WENO scheme uses a convex combination of a quartic polynomial with two quadratic polynomials . The linear weights can be artificially set as any positive constants on condition that their summation is one. Together with a new mapping function , associated new mapped nonlinear weights are proposed to reduce the difference with the linear weights. So it is a first time that the new finite difference MUS-WENO scheme with a very small ε could reach optimal accuracy order convergence even near extreme points in smooth regions and avoid spurious oscillations near strong discontinuities when solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Generally speaking, the main advantages of such new MUS-WENO scheme comparing with the classical WENO scheme [19] are its good convergence, robustness, efficiency and easy extension to multi-dimensions. Numerical experiments are proposed to show the good performance of this new MUS-WENO scheme.},

However, the physics-informed machine learning technique used in these two methods gives rise to expensive time consumption for complex neural network, higher reduced basis and a large amount of residual points. With understanding of PDNN, PINN and PRNN, a model-based neural network (MBNN) is proposed to cope with nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) without source terms . Compared with PINN, the fully discrete scheme of PDEs is adopted to avoid expensive cost for automatic differentiation technique. Moreover, initial conditions at residual points in parameter space are added to loss function with a proper proportion. Since the reduced order equation is taken into account, the proposed MBNN can predict solutions in a larger time range than the time range to which the snapshot belongs. Numerical results show that MBNN achieves better performance than the projection-driven neural network. Generally, the proposed method for lower order reduction can get a consistent L 2 L2 error with POD after the convergent tolerance is reached.},

A well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme is proposed for solving the SW equations with sediment transport and bed evolution. To achieve the well-balanced property of the numerical scheme easily, the nonlinear SW equations are first reformulated into a new form by introducing an auxiliary variable. Then the DG method is used to discretize the model, in which the FORCE flux is used. By choosing an appropriate value of the auxiliary variable, we can prove that the numerical method can accurately maintain the steady solution in still water, so it is indeed an equilibrium preserving scheme. The well-balanced property can be extended to any numerical flux which satisfies the consistency. Moreover, we investigate the impact on the numerical results if the appropriate value of auxiliary variable is slightly modified. The effectiveness of the numerical method is finally verified by numerical experiments.},

The main novelty is that curved elements are naturally handled without any degradation of the solution accuracy. Indeed, in presence of curved boundaries, or internal interfaces , the geometrical error introduced by planar approximations may dominate the convergence rate limiting the benefit of high-order approximations. We consider the Darcy problem in its mixed form to directly obtain accurate and mass conservative fluxes without any post-processing. An important step to derive the proposed scheme is the integration over curved polyhedrons , here presented and discussed. Finally, we show the theoretical analysis of the scheme as well as several numerical examples to support our findings.},

A semi-discrete continuous-in-time formulation of the linear advection-diffusion equation is obtained by using a mixed hybrid finite element method, in which the flux variable represents both the advective and diffusive flux, and the Lagrange multiplier arising from the hybridization is used for the discretization of the advective term. Based on global-in-time and nonoverlapping domain decomposition, we propose two implicit local time-stepping methods to solve the semi-discrete problem. The first method uses the time-dependent Steklov-Poincaré type operator and the second uses the optimized Schwarz waveform relaxation (OSWR) with Robin transmission conditions. For each method, we formulate a space-time interface problem which is solved iteratively. Each iteration involves solving the subdomain problems independently and globally in time; thus, different time steps can be used in the subdomains. The convergence of the fully discrete OSWR algorithm with nonmatching time grids is proved. Numerical results for problems with various Peclét numbers and discontinuous coefficients, including a prototype for the simulation of the underground storage of nuclear waste, are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed local time-stepping methods.},

The effects of heat flow memory and heat capacity memory (internal energy) in solids are considered in first-order integrodifferential evolutionary equations with difference-type kernels. The main difficulties in applying such nonlocal in-time mathematical models are associated with the need to work with a solution throughout the entire history of the process. The paper develops an approach to transforming a nonlocal problem into a computationally simpler local problem for a system of first-order evolution equations. Such a transition is applicable for heat conduction problems with memory if the relaxation functions of the heat flux and heat capacity are represented as a sum of exponentials. The correctness of the auxiliary linear problem is ensured by the obtained estimates of the stability of the solution concerning the initial data and the right-hand side in the corresponding Hilbert spaces. The study&#39;s main result is to prove the unconditional stability of the proposed two-level scheme with weights for the evolutionary system of equations for modeling heat conduction in solid media with memory. In this case, finding an approximate solution on a new level in time is not more complicated than the classical heat equation.

This method is different from the known second-order methods, which is called the L 2- 1 σ 1σ Crank-Nicolson method in this paper. Using the L 2- 1 σ 1σ Crank-Nicolson method of the Caputo fractional derivative, a fully discrete L 2- 1 σ 1σ Crank-Nicolson difference method for two-dimensional time-fractional wave equations with variable coefficients is developed. The unconditional stability and convergence of the method are rigorously proved. The optimal error estimates in the discrete L 2 L2 -norm and H 1 H1 -norm are obtained under a relatively weak regularity condition . The error estimates show that the method has the second-order convergence in both time and space for all α ∈ ( 1 , 2 ) α∈(1,2) . In order to overcome the loss of the temporal convergence order caused by the stronger singularity of the exact solution at the initial time , a nonuniform L 2- 1 σ 1σ Crank-Nicolson difference method is also developed on a class of general nonuniform time meshes. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence result. The effectiveness of the nonuniform method for non-smooth solutions with the stronger singularity at the initial time is tested on a class of initially graded time meshes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine conditioning of the discretization of the Helmholtz problem. Although the discrete Helmholtz problem has been studied from different perspectives, to the best of our knowledge, there is no conditioning analysis for it. We aim to fill this gap in the literature. We propose a novel method in 1D to observe the near-zero eigenvalues of a symmetric indefinite matrix. Standard classification of ill-conditioning based on the matrix condition number is not true for the discrete Helmholtz problem. We relate the ill-conditioning of the discretization of the Helmholtz problem with the condition number of the matrix. We carry out analytical conditioning analysis in 1D and extend our observations to 2D with numerical observations. We examine several discretizations. We find different regions in which the condition number of the problem shows different characteristics. We also explain the general behavior of the solutions in these regions.},

Some priori bounds on certain derivatives of the solution show that the solution exhibits a weak singularity at the initial time t = 0 t=0 . To resolve this initial singularity, we rewrite the superdiffusion equation as a coupled system by introducing a intermediate variable p : = D t α / 2 ( u − t u 1 ) p:=Dtα/2(u−tu1) , and adopt the L1 scheme and Alikhanov scheme on graded meshes in temporal direction. In spatial direction, the conforming finite element method is used. Furthermore, we derive the H 1 H1 -norm stability result. It is worth noting that some priori bounds on certain derivatives of p are obtained, on basis of which, we derive an α -robust prior error estimate with optimal H 1 H1 -norm convergence order. Finally, we provide the numerical experiment to further verify our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a Keller box calculation of magnetic nanopolymer coating flow over a circular cylinder in the presence of nonlinear convection is performed. A two-phase nanofluid model (Buongiorno model) is used to model the equations for nanofluid flow and heat and mass transfer. The problem at hand is first formulated in the dimensional form of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and then transformed into the dimensionless PDEs form by manipulating non-similar variables. The Keller box approach (implicit finite differences) is used for the calculations of the transformed PDEs. The characteristics of critical thermophysical physical parameters on the flow field, viz thermal convection, Brownian motion, Weissenberg number, thermophoresis, magnetic field, heat source/sink, Biot number, buoyancy ration parameter, Eckert number, and mixed convection, are graphically manifested. In addition, the flow control parameters estimate the sheath friction, heat transfer rate, and mass transfer rate in the flow coordinate. A significant increase in the velocity of the Williamson nanofluid is accompanied by an increase in the Biot number, magnetic field, and mixed convection. The isotherms show a higher fluid temperature near the wall in the absence of convection. The Weissenberg number, Biot number, and thermophoresis significantly increase the temperature of the Williamson nanofluid. The density of the streamlines is lowered with a larger buoyancy ratio parameter. The total entropy generation of the Williamson nanofluid is improved by increasing the Brinkman number and the Weissenberg number.},

After discretization of time variable, linear barycentric interpolation method is used to discretize space variables. In this way, a fully discrete scheme is obtained, which can be used to solve the problem numerically. The numerical solution is compared with exact solution to see how accurate it is. Also L ∞ L∞ error norm is reckoned and compared with those of other numerical methods in the literature to see performance of the method.

  abstract     = {The goal of this work is first to include a hysteresis model in the classical equivalent circuit model (ECM) for a battery system and then to improve the estimation of the state of charge (SoC) by applying the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The hysteretic behavior of the open circuit voltage (OCV) is modelled with the classical Preisach model used for magnetic materials. The construction of the Preisach operator is made by means of the Everett function identified from experimental data which only involve the charging curves of the battery. Thus, a significant reduction in the time necessary to obtain the measurements is achieved. The model is assessed with some laboratory experiments performed on a lithium-ion battery and the results show that with this procedure hysteresis is very well reproduced, even when interior loops are present. In addition, the use of the EKF allows us to eliminate the measurements noise and ensure the accuracy of SoC estimation. The high computational efficiency and precision of the method, joined to the limited computational resources needed for the numerical implementation, make it particularly suitable for real-time embedded battery management system (BMS) applications. In addition, the proposed methodology is well-adapted to any battery type, independently of the SoC-OCV profile of the hysteresis cycle.},

The blob of the viscous fluid is affected by the shearing forces induced by a changing gap distance, however the rotation also has significant influence on the shape of the blob. Using the method of complex moments, we characterize the solution of the moving boundary problem that models the evolution of the blob and investigate the morphology using linear analysis. The results of the linear analysis indicate the de-stabilizing influence of the rotation. In the numerical methods, we develop a spectrally accurate boundary integral technique to explore the complete nonlinear dynamics of the problem. Using the boundary integral simulations we demonstrate that, for a given strength of surface tension, the rotational effect causes a more complex pattern on the fluid interface that involves the formation of narrow fingers and more splitting of the interface. The effect is more pronounced if the angular speed increases. We also prescribe a method for controlling the viscous fingering using insights from linear analysis.

  abstract     = {In compressible computational fluid dynamics, the step size of explicit time integration schemes is often constrained by stability when high-order accurate spatial discretizations are used. We report a set of new optimized explicit Runge–Kutta schemes for the integration of systems of ordinary differential equations arising from the spatial discretization of wave propagation problems with high-order entropy stable collocated discontinuous Galerkin methods. The eigenvalues of the discrete spatial operator for the advection equation and the propagation of an isentropic vortex with the compressible Euler equations for various values of the problems&#39; parameters are used to optimize the stability region of the proposed time integration schemes. To demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of the methods, we solve the compressible turbulent flow past the Valeo controlled-diffusion airfoil and a delta wing at a Reynolds number of 8.3 × 10 5 8.3×105 and 10 6 , respectively. A thorough analysis of the performance of the two families of optimized schemes revealed that methods generated using the spectra of the vortex problem are 6-to-20% faster than methods constructed using the spectra of the advection equation. Compared to widely used explicit Runge–Kutta schemes, the methods designed using the spectra of the vortex problem yield a time-to-solution saving of approximately 6-to-38%. For large-scale time-dependent partial differential equations computations, these gains mean saving hundreds of thousands if not millions of core hours. In addition, the new methods can be effectively and efficiently applied to integrate systems of ordinary differential equations arising from a wide range of spatial discretization, including discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods, spectral difference methods, and flux reconstruction methods.},

  abstract     = {The Backward Differentiation Formulae (BDF) of orders one to six are implemented in an in-house three-dimensional finite-volume (FVM) compressible flow code that operates on unstructured meshes. The lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LUSGS) implicit relaxation technique based on the splitting of convective Jacobians is used to obtain a variable-order stable implementation in the solver. The temporal order of accuracy of the implemented schemes is verified using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MoMS). Practical engineering flow problems are simulated to investigate the operational stability of BDF methods so that these can be used as a cheaper alternative to multi-stage methods in RANS, hybrid RANS-LES, and LES implementations. Steady-state flow simulations of supersonic flow over a flat plate and high Reynolds number flow over a NACA-0012 airfoil show that algorithm with BDF schemes of orders 1-5 is stable at high CFL numbers (700-1000) and produces a converged solution. Stokes&#39; second problem and a high-resolution delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES) of flow over a 3D circular cylinder using the BDF1-BDF6 methods demonstrate the use of these higher-order temporal schemes in unsteady laminar and turbulent flows. It is concluded that BDF methods of orders 3-5 can be practically employed to achieve higher levels of temporal accuracy in flow simulations when the level of spatial accuracy is also high (ENO/WENO schemes, spectral methods, etc.) in hybrid RANS-LES, LES or DNS. Even without higher-order spatial accuracy, the same BDF schemes can be used in Adaptive Time-stepping (ATS) methods to obtain prescribed temporal accuracy efficiently by algorithmically switching between the different schemes.},

  abstract     = {The application of finite element method in solving the lattice Boltzmann equation has been successfully demonstrated by many researchers. However, the computation cost of these methods is much higher than the standard lattice Boltzmann method. In this paper, an efficient implementation of nodal discontinuous Galerkin lattice Boltzmann method is presented. It relies on a simplified nodal discontinuous Galerkin formulation, which makes full use of the possible sparse property of elemental matrices in quadrangles and hexahedrons. Some key points of its implementation in the program are also discussed. Performance tests confirm the superior efficiency of the current program, which exceeds the record of previous researchers. The accuracy of the current method is investigated and compared with the standard lattice Boltzmann method. The high-order discretization can give similar accuracy with lower number of grid points and computational time and the efficiency of the present method is sometimes higher than standard lattice Boltzmann method. Direct numerical simulations of several incompressible turbulence benchmark cases are performed. The present method also shows better accuracy and stability especially in the turbulent pipe flow simulations.},

However, some troubles persist in dynamic analysis. The flat-top strategy is an alternative to hold up the SGFEM but, despite its good performance in quasi-static problems, for dynamic problems some points remain opened, such as the accuracy of natural frequencies, the computational effort to reach a desired degree of precision (for each natural frequency), and the conditioning of mass and stiffness matrices. The main objective of this work is to assess the performance of the flat-top SGFEM in the context of free vibration analysis Based in many numerical simulations, the sensitivity of the method is verified for different parameters, such as, the size of the flat-top partition of unity (PU) intervals, the smoothness of enriched functions, and the stabilization parameter. Despite the flat-top SGFEM improves the numerical stability for modal analysis, it is shown that the convergence rates can be degraded.},

Optimal convergence properties are obtained for both FEMs in their respective norms, additionally, the mixed FEM can produce one-order higher approximation accuracy for the electric field in L 2 L2 norm than that of the standard FEM, resulting in more accurate approximations to the electrostatic stress and the force of interaction in concentrated electrolytes. All attained theoretical results are validated by numerical experiments. Furthermore, a practical example is studied to validate the necessity of introducing the fourth-order modified Poisson-Fermi equation to describe the electrostatic potential field due to correlation effects by comparing with the classical Poisson equation that accounts for the classical mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory, illustrating that numerical trends obtained from the modified model are all consistent with experimental results under the circumstance of electrostatic correlations in concentrated electrolytes, which however cannot be predicted by the classical model.},

Optimal order error estimates in L 2 L2 norm can be proved for all the variables. Moreover, the approximation of the primal variable superconverges in L 2 L2 norm to a suitably chosen projection without requiring additional regularity. Residual type error estimators are proposed, which can guide adaptive mesh refinement to deliver optimal convergence rates even for solutions with singularity . Numerical experiments confirm that the optimal convergence rates in L 2 L2 norm can be achieved for all the variables. Moreover, all the provided residual type error estimators show the desired results. In particular, the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme on a polygonal approximation of the disk works well for the classic Babuška example.},

In doing so, a modified consistent weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics method is employed. It is assumed that the thixotropic fluid obeys the Moore model, and the surface tension is modeled by the continuum surface tension (CST) method. After verifying the utilized paradigm, it is applied to novel cases in which one of the fluids exhibits thixotropic behavior . The effects of Moore&#39;s model constants are examined through several numerical simulations. It is shown that the drop deformation is dramatically affected by thixotropic behavior. Generally speaking, the deformation of the Newtonian droplet is decreased by increasing the destruction-to-rebuild ratio of the surrounding thixotropic liquid. The same trend is found when the thixotropic droplet is exposed to the shear flow of a Newtonian fluid . Also, it is demonstrated that the presence of another droplet in the vicinity of the first droplet could dramatically change the flow domain. To the best of the author&#39;s knowledge, the effect of thixotropy is investigated on droplet deformation for the first time.},

By using the abstract theories of generalized saddle-point problems, the stability (or inf-sup condition in general) of the proposed finite volume methods could be established. The resulting finite volume methods have the optimal H 1 H1 -norm error estimate for velocity of the Stokes problem without constraints on dual meshes of dual partitions of the finite volume methods, and have the optimal L 2 L2 -norm error estimate for velocity with a specially selected dual mesh of the dual partitions. In addition, by adopting another appropriate dual mesh of the dual partitions, the finite volume methods may be identified as the corresponding finite element methods with differences only in their right-hand items. As a result, the optimal-order error estimate could be obtained in the H 1 H1 -norm for velocity without any restriction on mesh geometry of the primary partitions. Finally, we investigate numerically the imposed geometric conditions on meshes of the primary partitions for ensuring the ellipticity of the discrete elliptic bilinear forms and we validate our theoretical error estimates through some numerical experiments.},

The nonlinear interface condition poses an extra difficulty, as there are different approaches to modeling the Reynolds stresses on the joint boundary of the two flows. We investigate three such approaches; all three models are shown to be quantitatively similar when tested on a model with a manufactured solution. Two of them are proven to be unconditionally stable, and yet it is the third model that clearly outperforms the others in the most computationally appealing case when high Reynolds number flows are modeled on a coarse mesh with large filtering width.},

At present, the so-called multi-static response (MSR) matrix whose elements are measured far-field pattern data is neither symmetric nor Hermitian, a projection operator onto the noise subspace cannot be defined using the conventional method, so the imaging function cannot be designed. Motivated by this fact, we first propose a novel MUSIC imaging function in limited-aperture inverse scattering problem. This is based on the asymptotic expansion formula for far-field patterns in the presence of small cracks and the structure of singular vectors associated with nonzero singular values of the MSR matrix. Next, the new imaging function was analyzed by establishing a relationship with an infinite series of the Bessel function of the integer order of the first kind and ranges of incident and observation directions. We then observe some properties of MUSIC in limited-aperture problems and show that the proposed imaging function is a generalization of full- and limited-view problems. We finally validate the feasibility and limitation of the proposed MUSIC imaging function through numerical simulation results using synthetic and real data .},

The LRTCM is constructed by combining the traditional radial Trefftz collocation method (RTCM) and the localized collocation scheme. In the proposed LRTCM, the radial Trefftz basis of the heat conduction equation in FGMs is derived by the variable transformation and domain mapping method, and the approximation solution at each node is expressed as a linear combination of a radial Trefftz basis in each local subdomain , thus the resulting sparse linear system naturally satisfies governing equation at interior nodes and boundary conditions at boundary nodes . The LRTCM not only inherits the advantages of the RTCM (meshlessness, no fictitious boundary and high accuracy), but also works well in large-scale structures or with more complicated boundary conditions when compared to the RTCM. Finally, the feasibility, accuracy, efficiency and stability of the proposed method are investigated by three examples.},

Our approach, which extends a similar procedure employed with Hilbert spaces , proceeds in two slightly different ways depending on whether the kernel of the adjoint operator induced by one of the bilinear forms is trivial or not. If the latter holds, we make use of an equivalence result between a couple of inf-sup conditions involved, which, differently from the Hilbertian case, turns out to hold with different constants. While this fact causes no inconvenient in the continuous analysis, it does become a delicate issue at the discrete level, and hence the corresponding inf-sup conditions need to be assumed separately with respective constants independent of the finite element subspaces employed. In turn, if that kernel is trivial, then we employ a suitable characterization of a closed range injective adjoint operator , so that only one of the aforementioned inf-sup conditions is then required for the analysis. The applicability of the continuous solvability is illustrated with a mixed formulation for the decoupled Nernst-Planck equation.},

  abstract     = {When the characteristic-based split (CBS) scheme is combined with spectral element method (SEM), high-order nonlinear terms in CBS scheme produce non-negligible aliasing error, which causes severe stability problems. In this paper, a stabilized framework based on CBS-SEM for incompressible flow simulation is established with stabilization by over-integration. The introduced over-integration addresses the aliasing-driven instability by approximating nonlinear terms with higher-order interpolations. A numerical experiment is presented to assess the performance of the stabilized framework in terms of the stability range, solution quality, and computational efficiency. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Over-integration effectively extends the range of stability for CBS-SEM, where the increase in low-order interpolations is more significant. (2) For extremely under-resolved problems, two types of instabilities, including instability caused by the limitation of CFL condition and instability triggered by aliasing error, are observed in the numerical experiment. The stabilized framework is verified to be effective in handling both types of instability. (3) The order of over-integration only slightly affects the stability, but it markedly improves the capture of complex flow structure for high-order interpolations. In addition, a numerical investigation on incompressible flow past an airfoil is performed to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.},

We prove that the condition number of the preconditioned matrix converges to 1 as the mesh size is reduced, that is, the preconditioner is asymptotically equivalent to the exact inverse. Moreover, we give numerical evidence of its good behaviour with respect to the spline degree and the (possibly singular) geometry parametrization .

In this work we propose an optimization-based approach to parameter identification for fractional models with an optional truncation radius. We formulate the inference problem as an optimal control problem where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between observed data and an approximate solution of the model, and the control variables are the fractional order and the truncation length. For the numerical solution of the minimization problem we propose a gradient-based approach, where we enhance the numerical performance by an approximation of the bilinear form of the state equation and its derivative with respect to the fractional order. Several numerical tests in one and two dimensions illustrate the theoretical results and show the robustness and applicability of our method.},

Data Assimilation (DA) techniques combine physical models and observational data, often in a Bayesian framework, to predict the future state of the model and the uncertainty in this prediction. Inherent in these systems are noise (Gaussian and non-Gaussian), nonlinearity, and high dimensionality that pose challenges to making accurate predictions. To address these issues we investigate the use of both model and data dimension reduction based on techniques including Assimilation in the Unstable Subspace (AUS), Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). Algorithms to take advantage of projected physical and data models may be combined with DA techniques such as Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and Particle Filter (PF) variants. The projected DA techniques are developed for the optimal proposal particle filter and applied to the Lorenz&#39;96 model (L96) and Shallow Water Equations (SWE) to test the efficacy of our techniques in high dimensional, nonlinear systems.},

Then a rectangular product-integration (PI) rule is implemented in an implicit-explicit (IMEX) framework in order to implicitly treat this linear stiff term and handle in an explicit way the non-linear, and usually non-stiff, term. The kernel compression scheme (KCS) is successively adopted to reduce the overload of computation and storage need for the persistent memory term. To reduce the computational effort the semidiscretized problem is described in a matrix-form, so as to require the solution of Sylvester equations only with small matrices. Theoretical results on the accuracy, together with strategies for the optimal selection of the main parameters of the whole method, are derived and verified by means of numerical experiments carried out in two-dimensional domains. The computational advantages with respect to other approaches are also shown and some applications to the detection of pattern formation are illustrated at the end of the paper.},

  abstract     = {We present a numerical approximation of Darcy&#39;s flow through a porous medium that incorporates networks of fractures with non empty intersection . Our scheme employs PolyDG methods, i.e. discontinuous Galerkin methods on general polygonal and polyhedral (polytopic, for short) grids, featuring elements with edges/faces that may be in arbitrary number (potentially unlimited) and whose measure may be arbitrarily small. Our approach is then very well suited to tame the geometrical complexity featured by most of applications in the computational geoscience field. From the modelling point of view, we adopt a reduction strategy that treats fractures as manifolds of codimension one and we employ the primal version of Darcy&#39;s law to describe the flow in both the bulk and in the fracture network . In addition, some physically consistent conditions couple the two problems, allowing for jump of pressure at their interface, and they as well prescribe the behaviour of the fluid along the intersections, imposing pressure continuity and flux conservation. Both the bulk and fracture discretizations are obtained employing the Symmetric Interior Penalty DG method extended to the polytopic setting. The key instrument to obtain a polyDG approximation of the problem in the fracture network is the generalization of the concepts of jump and average at the intersection, so that the contribution from all the fractures is taken into account. We prove the well-posedness of the discrete formulation and perform an error analysis obtaining a priori hp -error estimates. All our theoretical results are validated performing preliminary numerical tests with known analytical solution.},

To this end, we exploit the freedom in choosing the weighting matrices and propose a specific choice which leads to an LQG controller which is port-Hamiltonian and, thus, in particular stable and passive. Furthermore, we construct a reduced-order controller via balancing and subsequent truncation. This approach is closely related to classical LQG balanced truncation and shares a similar a priori error bound with respect to the gap metric. By exploiting the non-uniqueness of the Hamiltonian , we are able to determine an optimal pH representation of the full-order system in the sense that the error bound is minimized. In addition, we discuss consequences for pH-preserving balanced truncation model reduction which results in two different classical H ∞ H∞ -error bounds. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical findings by means of two numerical examples .},

Since the computation of such an optimal solution is numerically costly, we design an efficient strategy to compute a sub-optimal (but applicationally acceptable) solution with significantly reduced computational effort. We employ an economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to obtain a feedback control. The MPC sub-problems are based on a linear-quadratic optimal control problem subjected to mixed control and state constraints and a convection-diffusion equation, reduced with proper orthogonal decomposition. To solve each sub-problem, we apply a primal-dual active set strategy. The method can be fully parallelized, which enables the solution of large problems with real-world parameters.},

  abstract     = {We design a virtual element method for the numerical treatment of the two-dimensional parabolic variational inequality problem on unstructured polygonal meshes . Due to the expected low regularity of the exact solution, the virtual element method is based on the lowest-order virtual element space that contains the subspace of the linear polynomials defined on each element. The connection between the nonnegativity of the virtual element functions and the nonnegativity of the degrees of freedom, i.e., the values at the mesh vertices, is established by applying the Maximum and Minimum Principle Theorem. The mass matrix is computed through an approximate L 2 L2 polynomial projection, whose properties are carefully investigated in the paper. We prove the well-posedness of the resulting scheme in two different ways that reveal the contractive nature of the VEM and its connection with the minimization of quadratic functionals. The convergence analysis requires the existence of a nonnegative quasi-interpolation operator, whose construction is also discussed in the paper. The variational crime introduced by the virtual element setting produces five error terms that we control by estimating a suitable upper bound. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rate for the refinement in space and time on three different mesh families including distorted squares, nonconvex elements, and Voronoi tesselations.},

By this approach, we manage to construct different bilinear forms yielding optimal or quasi-optimal stability bounds and error estimates , under weaker assumptions on the tessellation than the ones usually considered in this framework. In particular, we prove optimality under geometrical assumptions allowing a mesh to have a very large number of arbitrarily small edges per element.

For models with two structures, we propose a numerical technique to approximate R 0 R0 , which measures the transmissibility of an infectious disease and, rigorously, is defined as the dominant eigenvalue of a next generation operator. Via bivariate collocation and cubature on tensor grids, the latter is approximated with a finite-dimensional matrix, so that its dominant eigenvalue can easily be computed with standard techniques. We use test examples to investigate experimentally the behavior of the approximation : the convergence order appears to be infinite when the corresponding eigenfunction is smooth, and finite for less regular eigenfunctions . To demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for more realistic applications, we present a new epidemic model structured by demographic age and immunity, and study the approximation of R 0 R0 in some particular cases of interest.},

In order to provide an alternative solution approach, especially in a large-scale context, this article investigates penalization techniques. Taking inspiration from a well-known family of existing exact penalty algorithms, a novel improved penalty algorithm is derived, whose key ingredients are a basin hopping strategy and an interior point method, both of which are specialized for the problem class. A thorough numerical investigation is carried out for a standard stationary test problem. Extensions to a convection-diffusion as well as a nonlinear test problem finally demonstrate the versatility of the approach.},

On one hand, a modified Ritz projection operator R h Rh is introduced and analyzed, which plays an important role in getting the unconditional optimal error estimates . On the other hand, a time-discrete system is constructed with the linearized BDF2 and the regularity is derived with the temporal error results. Combining these two aspects, the errors between R h U n RhUn and U h n Uhn with order O ( h 3 + h 2 △ t ) O(h3+h2△t) in L 2 L2 -norm and O ( h 2 + h 2 △ t ) O(h2+h2△t) in the modified energy norm are deduced, where h is the subdivision parameter, △ t is the time step, U n Un and U h n Uhn denote the solutions of the time-discrete system and the BDF2-MG FEM respectively. Therefore the boundedness of ‖ U h n ‖ 0 , ∞ ‖Uhn‖0,∞ is proven without any restriction on the time-space grid ratio. Furthermore, by using the properties of R h Rh , unconditional optimal error estimates of order O ( h 3 + ( △ t ) 2 ) O(h3+(△t)2) in L 2 L2 -norm and O ( h 2 + ( △ t ) 2 ) O(h2+(△t)2) in the modified energy norm are obtained directly. It should point out the spatial discrete errors of the BDF2-MG FEM are all one order higher than that of the BDF2 traditional Galerkin finite element method with Wilson element for the GLE. At last, a numerical experiment is presented to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {We propose and analyze an unfitted method for a dual-dual mixed formulation of a class of Stokes models with variable viscosity depending on the velocity gradient , in which the pseudoestress, the velocity and its gradient are the main unknowns. On a fluid domain Ω with curved boundary Γ we consider a Dirichlet boundary condition and employ an approach previously applied to the Stokes equations with constant viscosity, which consists of approximating Ω by a polyhedral computational subdomain Ω h Ωh , not necessarily fitting Ω, where a Galerkin method is applied to compute solution. Furthermore, to approximate the Dirichlet data on the computational boundary Γ h Γh , we make use of a transferring technique based on integrating the discrete velocity gradient . Then the associated Galerkin scheme can be defined by employing Raviart–Thomas of order k ≥ 0 k≥0 for the pseudostress, and discontinuous polynomials of degree k for the velocity and its gradient. For the a priori error analysis we provide suitable assumptions on the mesh near the boundary Γ ensuring that the associated Galerkin scheme is well-posed and optimally convergent with O ( h k + 1 ) O(hk+1) . Next, for the case when Γ h Γh is taken as a piecewise linear interpolation of Γ, we develop a reliable and quasi-efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimator . Numerical experiments verify our analysis and illustrate the performance of the associated a posteriori error indicator.},

  abstract     = {Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces are commonly used within Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools to represent geometric objects . When using isogeometric analysis (IGA), it is possible to use such NURBS geometries for numerical analysis directly. Analyzing fluid flows, however, requires complex three-dimensional geometries to represent flow domains. Defining a parametrization of such volumetric domains using NURBS can be challenging and is still an ongoing topic in the IGA community. With the recently developed NURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM), the favorable geometric characteristics of NURBS are used within a standard finite element method . This is achieved by enhancing the elements touching the boundary by using the NURBS geometry itself. In the current work, a new variation of NEFEM is introduced, which is suitable for three-dimensional space-time finite element formulations . The proposed method makes use of a new mapping which results in a non-Cartesian formulation suitable for fluid-structure interaction (FSI). This is demonstrated by combining the method with an IGA formulation in a strongly-coupled partitioned framework for solving FSI problems. The framework yields a fully spline-based representation of the fluid-structure interface through a single NURBS. The coupling conditions at the fluid-structure interface are enforced through a Robin-Neumann type coupling scheme. This scheme is particularly useful when considering incompressible fluids in fully Dirichlet-bounded and curved problems, as it satisfies the incompressibility constraint on the fluid for each step within the coupling procedure. The accuracy and performance of the introduced spline-based space-time finite element approach and its use within the proposed coupled FSI framework are demonstrated using a series of two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the nonlinear squeeze-film damping (SFD) involving rarefied gas effect in the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) is investigated. Considering the motion of structures (beam, cantilever, and membrane) in MEMS, the dynamic response of the structure is affected greatly by the SFD. In the traditional model, a viscous damping assumption that the damping force is linear with the moving velocity is used. As the nonlinear damping phenomenon is observed for a micro-structure oscillating at a high velocity, this assumption does not hold and will cause error results for predicting the response of the micro-structure. Meanwhile, due to the small size of the device and the low pressure of the encapsulation, the gas in MEMS is usually rarefied gas. Therefore, to correctly predict the damping force, the rarefied gas effect must be considered. To study the nonlinear SFD problem involving the rarefied gas effect, a kinetic method, i.e., discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS), is introduced in this paper. Also, based on the DUGKS, two solving methods, i.e., a traditional decoupled method (Eulerian scheme) and a coupled framework (arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme), are adopted. With these two methods, two basic motion forms, i.e., linear (perpendicular) and tilting motions of a rigid micro-beam, are studied under forced and free oscillations. For a forced oscillation, the nonlinear SFD phenomenon is investigated. For a free oscillation, in the resonance regime, some numerical results at different maximum oscillating velocities are presented and discussed. Besides, the influence of oscillation frequency on the damping force or torque is also studied, and the cause of the nonlinear damping phenomenon is investigated.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an alternative numerical method is proposed to predict the two-phase flow during dendritic growth under melt convection. It consists of two main parts. The phase-field method (PFM) is used for modeling the solid phase and tracking the morphological changes during dendritic solidification, and the finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method (FDLBM) is used for predicting the fluid flow of the liquid phase . The no-slip boundary condition to take into account the interaction between liquid and solid phases at the interface is modeled as a diffusive drag force. This method is referred to as phase field-finite difference lattice Boltzmann method (PF-FDLBM). In the numerical formulation, a collision term with single relaxation time (SRT) is used for simplicity, and a negative viscosity term is included to improve numerical stability . The proposed method can be implemented on regular and non-regular grids. Two-dimensional benchmark computations of flows past a circular cylinder show that the no-slip boundary condition is well satisfied. The flow patterns and drag coefficients are appropriately predicted even for flows at low Reynolds numbers , in which viscous forces commonly deteriorate numerical stability . Then, simulations of dendritic growth under melt convection are carried out with the present method. The effect of melt convection on the solidification patterns is well predicted for an alloy with its actual physical properties. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated considering an increase of the relaxation time , and its influence related to the computational resources . As a result, faster and stable computations are possible by appropriately setting the relaxation time and the negative viscosity term in PF-FDLBM formulation.},

We investigate the behavior of this new mathematical tool on the lowest-order conforming approximation of the three-dimensional Poisson equation . This work also assesses the convergence rate of the VEM when applied to very general polyhedral meshes, including non-convex and skewed three-dimensional elements. Such meshes are created within an original mesh generation framework, which is designed to allow the generation of meshes with very different sizes, connectivity, and geometrical properties.

The model problem is rewritten in terms of a first-order system, without the pressure, based on the introduction of the strain tensor and a nonlinear pseudo-stress tensor in the fluid equations. After a variational approach, the resulting weak model is then augmented using appropriate redundant penalization terms for the fluid equations along with a standard primal formulation for the heat and substance concentration. Then, it is rewritten as an equivalent fixed-point problem. Well-posedness results for both the continuous and the discrete schemes are stated, as well as the respective convergence result under certain regularity assumptions combined with the Lax-Milgram theorem, and the Banach and Brouwer fixed-point theorems. In particular, Raviart-Thomas elements of order k are used for approximating the pseudo-stress tensor, piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k and ≤ k + 1 ≤k+1 are utilized for approximating the strain tensor and the velocity, respectively, and the heat and substance concentration are approximated by means of Lagrange finite elements of order ≤ k + 1 ≤k+1 . Optimal a priori error estimates are derived and confirmed through some numerical examples that illustrate the performance of the proposed semi-augmented mixed-primal scheme.},

It is found that the RPIM with sufficiently large support domains of quadrature points is able to yield almost no spatial dispersion errors which are much lower than those from the traditional finite element (FE) approach with the identical node distributions , hence we can monotonically improve the computation accuracy of the numerical results by using the decreasing time steps, namely the present method shows the important and attractive monotonic convergence property for transient wave analysis. This property makes the present method clearly superior to the standard FE approach in transient wave analysis and much more accurate solutions can be achieved.

The interaction between solute transport and interface capillary determines eutectic growth under convection. By employing a multiphase-field lattice-Boltzmann method, together with a parallel-adaptive mesh refinement algorithm, the effect of convection on 3D eutectic growth is quantified including lamellar and rod eutectics. The flow-induced solute distribution changes eutectic growth dynamics by establishing a new solute transport equilibrium. The growth behaviors of different eutectic patterns are investigated, and the eutectic growth dynamics is largely dependent on the constitutional undercooling and the curvature undercooling ahead of the solidification front. The natural convection changes the width ratio of coexisting solid phases, while the forced convection causes a tilt band for both lamellar and rod eutectics. Rod-to-lamellar transition under larger convection intensity, which is first predicted by numerical techniques, is discussed and good agreement with previous works is achieved. The deep understanding of the convection effect can help guide how to regulate eutectic patterns through changing the solidification condition.},

  abstract     = {On the basis of phase-field theory, we develop a simple lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for liquid-vapor-solid flow with thermal phase change, which is able to deal with large fluid density contrasts. The conservative Allen-Cahn equation and Navier-Stokes equations are modified to take into account the phase change effects based on the Stefan boundary condition. Three distribution functions are used in the model, one of which is to track the interface among the fluids, one is employed for the fluid hydrodynamics , and the other one is utilized to solve the heat equation. The LB evolution equations are incorporated with proper source terms such that the modified interface tracking equation and hydrodynamic equations can be derived exactly. The proposed model for phase change is much simpler than the previous phase-field LB models. Combining with particle dynamics algorithms , the present model can further simulate liquid-vapor-solid systems with phase change. Several numerical tests, including the one-dimensional Stefan problem and droplet evaporation, have been performed to test the accuracy and stability of the present model, and the results obtained by this approach are in good agreement with the theory. Evaporation of a droplet wetting on a particle is simulated, it is found the fluid-solid interaction associated with the interface can be captured. Finally, as an application, the motion and growth of a rising vapor bubble with a particle through a superheated liquid is investigated.},

The PDWG finite element scheme for the div-curl system has two prominent features in that it offers not only an accurate and reliable numerical solution to the div-curl system under the low H α Hα -regularity ( α &gt; 0 α&amp;gt;0 ) assumption for the true solution, but also an effective approximation of the normal harmonic vector fields on domains with complex topology. Seven numerical experiments are conducted and the results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the PDWG algorithm, including one example on the computation of discrete normal harmonic vector fields.},

  abstract     = {A linear lattice Boltzmann flux solver (LLBFS) is developed based on the high-precision finite-volume method (FVM) and is used to simulate problems involving acoustic propagation . The least-squares-based finite difference (LSFD) is used to construct the high-precision FVM, which discretizes the linear Navier–Stokes equations (LNSE). In terms of the flux calculation for the interface of the control cell, the LLBFS is derived by comparing the macroscopic and microscopic variables through the Chapman–Enskog (C-E) multi-scale analysis, which establishes the relationship between the linear lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) and the LNSE. The algorithm has the following advantages. First, the proposed LLBFS inherits the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann flux solver (LBFS), i.e., the local solution of the lattice Boltzmann equation is used to calculate the fluxes; handling the inviscid and viscous fluxes simultaneously makes for a more consistent algorithm and it can be expanded to the multi-dimensional scheme without approximation . Second, solving the LNSE using the high-precision FVM on unstructured grids , which enables problems involving acoustic waves interacting with complex geometries can be simulated conveniently. To validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, several cases are simulated, including acoustic waves propagating in an inviscid and viscous mean flow and interacting with complex geometries.},

This method can accurately capture both compressible phenomena such as shock waves as well as small turbulent structures. With a detailed analysis of the numerical viscosity and effective eddy viscosities in physical and spectral spaces, the method is verified to be suitable for the simulation of compressible turbulent flows.

We start from the usual way of changing the given equation into a mixed system using the Darcy&#39;s law , u = − K ∇ p u=−K∇p . By integrating the system of equations with some judiciously chosen test spaces on each element, we define new mixed virtual volume methods of all orders. We show that these new schemes are equivalent to the nonconforming virtual element methods for the primal variable p . Once the primary variable is computed solving the symmetric, positive definite system, all the degrees of freedom for the Darcy velocity are locally computed. Also, the L 2 L2 -projection onto the polynomial space is easy to compute. Hence our work opens an easy way to compute Darcy velocity on the polygonal/polyhedral grids. For the lowest order case, we give a formula to compute a Raviart-Thomas space like representation which satisfies the conservation law . An optimal error analysis is carried out and numerical results are presented which support the theory.},

  abstract     = {Images taken and stored digitally are often degraded by noise, so that the perceived image quality is significantly decreased in the presence of noise and human gaze behavior is affected by this noise as well. In recent years, image denoising has been modeled as partial differential equations (PDEs), which can be said to eliminate noise as well as preserve image detail is one of their main advantages. Numerical simulation of these PDEs, which are often nonlinear, high-order and high-dimensional, is one of the most challenging topics in this field. In this paper, one of the most powerful meshless numerical approaches , the operator splitting radial basis function (RBF) collocation method, is introduced to solve two modified versions of the Perona-Malik (PM) equation. The method splits each problem into several equations each of which is solved in one direction so as to make the major problem solvable in a smaller size. Furthermore, being in one direction makes it possible to solve the equations without any need for domain decomposition and its complexities. An unconditionally stable method (Crank-Nicolson) is used for discretizing time in this paper. Using meshless approaches in the image processing problems makes sense since the structure of digital images consist of pixels that corresponds to the distributed nodes of the meshless method so the complex time consuming domain construction of the finite element methods is avoided to get higher speeds in obtaining the desired denoised results. Some images with different noise levels are denoised using the presented method in the section of numerical results to show the desirable performance of the method. Also, the quality of the denoised images are concluded in tables which can be used to compare the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {The tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts key effects on tumor development, progression and treatment. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of various cellular and molecular interactions in the TME is very important. In this study, we combined a dynamic model and data analysis to quantitatively explore how microenvironmental factors influence tumor growth and three phases of cancer immunoediting. First, we presented a model system of partial differential equations (PDEs) using four main types of cells within the microenvironment of solid tumors and used two sets of published experimental data to validate the model. Accordingly, the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) was calculated to identify the sensitive parameters related to significant biological processes. Furthermore, numerical simulations indicated that the power of tumor proliferation exerts a substantial effect on the state of malignancy, but tumor control is achieved by adjusting sensitive microenvironmental factors, such as immune intensity and the proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Moreover, we used two indicators to quantify three states, i.e., elimination, equilibrium and escape from cancer immunoediting. The quantitative analysis of the TME revealed that immune cells and CAFs dynamically guide the transition of the three states of immunoediting, namely, how these related factors affect the capacity of the immune system to eliminate developing tumor cells, hold them in an equilibrium state, or facilitate their expanded growth. These quantitative results provide new insights into how various microenvironmental changes mediate both natural and therapeutically induced cancer immunoediting responses.},

The coarse spaces in the multigrid hierarchy are constructed by first aggregating degrees of freedom, and then solving some local flow problems. The mixed formulation and the choice of coarse spaces allow us to assemble the coarse problems without visiting finer levels during the solving phase, which is crucial for the scalability of multigrid methods. Specifically, a natural generalization of the upwind flux can be evaluated directly on coarse levels using the precomputed coarse flux basis vectors. The resulting solver is applicable to problems discretized on general unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed nonlinear multigrid solver in comparison with the standard single level Newton&#39;s method is demonstrated through challenging numerical examples. It is observed that the proposed solver is robust for highly nonlinear problems and clearly outperforms Newton&#39;s method in the case of high Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers.},

In the modified phase-field LB method, two multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) LB equations are utilized, one with a nondiagonal relaxation matrix used to solve the conserved Allen-Cahn (A-C) equation and the other with a modified discrete source term used to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. Based on the idea of geometric formulation, two wetting boundary schemes corresponding to the modified phase-field LB model are proposed. In the first scheme, a layer of virtual nodes is utilized to realize the geometric formulation. The values of the order parameter at the virtual nodes are determined by the central difference method. In the second scheme, the geometric formulation is realized through a local scheme for the gradient terms of the order parameter where the nonequilibrium parts of the distribution function are utilized. Compared with the first wetting boundary scheme and some previous models, the second wetting boundary scheme does not require the virtual nodes and simplifies the numerical implementation. The developed two schemes are validated through a series of benchmark simulations, including droplet spreading on idea substrate, capillary intrusion and droplet shearing on nonideal substrate. It is found that satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by both two schemes, and the second scheme can obtain better stability while the first scheme shows better performance in simulating contact angle hysteresis.},

The accuracy of the scheme for momentum equation is O ( τ + h x 2 + h y 2 ) O(τ+hx2+hy2) , while the one for temperature and concentration equations is O ( τ 2 + h x 2 + h y ) O(τ2+hx2+hy) . Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify methods and demonstrate the analysis effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Supermodeling is a modern, model-ensembling paradigm that integrates several self-synchronized imperfect sub-models by controlling a few meta-parameters to generate more accurate predictions of complex systems&#39; dynamics. Continual synchronization between sub-models is an attractive alternative allowing for accurate trajectory predictions compared to a single model or a classical ensemble of independent models whose decision fusion is based on the majority voting or averaging the outcomes. However, it comes out from numerous observations that the supermodeling procedure&#39;s convergence depends on a few principal factors such as (1) the number of sub-models, (2) their proper selection, and (3) the choice of the convergent optimization procedure , which assimilates the supermodel meta-parameters to data. Herein, we focus on modeling the evolution of the system described by a set of PDEs . We prove that supermodeling is conditionally convergent to a fixed-point attractor regarding only the supermodel meta-parameters. In our proof, we assume constant parametrization of the sub-models. We investigate the formal conditions of the convergence of the supermodeling scheme theoretically. We employ the Banach fixed point theorem for the supermodeling correction operator, updating the synchronization constants&#39; values iteratively. From the theoretical estimate, we make the following conclusions. The nudging of the supermodel to the ground truth (real data assimilated) should be well balanced because both too small and too large attraction to data cause the supermodel desynchronization. The time-step size can control the convergence of the training procedure, by balancing the Lipshitz continuity constant of the PDE operator. All the sub-models have to be close to the ground-truth along the training trajectory but still sufficiently diverse to explore the phase space better. As an example, we discuss the three-dimensional supermodel of tumor evolution to demonstrate the supermodel&#39;s perfect fit to artificial data generated based on real medical images.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the weakly singular integrals in thin structures of 3D boundary element method . In the pioneering woks for the weakly singular integrals, the singularities are eliminated through introducing transformations whose Jacobian at the singular point is zero. When using these methods for weakly singular boundary integrals on elements with a large-angle and large side length ratio, near singularity will appear. In this paper, a dual transformation method is proposed to accurately calculate weakly singular integrals in which the near singularity is also considered. The numerical implementation is divided into several steps. Firstly, the ( α , β ) coordinate transformation method is used to eliminate the weak singularity by introducing the α factors in the transformation Jacobian. Then extract the integral form with near singularities about β . Finally, a corresponding distance transformation is constructed to eliminate its near singularity. The results show that the proposed method can accurately integrate for arbitrary element shape and source point position. The dual transformation method may be a good choice to evaluate weakly singular integral for thin structural problem.},

In order to accelerate Newton-MG method for calculating the finite difference (FD) solution on the finest grid, a quite good initial guess is constructed from the fourth-order FD solutions at two coarse levels by using Richardson extrapolation and bi-quartic polynomial interpolation , which greatly reduces the number of Newton iterations required. A completed extrapolation technique is adopted to generate a sixth-order extrapolated solution on entire finest grid cheaply.

  abstract     = {Down-sampling in the process of saving and transferring images often leads to the appearance of jaggies or step like edges in the objects of images where they should be smooth to seem natural. The application of blurring filters for the purpose of anti-aliasing images seems inappropriate since it leaves a blurring effect that destroys the edges in a way that they become indistinguishable. In 2012 Ziou and Horé proposed a novel partial differential equation (PDE) in which anti-aliased images efficiently. However, solving this equation as it is severely nonlinear and defined in a large domain due to the size of images is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method that is based on a combination of iterative operator splitting (IOS) technique with Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) method for solving this equation in an efficient way. The proposed method converts the problem to several one-dimensional linear problems that are solved in smaller sizes to overcome the large domain of the problem. The Crank-Nicolson method is applied for the discretization of the time dimension . The proposed method is tested on different gray-scale, color, and outline images to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method visually and numerically in the section of numerical results.},

Essential boundary conditions are imposed weakly through the functionals with proper norms. It is proved that the Ritz approximation is the best approximation in the energy norm; moreover, effect of numerical integration for the Ritz approximation is analyzed as well. Two estimators for adaptive neuron enhancement method are introduced, one is the so-called recovery estimator and the other is the least-squares estimator.

This theory shows that, if the solution operator is bounded polynomially in the wavenumber k , then the Galerkin method is quasioptimal provided that h k / p ≤ C 1 hk/p≤C1 and p ≥ C 2 log ⁡ k p≥C2log⁡k , where C 1 C1 is sufficiently small, C 2 C2 is sufficiently large, and both are independent of k , h k,h , and p . The significance of this result is that if h k / p = C 1 hk/p=C1 and p = C 2 log ⁡ k p=C2log⁡k , then quasioptimality is achieved with the total number of degrees of freedom proportional to k d kd ; i.e., the hp -FEM does not suffer from the pollution effect. This paper proves the analogous quasioptimality result for the heterogeneous (i.e. variable-coefficient) Helmholtz equation , posed in R d Rd , d = 2 , 3 d=2,3 , with the Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity, and C ∞ C∞ coefficients. We also prove a bound on the relative error of the Galerkin solution in the particular case of the plane-wave scattering problem.

The numerical solution is obtained explicitly using the Euler&#39;s methods and the separation of variables. To reconstruct the 3D object from two slice data, we set one slice as the target data and the other data as the initial data. We solve the governing equation and stack intermediate solutions based on the relative fraction of the symmetric difference of two regions occupied by the target and source data. To demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct a 3D model through extracted intermediate slice data during shape transformation, we perform several computational tests.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NNLSE), which is an important extension of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). Since the nonlinearity of NNLSE involves a convolution , numerical approximation of its solution is very expensive. To achieve an efficient numerical method for solving the NNLSE, according to the property of convolution, we firstly present a partial differential equation (PDE) method to transfer the NNLSE from an integro-differential equation to an equivalent or approximate system of PDEs, and the numerical solution of the NNLSE can then be obtained by solving these PDEs. Based on the recently developed finite integration method (FIM), we derive an improved method (IFIM) in this paper. The novelty of this IFIM is that the quadrature method is only used once instead of multiple times for multi-layer integral, so it consumes less running time and provides higher accuracy. In addition, we adapt a second-order operator-splitting method (OS2) at each time-step to ensure a convergent solution for long-time integration. Several numerical experiments are given to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed IFIM for solving the NNLSE.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops and investigates a new method for the application of Dirichlet boundary conditions for computational models defined by point clouds. Point cloud models often stem from laser or structured-light scanners which are used to scan existing mechanical structures for which CAD models either do not exist or from which the artifact under investigation deviates in shape or topology. Instead of reconstructing a CAD model from point clouds via surface reconstruction and a subsequent boundary conforming mesh generation , a direct analysis without pre-processing is possible using embedded domain finite element methods . These methods use non-boundary conforming meshes which calls for a weak enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions . For point cloud based models, Dirichlet boundary conditions are usually imposed using a diffuse interface approach. This leads to a significant computational overhead due to the necessary computation of domain integrals. Additionally, undesired side effects on the gradients of the solution arise which can only be controlled to some extent. This paper develops a new sharp interface approach for point cloud based models which avoids both issues. The computation of domain integrals is circumvented by an implicit approximation of corresponding Voronoi diagrams of higher order and the resulting sharp approximation avoids the side effects of diffuse approaches. Benchmark examples from the graphics as well as the computational mechanics community are used to verify the algorithm. All algorithms are implemented in the FCMLab framework and provided at https://gitlab.lrz.de/cie_sam_public/fcmlab/ . Further, we discuss challenges and limitations of point cloud based analysis w.r.t. application of Dirichlet boundary conditions.},

The algorithm is decoupled in Elsässer variables and permits a shared coefficient matrix for all members at each time-step. Thus, the algorithm is much more computationally efficient than separately computing simulations for each member using usual MHD algorithms. We prove the proposed algorithm is unconditionally stable and convergent. Several numerical tests are given to support the predicted convergence rates. Finally, we test the proposed scheme and observe how the physical behavior changes as the coupling number increases in a lid-driven cavity problem with mean Reynolds number R e ≈ 15000 Re≈15000 , and as the deviation of uncertainties in the initial and boundary conditions increases in a channel flow past a step problem.},

In this work, the snap-through buckling of composite cylindrical shell panels subjected to lateral loads is calculated and designed. We present a novel method to extract the essential features of the snap-through response using a fast path-following scheme, and subsequently apply them as inputs to the stacking sequence optimization. In the path-following scheme, the full snap-through response can be achieved efficiently based on the finite element perturbation method, meanwhile its numerical accuracy is well guaranteed by the necessary corrections on residual forces. The essential features of the snap-through response, i.e. the load-limit point, critical deflection and jump deflection, are selected to be either the objective or the constraint in the stacking sequence optimization. The stacking sequence optimization using the genetic algorithm can be realized considering the severe geometrical nonlinearities of mechanics responses, benefiting from the high efficiency and robustness of a single function call. Composite cylindrical shell panels with various geometry/lamination configurations and load/displacement boundary conditions, are considered in the stacking sequence optimizations, to validate the good performance of the proposed method.},

Using the resolution tests, the detailed convergence analysis of the numerical method is carried out. The efficiency of the developed model is demonstrated by simulating the processes of heating, energy storage and cooling of the TES taking into account the lateral heat losses at various values of heat loss intensity and PCM heat conductivity. A comparison of the solutions obtained by 1D and 2D models is carried out, and the applicability of commonly used 1D approach for simulating processes in the axisymmetric TES with lateral heat losses is analyzed. It is shown that the ability of the 1D model to predict the averaged parameters decreases not only with increasing heat transfer coefficient, but also with decreasing PCM heat conductivity. The use of the 1D approach at large lateral heat losses does not provide guaranteed lower or upper bound for the sought parameters.},

Positivity of the parallel scheme based on monotone finite volume element method is proved.

These parallel schemes are of intrinsic parallelism since we apply the prediction-correction technique to the interface of subdomains coming from an artificial division of computational domain or multi-medium physical domain. The proposed parallel schemes need only local communication among neighboring processors.

Rational inattention as a novel adaptive strategy to collect information and intervene against the target system is modeled using Erlangization. The system dynamics containing the river discharge following a continuous-state branching with an immigration-type process and the controlled sediment storage dynamics lead to a nonsmooth and nonlocal infinitesimal generator. Modeling uncertainty, which is ubiquitous in certain applications, is considered in a robust control framework in which deviations between the benchmark and distorted models are penalized through relative entropy. The partial integro-differential Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman–Isaacs (HJBI) equation as an optimality equation is derived, and its uniqueness, existence, and optimality are discussed. A monotone finite difference scheme guaranteeing the boundedness and uniqueness of numerical solutions is proposed to discretize the HJBI equation and is verified based on manufactured solutions. Model applications are also conducted with the parameter values identified from the available data and physical formulae.

In order to match the rotation form and ease error analysis, a skew-symmetric discrete trilinear form containing the reconstruction operator is proposed, in which not only the velocity test function is changed. The corresponding well-posed discrete weak formulation stems straight from the classical inf-sup stable mixed conforming high-order finite elements, and it is proved to achieve the pressure-independent velocity errors.

Coupling between separately-parameterized patches uses a slight modification of the penalty formulation proposed by Herrema et al.

Our open-source implementation leverages both advanced code generation through the FEniCS toolchain and efficient computational geometry operations through the Open Cascade modeling kernel.

The domain of the PDE is firstly decomposed into several overlapping subdomains and the original inverse source identification problem is then transformed into smaller independent subproblems defined on these subdomains. Each subproblem is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem with appropriate conditions prescribed on the inner boundaries and discretized by finite element method. The resulting coupled algebraic systems are solved simultaneously by restarted GMRES method with a space-time restricted additive Schwarz preconditioner. When forming the preconditioner, a second level of domain decomposition is introduced for each subdomain. The solutions of these subproblems are combined together to form an approximated global solution to the original inverse problem by discarding the overlapping parts of the solution. Since all the subproblems are solved independently, the two-level domain decomposition method provides higher degree of parallelism and saves much computing time. Numerical experiments conducted on a supercomputer with thousands of processor cores validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.},

Considering the boundary conditions of heat conduction and combining the Galerkin method, virtual source functions of particular solutions can be solved by first using VBMGM. Applying boundary conditions of transformation, virtual source functions of homogeneous solutions can be obtained by second employing VBMGM. The coefficients of two matrix equations are symmetrical.

The basic estimate is then refined to distinguish the different components of the error, and is used as a starting point to design an algorithm including adaptive stopping criteria for the nonlinear solver and automatic tuning of a regularization parameter .

Since the complex activation function e i x → eix→ is introduced to be the activation function of the neural network, PWNN significantly improves the computational speed and accuracy as compared to traditional activation based neural networks (TANN) and the finite difference method (FDM), for relatively large wave number problems. We establish a new upper bound for error estimates for homogeneous Helmholtz solutions in two dimensions by plane waves, which is different from the previous estimates by generalized harmonic polynomials. Based on the new error estimates, the theoretical guidance is given for choosing the number of neural network&#39;s neurons and the initial value to accelerate network training. The analyses of computational complexity related to the wave number k are given for PWNN with two layers, TANN, the plane wave partition of unity method (PWPUM) and FDM. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D are performed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of PWNN. Especially for large wave number problems, like k = 500 k=500 , PWNN can get the solution with relative error less than 10 − 4 10−4 in less than 20 seconds, which is more efficient than other methods.},

Error estimates are needed to determine when the accuracy is insufficient and a more costly special quadrature method should be utilized. The final result of this paper are such quadrature error estimates for the composite Gauss-Legendre rule and the global trapezoidal rule , when applied to evaluate layer potentials defined over smooth curved surfaces in R 3 R3 . The estimates have no unknown coefficients and can be efficiently evaluated given the discretization of the surface, invoking a local one-dimensional root-finding procedure. They are derived starting with integrals over curves, using complex analysis involving contour integrals , residue calculus and branch cuts . By complexifying the parameter plane, the theory can be used to derive estimates also for curves in R 3 R3 . These results are then used in the derivation of the estimates for integrals over surfaces. In this procedure, we also obtain error estimates for layer potentials evaluated over curves in R 2 R2 . Such estimates combined with a local root-finding procedure for their evaluation were earlier derived for the composite Gauss-Legendre rule for layer potentials written in complex form [4] . This is here extended to provide quadrature error estimates for both complex and real formulations of layer potentials, both for the Gauss-Legendre and the trapezoidal rule . Numerical examples are given to illustrate the performance of the quadrature error estimates. The estimates for integration over curves are in many cases remarkably precise, and the estimates for curved surfaces in R 3 R3 are also sufficiently precise, with sufficiently low computational cost, to be practically useful.},

We propose a topology optimization method for isotropic linear elastic body problems using LBM in this paper, as a first step to realize this. First, the analysis approach of the isotropic linear elastic field using LBM is constructed with incorporating the expansion technique of the governing equations for applying to a topology optimization framework. Next, based on the density approach, the optimization problem is formulated, and by using the adjoint lattice Boltzmann method (ALBM), the design sensitivity is derived.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a general numerical platform for designing accurate, efficient, and stable numerical algorithms for incompressible hydrodynamic models that obey thermodynamical laws. The obtained numerical schemes are automatically linear in time. It decouples the hydrodynamic variable and other state variables such that only small-size linear problems need to be solved at each time marching step. Furthermore, if the classical velocity projection method is utilized, the velocity field and pressure field can be decoupled. In the end, only a few elliptic-type equations shall be solved in each time step. This strategy is made possible through a sequence of model reformulations by exploring the models&#39; thermodynamic structures. The generalized Onsager principle directly guides these reformulation procedures. In the reformulated but equivalent models, the reversible and irreversible components can be identified, guiding the numerical platform to decouple the reversible and irreversible dynamics. This eventually leads to decoupled numerical algorithms, given that the coupling terms only involve irreversible dynamics. To further demonstrate the numerical platform&#39;s power, we apply it to several specific incompressible hydrodynamic models. The energy stability of the proposed numerical schemes is shown in detail. The second-order accuracy in time is verified numerically through time step refinement tests. Several benchmark numerical examples are presented to further illustrate the proposed numerical framework&#39;s accuracy, stability, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a finite temperature multiscale method for simulating complex dynamics with different spatial scales accurately and efficiently. We separate the domain into an MD (Molecular Dynamics) subdomain and an MC (MacrosCopic) subdomain, with a handshaking subdomain between two scales. We cast the coarse grid over the whole domain using a matching differential operator approach. We reassign the coarse grid displacement in the MD subdomain with an average of the MD solution. Using a spectral decomposition in a handshaking subdomain, we split the displacement of atoms into its mean and fluctuation parts. The mean part is reassigned by the coarse grid linear interpolation , which is the main technique to realize information exchange from the coarse grid to fine grid consistently. A two-way artificial boundary condition is proposed for eliminating boundary reflections and injecting heat sources . With the two-way boundary condition, we design the heat jet approach and combine with the handshaking subdomain, which is used to implement temperature control in crystalline solids. Numerical tests of linear lattice and non-linear lattice with Morse potential in one space dimension illustrate the accuracy and effectiveness of resolving information exchange between the two scales subject to thermal fluctuations at a given temperature.},

The periodic heterogeneities are relevant to the mesoscopic scale at which a double porous medium constituted by a hyperelastic skeleton and an incompressible viscous fluid is featured by large contrasts in the permeability. Within the Eulerian framework related to the current deformed configuration , the two-scale homogenization approach is applied to a linearized model discretized in time, being associated with an incremental formulation. For this, the equilibrium equation and the mass conservation expressed in the spatial configuration are differentiated using the material derivative with respect to a convection velocity field . The homogenization procedure of the linearized equations provides effective (homogenized) material properties which are computed to constitute the incremental macroscopic problem. The coupled algorithm for the multiscale problem is implemented using the finite element method .

  abstract     = {We revisit the Partially-Saturated-Cells method (PSC) in the context of incompressible single-phase flows past stationary and moving bodies. This methodology adds a solid collision operator to the Lattice Boltzmann Equation, resulting in a unified evolution equation everywhere in the domain that suitably accounts for the boundary conditions. The unified evolution equation, which also allows for a smooth transition from solid cells to fluid cells, is dictated by the solid volume fraction, obtained using a simple geometric approach. We prove that the PSC approach exhibits nominal second-order accuracy in presence of straight and curved boundaries for pressure, although spatial order of accuracy in velocity degrades to first-order. Our analysis also reveals that PSC is approximately discretely conservative in the incompressible limit with the mass conservation errors being dependent on the lattice size and relaxation time. For simulations involving moving body problems, the method is found to introduce acceptable level of spurious force oscillations, which rapidly decrease with increasing grid resolution. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, the present investigations pertaining to discrete conservation and spurious force oscillations in the PSC approach have never been discussed in literature. Extensive numerical experiments are performed involving both stationary and moving bodies, with imposed and induced motion, to assess the applicability of the PSC approach. Our findings illustrate that the inclusion of added mass effects are important for accurate force and torque computations in case of accelerating solids. Numerical investigations, that include unsteady flows featuring three degrees-of-freedom fluid-particle interactions clearly highlight the ability of the PSC approach in resolving complex hydrodynamical phenomena. This in-depth evaluation of the PSC approach conclusively demonstrates its efficacy as a promising computational framework for efficient and robust computations of incompressible fluid flows over a range of flow scenarios.},

Through a duality scheme, developed recently for the design of pre-stressed membranes, the optimal vault problem is reduced to a pair of mutually dual convex problems formulated on the 2D reference region. The vault constructed upon solutions of those problems is both of minimum volume and minimum compliance; analytical examples of optimal vaults are given. Through a measure-theoretic approach, such optimal vaults are proved to solve the Prager problem of designing a 3D structure that by compression carries a transmissible load. The ground structure method applied to the convex problems furnishes a pair of discrete, conic quadratic programs leading to optimal design of grid-shells. By adopting the member-adding adaptive technique, this pair is efficiently tackled numerically. The computer method is demonstrated on a number of examples where highly precise grid-shell approximations of optimal vaults are found.},

The formulation of boundary layer configurations for microbes propagation, fluid temperature, the volume fraction of nano-inclusions, and the fluid velocity with varying persuasive parameters have discussed. The main findings of the prevailing assessment are that an increasing trend in the ablation/slash accretion in leading-edge declines in the non-dimensional melting factor of fluid velocity and temperature, while a decreasing trend has seen with the enhancing impact of ablation/slash accretion at the leading edge that represents the flow velocity deceleration.

We firstly show that the solutions, independent of regulation parameter, can be bounded. Then these bounds are used to derive bounds on the time-derivatives which are also independent of regulation parameter. In addition, compactness arguments have been used to discuss the convergence of the finite element the approximate problem. We demonstrated the existence of a weak solution for the model under study.

The idea of the former is to introduce suitable auxiliary variables to facilitate construction of high order stable schemes for a large class of gradient flows . We propose a new technique to treat the coupling terms involved in the crystal growth model, and introduce suitable stabilization terms to result in totally decoupled schemes, which satisfy a discrete energy law without affecting the convergence order. A delicate implementation demonstrates that the proposed schemes can be realized in a very efficient way. That is, it only requires solving four linear elliptic equations and a simple algebraic equation at each time step. A detailed comparison with existing schemes is given, and the advantage of the new schemes is emphasized. As far as we know this is the first second-order scheme that is totally decoupled, linear, unconditionally stable for the dendritic crystal growth model with variable mobility parameter.},

  abstract     = {In the simulation of biological pattern forming, it has been observed that the numerical solution is more sensitive to the spatial mesh resolution than the temporal one. Such a higher sensitivity to the spatial resolution is mainly originated from an inaccurate approximation of diffusion differential operators , which might violate the rotational symmetry to be seriously erroneous in low spatial resolutions. Also, it has been known that the second-order Crank-Nicolson time-stepping procedure may introduce spurious oscillations when the initial data or the source term is nonsmooth and the temporal step size is set relatively large. This article studies 9-point finite difference schemes for the diffusion operator to enhance the rotational symmetry , employs the variable- θ method to achieve a nonoscillatory second-order time-stepping procedure, and adopts an effective relaxation linear solver to solve the algebraic systems efficiently. The variable- θ method is proved to satisfy the maximum principle, which guarantees that the time-stepping procedure is unconditionally stable. When the successive over-relaxation method with an optimal relaxation parameter is adopted for the algebraic solver, the iteration converges in 2-4 iterations in most time steps. The overall algorithm is second-order in accuracy and scalable in efficiency. Various examples are given to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the numerical solution of the system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations.},

While classical methods for calculating the value function are generally based on a discretization in the state space, optimistic planning algorithms have the advantage of using adaptive discretization in the control space. These approaches are therefore very suitable for control problems where the dimension of the control variable is low and allow to deal with problems where the dimension of the state space can be very high. Our algorithms also have the advantage of providing, for given computing resources, the best control strategy whose performance is as close as possible to optimality while its corresponding trajectory comply with the state constraints up to a given accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, numerical predictions are performed for a planar prefilming atomizer using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. The main target is to inspect the effects of surface wettability on the primary liquid film breakup at the prefilmer edge. To this end, a phase-field-based multiple-relaxation-time LB model for two-phase flow is derived and verified for the present study, as well as the wetting boundary scheme. After that, the effects of surface wettability are assessed by specifying different contact angles during the simulations. Numerical results indicate that the whole primary breakup process of the liquid film can be roughly divided into three interactive stages: (i) liquid accumulation at the trailing edge ; (ii) ligament formation and its flapping movements; (iii) ligament breakup and droplet formation. It is visible that the liquid accumulation and the following ligament breakup show similar periodic patterns with quite consistent frequencies. Besides, when the contact angle is increased, the volume of liquid accumulated at the prefilmer edge declines, the maximum flapping region of ligaments shrinks, the ligament breakup length reduces, but the ligament breakup frequency increases . Based on the above-mentioned results, it can be concluded that the prefilmer with hydrophobic surfaces benefits the primary liquid film breakup in the close vicinity of the prefilmer edge.},

  abstract     = {In incompressible flow problems, the finite element discretization of pressure and velocity can be done through either stable spaces or stabilized pairs. For equal-order stabilized methods with piecewise linear discretization , the classical theory guarantees only linear convergence for the pressure approximation . However, a higher order is often observed, yet seldom discussed, in numerical practice. Such experimental observations may, in the absence of a sound a priori error analysis , mislead the selection of finite element spaces in practical applications. Therefore, we present here a numerical analysis demonstrating that an initial higher-order pressure convergence may in fact occur under certain conditions, for equal-order elements of any degree. Moreover, our numerical experiments clearly indicate that whether and for how long this behavior holds is a problem-dependent matter. These findings confirm that an optimal pressure convergence can in general not be expected when using unbalanced velocity-pressure pairs.},

The nonstiff and stiff terms are treated explicitly and implicitly, respectively, based on the high order IMEX Runge-Kutta time discretization method that is asymptotic preserving and asymptotically accurate in the zero Mach number limit. A fifth-order WCNS and fourth-order centered finite difference schemes with zero numerical viscosity are used for the spatial discretization . Numerical tests in one and two space dimensions are displayed to demonstrate the performance of the high order semi-implicit WCNS in compressible and incompressible regimes. Comparisons with the third-order explicit weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme are also made in order to better assess the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the displacement dynamics of compound droplet inside porous medium with complex structure is numerically investigated by the newly-proposed wetting boundary treatments in Part 1 [1] . The compound droplet consists of two immiscible fluids surrounded by another fluid forming a three-phase system. To investigate the compound droplet&#39;s penetration and spreading in two regimes, the conservative phase-field model is solved via the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) at different wettability and governing non-dimensional numbers including the Reynolds number (25-100), Weber number (100-1000), and density ratio (7.5-750). Moreover, the permeation and spreading of each droplet, without the presence of the other in the binary system, is compared with those of ternary. It is revealed that the way the penetration is influenced by the variation of surface tension, wettability, and density ratio completely depends on the value of Bond number and the capillary or gravitational-dominant regimes. Furthermore, it appears that in the capillary-dominant regime, the migration pattern of one droplet cannot be evaluated independent of the other, since the factors affecting the capillary pressure and viscous coupling on one, affects the penetration and spreading of the other. Finally, it is identified that ternary penetration is slower than binary and the presence of the other droplet confines the early stage spreading in the ternary system .},

However, the extra 2D bubble function is difficult to be adopted as facet shape function for 3D polyhedral element. In this paper, a revised-scaled-boundary element (denoted by 2DRSBd2) only corresponding to the boundary nodal displacements is constructed by elimination of the 2D bubble function derived from the constant right-hand term in 2D Poisson equation. This polygonal element 2DRSBd2 possesses the second order completeness and the third order convergence in L 2 L2 -norm. Then we construct two polyhedral elements 3DSB-2DRSBd2 and 3DRSB-2DRSBd2 based on the polygonal element 2DRSBd2. The difference between the two 3D elements is: the 3DSB-2DRSBd2 element is constructed with three 3D bubble functions derived from the constant body loads in three dimensional elastostatic problem, while the 3D revised-scaled-boundary element 3DRSB-2DRSBd2 is constructed by elimination of those 3D bubble functions. Both elements 3DSB-2DRSBd2 and 3DRSB-2DRSBd2 possess the second order completeness and the third order convergence in L 2 L2 -norm.

To check the reliability of the proposed velocity field, the software ANSYS/LS-DYNA is used, and the change law of metal flow in the deformation zone is analyzed. Based on this velocity field, a three-dimensional rolling force model of extra-thick plate is established. During the analysis, the problem of integral difficulty due to the nonlinear Mises yield criterion is settled, and the internal power of deformation is deduced based on the method of inner product and accumulative summation of vector component. Meanwhile, the friction power and the shear power are also calculated by the method of co-line vector inner product and the variable upper bound integration method, respectively. The rolling force is acquired by the energy method and validated with the site measured value. The calculated deviations of the rolling forces between the model and the measured data are within 5.14%. Furthermore, the influences of the temperature difference of the workpiece, relative reduction, thickness-radius ratio, and friction factor on the rolling force model are analyzed. It is showing that the change law of the metal flow by simulation is consistent with the proposed velocity field, and the rolling force model accounting for the temperature difference of the workpiece is much closer to the actual situation.},

These systems occur in the simulation of fluid flow in vascularized biological tissue, root water and nutrient uptake in soil, hydrological or petroleum wells in rock formations, or heat transport in micro-cooling devices. The key processes, such as heat and mass transfer, are often dominated by the exchange between the network system and the embedding domain. By explicitly resolving the interface between these domains with the computational mesh, we can accurately describe these processes. The network is efficiently described by a network of line segments. Coupling terms are evaluated by projection of the interface variables. The new method is naturally applicable for nonlinear and time-dependent problems and can therefore be used as a reference method in the development of novel implicit interface 1D-3D methods and in the design of verification benchmarks for embedded tubular network methods. Implicit interface models, not resolving the bulk-network interface explicitly have proven to be very efficient but have only been mathematically analyzed for linear elliptic problems so far. Using two application scenarios, fluid perfusion of vascularized tissue and root water uptake from soil, we investigate the effect of some common modeling assumptions of implicit interface methods numerically.},

The proposed method works for any frequency ω , but is especially efficient for high-frequency problems. It is based on a time-domain approach and consists of three steps: i) computation of a suitable incoming plane wavelet with compact support in the propagation direction ; ii) solving a scattering problem in the time domain for the incoming plane wavelet; iii) reconstruction of the time-harmonic solution from the time-domain solution via a Fourier transform in time. An essential ingredient of the new method is a front-tracking mesh adaptation algorithm for solving the problem in ii) . By exploiting the limited support of the wave front , this allows us to make the number of the required degrees of freedom to reach a given accuracy significantly less dependent on the frequency ω . We also present a new algorithm for computing the Fourier transform in iii) that exploits the reduced number of degrees of freedom corresponding to the adapted meshes . Numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method and the fact that the method can also be applied with external source terms such as point sources and sound-soft scatterers .

  abstract     = {Not only coughing and sneezing, but even normal breathing can produce aerosols, because rupture of liquid plugs forms microdroplets during pulmonary airway reopening. Aerosols are important carriers of various viruses, such as influenza, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. To control airborne disease transmission, it is important to understand aerosol formation, which is related to the pressure drop, liquid plug, and film. In addition, the detrimental pressure and shear stress at the airway wall produced in the process of airway reopening have also attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we proposed a multiphase lattice Boltzmann method to numerically simulate pulmonary airway reopening, in which the gas-liquid transition is directly driven by the equation of state . After validating the numerical model, two rupture cases with and without aerosol formation were compared and analyzed. We found that injury of the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation was almost the same as that without aerosol formation, even though the pressure drop in the airway increased by about 50%. Further investigation showed that the aerosol size and maximum differences of the wall pressure and shear stress increased with pressure drop in the pulmonary airway. A similar trend was observed when the thickness of the liquid plug became larger, while an opposite trend occurred when the thickness of the liquid film increased. The model can be extended to study generation and transmission of bioaerosols carrying the influenza or coronavirus.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a fast finite volume method is proposed for the initial and boundary value problems of spatial fractional diffusion equations on nonuniform meshes. The discretizations of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives lead to unstructured dense coefficient matrices, differing from the Toeplitz-like structure under the uniform mesh. The fast algorithm is proposed by using the sum-of-exponentials (SOE) technique to the spatial kernel x α − 1 , α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) xα−1,α∈(0,1) . Then, the matrix-vector multiplications of the resulting coefficient matrices could be implemented in O ( m log 2 ⁡ m ) O(mlog2⁡m) operations, where m denotes the size of matrices. Iterative solvers are preferably applied to obtain the numerical solution. The proposed fast scheme is proved to be unconditionally stable for sufficiently accurate SOE approximation. Meanwhile, a banded preconditioner is exploited to accelerate the Krylov subspace method. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed fast algorithm.},

We extend least square method (LSM) objective function to a flexible wave band to obtain its difference coefficients. Our method (model-driven LSM) is based on flexible model parameters to obtain corresponding optimal difference coefficients, rather than a uniform set of coefficients applied to all models. To reduce the computation cost in parameter estimation, we introduce the architecture, training and application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to evaluate the staggered-grid finite-difference order and coefficients efficiently. In ANNs , double loss functions are adopted to ensure the stable and efficient convergence of training. Several numerical experiments for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional wave modeling are provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for the derivation of compact difference schemes for the approximation of an arbitrary order derivative. We formulate a methodology for calculating the approximation coefficients involving a large number of mesh points leading to very high-order formulas, e.g., 20th or 30th order. The main emphasis is on the first and second order derivative occurring in the Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow problems . Contrary to most studies on compact schemes in which the computational stencils employed in the discretization are narrow and consist of only a few mesh points K , in the presented paper we consider wide stencils that in practice are limited only by the overall number of the nodes in a computational grid . We analyze the features of such wide stencil based schemes in physical and spectral space. It is shown that the solutions obtained applying the schemes of the same order but involving different number of the mesh points characterize significantly different accuracy. This is presented by direct comparisons of the analytically derived formula for the leading terms of the truncation errors as well as in practical simulations. The test cases include a second order ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients , 1D Burgers equation and three typical benchmark problems used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), i.e., inviscid vortex advection , convected Taylor-Green vortices and a double jet flow. The obtained results are compared with available analytical solutions and the solutions obtained with the help of a pseudo-spectral method. We found that very high-order compact schemes reach the spectral accuracy characterized by the error decrease proportional to O ( h K ) O(hK) . In some cases, they show even higher accuracy, and moreover, reaching the limit of the machine precision they are substantially more resistant to the round-off errors.},

The proposed method reduces the size of the system by splitting the temperature, the velocity, and the pressure fields while preserving the accuracy of the simulations. A single-domain approach using a variant of the enthalpy-porosity formulation is employed. Incompressible Navier–Stokes problem with Boussinesq approximation for thermal effects in solid and liquid regions is considered. We regularize the discontinuous variables such as latent heat and material properties by a continuous and differentiable hyperbolic tangent function. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are illustrated by comparing the numerical results with numerical and experimental benchmark.},

The effectiveness and efficiency of these solutions are strictly checked through a series of comparisons with published ones in literature. Results show that our proposed approach holds both strong nonlinear processing capability and excellent local display characteristics so that it can be used to attack complicated nonlinear problems more efficiently and accurately than the traditional homotopy analysis method and the Coiflet wavelet analysis approach. Besides, physical properties of hybrid nanofluid behaviors are examined, it is noticed that, similar to nanofluids , the hybrid nanofluid is superior to traditional heat transfer fluids for heat transfer enhancement but it could be easier and cheaper.},

In this regard, we consider degenerating mobility functions and free energies of Landau, Flory–Huggins and double-obstacle type. We apply the Faedo–Galerkin method to the system, derive energy estimates, and use compactness theorems to pass to the limit in the discrete form. In order to compensate for the missing chain rule of fractional derivatives, we prove a fractional chain inequality for semiconvex functions. The work concludes with numerical simulations and a sensitivity analysis showing the influence of the fractional power.

Baran and Stoyan proved that these critical functions belong to the range of the divergence operator applied to Crouzeix-Raviart velocity functions and the macroelement technique implies the inf-sup stability. The generalization of this theory to cover odd polynomial orders p ≥ 5 p≥5 is involved; one reason is that the macroelement classes, which have been used for even p , are unsuitable for odd p . In this paper, we introduce a new and simple representation of non-conforming Crouzeix-Raviart basis functions of odd degree. We employ only one type of macroelement and derive representations of all possible critical functions.

  abstract     = {The lattice Boltzmann flux solver (LBFS) is a novel Boltzmann-typed solver under the finite volume framework, which has many advantages over traditional lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) solvers. However, the existing versions of LBFS are explicit in temporal discretization . Therefore, they are of low computational efficiency and are mostly applied to the simulation of flows around simple geometries . In this paper, an implicit lattice Boltzmann flux solver for compressible flows is proposed, which can efficiently march in time with a large CFL number, and therefore facilitates the simulation of flows around complex geometries in practical engineering applications . Aiming to obtain the time-accurate results of unsteady flows, the implicit LBFS is further combined with the dual time-stepping technique to efficiently simulate unsteady flows, in which a sub-iteration is applied on the pseudo time level. In the sub-iteration, the Jacobian matrix is preconditioned by the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LUSGS) method and solved by the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES). The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed solver are demonstrated by various simulations in a wide Mach number regime. To further demonstrate its performance in practical engineering applications , the proposed solver is also used to simulate the flow over complex aircraft models.},

For the fully discrete scheme, we use the fast L1 scheme developed in [28] to speed up the evaluation of the Caputo derivative on nonuniform time step, employ the Galerkin finite element (FE) method to discretize the spatial direction, and take the Newton linearized method to approximate the nonlinear term . While the theory of the L 2 L2 -norm error estimate is well studied, there are few works on the unconditional convergence of H 1 H1 -norm error estimate of the linearized Galerkin FE scheme for nonlinear subdiffusion equations. The main reason is that it requires to find a suitable test function in the FE space. To this end, we here respectively take the time-discrete operator and Laplace operator as the suitable test function in the FE space, and combine an improved discrete fractional Grönwall inequality to achieve the unconditional error estimate in H 1 H1 -norm. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

We focus in particular on the numerical analysis of such a system. We propose and derive convergence estimates for a piecewise linear finite element method (FEM) with quadrature. We prove that the FEM is second order convergent for concentration in a discrete L 2 L2 -norm. Since concentration depends on the gradient of acoustic pressure, this result shows that the FEM is superconvergent. Note that one expects the FEM to be convergent of order one in the L 2 L2 -norm because the optimal convergence rate for the acoustic pressure is two in the H 1 H1 -norm. We include numerical results backing the theoretical findings and an application of the model to a laboratory experiment of ultrasound enhanced transdermal drug delivery.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropic diffusion model has been established as one of the most significant image processing techniques, because it not only allows for space-variant filtering, but also realizes real direction-specific anisotropic smoothing of image structures. In this paper, an anisotropic nonlinear diffusion system is proposed for image enhancement and segmentation by taking into account the structure tensor constructed from the time-delay regularization and a nonlinear isotropic diffusion equation. Meanwhile, the diffusion system makes full use of the source term which increases the contrast and makes the image be less susceptible to noise, even in high level noise images. The source term also causes the restored image to tend to the binary image, which has proven to be an effective strategy for image segmentation. We analyze the proposed model in the view of the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution by using Galerkin&#39;s method. Some other theoretical analysis such as the maximum property is also discussed in the paper. With the appropriate and adaptive parameters, the anisotropic diffusion system achieves a better trade-off between computation time and image processing task. Furthermore, various image experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves much better efficiency and universality.},

  abstract     = {Variational based solvation models of biomolecules with smooth interface have drawn attentions in the past decade since they have been developed as an efficient and reliable representation of solute-solvent interfaces in the framework of implicit solvent models. This work aims at providing solid mathematical supports for a promising geometric flow based computational solvation model with smooth interface (GFBSS) and its involved computational treatments. For this purpose, we improve the GFBSS model by explicitly including two physical constraints: (1) a novel experimental based domain decomposition , and (2) a two-sided obstacle for the characteristic function describing the optimal diffuse solute-solvent boundary. It is shown that the resulting constrained model is mathematically well-posed. Further, to overcome the challenges arising from including these constraints, we propose a family of generalized constrained energy functionals whose variations satisfy a q -Laplacian type equation for nonpolar molecules. The solvation free energies predicted by the generalized models converge to that of the proposed constrained one. Most importantly, the numerical difference between the generalized models and the previous unconstrained GFBSS model is negligible. It implies that the newly proposed constrained solvation model and the previous unconstrained one are equivalent to each other in terms of the solvation free energy calculation and prediction. Our model validation, its numerical implementation, and solvation energy convergence have been demonstrated using several common biomolecular modeling tasks.},

  abstract     = {We present an approach to simulation of low speed, two-phase interfacial flows. It utilises the diffuse-interface method, based on the so-called conservative Allen–Cahn equation with some further modifications. The flow description allows for weak density variations (weak compressibility) as a computationally efficient treatment of incompressible flow regime. The proposed model conserves mass and momentum. The pressure field evolves according to the energy conservation law for inviscid fluids , expressed in primitive variables . The assumption of weak compressibility leads to some modelling and numerical issues related to the need of unique interface region identification required by the one-fluid formulation. We propose a successful and efficient remedy to this problem which, importantly, is independent of the Mach number . To numerically solve the governing equations we use the classical finite volume method and explicit time integration. This makes the presented strategy easy to implement in existing numerical codes and allows for efficient execution of the simulations using parallel computing devices. The spatial discretisation needs some special care to preserve the simplicity without impairing the fundamental physical consistency. We propose the values of tunable model parameters resulting in an universal approach, suitable for a wide variety of interfacial flows. The approach is validated both qualitatively and quantitatively for a selection of well known benchmark cases in two- and three-dimensional set-ups. High computational efficiency is obtained with simple programming techniques when the code is executed on multicore CPU.},

  abstract     = {The relaxed physical factorization (RPF) preconditioner is a recent algorithm allowing for the efficient and robust solution to the block linear systems arising from the three-field displacement-velocity-pressure formulation of coupled poromechanics. For its application, however, it is necessary to invert blocks with the algebraic form C ˆ = ( C + β F F T ) Cˆ=(C+βFFT) , where C is a symmetric positive definite matrix , F F T FFT a rank-deficient term, and β a real non-negative coefficient. The inversion of C ˆ Cˆ , performed in an inexact way, can become unstable for large values of β , as it usually occurs at some stages of a full poromechanical simulation. In this work, we propose a family of algebraic techniques to stabilize the inexact solve with C ˆ Cˆ . This strategy can prove useful in other problems as well where such an issue might arise, such as augmented Lagrangian preconditioning techniques for Navier-Stokes or incompressible elasticity. First, we introduce an iterative scheme obtained by a natural splitting of matrix C ˆ Cˆ . Second, we develop a technique based on the use of a proper projection operator annihilating the near-kernel modes of C ˆ Cˆ . Both approaches give rise to a novel class of preconditioners denoted as Enhanced RPF (ERPF). Effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated in both theoretical benchmarks and real-world large-size applications, outperforming the native RPF preconditioner.},

  abstract     = {Certain Petrov-Galerkin schemes deliver inherently stable formulations of variational problems on a given mesh by selecting appropriate pairs of trial and test spaces. These schemes are especially suited for adaptation, due to their inherent ability to yield robust a posteriori error estimates. On the other hand, metric-based continuous mesh models have previously been proposed for schemes using piecewise polynomial approximation spaces. These models aim to build (near) optimal anisotropic meshes with respect to interpolation error models. The main focus of this article is to formulate continuous-mesh error models for the optimal Petrov-Galerkin methodology using the inbuilt a posteriori error estimate rather than a generic interpolation error model. This pairs the ability to produce near optimal anisotropic simplex meshes with a numerical method that in turn produces optimal stability and approximation properties on these meshes. Error models are formulated either with respect to a suitable norm of the numerical error, or with respect to certain admissible target functionals, in the spirit of goal-oriented adaptation. We demonstrate the fidelity of the proposed metric-based mesh adaptation strategy via numerical examples for convection-diffusion problems on triangular meshes.},

  abstract     = {This article reports our explorations for solving second-order hyperbolic interface problems by immersed weak Galerkin (IWG) method on interface independent meshes. The method presented here uses IWG functions for the discretization in spatial variable. The study includes the Newmark algorithm which has been used extensively in applications. The stability analysis based on the energy method is presented for semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes under some conditions on parameters of the Newmark algorithm. In this work, we carried out a convergence analysis and obtained optimal a priori error estimates in both energy and L 2 L2 norms for the semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes under piecewise H 2 H2 regularity assumption in space and some conditions on parameters of the Newmark algorithm. We demonstrate that the maximal error in the L 2 L2 -norm error over a finite time interval converges optimally as O ( h 2 + τ r ( γ ) ) O(h2+τr(γ)) , where r ( γ ) = 1 r(γ)=1 if γ ≠ 1 / 2 γ≠1/2 , r ( 1 / 2 ) = 2 r(1/2)=2 , h and τ are the mesh size and the time step, respectively. Numerical examples are provided to confirm theoretical findings and illustrate the efficiency of the method for standing and traveling waves.},

  abstract     = {The boundary element method is an efficient algorithm for simulating acoustic propagation through homogeneous objects embedded in free space. The conditioning of the system matrix strongly depends on physical parameters such as density, wavespeed and frequency. In particular, high contrast in density and wavespeed across a material interface leads to an ill-conditioned discretisation matrix. Therefore, the convergence of Krylov methods to solve the linear system is slow. Here, specialised boundary integral formulations are designed for the case of acoustic scattering at high-contrast media. The eigenvalues of the resulting system matrix accumulate at two points in the complex plane that depend on the density ratio and stay away from zero. The spectral analysis of the Calderón preconditioned PMCHWT formulation yields a single accumulation point. Benchmark simulations demonstrate the computational efficiency of the high-contrast Neumann formulation for scattering at high-contrast media.},

  abstract     = {An efficient adaptive phase-field method based on bilinear elements for tensile-compressive-shear fracture is developed. On the one hand, refined meshes are needed near the crack path to obtain accurate results, and the computational efficiency is very low if a prior mesh refinement is applied, especially when the crack paths are unknown. On the other hand, conventional phase-field models are not applicable to tensile-compressive-shear fracture under complex stress states at present. In this paper, an adaptive scheme is proposed to improve the computational efficiency, in which a bilinear multi-node element is adopted to avoid using high order quadrature and shape functions when new nodes are inserted in elements, and a new multi-node triangular element is outlined to expand the scope of application of the proposed adaptive method. Another important aspect of the contribution is the development of the phase-field model for tensile-compressive-shear fracture under complex stress states, in which a universal fracture criterion is embedded. To determine the optimal parameters in the adaptive scheme and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed bilinear adaptive method, a series of numerical examples are performed for sensitivity analysis. Comparison with experimental results is also conducted to validate the proposed phase-field model for tensile-compressive-shear fracture under complex stress states.},

By means of the Gauss–Lobatto collocation points , the CCS is employed to obtain the particular solution. With the obtained particular solution, the inhomogeneous elliptic boundary value problem can be transformed into a classical homogeneous problem which can be solved by the LSBM. In the LSBM, the whole computational domain with distributed nodes is divided into a series of overlapping circle-shaped sub-domains. For each sub-domain, the moving least square method and the conventional singular boundary method (SBM) are utilized. Considering that the matrix generated by the CCS-LSBM is sparse, this scheme is granted the tremendous potential to address large-scale problems. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed scheme for problems with mixed boundary conditions , sophisticated analytical solutions, and complex computational domains, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Method of asymptotic partial decomposition of a domain (MAPDD) proposed and justified earlier for thin domains (rod structures, tube structures consisting of a set of thin cylinders) generates some specific interface conditions between three-dimensional and one-dimensional parts. In the case of the heat equation these conditions ensure the continuity of the solution and continuity in average of the normal flux. However for some computational reasons the strong continuity condition for the solution may be undesirable. It may be preferable to replace it by more flexible condition of continuity in average over the interface cross section . In the present paper we introduce and justify this alternative junction condition allowing such discontinuity of the solution of both stationary and non-stationary problems. The closeness of solutions of these hybrid dimension problems to the solution of the fully three-dimensional setting is proved. At the discrete level, finite volume schemes are considered, an error estimate is established. The new version of the MAPDD is compared to the classical one via numerical tests. It shows better stability of the new scheme.},

Following method-of-lines approach, the solution to the PIDCP can be computed quite accurately by a robust numerical technique that combines Ikonen–Toivanen splitting with an alternating direction implicit scheme. However, we observed that computing the numerical solution with this technique becomes extremely time consuming, mainly due to the handling of the integral term. In this paper we parallelize this technique by applying a parallel fast Fourier transformation algorithm to all matrix-vector multiplications involving the huge and dense integral approximation matrix by exploiting its block Toeplitz with Toeplitz block structure. We also parallelize other computationally intensive steps of this technique by applying a recently developed parallel cyclic reduction algorithm for pentadiagonal systems. Our solutions computed on a graphics processing unit (GPU) using CUDA® platform are compared for accuracy with those available in the literature. It is observed that by solving the PIDCP parallelly we could bring down the computational times from several hours to a few seconds in certain cases in our experiments.},
