  abstract     = {In fuzzy neighborhood rough sets (FNRSs), uncertainty measurement performs mainly classification-hierarchical and multiplication-simple fusion, so the corresponding feature selection has advancement space. This paper aims to improve uncertainty measurement and feature selection via FNRSs. Two measurement strategies regarding class-hierarchical fusion and multiplication-optimal fusion are proposed, and three measure-based heuristic feature selection algorithms are developed. Concretely, fuzzy neighborhood self-information (FNSI) and joint entropy (FNJE) constitute two bases of heterogeneous fusion, and their multiplication fusion induces both the existing measure FNSIJE (which is based on classification-level fusion) and a new measure CFNSIJE (which is based on class-level fusion); furthermore, FNSIJE and CFNSIJE are extended to the optimal measures FNSIJEE and CFNSIJEE, respectively, by exponential parameterization. The four types of fusion measures acquire their calculation algorithms and granulation nonmonotonicity and systematically motivate four heuristic feature selection algorithms, i.e., the current FNSIJE-FS and the new CFNSIJE-FS, FNSIJEE-FS, and CFNSIJEE-FS. By using examples and experiments, relevant uncertainty measurement and granulation nonmonotonicity are validated, while the novel selection algorithms demonstrate better classification performances. This study establishes the hierarchical fusion and exponential expansion to acquire robust uncertainty measurement and optimal feature selection, and the measurement, nonmonotonicity, and selection have strong generalization for information fusion and rough-set learning.},

We call the proposed approach the deep state-space model. The experiments are carried out on established cryptocurrencies (obtained from Yahoo Finance). The goal of the work has been to predict the price for the next day. Benchmarking has been done with both state-of-the-art and classical dynamical modeling techniques.

  abstract     = {Least squares regression (LSR) and its extended methods are widely used for image classification . However, these LSR-based methods do not consider the importance of global information and ignore the connection between feature learning and regression representations. To address these problems, we propose a novel method called orthogonal autoencoder regression (OAR) that considers global information by combining the feature learning part with the regression representation part. In addition, to enhance the model’s feature learning ability, we introduce an orthogonal autoencoder model to learn more effective data. To promote the model’s regression representation ability, we also add weight constraints to the model and make the OAR more discriminative. An iterative algorithm with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve the model. The experimental results from several databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the OAR.},

  abstract     = {The explanatory capacity of interpretable fuzzy rule-based classifiers is usually limited to offering explanations for the predicted class only. A lack of potentially useful explanations for non-predicted alternatives can be overcome by designing methods for the so-called counterfactual reasoning . Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods for counterfactual explanation generation require special attention to human evaluation aspects, as the final decision upon the classification under consideration is left for the end user. In this paper, we first introduce novel methods for qualitative and quantitative counterfactual explanation generation. Then, we carry out a comparative analysis of qualitative explanation generation methods operating on (combinations of) linguistic terms as well as a quantitative method suggesting precise changes in feature values. Then, we propose a new metric for assessing the perceived complexity of the generated explanations. Further, we design and carry out two human evaluation experiments to assess the explanatory power of the aforementioned methods. As a major result, we show that the estimated explanation complexity correlates well with the informativeness, relevance, and readability of explanations perceived by the targeted study participants. This fact opens the door to using the new automatic complexity metric for guiding multi-objective evolutionary explainable fuzzy modeling in the near future.},

However, there have been only a few studies conducted on q-ROFPRs. Therefore, in the context of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM), a decision framework for MADM with q-ROFPRs is proposed. First, a novel score function is proposed to compare two different q‐rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q‐ROFNs). Subsequently, an algorithm is developed to check and improve the multiplicative consistency of q-ROFPRs. Moreover, to consider the rationality of the threshold determination, an objective method for determining the threshold of q-ROFPRs is developed considering the number of alternatives and rung q. Finally, a new method for determining the weights of attributes is discussed. In addition, an illustrative example involving the brand evaluation of new energy vehicles is used to verify the applicability of the above methods. The rationality and superiority of the proposed methods are highlighted by a comparative analysis with existing studies.},

In order to solve this problem, a new BN model for risk assessment based on cloud model (CM), interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) and the improved Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory was developed in the following route. Firstly, CM and IT2FSs were used to define a new solution for the digital characteristics, and the standard and index cloud membership functions for the IT2FSs-CM were established. Then, the index cloud membership function for the IT2FSs-CM was defined as the basic probability assignment (BPA) function, a new evidence fusion rule algorithm was defined, and the improved D-S evidence theory was proposed. Furthermore, the improved D-S evidence theory was used to transform the BPA function into the IT2FSs based prior probability, and a new BN model for risk assessment was developed. Finally, the BN model was applied to a nuclear power plant (NPP) construction project, its risk was assessed at level I (very low risk), and the results by IT2FSs-CM and Bayesian reasoning were compared with those by common methods. The findings show that the new BN model is effective and applicable in risk assessment.},

  abstract     = {Recent financial studies have shown that spillover effects of some market factors play a significant role in stock fluctuations. Previous studies, however, were incapable of capturing the spillovers of these relational market factors because they relied on a homogeneous graph that condenses these factors into firm node attributes and requires their spillover effects to follow firm relationship instead of themselves. This fact brings up a heterogeneous graph learning problem that requires multiple node types to transport different spillover effects. This study proposes a novel conditional heterogeneous graph neural network (FinHGNN) to capture multiple spillover effects in asset pricing with two uniquely designed mechanisms. First, it presents an efficient way to preserve the connectivity of relational attributes in graph learning, which is achieved by converting relational attributes into node variables to form a heterogeneous graph. Second, a conditional message-passing mechanism is proposed to handle multiple spillover effects simultaneously by messaging conditioned on different types of nodes and node attributes. This study paves the way for addressing the relational attributes in graph learning. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over three classic and four state-of-the-art algorithms, including LSTM , GCN, HGNN, eLSTM, TGC , FinGAT, and AD-GAT.},

What proposed here, k-means-g*, is based on a simple geometric concept. For four distinct points, if distance between all pairs except one pair are known, then, a lower bound can be determined for the unknown distance. Utilizing this technique in the assignment step of the k -means, many high-dimensional distance computations can be easily ignored, where small amount of memory is used. Both theoretical and experimental results approves speed of the k-means-g* against recently published fast variants. For over than 50 cases, out of 70 cases of performed experiments, it is faster than other algorithms. The C++ source code for k-means-g* is publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Frequent pattern mining (FM) has a wide range of applications in the real world. But FM sometimes discovers many uninteresting patterns at the same time. Constraint-based FM, especially periodic constraint FM, becomes of interest, and it reduces redundant patterns. Most of the state-of-the-art algorithms for mining periodic frequent patterns (PFPs) are designed to find PFPs only in binary temporal databases . However, vast information in real situations is more suitable to be modelized as quantitative databases, in which most existing methods are inapplicable. Patterns obtained by those methods may change due to a tiny perturbation in the database, which is not expected in many situations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm (FP2M) to mine fuzzy-driven periodic frequent patterns and an algorithm (SFP2M) to find stable fuzzy-driven periodic frequent patterns in quantitative temporal databases . Fuzzy sets are used in our algorithms to deal with quantitative data since they provide a relaxed interval segmentation and are easy to implement. Novel pruning strategies and a new structure called Estimated Period Co-occurrence Structure (EPCS) are designed to speed up the mining process and improve efficiency. An improved method (SFP2M) is also presented by using the lability measurement to find stable patterns. Experimental evaluations on both real and synthetic datasets show good performance of the designed algorithms.},

Distinguished from other existing CS-based cryptosystems, SSL-PUF with quantum tunneling induced chaos is utilized, in which the key distribution for the public channel can be achieved by a pair of matched SSL-PUF. First, the seed key generated from SSL-PUF is extended with the pseudo-random coupled map lattices (PRCML) module. Next, gradient-type alternating minimization approach is employed to solve the low coherence measurement matrix. Finally, compressing and encrypting can be implemented simultaneously by measuring the plain image bi-directionally. Moreover, the total variation (TV) regularization reconstruction method is optimized based on the Adam algorithm. With low compression ratios and computationally constrained environments, the proposed optimization method can reconstruct images with high quality. Numerous experiments were simulated and analyzed to validate that the proposed 2DCS-based cryptosystems possess well performance, such as image reconstruction effect, security against various attacks, and good robustness.},

To simultaneously guarantee the significant properties including the asymptotic consensus, and strong Zeno-freeness (strictly positive inter-event times), a novel distributed dynamic event-triggered protocol is proposed. Unlike the most-existing emulation-based approaches in which the control gain is previously decided, a systematic co-design procedure is proposed to design the controller gain , the observer gain, and the event-triggering mechanisms altogether in terms of solving a linear matrix inequality optimization problem . Based on the resulting hybrid system framework, a hybrid model is established for the distributed closed-loop system and the asymptotic consensus is achieved.

New sufficient conditions to achieve impulsive secure consensus are analyzed. To determine the stability of the resulting error system, we utilized fractional-calculus theory, algebraic graph theory, Lyapunov functional . The influence of the impulsive control scheme depends on the order of the Caputo fractional-order systems addressed. It is shown that the agents can achieve an exponential consensus under the proposed impulsive control scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated by numerical examples and simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Streaming feature selection for unlabeled data aims to remove redundant and irrelevant features from the continuously arriving features without label information. Most existing methods usually focus on selecting a small set of features that approximately reconstruct each sample in the raw data. However, the real-world streaming data may contain irrelevant features which the current reconstruction strategy cannot effectively exclude. These irrelevant features significantly impair the reliability of the selected feature subset. To address this problem, we introduce a dynamic similarity graph to learn the pairwise sample correlations for adaptively evaluating irrelevant features. By virtue of similarity graph diffusion, the unreliable similarities caused by irrelevant features can be gradually eliminated. The past and current diffused graphs are then used to guide feature selection, thus successfully removing redundant and irrelevant features, respectively. The proposed method consists of two stages: 1) minimum redundancy : accepting only features containing new information based on the past diffused graph; 2) maximum relevance: selecting the most relevant features based on the current diffused graph. Additionally, a compound threshold operator is derived to solve the graph-based learning objective. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensors has promoted the development of body area networks (BAN) in the area of intelligent monitoring. However, current health assessment methods based on BAN still have problems such as a high false alarm rate and low efficiency in identifying signs and states, which not only increase the psychological burden of the ward but also bring unnecessary troubles to the medical staff. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a multi-sign parameter fusion health assessment model based on BP neural network (BPNN). Firstly, the blood pressure, heart rate, pulmonary hypertension, respiration rate, blood oxygen, and body temperature are obtained by sensors in real-time, and then these six parameters are fused by the BPNN . In addition, aiming at the problems of slow convergence speed and easy falling into a local minimum in BPNN, the structure of this model is optimized, and the influence of the number of neurons and activation function of the hidden layer on the performance of the model is explored. Results show that when the number of neurons in the hidden layer is 13 and the activation function is Logsit, the performance of the model is optimal. Among them, the recognition accuracy of the model is 95\%, and the running time is 2.798 s. Finally, comparing the recognition results of this model with support vector machines (SVM), genetic BP neural networks (GA-BPNN), and fuzzy neural networks (FNN), it is found that the accuracy of these three methods is 70\%, 70\% and 80\% respectively, which verifies the validity of the model proposed in this paper.},

The length of the longest common subsequence is often used to measure the similarity between sequences. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for the MLCS problem often transform the problem into finding the longest path in a directed acyclic graph (DAG); however, their fatal flaw is that the time cost or constructed DAG is too large. Aiming at solving the problem of the existing algorithms, this paper proposes a time-efficient upper bound estimation method that can estimate the upper bound for the length of any path through a node in much less time, and then proposes an adaptive lower bound estimation strategy that can estimate the more precise lower bound for the length of the longest common subsequences. This study also describes a distributed storage scheme that stores most parts of the DAG in external devices and only a few parts in memory. A comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms in the experiments indicates that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and effective.},

Many existing methods focus only on local or global information of nodes but neglect the interaction between nodes. Gravity centrality is a recently raised centrality method that combines a node’s local and global information to properly describe the interaction between nodes. However, node degree is the local information metric in gravity centrality, which omits the connection situation of its neighboring nodes. To overcome the drawbacks of node degree parameters used in gravity centrality, we introduced Laplacian centrality to optimize the initial gravity centrality and put up Laplacian gravity centrality. Regarding real networks from different fields, our method has the highest Kendall’s correlation coefficient to the result of node infection ability simulated by the susceptible-infected-recovered model than other methods in 7 out of 10 real networks. Furthermore, the proposed method&#39;s time complexity can be as low as linear time complexity in sparse networks. Results show that Laplacian gravity centrality is an effective method to identify influential nodes, especially in networks with smaller average node degrees and longer average path lengths.},

Bank default is one of the most studied topics in financial literature because of the severity of its consequences on the whole economic system. However, little attention has been paid to the identification of the major determinants of bank failures via machine-learning approaches. This paper employs several machine-learning algorithms, including a graph neural network that has never been used in a financial context. Another novelty is the implementation of a balanced dataset by customising the heuristic oversampling method based on k-means and synthetic minority over-sampling technique. This paper also deals with the inclusion of competition among the possible default determinants. The dataset consists of all the banks in the Euro Area in the period 2018–2020.

  abstract     = {The bus network, including several bus lines (BLs), is the most important public transportation system in many cities. A bus line (BL) may be inefficient compared to the other BLs. Therefore, solutions are needed to make it efficient. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a mathematical programming model that can measure the performance of BLs and provide solutions to improve the performance of inefficient BLs. However, DEA can consider only a few attributes when evaluating BLs, while this evaluation requires big data to be considered. Moreover, DEA solutions may negatively affect exogenous variables , in particular social and environmental variables. Although these variables are not directly related to measuring BLs’ efficiency, they may affect the implementation of DEA solutions. For example, reducing the number of buses on an inefficient line can increase its efficiency. However, it may indirectly increase the use of personal vehicles, resulting in more pollution and traffic. If the magnitude of this pollution or traffic is too high, decision-makers (DMs) may ignore improving the efficiency of that BL. Thus, the magnitude of possible negative consequences of DEA solutions, especially on critical social and environmental variables, should be estimated before their implementation. This study uses AIMSUN simulation software to pre-evaluate the negative effects of DEA solutions on critical exogenous social and environmental variables. We use a real example to illustrate that DEA solutions sometimes may not be implemented due to their harmful negative consequences.},

  abstract     = {Salient object detection is a fundamental problem in image processing and computer vision. Many saliency detection algorithms based on the background and frequency-domain are used to extract salient object clues. However, the former causes the real object to be submerged in the detected object areas, especially in complex or small object scenes. While the latter will lead to the loss of some object information when detecting large objects. To solve these problems and achieve better object detection results, we propose a fusion framework for salient object detection by fusing background and frequency-domain features. The background features of the image are extracted by an improved background model. This model represents the spatial layout of the image area with respect to the image boundaries. Meanwhile, we present a new frequency-domain processing method to obtain multiscale frequency-domain features and mark the saliency of the object at different scales. Within our framework, inspired by human visual attention, we use the idea of a self-attention mechanism to capture the intrinsic relation between background and multiscale frequency-domain features. In addition, this fusion framework provides a three-dimensional Gaussian convolution kernel, which expands two-dimensional local information to three dimensions for feature fusion, thus producing more accurate salient objects. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods on five challenging and complicated datasets in terms of four evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Recently GNN-based graph machine learning methods have been widely used in fraud detection. Prior works have revealed the problems of camouflaged fraudsters on graphs, which dilute the suspicion of aggregated features of fraudsters . The fraudsters’ camouflage lies in two main aspects: 1) fraudsters adjust their attributes to camouflage original hand-craft features against detection. 2) fraudsters connect to benign entities, making the labels of their contexts inconsistent. However, previous neighbor sampling methods based on similarity measures are inadequate in calculating neighbor similarity, resulting in a loss of GNN-based detector performance. In this paper, we enhance the node similarity measure-based neighbor sampling method and the multi-relational aggregator . First, we use supervised contrastive learning to aggregate discriminative node embeddings . After that, the consistent neighbors are sampled according to the contrastive embedding similarity as well as the node feature similarity. Finally, we improve the multi-relational aggregator via contrastive embeddings. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model CACO-GNN achieves the highest scores in F1-macro, AUC, and Recall, with an 18.5\% improvement in F1-macro performance, enabling more effective detection of camouflaged fraudsters.},

It focuses on explaining ML models and their predictions, enabling people to understand the rationale behind them. Counterfactuals and semifactuals are two instances of Explainable ML techniques that explain model predictions using other observations. These techniques are based on the comparison between the observation to be explained and another one. In counterfactuals, their prediction is different, and in semifactuals, it is the same. Both techniques have been studied in the Social Sciences and Explainable ML communities, and they have different use cases and properties. In this paper, the Explanation Set framework, an approach that unifies counterfactuals and semifactuals, is introduced. Explanation Sets are example-based explanations defined in a neighborhood where most observations satisfy a grouping measure. The neighborhood allows defining and combining restrictions. The grouping measure determines if the explanations are counterfactuals (dissimilarity) or semifactuals (similarity). Besides providing a unified framework, the major strength of the proposal is to extend these explanations to other tasks such as regression by using an appropriate grouping measure. The proposal is validated in a regression and classification task using several neighborhoods and grouping measures.},

However, this task is challenging due to the unclear correlation underneath the testing data and the class imbalanced issue between anomalous and normal data. Moreover, it is noted that the misclassification of anomalous and normal data is usually associated with different costs in real applications. To solve these issues, we propose a search-based cost-sensitive hypergraph learning method (SCSHL) for anomaly detection. More specifically, to deal with the imbalanced issue, we first construct a target-specific subset of training data according to the testing samples and conduct a cost-sensitive feature selection method to select the effective features. To explore the unclear high-order correlation underneath the data, we employ the hypergraph structure to formulate the complex relationship among the testing data and further combine the cost information into hypergraph learning and conduct label propagation on the cost-sensitive hypergraph structure.

  abstract     = {This paper studies model predictive security control (MPSC) for networked switched systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Most of existing works only adjust the triggering scheme when being attacked. Different from them, this paper proposes a novel timing-response event-triggering scheme (TR-ETS) to reduce the impact of attacks on system performance, which can not only configure system resources adaptively, but also accurately detect attack information and compensate the attacked data. Specifically, the proposed scheme includes two event-based triggers, which can dynamically and jointly regulate the communication/calculation ability, generate virtual attack sequences and acquire the number of passive packet loss . Then, based on the triggered states, a class of model predictive controllers is designed to optimize the control action. Due to possible strong attacks, a security control framework including network and local loops be introduced and a permissable type-switching mechanism (PTM) is used. Under the permissable controllers (i.e., network and local controllers), sufficient conditions for the stability of closed-loop switched systems are derived. In addition, a set of model predictive optimization algorithm using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique is addressed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Supervised feature selection (FS) for classification aims at finding a more discriminative subset from original features, to facilitate classifier training, improve classification performance and enhance model interpretability. Primary normalized cross-covariance operator (NOCCO) is a nonlinear kernel-based dependency measure between features and labels, including two inverse matrices, and its approximated version (ANOCCO) is simplified via exploiting linear kernel for features, delta kernel for labels and Moore–Penrose inverse. In this paper, we apply NOCCO and ANOCCO to FS task. According to sequential forward selection, a forward NOCCO-based FS algorithm (i.e., FoNOCCO) is directly implemented via various accelerating strategies, but its computational complexity is extremely high. To this end, we propose its fast version via maximizing ANOCCO (i.e., FoANOCCO), where each candidate feature is evaluated efficiently according to column recursive algorithm for Moore–Penrose inverse. Theoretical analysis shows that evaluating a candidate feature needs a time complexity of O ( N 2 ) O(N2) in FoANOCCO and O ( N 3 ) O(N3) in FoNOCCO, where N N is the number of instances. On eight small-size high-dimensional benchmark data sets, our detailed experiments illustrate that our two forward FS algorithms are superior to six state-of-the-art FS methods with four baseline classifiers, and FoANOCCO runs 70 times faster than FoNOCCO with a 1.79\% accuracy drop.},

  abstract     = {People are increasingly storing their images on the cloud as cloud storage grows in popularity, delivering a variety of benefits. However, the associated privacy concern may pose a serious challenge to data users. While traditional confusion-diffusion-based encryption is an effective way to resolve this concern by yielding a noise-like image without visual meaning, it sacrifices visual usability, i.e., it fails to make privacy and usability compatible. Thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE) is proposed to balance privacy and usability, which requires that the thumbnail of the encrypted image is identical or approximate to that of the original. Although approximate-TPE has higher efficiency than ideal-TPE, the existing approximate-TPE methods cannot decrypt without loss. Motivated by this, we design a novel approximate-TPE method that is noise-free for the first time, which employs reversible data hiding based on the most significant bit prediction. Experimental results show that the method can effectively eliminate noise and finally perform decryption without sacrificing the quality of the decrypted image. Furthermore, image owners can recognize their images through the preserved coarse perceptual characteristics in the encrypted image, though it is difficult for an unauthorized third party to successfully discern with limited prior knowledge.},

  abstract     = {The survivor selection operation is one of the factors affecting the performance of differential evolution (DE) algorithms. However, in single-objective DE algorithms, researchers seldom address the improvement of survivor selection operations. Most DE algorithms use greedy selection operations. In this research, we propose an evolutionary-state-based selection (ESS) strategy for single-objective DE, which constructs a probability model based on evolutionary states to solve real-parameter optimization problems. In the survivor selection process, it is no longer true that only the winner can survive to the next generation; the loser also has a certain probability of surviving to the next generation, and this probability is related to the evolutionary states. Based on ESS, a new DE variant called evolutionary-state-based differential evolution (ESDE) is proposed. To verify the ESDE and ESS performance, ESDE was compared with eight state-of-the-art DE variants, and ablation experiments were performed on ESDE to analyze the impact of ESS on the ESDE performance. The experimental results show that ESDE is significantly better than the other eight DE variants, and ESS could significantly improve the DE performance.},

In addition, the theoretical analysis and numerical examples have been shown to verify these newly proposed uncertainty principles, e.g., under the case of special parameters of Tsallis entropy, the uncertainty bound reaches its peak value for the sparsest representation of matrix (i.e., only one eigenvalue is not zero).

Therefore, we propose a new graph convolutional network with attention modules. This research reveals a new attention network that encompasses the encoder-decoder and the triplet attention module. The proposed attention module employs the self-attention process to achieve potent and discriminatory features by utilizing temporal, spatial, and channel context information. The triplet attention module is utilized to capture cross-dimension dependencies and pedestrian features, and also reduces the impact of the imperfect pedestrian image to remedy the occlusion issue. The encoder-decoder is used to observe the whole-body shape.

  abstract     = {The generalized three-way decision (G3WD) theory is featured by a trisecting-acting-outcome paradigm. Experiments in psychology and economics have indicated that risky decision-making problems should take into account the psychological characteristic of agents. Moreover, the loss of information acts as a serious challenge in G3WD. Thus, exploring valid G3WD approaches that consider the mental state of decision-makers in incomplete information systems (IISs) is imperative. This paper explores a new three-way decision (3WD) approach that combines the prospect theory with the regret theory for IISs with the support of fuzzy set pair dominance degrees. First, the notion of fuzzy set pair dominance degrees to process evaluation information in IISs is put forward. Then, an approach that obtains objective reference points and determines the weighting function in the prospect theory is given by combining 3WD with the behavioral decision theory. In light of the prospect theory, a prospect value function is obtained, which is introduced into the regret theory to obtain two utility perception functions. As a consequence, a G3WD approach based on fuzzy set pair dominance degrees and the behavioral decision theory is constructed for IISs. By using two medical cases in the KEEL and UCI datasets, the superiority, effectiveness and stability of the constructed approach are verified via corresponding comparative and experimental analyses.},

We found that the accuracy improved by at least 6\%. Second, with the diversity and complexity of the hotspot feature space and the ability of representation learning to mine hidden features of the hotspot, we designed a new method, called HP2vec, convert the feature space to a low rank and dense vector. Finally, considering the dynamic time limit of hotspot spreading, we create time slices to discretize the life of a hotspot and propose a dynamic dissemination method based on CNN . The experimental section shows that the accuracy of this method is as high as 86\% in Weibo dataset and as high as 93\% in twitter dataset.

Three-way decision (TWD), as an effective way of dealing with multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems, aims to minimize expected losses, and the choice of delayed decisions in the presence of insufficient evaluation information can significantly reduce expected losses. In light of the combination of PLTSs with TWD, a TWD method under PLTSs is put forward in this paper, i.e., the TWD-PLTS method. First, two conversion operators are designed to ensure that both real-valued and linguistic data can be converted to PLTSs. By using the difference in terms of information entropies between linguistic term sets (LTSs) and corresponding PLTSs, attribute weights can be derived. Next, a dominance set is constructed based on the probabilistic linguistic TODIM (PL-TODIM) method, which can in turn calculate conditional probabilities . Then, a relative loss function matrix is constructed with PLTSs, and the TWD-PLTS method is presented in this way. Finally, the TWD-PLTS method is applied to address a realistic case and compare it with other decision-making methods for verifying the feasibility and validity of the presented method.},

However, adversarial attacks can significantly degrade the performance of GNNs, hindering their deployment in critical real-world tasks. GNNs must be robust against adversarial attacks , in which imperceptible adversarial perturbations are introduced to induce serious security issues. To achieve this goal, we propose a robust graph convolutional network , ERGCN, for node classification via data enhancement. ERGCN simultaneously utilizes properties from the “data domain” and “model space” as guidance. Based on the feature smoothness assumption , a graph structure enhancement (GSE) mechanism is proposed to improve the structural reliability of input graphs. Moreover, inspired by self-training methods that assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled training samples and use them to optimize the target model iteratively, a reliable node selection metric, model boundary distance (MBD), is defined based on the distance from training samples to model decision boundary. Finally, a self-training-based robust graph convolutional network is proposed for node classification . Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our study provides a solution for trustworthy graph machine learning systems in adversarial environments. The code is available at https://github.com/star4455/ERGCN .},

  abstract     = {In evolutionary multiobjective optimization , effectiveness refers to how an evolutionary algorithm performs in terms of converging its solutions into the Pareto front and also diversifying them over the front. This is not an easy job, particularly for optimization problems with more than three objectives, dubbed many-objective optimization problems . In such problems, classic Pareto-based algorithms fail to provide sufficient selection pressure towards the Pareto front , whilst recently developed algorithms, such as decomposition-based ones, may struggle to maintain a set of well-distributed solutions on certain problems (e.g., those with irregular Pareto fronts). Another issue in some many-objective optimizers is rapidly increasing computational requirement with the number of objectives, such as hypervolume-based algorithms and shift-based density estimation (SDE) methods. In this paper, we aim to address this problem and develop an effective and efficient evolutionary algorithm (E3A) that can handle various many-objective problems. In E3A, inspired by SDE, a novel population maintenance method is proposed to select high-quality solutions in the environmental selection procedure.

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact of combining multiple representations derived from heterogeneous data sources on the performance of machine learning (ML) models. In particular, we experimentally compare the approach in which independent models are trained on data representations from different sources with the one in which a single model is trained on joined data representations. As a case study, we discuss various entity representation learning methods and their applications in our data-driven advisory framework for video game players, called SENSEI. We show how to use the discussed methods to learn representations of cards and decks for two popular collectible card games (CCGs), namely Clash Royale (CR) and Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft (HS). Then, we follow our approach to create ML models which constitute the back-end for several out of SENSEI’s end-user functionalities. When learning representations, we consider techniques inspired by the NLP domain, as they allow us to create embeddings which capture various aspects of similarity between entities. We put them together with representations composed of manually engineered features and standard bags-of-cards. On top of that, we propose a new end2end deep learning architecture with an attention mechanism aimed at reflecting meaningful inter-entity interactions.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (ReID) arises in many applications, such as video surveillance and intelligent security. A challenge of cross-domain person ReID is the notorious distribution drift problem. Improving the accuracy of pseudo labels can promote the model to fit the target domain, so it is crucial to extract discriminative person features. The transformer can extract discriminative person features due to its ability to capture long distance dependencies, but its poor generalization ability may aggravate the influence of noise pseudo labels. The isolation between local information modeling and global information modeling further prevents the extraction of the discriminative person features. Therefore, this paper proposes an interactive cascade transformer framework. Firstly, a lightweight transformer structure (microformer) with better generalization is proposed. It maintains the advantages of traditional transformers on extracting discriminative features, and avoids the aggravation of the influence of noise labels. Secondly, an interactive cascade microformer framework (ICMiF) is proposed, which promotes the interaction between local information modeling and global information modeling to enhance the person feature representation. Local information facilitates mining global attribute dependencies, and global information improves the accuracy of local information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ICMiF outperforms state-of-the-art methods for the cross-domain person ReID tasks.},

  abstract     = {Deep metric learning aims to learn a discriminative feature space in which features have larger intra-class similarities and smaller inter-class similarities. Most recent studies mainly focus on designing different loss functions or sampling strategies, while ignoring a crucial limitation caused by mini-batch training. We argue that existing mini-batch-based approaches do not explore the global structure similarities among samples in feature space. As a result, instances and their k -nearest neighbors may not be semantically consistent. To this end, we propose a method, dubbed Local Neighborhood Component Analysis (LNCA), to improve deep metric learning. Specifically, LNCA leverages a feature memory bank, storing the feature vectors of all instances, to estimate the global structure similarities and determine the k nearest neighbors of samples in the feature space. Further, in order to refine the local neighborhood components of samples, LNCA introduces a metric to attract the positive neighbors and repulse the negative neighbors simultaneously. LNCA is a plug-and-play module and can be integrated into a general DML framework. Experimental results show that it can boost the generalization performance of existing DML approaches significantly.},

Compared with data noise, self-expressive noise is complex, and its exact estimate is a difficult problem. This paper proposes a Bi-domanial Deep Subspace Clustering model (BD-DSC), which is a coupled game model. BD-DSC leverages two networks to extract the clean data in the reconstructed spatial domain and clean features in the feature domain respectively. The ability of the deep network to clean data and features allows us to avoid estimating self-expressive noise and efficiently construct two self-expressive models in both domains. Furthermore, game theory is used to couple these two self-expressive models in order to achieve efficient information interaction and increase the robustness and stability of the results. By means of co-supervising each other during training, a three-stage algorithm is provided to solve the game model. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four benchmark datasets. Owing to avoiding the self-expressive noise, fusing two modules dynamically and choosing the optimal parameters carefully, our proposed approach is robust to data noise and significantly superior to the state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods with the lowest clustering errors.},

IoMT devices do not have a security authentication mechanism, and the trust between devices relies heavily on centralized third-party services. Blockchain can provide a secure interactive environment for the medical Internet of Things. However, security issues in the IoMT-Blockchain environment are also becoming increasingly prominent. Cyber-attacks targeting IoMT-Blockchain will not only compromise the security of IoT devices, but also seriously affect the security of the Internet. Therefore, how to detect abnormal traffic in the IoMT-Blockchain environment becomes particularly important. In this work, an abnormal traffic detection with deep neural network is designed for abnormal traffic detection in IoMT-Blockchain environment. First, this work proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on multi-model autoencoders. The algorithm processes the feature information in groups to reduce the complexity between traffic feature information. It builds a multi-model autoencoder to further extract fusion features between multi-model features. Second, to maximize use of traffic data information in detection network, this work proposes a multi-feature sequence anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm extracts low-level fusion features and high-level temporal features in network traffic respectively, and applies the features to anomaly detection and classification tasks by means of residual learning.},

This paper presents a new centralized DCT protocol, called ZE2-P3T (Zero Ephemeral Exchanging Privacy-Preserving Proximity Protocol), which relies on smartphone localization but does not give any information about the user’s location and identity to the server. Importantly, the fact that no exchange of ephemeral identities among users is required is the basis of the strong security of the protocol, which is proven to be more secure than the state-of-the-art protocol DP-3T/GAEN.},

However, the existing CTR prediction techniques exhibit two major limitations in estimating accurate CTRs. First, they lack interpretability as they are unable to justify and explain the outcomes of the models. Irrelevant recommendations of products and services may have severe consequences on the personal and financial safety of a user. Second, the high computational complexity of deep-learning models hinders deployment in real-time recommender systems . Thus, this study proposes an interpretable, accurate, and efficient CTR estimator based on the neural additive factorization model (NAFM). The NAFM leverages the model distillation framework, where it effectively learns from a gated ensemble of existing CTR models. The NAFM provides interpretable insights into features and their interactions with a reduced computational cost. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed NAFM was verified by applying it on two public click-through datasets, namely, Criteo and Avazu. Unlike post-hoc explainable models, the NAFM avoids an additional phase of training to generate an interpretable model, and its explanations are truthful to the model.},

Definitely, these operations lead us to define the Z+ -valued function. Afterward, the limit and continuity concepts of a Z+ -valued function are provided under the definition of a metric on the space of Z+ -numbers. Furthermore, the concepts of Z+ -differentiability, Z+ -integral, and Z+ -Laplace transform with the convergence theorem for the Z+ -valued function and its nth-order derivatives are introduced in detail. Considering all these concepts, a Z+ -differential equation ( Z+ DE) can be expressed in the form of a bimodal differential equation combining a fuzzy initial value problem (FIVP) and a random differential equation (RDE). To this end, we use a combination of “FIVP under strongly generalized Hukuhara differentiability (SGH-differentiability)” and “random differential equation under mean-square differentiability (ms-differentiability)” to define the nth-order differential equations with Z+ -number initial values. Further, the existence and uniqueness of the Z+ -differential equations are examined by presenting several theorems.

The research paper recommendation systems have been advocated to address this problem. The existing research paper recommendation systems lack in exploiting prominent information of papers, such as relevancy with the current time, novelty, scientific contribution, writing complexity of the papers, etc. Further, the existing models emphasize only on user’s preference rather than user’s intention that may change with time. Furthermore, the existing models do not consider a sound ranking strategy to unleash the personalization aspect and relevancy of papers. This work aims to address the existing limitations and proposes a systematic hidden attribute-based recommendation engine (SHARE). SHARE utilizes a feature engineering technique to unfold valuable insights of papers through multiple hidden features. These features are used as a context for users as well as multiple criteria for ranking papers. Additionally, SHARE predicts a user’s intention beyond the user’s preference to capture the dynamic notion of a user. Finally, a novel ranking strategy is proposed to retrieve personalized and the most important papers. SHARE is flexible for recommending both old and new users. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of SHARE both user studies and system evaluations were performed. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed approach and are comparable to the existing systems.},

In MARL, each agent discovers a strategy alongside others and adapts her policy in response to the behavioural changes of others. A fundamental difficulty faced by MARL is that every agent is dynamically learning and changing to improve her reward, making the whole system unstable and agents’ policies difficult to converge. In this paper, we introduce the entropy regularizer into the Bellman equation and utilize Lagrange approach to optimize the entropy regularizer. We then propose a MARL algorithm based on the maximum entropy principle and the actor-critic method. This algorithm follows the policy gradient approach and uses a policy network and a value network. We call it Multi-Agent Deep Soft Policy Gradient (MADSPG). Then by using the Lagrange approach and dynamic minimax optimization, we propose the AUTO-MADSPG algorithm with an automatically adjusted entropy regularizer. These algorithms make multi-agent learning more stable while sufficient exploration is guaranteed. Finally, we also incorporate MADSPG with the recently proposed opponent modeling component into an integrated framework. This framework outperforms many state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in conventional cooperative and competitive game settings.},

The most recent and best accurate approaches use crisp color prototypes to build fuzzy color spaces , considering standard and fixed set of colors prototypes (such as ISCC-NBS system) for this purpose. The use of these types of general purpose prototypes may not be flexible enough to collect particular colors of a given image (or a set of images); in addition, image colors may be context dependent in some cases (for example, red color in winery or medicine context). In order to solve these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to learn fuzzy color spaces by analyzing the relevant colors in a given set of representative images for a specific context and/or application; then, we will use them as prototypes in order to build adaptive fuzzy color spaces.

  abstract     = {Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a cryptographic solution to protect resources in a fine-grained manner based on a set of public attributes. This is similar to attribute-based access control schemes in the sense that both rely on public attributes and access control policies to grant access to resources. However, ABE schemes do not consider the semantics of attributes provided by users or required by access structures. Such semantics not only improve the functionality by making proper access decisions but also enable cross-domain interoperability by making users from one domain able to access and use resources of other domains. This paper proposes a Semantic ABE (SABE) framework by augmenting a classical Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE) scheme with semantic technologies using a generic procedure by which any CP-ABE scheme can be extended to an SABE. The proposed SABE framework is implemented in Java and the source code is publicly available. The experiment results confirm that the performance of the proposed framework is promising.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) aims at simultaneously exploiting the sample efficiency as well as the diversity and robustness of the two paradigms. Recently, hybrid learning frameworks based on this principle have achieved great success in robot control tasks. However, in these methods, policies from the genetic population are evaluated via interactions with the real environments, severely restricting their applicability when such interactions are prohibitively costly. In this work, we propose Surrogate-assisted Controller (SC), a generic module that can be applied on top of existing hybrid frameworks to alleviate the computational burden of expensive fitness evaluation. The key to our approach is to leverage the critic network that is implemented in existing hybrid frameworks as a novel surrogate model , making it possible to estimate the fitness of individuals without environmental interactions. In addition, two model management strategies with the elite protection mechanism are introduced in SC to control the workflow, leading to a fast and stable optimization process. In the empirical studies, we combine SC with two state-of-the-art evolutionary reinforcement learning approaches to highlight its functionality and effectiveness. Experiments on six challenging continuous control benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym platform show that SC can not only significantly reduce the cost of interaction with the environment, but also bring better sample efficiency and dramatically boost the learning progress of the original hybrid framework.},

Existing sentiment analysis methods are primarily based on complex user social relations and text data. However, they only use social relations among users and ignore the interactions of user sentiment orientation . In this paper, we designed a novel USON model to learn user sentiment orientation in social networks that fuses the interaction of users and their opinions. We define the score of the user sentiment orientation according to the sentiment polarity distribution of the opinion datasets. Then, we rebuilt a user social network, which is an attribute network with scores of user sentiment orientation as node attributes and social relations as edges. Finally, we integrated user representations with opinion representations for sentiment analysis. Experimental results on Amazon and Yelp show that the performance of our proposed model is significantly higher than that of state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms have recently become fairly popular for many-objective optimization owing to their excellent selection pressure. However, existing decomposition methods are still quite sensitive to the various shapes of the frontiers of many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). On the one hand, the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) method is incapable of acquiring uniform frontiers for MaOPs with very convex frontiers due to the radial distribution of the reference lines. On the other hand, the parallel reference lines of the normal boundary intersection (NBI) method often result in poor diversity for MaOPs with concave frontiers because of under-sampling near the boundaries. In this paper, a collaborative decomposition (CoD) method is first proposed to integrate the advantages of the PBI and NBI methods to overcome their respective disadvantages. This method inherits the NBI-style Tchebycheff function as a convergence measure to improve the convergence and uniformity of the distribution of the PBI method. Moreover, this method also adaptively tunes the extent to which an NBI reference line is rotated towards a PBI reference line for every boundary subproblem to enhance the diversity of the distribution of the NBI method. Furthermore, a CoD-based evolutionary algorithm (CoDEA) is presented for many-objective optimization. A CoD-based ranking strategy is primarily designed in the CoDEA to rank all the individuals associated with every boundary subproblem according to the CoD aggregation function and determine the best ranks. The proposed algorithm is compared with several popular many-objective evolutionary algorithms on 85 benchmark test instances. The experimental results show that the CoDEA achieves high competitiveness, benefiting from the CoD method.},

In systems design and verification, it is often important to update existing knowledge with new attributes and subtract the irrelevant content while preserving the given properties on a known set of atoms. Under the scenario, given a specification, the weakest sufficient condition (WSC) and the strongest necessary condition (SNC) are dual concepts and very informative in formal verification . In this article, we generalize our previous results (i.e., the decomposition, homogeneity properties, and the representation theorem) on forgetting in bounded CTL to the unbounded one. The cost we pay is that, unlike the bounded case, the result of forgetting in CTL may no longer exist. However, SNC and WSC can be obtained by the new forgetting machinery we are presenting. Furthermore, we complement our model-theoretic approach with a resolution-based method to compute forgetting results in CTL. This method is currently the only way to compute forgetting results for CTL and temporal logic. The method always terminates and is sound. That way, we set up the resolution-based approach for computing WSC and SNC in CTL.},

  abstract     = {As the basis of many artificial intelligence tasks, text similarity measurement has received extensive attention in current studies. However, few of them focus on the resource-limited scenes (i.e., limited computational resources and few training datasets), which are becoming increasingly popular and challenging with the development of the Internet of Things . Worse still, popular methods such as the deep-neural-network-based methods may lose their power in such scenes, since they typically require considerable computational resources. As for most current traditional methods, they also have issues of not effectively exploiting the semantic information in the sentences. As an alternative, this paper proposes a lightweight and semantically rich text similarity measurement model named the TES-TK model. In this model, a sentence is first transformed into a tree structure called TES-Tree with the integration of syntactic information , semantic knowledge , and topic distribution, aiming to comprehensively represent the multidimensional semantics of sentences. Afterward, a modified tree kernel model is designed to calculate the similarity between each pair of TES-Trees. In this way, the similarity score between the two related sentences can be retrieved. Experiments on 19 public benchmark datasets (STS2012–2015) demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits significantly better performance than the compared eight peer methods on most datasets. Especially in resource-limited scenes, our approach achieved highly competitive results compared with the latest methods, such as BERT .},

Although a number of efforts have been made to improve robustness of federated learning, existing solutions are either too costly or attack-specific. In this paper, we propose the Robust Ternary Gradients Aggregation (RTGA) algorithm, which can efficiently handle different attacks using two novel mechanisms. At the client-side, the ternary quantization mechanism compresses gradients using only two bits to store each coordinate of the gradient vector . We adopt the error-feedback mechanism to compensate for the difference between the compressed and actual gradients. At the server-side, the robust aggregation mechanism is designed to detect malicious clients according to the risk score of each client. The risk score is calculated by solving an optimization problem of the divergence among clients. Furthermore, we provide analysis of the compression and robustness properties of our proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments show that, compared with existing algorithms, RTGA can mitigate different types of attacks while costing much less communications.},

It is of great interest to study the relationship between documents from different sources and uncover the underlying causality. Zhu et al. (2021) proposed a joint dynamic topic model (JDTM). They classified all topics into three groups and used the “shared topics” with a fixed time lag order to characterize the shared information between two corpora. Although JDTM is a powerful tool for discovering the lead-lag relationship, there are two potential shortcomings. First, different shared topics should have distinct meanings, which should lead to different time lag orders between the two corpora. Second, for dynamic documents, not all topics are represented in each time slice, and thus topic sparsity should be considered. To address these two problems, we propose a sparse joint dynamic topic model (SJDTM) with a flexible lead-lag order. We assume a birth-and-death mechanism for all topics and a flexible lead-lag order for different shared topics. The performance of SJDTM is evaluated using both synthetic data and two real text corpora consisting of conference papers and journal papers.},

Most of the Byzantine-robust methods address this issue by using robust aggregation rules to aggregate the received messages, but rely on the assumption that all the regular workers have i.i.d. data, which is not the case in many federated learning applications. In light of the significance of reducing stochastic gradient noise for mitigating the effect of Byzantine attacks, we use a resampling strategy to reduce the impact of both inner variation (that describes the sample heterogeneity on every regular worker) and outer variation (that describes the sample heterogeneity among the regular workers), along with a stochastic average gradient algorithm to gradually eliminate the inner variation. The variance-reduced messages are then aggregated with a robust geometric median operator. We prove that the proposed method reaches a neighborhood of the optimal solution at a linear convergence rate and the learning error is determined by the number of Byzantine workers. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in the non-i.i.d. setting.},

To identify all the parameters, a novel NMJSs identification algorithm based on a new particle system is proposed. The hidden state inference is implemented via an extended smoother that embodies the new particle system and Rao-Blackwellized particle Gibbs ancestor sampling kernel. The smoother not only estimates hidden state but also enables parameter update of the nonlinear functions .

Then expectation–maximization and gradient descent are adopted to update the parameters. Finally, different experiments are conducted to verify the proposed algorithm.

To tackle such difficulty, this paper defines a novel tensor rank called the tensor eigen rank for the low-rank TC problem. Specifically, the novel tensor rank is obtained from a tensor transformation, which directly transforms an arbitrary-order tensor into a tensor pile. By minimizing the novel tensor rank, we subsequently establish a low-rank TC model. Within the framework of the iterative shrinkage and thresholding scheme, an algorithm named iterative tensor eigen rank minimization (IterMin) is further proposed to address the established model.

Such consideration prompted the proposal of a systematized framework of an improved version of the BM operator, denoted by the f G BM fGBM operator, where the unconventional association among data entities are portrayed through different graphical patterns. The f G BM fGBM operator has been formulated in a way that the knowledge of interactional information depicted through graphs is embedded into its processing system with the aim of capturing precise interconnections among entities. The generalized variation of the f G BM fGBM operator has also been proposed by substituting the sub-components of the f G BM fGBM operator with other precise forms of the aggregation functions to provide an illustrative alignment, which is quite expressible and interpretable, and also facilitates modeling mandatory prerequisites of the decision systems. For an applicatory aspect, the proposed operators have been utilized over the Hacker attack system and have been presented with a numerical example. A detailed comprehensive analysis has been presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed operators.},

  abstract     = {The problem of testing the equality of the generating processes of two multivariate time series is addressed in this work. To this aim, we construct four tests based on a distance measure between stochastic processes. The metric is defined in terms of the quantile cross-spectral densities of both processes. A proper estimate of this dissimilarity is the cornerstone of the proposed tests. The first test employs the asymptotic distribution of the estimate, which we derive from some standard results on complex random variables and which is useful in its own right. The bad behaviour of this test when compared with alternative ones is shown. The three remaining techniques are based on the bootstrap. Specifically, a particular bootstrap method for spectral densities and extensions of the moving blocks bootstrap and the stationary bootstrap are used for their construction. The approaches are assessed in a broad range of scenarios under the null and the alternative hypothesis. The results from the analyses show that the procedure based on the stationary bootstrap exhibits the best overall performance in terms of both size and power. The proposed techniques are used to answer the question about whether or not the dotcom bubble crash of 2000s permanently impacted the global market behavior.},

The presented MPC control schemes utilize online advanced trajectory linearization, which yields simple quadratic optimization programs. It is shown that the discussed approaches give excellent prediction accuracy and control quality, very similar to that possible in MPC with full nonlinear prediction and nonlinear optimization done online. It is also demonstrated that the described MPC algorithms are a few times faster than the MPC method with nonlinear optimization.

The vast majority of existing network embedding methods are typically represented in continuous vectors, which impose formidable challenges in storage and computation costs, especially in large-scale applications. To this end, we propose a novel Binarized Network Embedding (BINE) method to learn binary node representations while retaining the community structural information in the network. Specifically, to preserve the community structure among node representations, we absorb the modularity constraint into the matrix factorization-based framework that can approximate the first-order and second-order proximity. Meanwhile, the cyclic coordinate descent method is adopted to implement the binary node representations for improving storage and computing efficiency. Finally, the conjugate gradient algorithm is employed to jointly optimize the objective function. Extensive experimental results on a variety of real-world network datasets demonstrate that BINE exhibits lower storage and computational complexity than state-of-the-art network embedding methods while achieving competitive experimental performance.},

The former’s role is to discover solutions relevant to the committee. The latter approximates the entire Pareto front, revealing a variety of trade-offs between objectives. The method improves the potential of conducting more informative interactions with the DMs and prevents the evolution from stagnation. Furthermore, it improves the evolutionary pace by dynamically removing no longer worthwhile goals from the supportive population in favor of increasing the primary population size. We confirm the importance of using co-evolution and dynamic resource allocation in extensive experiments. Also, we prove the competitiveness of our proposals by comparing them with the state-of-the-art methods on the WFG benchmarks.

  abstract     = {The techniques based on the theory of differential privacy (DP) have become a standard building block in the machine learning community. The DP training mechanisms offer strong guarantees that an adversary cannot determine with high confidence about the training data based on analyzing the released model, let alone any details of the instances. However, DP may disproportionately affect the underrepresented and relatively complicated classes, which means that the reduction in utility (i.e., model’s accuracy) is unequal for each class. Existing work neglects the adverse impact of DP or omits the influence of hyperparameters on the private learning procedure. This paper proposes a fair differential privacy algorithm (FairDP) to mitigate the disparate impact on each class’s model accuracy. We cast the learning procedure as a bilevel programming problem, which could integrate differential privacy with fairness. FairDP establishes a self-adaptive DP mechanism and dynamically adjusts instance influence in each class depending on the theoretical bias-variance bound with privacy guarantees simultaneously. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of FairDP in mitigating the disparate impact on model accuracy among the classes on several benchmark datasets and scenarios ranging from text to vision and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and fairness.},

Thus, this study proposes a novel method for density peaks clustering based on fuzzy semantic cells. Specifically, each object is coarsened into a fuzzy point with the form of the fuzzy semantic cell model. Based on this model, a local density metric is defined and estimated via the principle of justifiable granularity . Our local density estimation can be converted into an optimization problem . In addition, a relative semantic distance is also introduced which concerns the distance between fuzzy semantic cells.

The existing sequential three-way decision models mainly constructed the hierarchical condition information granules via concept hierarchy tree to discuss the three probabilistic regions for flat classification. However, in real-world applications, one may face not only the tree-structured data with hierarchical condition attributes but also more often the multi-level data with hierarchical decision attribute (hierarchical class labels). How to obtain acceptable decisions under different levels of granularity is the most important issue within the multi-level and multi-view data. To this end, we construct a generalized hierarchical decision table and propose a generalized hierarchical multigranulation sequential three-way decision model by combining multi-granularity and sequential three-way decisions. Specifically, we first design a generalized hierarchical decision table using concept hierarchy trees of all conditional attributes and decision attribute, and explore some basic properties. Then we decompose and aggregate condition and decision granules under different levels of granularity, propose the optimistic and pessimistic generalized hierarchical multigranulation three-way decision models to update the three probabilistic regions for flat and hierarchical classification, and discuss the relationships between these two models. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are more suitable for different applications. These models will provide a novel insight and enrich the development of multigranulation three-way decisions from the perspective of multi-level and multi-view.},

Graph Neural Network, which aggregates the topological information of the neighbourhoods of each node in a graph to implement graph/network embedding, has attracted wide attention. With the explosive growth of information, large amounts of data need to be expressed in the form of hypergraphs. As a result, the hypergraph neural networks arise at the historic moment. However, most current work is based on static hypergraph structure, making it hard to effectively transmit information. To address this problem, D ynamic H ypergraph Neural Networks based on K ey H yperedges (DHKH) model is proposed in this paper. Considering that the graph structure data in the real world is not uniformly distributed both semantically and structurally, we define the key hyperedge as the subgraph composed of a small number of key nodes and related edges in a graph. The key hyperedge can capture the key high-order structure information, which is able to enhance global topology expression. With the supporting of hyperedge and key hyperedge, DHKH can aggregate the high-order information and key information. In our experiments, DHKH shows good performance on multiple datasets, especially on the SZ dataset and LOS dataset which have inherently some key structures.},

  abstract     = {Active learning (AL) aims to select valuable samples for labeling from an unlabeled sample pool to build a training dataset with minimal annotation cost. Traditional methods always require partially and initially labeled samples to start active selection and then query annotations of samples incrementally through several iterations. However, this scheme is not effective in the deep learning scenario. On the one hand, initially labeled sample sets are not always available in the beginning. On the other hand, the performance of the traditional model is usually poor in the early iterations due to limited training feedback. For the first time, we propose a cold-start AL model based on representative (CALR) sampling, which selects valuable samples without the need for an initial labeled set or the iterative feedback of the target models. Experiments on three image classification datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Caltech-256, showed that CALR achieved a new state-of-the-art performance of AL in cold-start settings. Especially in low annotation budget conditions, our method can achieve up to a 10\% performance increase compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, CALR can be combined with warm-start methods to improve the start-up efficiency while further breaking the performance ceiling of AL, which makes CALR have a broader application scenario.},

  abstract     = {Graph matching (GM) plays a vital role in solving various computer vision tasks by establishing a node-to-node correspondence between graph-structured data. In this study, we propose a novel method based on affinity matrix for solving GM tasks. Specifically, a pruning strategy is proposed to remove inconsistent edges from an association graph that formulates the GM problem into a node ranking and selection problem. Moreover, an edge context information with respect to a cross-graph reference structure is proposed and combined with the local distance information to compute the affinities among the graphs’ nodes. Then, the re-weighted random walk technique is utilized to simulate random walks on the association graph and compute a quasi-stationary distribution in an iterative manner. Finally, the Hungarian algorithm is used to discretize the distribution and obtain an approximate matching between two graphs. The experimental results indicate that our proposed GM method is able to produce promising results in the presence of outliers and deformation noise as compared with other methods.},

  abstract     = {Clustering algorithms create groups of objects based on their similarity. As objects are usually defined by data points, this similarity is commonly measured by a distance function. When the objects are defined by variables that are intervals, it is more difficult to determine how to measure the similarity between the objects of the dataset. In this work, we propose some similarity measures between intervals based on average embedding functions. Using these, new similarity measures between interval-based objects are proposed. All the proposed similarities are based on measuring the similarity between the objects variable by variable and then averaging the obtained results to get a single value. By its definition, the objects can be considered as interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFS), so the similarities introduced are proved to be valid similarities for IVFS. The measures proposed are used in a hierarchical clustering algorithm with the aim of grouping the objects of the dataset into different clusters based on their similarity to interval-valued data. The described process is applied to real data regarding the Spanish weather in order to cluster the provinces of Spain based on the interval temperature of each month in 2021, showing different results that the ones obtained using non-interval-valued data.},

A novel PaR-based loss function with an elastic net is proposed that can effectively trade off the sparsity of weights to mitigate the risk of underfitting or overfitting. An improved artificial bee colony algorithm-based optimization method is introduced to achieve the optimal weights. The experimental results on gold, silver and crude oil price data demonstrate that the proposed forecast combination approach can outperform not only individual models but also combination approaches like simple averaging and other competitive benchmarks.

In order to improve the efficiency of poisoning sample generation, we propose training interval, gradient truncation, and parallel process mechanisms. As a result, the model trained on the poisoning samples generated by our method is easily misled by slight crafting, and the attack is difficult to be detected since the contaminated model performs well on clean samples. The experimental results show that our method significantly increases the attack success rate without a substantial drop in classification accuracy on clean samples.

The elements belonging to this family are called φ φ -interval optimization problems . An advantage of the proposed method is that decision makers can consider a suitable interval optimization problem, choosing an appropriate order relation, which is obtained by choosing an automorphism. Moreover, this paper shows that each φ φ -interval optimization problem is equivalent to a biobjective optimization problem.

Second, an attribute weight optimization model is established based on adjustment satisfaction and fairness satisfaction to aggregate the subgroups. Third, we define the satisfaction determination method of experts in the transition process and then apply the quantum framework to update their state in the next stage.

The underlying reason is that, for the current state-of-the-art probabilistic models, it is required to evaluate multiple forecasts before uncertainty estimation, leading to computationally intensive, if not intractable, uncertainty inference. To this gap, probabilistic dynamics is introduced in the current study. A self-consistent condition in terms of empirical prior is formulated to measure uncertainty via inferring parametric distribution, and the resulted neural network is termed as probabilistic inference neural network (PINN). This approach is remarkably effective for data regression and policy learning frameworks. Experiments are performed on UCI datasets. The results demonstrate that PINN performance is more competitive than those of the currently prevailing methods. Finally, a PINN-based policy learning framework is proposed and applied to benchmark control tasks and physical control task of an in-house self-developed 14-DOF robot featuring high dimensional state/action spaces.

Our methodology focuses on collecting data from social media about real-world events which are known to trigger fake news. We propose a labelling method based on crowdsourcing that is fast, reliable, and able to approximate expert human annotation.

Firstly, PMMS-Eclat, an improved mining algorithm based on Ecalt, is used to obtain frequent partial periodic patterns from single time serie, which avoids the expensive tree structure adjustment cost. In this process, two new metrics are defined to characterize the correlation among sequential data effectively, namely density ratio and average periodic rate, which respectively reflect the density and occurrence rate of patterns. Secondly, the frequent partial periodic patterns excavated above are used as input matrices, and the ultimate relevant partial periodic patterns are obtained based on LSH principle.

  abstract     = {Most metaheuristic optimizers rely heavily on precisely setting their control parameters and search operators to perform well. Considering the complexity of real-world problems, it is always preferable to adjust control parameter values automatically rather than clamping them to a fixed value. In recent years, Spherical Search (SS) has emerged as a population-based stochastic optimization method that exploits the concepts of random projection matrices in linear algebra . As a result of the success of SS in solving non-convex, real-parameter optimization problems of various complexity, we have significantly extended SS in this paper by introducing a set of new algorithms, collectively known as Self Adaptive Spherical Search (SASS). Our proposal aims to enhance the performance of SS by using different projection matrix schemes in conjunction with improved search-direction calculations and an adaptive modification of parameter values. In our proposed adaptation scheme, parameters are modified to relevant values by applying a self-adaptive process that does not rely upon prior knowledge of the correlation between the parameter values and characteristics of the problem space. Consequently, we may apply the algorithms to bound and nonlinearly constrained optimization problems . For the benchmark suites derived from the most recent IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) competitions, simulation results indicate that the SASS family of algorithms performs better than or is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms from the other paradigms concerning robustness and convergence.},

It refers to conceiving a rule to allow deciding whether the number of 1s in an arbitrary binary sequence is an odd or even number , without resorting to globally accessing the sequence. In its most traditional formulation, it refers to cyclic configurations of odd length, which, under the action of a cellular automaton, should converge to a fixed point of all cells in the 0-state, if the configuration initially has an even number of 1s, or to a fixed point of all cells in the 1-state, otherwise. It has been shown that the problem can be solved in this formulation, in particular by a rule alone. Here, we provide a synchronous solution to the problem, by relying upon elementary cellular automaton rule 150, the elementary local parity rule, over a connection pattern among the cells defined by a family of directed, non-circulant, regular graphs . This represents the simplest synchronous solution currently known for cyclic configurations and, quite interestingly, being an instance of the solution of a non-trivial global problem by means of its local counterpart.},

  abstract     = {The existence of constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) in real-world applications motivate researchers to focus more on developing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). Due to the presence of constraints, an efficient constraint handling technique (CHT) is required in CMOEA to balance the constraint satisfaction and optimization of objective functions. Recently, different fitness based, ranking based, multi-population and multi-staged evolutionary approaches are proposed to handle CMOPs. However, most of the approaches still struggle while handling CMOPs with discontinuous feasible regions or whose feasible regions consist infeasible barriers. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Dual-Population and Multi-Stage based Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm which is termed as CMOEA-DPMS. In CMOEA-DPMS, two populations are used to explore the search space and feasible regions. Along with two populations, an archive is also employed to store feasible, well converged and distributed solutions. To employ appropriate mating selection and environmental selection strategies according to the evolution of the populations, evolutionary process is divided into several stages. A strategy decider mechanism is proposed to determine the appropriate mating and environmental selections depending on the status of the population. In addition, a novel CHT named decomposition based constraint non-dominating sorting ( DCDSort DCDSort ) is proposed by combining decomposition based selection with traditional constraint non-dominating sorting to maintain feasibility, convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on five recent and popular test suites along with 36 real-world constrained multi-objective optimization problems against eight state-of-the-art algorithms. The empirical results suggests that CMOEA-DPMS is significantly superior or comparable to the considered algorithms and can tackle all kinds of CMOPs.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the predictive capabilities of different news providers based on sentiment analysis , and propose a framework that endows different weights to different news providers for improving the prediction performance. In sentiment analysis , the prevalent Loughran-McDonald sentiment dictionary is utilized to calculate the sentiment scores of news articles, and the sentiment index of each news provider is obtained by integrating these sentiment scores. Based on the market data and sentiment indices of multiple news providers, we employ the recurrent neural network to build a number of base classifiers , and adopt the evidential reasoning rule to combine these base classifiers for predicting the stock market index movement. Additionally, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the weights of base classifiers and important hyper-parameters of the recurrent neural network . In the experimental study, we apply the proposed approach to the daily movement prediction of the S&amp;P 500 index, Dow Jones Industrial Average index and NASDAQ 100 index, and compare it with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our approach is effective for improving the prediction performance. Besides, the designed trading strategy based on the results of the proposed model achieves higher return rates than other trading strategies.},

  abstract     = {Decision making is undertaken by individuals whose perceptions for the objectives are vague due to the dynamics of decision-making objectives, the complexity of decision-making situation and the limitations of individuals’ education backgrounds, experiences, etc. Therefore, decision making which uses fuzzy set (FS) and its variants to describe the individuals’ vague perceptions has become more and more popular. Furthermore, in real-life decision-making situations, individuals are always bounded rationality, which is clearly described by prospect theory (PT). Thus, PT has been integrated into fuzzy decision making (FDM). Since then, FDM with PT have been rapidly developed. In this paper, we systematically analyze the existing FDM with prospect framework. Firstly, a detailed analysis about the existing research on this topic is given separately, including how to determine the reference point, how to express the value function and weighting function in PT under vague conditions. With this in mind, the applications and challenges of the existing methods are described and some possible directions for future research are provided. According to our review, it is worth mentioning that the FDM with psychological factors of decision makers will surely receive much more attention from researchers and practitioners in the future.},

The developed control scheme can remove a restrictive assumption on the system input channel and is applicable to general nonlinear descriptor systems. Moreover, universality discussion of the developed controller for two kinds of nonlinear descriptor systems is provided, which endows the proposed method with more confidence in real industrial applications.

Recent advances in this area are dominated by contrastive learning-based methods with various sampling strategies and optimization objectives . Unfortunately, these methods are limited by larger batch sizes and longer training epochs, resulting in non-negligible computational resource consumption and memory footprint . Unlike prior sampling manners and inspired by LEGO bricks, we design a comprehensive interleave sampling module to fully exploit unlabeled datasets, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of semantic and spatial relations complementarity from the unlabeled image via optimizing two objectives. Specifically, the unlabeled images are sampled in a dense and interleaved manner, which breaks down barriers of under-utilization of datasets existing in state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the redefined collaborative optimization term is designed to alleviate feature-specificity and implicitly explore sample relationships during training, which effectively improves the performance of downstream tasks on various datasets. Besides, we focus on high-level semantic features and utilize the spatial structure relationships provided by the unlabeled datasets to ensure the learned features with low-level texture characteristics. Extensive experiments on four types of datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art SSL methods.},

  abstract     = {The feature selection process plays an important role in different fields, particularly in bioinformatics and microarray gene expression data analysis, for choosing discriminative genes from high-dimensional datasets and selecting a subset of highly relevant features with low redundancy that may lead to build improved prediction models. Consequently, this study proposes a new feature selection method that integrates Preordonnances theory in terms of new Relevance and Complementarity criteria introduced here and also connectivity in undirected Weighted Graphs (PCRWG). The method can handle high-dimensional data. PCRWG retains the relevant and complementary features to select effective features in large scale gene datasets. The proposed algorithm operates in two phases: filtering and wrapping. The strength of the first phase is that it is preceded by a step that further reduces the number of predictors by removing those in disagreement with the target based on the new proposed relevance criterion. Then, the proposed heuristic uses the relevance-complementarity ratio between preordonnances to automatically update the compromise rule between relevance and complementarity. In the wrapping phase , the suggested graph-based approach using maximal clique is based on a powerful relevance-complementarity matrix to consolidate edges, two connected interdependent features are complementary to each other, and it is possible to have high discriminative power when they serve as a group. We highlight the fact that existing graph-based feature selection algorithms do not consider relevance and complementarity simultaneously. The experiments were carried out on three simulated scenarios and the thirteen most popular cancer microarray gene datasets. Formally, they are eight binary and five multi-class microarray data. A 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and artificial Neural Network (NN) classifiers. The empirical results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed hybrid approach when compared to the most recently published articles.},

Based on this purpose, a constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with the two-archive weak cooperation (CMOEA-TWC) is proposed in this article. In CMOEA-TWC, two archives are evolved, which are denoted as driving archive and normal archive, respectively. Besides, the weak cooperation of two archives is designed for sharing valuable information between archives. Specifically, the driving archive only considers objectives, while the normal archive considers both objectives and constraints. In addition, the minimum shift-based density estimation-based (SDE) distance is adopted to enhance the diversity of solutions in the driving archive, and a strict constrained dominance principle is designed to improve the feasibility of solutions in the normal archive. The proposed algorithm is tested on 47 CMOPs of 4 benchmark suites with the comparison of 4 state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the average ranks in terms of inverted generational distance (IGD) outperform those of existing state-of-the-art competitors.},

Existing schemes are challenging to make the protagonist agent that agilely responds to the opponent’s changes and the resulting non-stationarity, which may inevitably limit their applicability. To address the dynamic opponent policy and adapt to the non-stationary environment continuously, we propose a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model for modeling and predicting opponent behaviors called OM-TCN, and apply it to the widely-used Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policies Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm of competitive MARL. In this work, we collect the opponent’s behavior data observed by the protagonist agent and serialize it in granularity of episodes. Then we input the time-series data into OM-TCN for sequence modeling. The OM-TCN learns the historical behaviors of the opponent instead of overfitting to a specific opponent policy, and can make predictions about the opponent’s future actions. Finally, we use predictions of opponent actions in place of the history sampled from the playback buffer, and apply the OM-TCN model to the MADDPG framework for decentralized training. We use the competitive scenario of Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE) to evaluate the proposed method. Simulation results show that the protagonist agent is able to learn more efficient and stable policy and converge easier than other baselines.},

Existing feature selection algorithms cannot be directly applied to LDL due to the unique challenges caused by the label uncertainty nature. In this paper, we propose a novel LDL feature selection algorithm based on neighborhood rough sets. Specifically, we first introduce dual-similarity that is used to measure sample similarity in both the feature and the label spaces. Second, we invent a novel neighborhood fuzzy entropy as a feature evaluation metric , with which neighborhood rough sets can be applied to deal with LDL problems. Lastly, we complete a feature selection model that inherits the spirit of neighborhood rough sets and neighborhood fuzzy entropy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on twelve real-world LDL datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model against to other six state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Here, a cutnode of an undirected graph G is a node of G , whose deletion will cause a reachable pair of the other nodes in G to be unreachable. Currently, the difficulty of maintaining the entire G in the main memory makes researchers pay attention to compute cutnodes on semi-external memory model. This paper shows that traditional semi-external algorithms are limited by their unbounded time and I/O consumption, making them impractical when G is relatively large or complex. Thus, we propose a linear s emi- e xternal c ut n ode computation algorithm, named SECN. Assuming that G has n nodes and m edges, and B is the disk block size. SECN is the first that can find all the cutnodes of G in O ( m + n ) O(m+n) time and with O ( m B ) O(mB) I/O cost on the semi-external memory model, as far as we know. SECN also has a smaller minimum memory space requirement than traditional algorithms. Our experimental evaluation conducted on both synthetic and real graphs confirms that SECN significantly outperforms existing algorithms (up to 10 3 103 times faster).},

In this paper, random and adaptive weights are introduced into MOEA/D to break the limitation of fixed weight vectors.

Nevertheless, existing rough set-based decision-making methods cannot effectively deal with the management decision-making problems with heterogeneity, multi-decision, and diversified attributes simultaneously. Given this, the purpose of this paper is to explore an effective classification solution for solving decision-making problems with the above-described characteristics from the perspective of granular computing. First, we present the notion of heterogeneous diversified attribute multi-decision systems. Because attribute semantics is crucial to multi-attribute decision analysis, we then divide an attribute set into nine subsets according to attribute semantics. Further, a composite binary relation that fits the realistic attribute features is constructed. Subsequently, considering different decision scenarios, we establish four kinds of variable precision multi-decision multi-granulation rough set models. Meanwhile, the related properties and relationships of these models are explored. We find that the established models are extensions of the existing classical rough sets. In the end, we apply the established models to an illustrative example of medical diagnosis. The results of the case and comparative analyses demonstrate the models’ feasibility, effectiveness, and superiority. As a result, our work provides a kind of new decision thinking with reasonable semantic analysis for solving complex management decision-making problems in reality.},

  abstract     = {The continuous advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been revolutionizing the strategy of decision-making in different life domains. Regardless of this achievement, AI algorithms have been built as Black-Boxes , that is as they hide their internal rationality and learning methodology from the human leaving many unanswered questions about how and why the AI decisions are made. The absence of explanation results in a sensible and ethical challenge. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an evolving subfield of AI that emphasizes developing a plethora of tools and techniques for unboxing the Black-Box AI solutions by generating human-comprehensible, insightful, and transparent explanations of AI decisions. This study begins by discussing the primary principles of XAI research, Black-Box problems, the targeted audience, and the related notion of explainability over the historical timeline of the XAI studies and accordingly establishes an innovative definition of explainability that addresses the earlier theoretical proposals. According to an extensive analysis of the literature, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by driving a fine-grained, multi-level, and multi-dimension taxonomy for insightful categorization of XAI studies with the main aim to shed light on the variations and commonalities of existing algorithms paving the way for extra methodological developments. Then, an experimental comparative analysis is presented for the explanation generated by common XAI algorithms applied to different categories of data to highlight their properties, advantages, and flaws. Followingly, this study discusses and categorizes the evaluation metrics for the XAI-generated explanation and the findings show that there is no common consensus on how an explanation must be expressed, and how its quality and dependability should be evaluated. The findings show that XAI can contribute to realizing responsible and trustworthy AI, however, the advantages of interpretability should be technically demonstrated, and complementary procedures and regulations are required to give actionable information that can empower decision-making in real-world applications. Finally, the tutorial is crowned by discussing the open research questions, challenges, and future directions that serve as a roadmap for the AI community to advance the research in XAI and to inspire specialists and practitioners to take the advantage of XAI in different disciplines.},

  abstract     = {Many fitness evaluations are often needed for large-scale evolutionary optimization to find the optimal solution. Therefore, evolutionary algorithms are impeded to solve computationally expensive problems. Surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been shown to have good capability in a finite computational budget. However, not many SAEAs, have been proposed for large-scale expensive problems. The main reason is that a proper surrogate model is challenging to be trained due to the curse of dimension. In this paper, we propose to employ the random grouping technique to divide a large-scale optimization problem into several low-dimensional sub-problems. Then a surrogate ensemble is trained for each sub-problem to assist the sub-problem optimization. The next parent population for large-scale optimization will be generated by the horizontal composition of the populations for sub-problem optimization. Furthermore, the best solution found so far for the sub-problem with the best population mean fitness value will be used to replace the best solution found so far for the large-scale problem on its corresponding dimensions, and the new solution will be evaluated using the expensive objective function. The experimental results on CEC’2013 benchmark problems show that the proposed method is effective and efficient for solving large-scale expensive optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) has attracted extensive attention in the field of machine learning due to its excellent performance in handling incomplete multiview data (IMVD). However, existing IMVC methods often use spectral clustering or k-means on the obtained affinity matrices to obtain the final clustering results , that is, the affinity matrices learning process and clustering process are separated. In this paper, we propose a new ingenious IMVC method, one-step incomplete multiview clustering with low-rank tensor graph learning (OIMVC/LTGL), to solve the problem. This method combines graph learning, low-rank tensor constraint, common representation learning and clustering into a unified optimization framework. First, we utilize the adjacency relationship between views to complete the similarity graph matrices. Second, we stack all similarity graph matrices into a third-order tensor. To mine higher-order correlations among different views, we impose a low-rank tensor constraint, the tensor nuclear norm (TNN), into the constructed tensor. Third, to explore consistent information between views, we introduce a common representation learning term to learn the optimal consensus representation. Last, we introduce spectral rotation to the consensus representation matrices to directly obtain the clustering labels. These steps promote each other for better clustering performance. We solve the optimization problem by using the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method. Experiments based on five well-known datasets show the superiority of our method.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world scenarios, multiple agents necessitate coordination with each other because of their limited observation and communication capability. Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in such challenging settings making use of value decomposition. One of the representative methods is QMIX, which factorizes the multi-agent global Q-value into individual Q-values and limits the joint action Q-value to a monotonic assumption leveraging an implicit mixing method. However, this assumption restricts it to representing certain value functions in which the ordering of an agent’s actions is based on the actions of others. WQMIX presents two weighting schemes to tackle this restriction but the weighting function is simple that limits the performance of methods, more appropriate weighting scheme is required to be considered. To tackle this issue, we present a more complex and accurate weighting scheme, which we call Dynamic Weighting (DW), as opposed to the fixed weighting in WQMIX. Our proposed method DW-QMIX guarantees a more general decomposition than QMIX or WQMIX and places accurate importance on the better joint actions thus leading to obtaining the optimal policy . Extensive experiments on the simulation environments and real-life systems demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.},

We adopt a community structure rapid identification algorithm to identify social network structure labels, to realize the label aggregation of community nodes. Combined with the structure of a binary tree, we use the adaptive method to identify the dense regions for the generated upper triangular adjacency matrix. We perturb the edge connection probability of the identified dense regions and reconstruct a disturbed adjacency matrix by edge optimal allocation to publish the final network graph, which can improve the efficiency of the algorithm and data availability. In addition, we experimentally evaluate our approach on four social network datasets and show that the published network graph has better data availability and privacy protection, with higher execution efficiency than the four classical schemes.},

  abstract     = {The decision tree algorithm has been widely used in data mining and machine learning due to its high accuracy, low computational cost and high interpretability. However, when dealing with the continuous data, the classical decision tree algorithm needs to replace continuous attributes with discretized attributes by the strategy of discretization. Discretization may cause a loss of information structure, which will affect the performance of classification. To tackle this problem, many researchers have proposed different decision tree methods based on variable precision neighborhood rough sets. However, these methods do not consider the geometric structure of neighborhood systems, which may lead to a contradiction in the transitivity of the equivalence relation. In this paper, we first define a novel neighborhood geometric similarity in a neighborhood system from the perspective of geometry. Second, by combining the neighborhood geometric similarity and the neighborhood algebraic similarity, we propose four new kinds of neighborhood similarities, which can solve the contradictory transitivity of the equivalence relation. Third, a variable precision neighborhood rough set model is constructed using the new similarities, and a novel decision tree algorithm is proposed based on this model, where the degree of attribute dependence is used as the partition measure. Experimental results on 14 selected datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository show that our algorithm is effective. The average accuracy of our algorithm is over 90\%, which is 10\% higher than the classical decision tree algorithms, and the number of leaf nodes increases slightly.},

The framework links GAE and DAE together by transferring the representation learned by DAE to the corresponding layer of GAE to alleviate the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, the latent representation learned by GAE is enforced to match a prior distribution via an adversarial training scheme to avoid the free of any structure of latent space. We design a joint supervision mechanism to improve the clustering performance consisting of self-supervision and mutual supervision. The self-supervision is to learn more compact representations , and mutual-supervision makes different representations more consistent. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against the state-of-the-art algorithms and achieve significant improvement on six benchmark datasets.},

The method, often called the fuzzy AHP, is also used when aggregating crisp pairwise comparisons of a group of decision makers in the group DM problem. In this paper, the DM problem is formulated in a general setting using pairwise comparisons matrices with elements from an Abelian linearly ordered group (alo-group). Such an approach enables extensions of traditional multiplicative, additive, or fuzzy approaches. Here, we propose some desirable properties (consistency, coherency, and intensity) of priority vectors, and derive sufficient conditions for the existence of priority vectors with those properties. In general, the most popular methods for deriving the priority vector – the Eigenvector Method and the Geometric Mean Method – do not always provide priority vectors having these desirable properties. Here, we formulate a new solution algorithm for deriving the priority vector based on a specific optimization problem satisfying the desirable properties under appropriate assumptions.

State-of-the-art approach in document similarity commonly involves deep neural networks, yet there is little study on how different architectures may be combined. Thus, we introduce the Siamese Attention-augmented Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (S-ARCNN) that combines multiple neural network architectures. In each subnetwork of S-ARCNN, a document passes through a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM) layer, which sends representations to local and global document modules. A local document module uses convolution, pooling, and attention layers, whereas a global document module uses last states of the bi-LSTM. Both local and global features are concatenated to form a single document representation. Using the Quora Question Pairs dataset, we evaluated S-ARCNN, Siamese convolutional neural networks (S-CNNs), Siamese LSTM, and two BERT models. While S-CNNs (82.02\% F1) outperformed S-ARCNN (79.83\% F1) overall, S-ARCNN slightly outperformed S-CNN on duplicate question pairs with more than 50 words (39.96\% vs. 39.42\% accuracy). With the potential advantage of S-ARCNN for processing longer documents, S-ARCNN may help researchers identify collaborators with similar research interests, help editors find potential reviewers, or match resumes with job descriptions.},

However, most existing studies describe the trust relationship only from the single perspective of the interpersonal relationships between DMs, which easily leads to inaccurate decision-making results. In this paper, we propose a dynamic consensus method using a dual-trust relationship-based social network (DTRSN) to solve large group emergency decision-making (LGEDM) problems. First, to more accurately reflect the trust relationship among DMs, a DTRSN based on familiarity-based trust and similarity-based trust is developed, which can comprehensively model the interpersonal relationships and opinion similarity between DMs simultaneously. Next, a DTRSN-based clustering method that considers dual-trust relationships is introduced to divide the large-group DMs into several clusters. Subsequently, to improve the efficiency of LGEDM, the exit-delegation mechanism is modified and introduced into our study, which can speed up consensus by excluding some subgroups whose opinions differ greatly from other subgroups and reserve their influence. Subsequently, a dynamic consensus method based on the modified exit-delegation mechanism is proposed to help DMs reach an agreement quickly. Finally, a case study regarding emergency alternative selection to deal with heavy rainstorms in Zhengzhou, China, is conducted to verify the efficiency of our study, and several comparison and simulation analyses are also conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.},

Differently from traditional co-training that requires at least two sufficient and independent data views (e.g., modes), our solution is applicable to any kind of data. Our approach exploits a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm as a strategy to relax the view independence assumption, using a stronger iterative agent that builds more precise combined decision class boundaries. Our experimental evaluation with four popular textual benchmarks demonstrates that CoRL can produce better classifiers than confidence-based co-training methods, while producing high effectiveness in comparison with the state-of-the-art in semi-supervised learning. In our experiments, CoRL reduced the labeling effort by more than 80\% 80\% with no losses in classification effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, including methods based on neural networks, with gains of up to 96\% 96\% against some of the best competitors.},

We first introduce the TPN-list structure, an extended version of the N -list structure, which is used to represent and discover the WUIPs. A TPN-list intersection algorithm is then developed, which has linear complexity and the ability to self-reduce its size. Several theorems are also proposed for the fast calculation and determination of a WUIP based on its TPN-list. Finally, we propose the HWUIPM algorithm, based on the above proposals, for mining WUIPs from uncertain databases. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms for mining WUIPs in terms of running time, resource usage and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Correspondence-based point cloud registration is a cornerstone in computer vision, robotics, autonomous navigation and remote sensing, which seeks to estimate the best rigid transformation between two point clouds from the point correspondences established over 3D keypoints. Owing to limited robustness and accuracy, current 3D keypoint matching techniques are rather prone to yield outliers, probably in large numbers, thus making robust estimation (outlier rejection) for the registration problem very important. Unfortunately, previously proposed robust registration methods often suffer from high computation cost or insufficient robustness when encountering high (or even extreme) outlier ratios , hardly ideal enough for practical use. In this paper, we present a novel, time-efficient consensus maximization solver, named Double-layered sAmpliNg with consensus maximization based on stratIfied Element-wise compatibiLity (DANIEL), for robust point cloud registration. DANIEL is smartly designed with two layers of random sampling operation, in order to find the inlier subset with the lowest computational cost possible. Specifically, we (i) apply the rigidity constraint to prune raw outliers in the first layer of one-point sampling, (ii) introduce a series of stratified element-wise compatibility tests to conduct rapid compatibility checking between minimal models so as to realize more efficient consensus maximization in the second layer of two-point sampling, and (iii) employ probabilistic termination conditions to ensure the timely return of the final inlier set. By conducting a series of experiments on multiple real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed solver DANIEL (i) is robust against over 99\% of outliers, (ii) is also significantly faster than previous state-of-the-art robust algorithms, and (iii) is fairly practical for use in real-world applications such as object localization and scan matching problems.},

  abstract     = {Generating a series of images to describe a story of multiple sentences is a challenging task in computer vision as it needs to consider both the image-level precision and story-level consistency. Existing methods usually focus on the consistency between images at the cost of the fine-grained object details. We propose a progressive adversarial learning algorithm, termed HR-PrGAN, to achieve high-resolution image sequences with rich details by decomposing the problem of generating into multiple stages. Specifically, HR-PrGAN has two stages, where the Coarse-grain Stage generates a series of coherent coarse-grained images from both the story and context embeddings, and an additional unconditional loss is proposed to restrict their deformation and preserve the object contours and layouts. Subsequently, the Refinement Stage further refines the series of coherent coarse-grained images by injecting the story-level text embeddings and preserving the image-level details via a Coarse-grained feature Supplementary Module (CSM). Moreover, two commonly-used datasets, i.e. the CLEVR-SV and PororoSV datasets, are applied to evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image anti-deformation, fine-grained feature synthesis and human perception based image quality evaluation.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach, called partially-federated learning , that combines machine learning with federated learning . This hybrid architecture can train a unified model across multiple clients, where the individual client can decide whether a sample must remain private or can be shared with the server. This decision is made by a privacy module that can enforce various techniques to protect the privacy of client data.

The main feature of the echo control strategy is that agents resend the information flows (received from neighbors) to the corresponding neighbor, just like the reflecting of sound waves. In other words, every individual under the echo control strategy is not only the sender and receiver of the information flows, but also the reflector of its neighbors’ messages. In this way, a negative feedback loop is constructed between every two agents, which is designed to ensure the stability of the multiagent system (MAS), and then the agents’ states will converge to a common value. The effectiveness of the echo control protocol is theoretically analyzed, and numerical simulations validate the correctness of the relevant results.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial examples cause misclassifications of deep learning (DL) systems. It isn’t easy to debug misclassifications due to the intrinsic complexity of DL architecture. Thus, applying coverage-guided fuzzing, a widely used technique to find crashes in complex software, is promising. However, mutation strategies of DL fuzzers , such as DeepHunter, have a limitation. They restrict multiple transformations and so penalize generating diverse inputs. Otherwise, they cause significant distortion, rendering invalid inputs, such as unrecognizable or ambiguous to humans. However, multiple transformations are critical in mutation-based fuzzing. To address this problem, we propose the mixed and constrained mutation (MCM) for DL fuzzers. Human perception-based constraints of MCM avoid significant distortion in a single transformation and the aggregation of multiple transformations. We verify transformation parameters through a survey with 15 participants on each MNIST, STL-10, and ImageNet dataset to implement such constraints, followed by statistical tests. MCM returns valid inputs in almost every fuzzing iteration. Furthermore, MCM improved the fuzzing performance on various DL architectures on MNIST, STL-10, and ImageNet compared to DeepHunter: MCM discovered 17.6\% more seeds showing new coverage and 132\% more adversarial examples on average. These adversarial examples correspond to more than double the incorrect classes for each original image than DeepHunter.},

In this work, we propose an algorithm called SpotRL to solve the auto-scaling problem using heterogeneous spot and on-demand instances. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been shown to be able to make effective decisions in highly dynamic environments, as they can learn step-by-step and find solutions without prior knowledge. SpotRL uses an RL-based approach for the scaling of heterogeneous spot instances. In the complex cloud environment, the training speed of RL agents is generally slow. Considering this issue, we use a multi-agent approach to decompose tasks to help agents learn faster. To reduce the negative impact of low service availability due to agents’ random explorations as they interact with the cloud environment, SpotRL uses a passive approach for the scaling of heterogeneous on-demand instances. Our experimental results show that the SpotRL approach can significantly reduce the deployment cost of SaaS providers while complying with high service availability.},

While there are existing deep neural networks that generate superpixels and superpoints/supervoxels from images and point clouds respectively, the current oversegmentation methods in 3D meshes mostly rely on hand-crafted features that are extracted using non-differentiable algorithms to generate superfacets. Nevertheless, these methods cannot leverage the feature extraction abilities of deep neural networks to generate superfacets in an end-to-end fashion. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end trainable deep neural network that learns to generate boundary-aware superfacets from 3D meshes. Specifically, our network learns a soft face-superfacet association map from faces and their adjacency relationships. Moreover, we develop a segmentation-aware loss on the faces that train the network to predict their labels in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate the performance of our method using mesh adaptations of two well-known superpixel evaluation metrics where experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed network surpasses that of other state-of-the-art mesh oversegmentation methods, and in doing so simultaneously improves superfacet-based semantic segmentation.},

However, few of these methods can effectively deal with the MADM problems with incomplete mixed information that are frequently encountered in real-world situations. This study proposes a three-way MADM method for an incomplete mixed information system (IMIS), where the objective determination of conditional probabilities and utility functions in IMIS without decision label is the pivotal issue. To overcome this issue, we define a probabilistic similarity measure for incomplete mixed information. The probabilistic similarity measure is used to replace the distance measure of classical TOPSIS for estimating the conditional probabilities objectively. The probabilistic similarity class is introduced with arithmetic average method to design a conversion mechanism and obtain the objective relative utility functions of incomplete evaluation values. We then construct a novel 3WD model in IMIS and combine it with two customized ranking principles, to solve the incomplete mixed MADM problems from the perspective of classification and ranking in a more thoughtful and interpretable manner. Our study provides a new perspective for the research on MADM in incomplete mixed information environment. Several examples and experimental comparisons verify the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method. The experiments demonstrate that our method can meet more decision-making requirements and is more accurate and rational in some decision-making scenarios than several prior similar methods.},

However, improper linear fitting tends to produce unsatisfactory results with notable artifacts. To relieve the improper linear fitting and reuse the hierarchical features, we propose an end-to-end locally linear embedding super-resolution network, termed as LLE-Net, based on the assumption that the local geometric relationship in the low-resolution manifold space also exists in high-level feature manifold space. The proposed LLE-Net includes two major components: 1) the local linear embedding block (LLEB) and 2) the hierarchical non-local block (HNB). In particular, LLEB searches sparse and similar feature maps and embeds the geometric relationship into the high-level feature space, allowing more attention to be paid to objects’ textural details. To promote the representation ability, the proposed HNB is able to explore layer- and pixel-level interdependencies. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the superiority of LLE-Net via two groups of experiments: (1) super-resolution tasks on two satellite image datasets and a satellite video image dataset, and (2) the subsequent high-level image processing tasks (i.e., satellite semantic segmentation). The proposed method achieves an 0.7 dB improvement in PSNR value on the Draper dataset and 0.07\% segmentation accuracy improvement. The source code of the proposed LLE-Net is publicly available.},

Inspired by the reinforcement learning techniques, we propose an MWM framework, L2M, with a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model, which can efficiently and effectively solve the MWM problem on large-scale general graphs. First, in contrast to traditional DRL methods that define the Markov Decision Process (MDP) without considering the efficiency issue, we represent MWM as an MDP that is carefully designed to accelerate computation. In particular, this MDP supports selecting multiple edges for each action and uses a pruning method to reduce search space efficiently. Second, since none of the existing DRL methods can support edge selection on large-scale graphs efficiently, we propose an edge-message-passing network EEN to generate edge embedding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that uses DRL model for solving the MWM problem . Experimental results show that L2M outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and generalizes well on graphs of different sizes and distributions.},

The linguistic summarization allows translating the explanations of the model outputs provided by SHAP into statements expressed in natural language. PLENARY accounts for the imprecision related to model outputs by summarizing them into simple linguistic statements and for the imprecision related to the data labeling process by including additional domain knowledge in the form of middle-layer labels. PLENARY is validated on preprocessed speech signals collected from smartphones from patients with bipolar disorder and on publicly available mental health survey data. The experiments confirm that fuzzy linguistic summarization is an effective technique to support meta-analyses of the outputs of AI models. Also, PLENARY improves explainability by aggregating low-level attributes into high-level information granules, and by incorporating vague domain knowledge into a multi-task sequential and compositional multilayer perceptron.

Inspired by this, we introduce a speed factor to characterize the worst-case convergence speed of the containment control and show that the convergence speed becomes faster as the speed factor decreases. The analytical solutions of the fastest convergence speed are obtained, and static linear distributed protocols are designed using the standard algebra Riccati equation to achieve the fastest convergence speed of the containment control. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the validity of the developed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems help users find items of interest in situations of information overload in a personalized way, using needs and preferences of individual users. In conversational recommendation approaches, the system acquires needs and preferences in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. This is usually driven by incrementally asking users about their preferences about item features or individual items. A central research goal in this context is efficiency, evaluated concerning the number of required interactions until a satisfying item is found. Today, research on dialog efficiency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate, for example, that one strategy for selecting questions to ask the user is better than another one in a given application. This work complements empirical research with a theoretical, domain-independent model of conversational recommendation. This model, designed to cover a range of application scenarios, allows us to investigate the efficiency of conversational approaches in a formal way, particularly concerning the computational complexity of devising optimal interaction strategies. An experimental evaluation empirically confirms our findings.},

  abstract     = {Most manifold learning algorithms are non-parametric, use unsupervised approaches, and hence lack prediction capability. Some of these methods have been adapted for out of sample points, but often they require the training data. We propose a framework to estimate an explicit map for manifold learning in a supervised setting. Although different modeling tools can be used, we study the performance with polynomials and neural networks . The quality of output of any regression system depends on the quality of the target data. We consider outputs from an unsupervised manifold learning method as the target. However, even for simple data, often the outputs (target) get severely distorted. For high-dimensional data, it is difficult to assess and correct if the target data are distorted. Our approach can predict as well as eliminate such distortions to a great extent in the output. We suggest three regularizers, each of which can be used to augment the loss function. For image data, even for a low order polynomial , the number of free parameters becomes large demanding a large training set. For this, we propose a scheme exploiting the spatial characteristics of neighboring pixels . The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated using synthetic and real data for both polynomial and neural network-based models.},

However, some existing approaches do not achieve satisfactory performance and robustness owing to the imperfection of norms used for measuring the distances in models. To solve this problem, we propose a new formulation of the robust PCA feature extraction method, called flexible capped PCA (FCPCA), in which we use capped L 2,p -norm distance metric to minimize reconstruction errors of data. In addition to having rotational invariance , capped L 2,p -norm distance metric can better weaken the role of outliers, even if the outliers’ effect is magnified when p is a large value . This characteristic makes our model more powerful than existing approaches. Also, the proposed model is more flexible than many other robust models, which can be derived by specifying the value of p. However, solving the resulting objective problem is a challenge. One of the key contributions of this study is the design of a new iterative algorithm for the derivation of an optimal solution, in which each iteration computes an eigenvalue problem associated with a weighted covariance matrix . Experimental results on several public datasets prove the algorithm’s effectiveness.},

As a result, in an effort to thoroughly investigate the impact of similarity measures integration with ML models, this work makes three major contributions: (1) proposing newly-integrated models and presenting benchmarking studies for integration methodology over balanced/imbalanced datasets; (2) offering detailed analysis for dozens of integrated models that are established, and experimentally proven, to significantly outperform state-of-the-art performance. The models&#39; construction used fourteen similarity measures, three knowledge representations (BoW, TFIDF, and Word embedding), and five models (Support Vector Machine, N -Centroid-based Classifier, Multinomial Naïve Bayesian , Convolutional Neural Network , and Artificial Neural Network); and (3) introducing significantly-effective and highly-efficient variations of these five models. The evaluation study has been conducted internally for integrated models against their baselines, and externally against the state-of-the-art models. While the internal evaluation constantly showed a total enhancement rate of 49.3\% and 59\% over the balanced and imbalanced datasets, respectively, the external evaluation attested to the superiority of the integrated models.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of social networks has made group activities part of people’s daily lives. It is in high demand to recommend items for a group of users that meet their common preferences, known as group recommendations (GRs). Recently, some studies have focused on GRs and adopted deep neural networks to model the process of group decision-making. These approaches can be further divided into two phases: the individual preference learning phase and the group decision phase, both of which face several challenges although recent research has some achievements. In the first individual preference learning phase, the challenges are how to effectively incorporate social networks to overcome the sparsity issue of user interaction data and how to capture the dynamic evolutions of users’ preferences over time. The challenge for the second group decision phase is how to adjust group members’ preference weights dynamically since each group member may carry different deciding power in different situations, depending on their roles in the group and domain expertise. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel group recommendation framework that d ynamically a ggregates the s ocial i nfluence diffusion and i nterest e volution (DASIIE). Specifically, DASIIE is composed of three main modules: 1) a social influence diffusion (SID) module which stacks multi-layer graph neural networks to simulate the influence propagation in social networks; 2) an interest evolution learning (IEL) component which learns individuals’ interest evolutions over time from their behavior sequences; 3) a two-way attention (TWA) module which learns group members’ role weights and expertise weights during the decision-making process simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results show the better performance of our model compared to the state-of-the-art baseline models .},

  abstract     = {Data denoising is an essential issue in machine learning and computer vision . However, most existing denoising methods can handle only low-noise data, because it is difficult for these methods to obtain the true structures of high-noise data. An existing partial solution is to consolidate the structures of data by moving each sample to its near high density region. It actually regards all non-noisy samples as noisy ones, but non-noisy samples are important for constructing the structures of high-noise data so they should not be moved. To address this problem, we propose a new denoising method called Denoising by a new Noise index and Reinforcement learning (DNR). Firstly, it detects each noisy sample by its density and the distance between this sample and the center of its neighbors. A noisy sample usually has a low density and most neighbors of this sample will be on the same side of it, leading to the center of its neighbors far from it, especially for high-noise data. Secondly, for each detected noisy sample, DNR models its movement as a Markov decision process to store the experience in this movement. Finally, NDR learns a policy to iteratively move each detected noisy sample to its near high density region by learns the experience of this movement in reinforcement learning. The learned experience can effectively help the movement adapt to the high-noise in real-world cases. In DNR, the structures of high-noise data can be well consolidated by our detection and movement of noisy samples. To prove the rationality of DNR, we theoretically analyze its convergence. Then, we perform the experiment to illustrate that DNR can better denoise high-noise data than existing denoising methods.

  abstract     = {Trajectory is an important basis for reflecting the behavior of moving agents and can be used for various applications. Autonomous systems navigating in complex scenes should have the ability to predict the future locations of surrounding agents and avoid collisions. Agents in a scene interact with each other constantly, which is the greatest challenge of trajectory prediction. However, existing methods have problems with insufficient, superfluous or inaccurate interactions, whether they are distance-, attention- or dense graph-based interactive mechanisms. Moreover, the dynamic complexity and validity of social interactions cannot be quantified. In this paper, we propose a dynamic social interaction modeling mechanism based on structure entropy minimization. Specifically, structure entropy minimization provides a principle for detecting and quantifying the natural or true interactions between agents. Additionally, considering that most agents under the same scenario often have similar behavioral preferences, we introduce scene features to model the interscene variance and intrascene consistency of motion patterns. Finally, through multi-time-scale motion tendency modeling, we can simultaneously model short-term and long-term intentions to alleviate accumulated errors for pedestrians avoiding collisions. We evaluate our proposed method on three trajectory datasets, and the experiments and comparisons demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating the capacity to model social interaction and motion patterns.},

Many efficient community detection algorithms have been proposed by researchers. However, effective community detection algorithms are accompanied by a growing problem of privacy disclosure. People have started to worry that their private information will be overexposed by community detection algorithms, so determining how to hide the community structure in the network to resist community detection algorithms has become an important issues. In view of this, we develop effective strategies to attack community detection algorithms through invisible disturbances to the network, namely, adding and removing a small number of connections, thus achieving privacy protection. In particular, a hiding strategy named “community hiding based on genetic algorithms using NMI (CGN)” is proposed in this paper. The algorithm uses normalized mutual information (NMI) as the fitness function and achieves an efficient global hiding effect by introducing a gene pool with prior information. We launched attacks based on CGN against four community detection algorithms on multiple real-world networks. By comparing with several state-of-the-art baseline algorithms, our CGN achieved the optimal results in NMI reduction. By visualizing the attack effect, it is proven that our CGN can achieve the community division error of nodes irrelevant to the connection changes by changing a very small number of connections, which fully reflects the concealment of community hiding. In addition, we further test the transferability and find that the modified network obtained by CGN on a specific community detection algorithm also shows extraordinary hiding effects when extended to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the event-based distributed sliding mode formation control issue of leader-following multi-agent systems subject to uncertain perturbations. Firstly, a distributed linear sliding manifold that ensures the asymptotic convergence of the states of multi-agent systems is constructed. Secondly, based on the controller output signal, an event-triggered mechanism is put forward to weaken the demand of continuous monitoring. In spite of external disturbances , the distributed robust sliding mode formation protocol relied on an event-triggered condition can guarantee the closed-loop system to reach the preestablished sliding manifold in finite time and keep a desired formation pattern while eliminating the Zeno behavior. Thirdly, sufficient conditions are derived for the distributed formation control of multi-agent systems. Finally, a numerical example is given and a simulation is performed on the robotic manipulators systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {One-class classification (OCC) is a classification task where the training data have only one class. The goal is to classify input data into one seen class or other unseen classes. This paper proposes an OCC approach using a signal transformation network (OCSTN), which aims to process univariate time-series data. The main contribution is developing a signal transformation network (STN) that aims to transform input signals into one signal, namely the goal signal. Moreover, the model error of the STN is a distance metric between the goal signal and the model output. The STN model learns from one-class signals. Therefore, model error for one class is small relative to other classes. Accordingly, OCSTN could discriminate between seen and unseen classes using the model errors. The proposed OCSTN is evaluated using two ballistocardiography (BCG) datasets. The OCSTN achieves fair results in both AUC scores and processing speed. OCSTN has a weak point in training diverse signals. In addition, the entropy and smoothness of the goal signal are highly related to the AUC score.},

This paper proposes a federated version of SCNs (FSCNs) for large-scale data, which are geographically distributed among different end-user clients with non-shareable data due to privacy and security concerns. Unlike centralized learning that needs to collect data from clients and store them collectively on a cloud server, FSCNs enable distributed analytics in a collaborative learning paradigm without centrally aggregating new data, thereby preventing the leakage of private information. Considering different supervisory and aggregate schemes of model parameters, two FSC algorithms with two aggregate strategies are presented.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the swarm control for large-scale omnidirectional mobile robots (OMRs) within incremental behavior is proposed to imitate the confluence behavior of animals during migration. In previous work, the number of OMRs in the swarm system was small and immutable. As such, the system lacked flexibility for swarm systems in practical applications. To solve these problems, we make several innovations. Firstly, OMRs within incremental behavior are proposed. Based on this, the incremental system of OMRs within incremental behavior is designed when the original swarm system needs assistance to form an incremental swarm system, which allows the incremental behavior happens among different swarm systems and the formation of each incremental system unchanged. Notably, incremental updating method based on second-order communication topology is proposed to update the adjacency matrix and the state matrix instead of creating a new swarm system. Then, to solve the pressure caused by the increasing number of OMRs in incremental swarm systems on calculating and storage, the incremental swarm system of large-scale OMRs based on second-order communication topology is introduced to rank the system and weaken the strong coupling relationship. In this case, the swarm control for a large-scale incremental swarm system is proposed through the backstepping method. The Lyapunov function is designed to prove the stability of the proposed controller. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {The capability of predicting the future trends of crowds has rendered crowd flow prediction more critical in building intelligent transportation systems, and attracted substantial research efforts. The trend of crowd flows is closely related to time and the urban topography. Therefore, extracting and leveraging both spatial features and temporal features are key gradients for effectively predicting crowd flows. Many previous works extract spatial features from crowd-flow data in an iteration way. As a result, models suffer from a heavy computation cost while ignoring details of road topology and structure information. Meanwhile, temporal features, including short-term features and long-term features, are separately extracted. The fusion of all features at the last stage before accomplishing the prediction also neglects the underlying associativity between various features. To address the limitations, we leverage spatial features by extracting structural information of road structures, such as road connection, road density, road width, etc. Rather than extracting spatial features from crowd-flow data, we capture them from images of city maps by adopting convolutional neural networks. Moreover, we implement a new sequence feature fusion mechanism to merge both spatial features and temporal features from various time scales so as to predict crowd flows. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Today’s world needs new methods to deal with and analyze the ever-increasingly generated data streams. Two of the most challenging aspects of data streams are (i) concept drift, i.e. evolution of data stream over time, which requires the ability to make timely decisions against the high speed of receiving new data; (ii) limited memory storage and the impracticality of using memory due to the large amount of data. Clustering is one of the common methods to process data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel, fully-online, density-based method for clustering evolving data streams. In recent years, a number of methods have been proposed, which also have the ability to cluster data streams. The main limitation of these methods is the use of parameters based on knowledge-expert. This work is among the first works to address this issue. Constant False Clustering Probability , CFCP, has tried to choose the algorithm’s parameters based on Statistics . The proposed method has also the ability to identify clusters with arbitrary shapes. It is robust to noise and offers high accuracy and efficiency in both low and high dimensions . In this method, we determine the value of the parameters by using statistical theories and do not require more information, taking advantage of expert-knowledge. The presented experimental results show that the method performs data clustering at high speeds without reducing the quality compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, the state-of-the-art work is inefficient for computing the resilience of IQ queries. Moreover, the complexity of resilience for self-join free (sj-free) CQs with other kinds of inequalities has not been explored. Therefore, we provide a dichotomy for the complexity of resilience for sj-free CQs with inequalities q q in this paper. We first introduce query condition graph, which includes a special query condition graph called query condition triad, and triangle vertex cover problem. Then we reduce the vertex cover problem to the triangle vertex cover problem. According to query condition graphs, our dichotomy is as follows: If q q is a qc-triad query, which is not an IQ query but contains a query condition triad, then RES ( q ) RES(q) is NP-complete. If q q is a qc-linear query, which neither is an IQ query nor contains a query condition triad, then RES ( q ) RES(q) is in PTIME. Finally, we introduce an algorithm called Rlin Rlin to compute the resilience of qc-linear queries, and an efficient algorithm named RIQ RIQ to efficiently compute the resilience of IQ queries. The experiments show that our RIQ RIQ has much better performance than other algorithms for computing the resilience of IQ queries.},

  abstract     = {CCA security is desirable when designing encryption schemes because it captures active attackers. One efficient approach for achieving CCA security is to use generic conversions. We first design a CPA secure scheme, and then transform it into a CCA secure scheme using the Fujisaki-Okamoto technique (CRYPTO ’99) in the random oracle model or the Canetti-Halevi-Katz technique (EUROCRYPT ’04) in the standard model if the CPA secure scheme satisfies some conditions. These transformations are generic so they can be applied to encryption primitives such as IBE and ABE . Nevertheless, both techniques result in an inevitable ciphertext expansion. Subsequent generic constructions mainly follow the idea surrounding these two techniques. The ciphertext expansion becomes a tradeoff in the existing conversions where it raises an inherently interesting question: do we have to sacrifice the size of the ciphertext during security transformation for all encryption primitives? In this work we will explore, for the first time, new generic conversions from CPA to CCA security without ciphertext expansion . By utilizing the properties of encryption in a novel way we will show that these generic conversions exist in the encryption primitive; they are called constant-size threshold ABE that satisfy verifiability or delegatability . Given a CPA secure threshold ABE that fulfills this requirement, we can convert it into a CCA secure threshold ABE without increasing the size of the ciphertext, albeit our conversions are restricted to the random oracle model . Our conversions are also applicable for transforming selective CPA to selective CCA security. We also show two instantiations of our conversions and obtain the shortest ciphertexts among all threshold ABE schemes with (selective) CCA security in the literature, even for other expressive access structures in the ABE setting. The ciphertext of the converted CCA secure scheme consists of three group elements only: two elements in group G 1 G1 (or G G in symmetric pairing) and one element in group G T GT .},

To effectively utilize the auxiliary information for assisting in building learner models with improved performance, this paper presents a novel stochastic configuration network (SCN) incorporating the iterative learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm, termed ISCN+. Meanwhile, to make the comments generated by the privileged information more closely match the ISCN+, these comments should be iteratively updated as the number of hidden nodes of the SCN increases. To this end, the training of SCN and the learning of comments generated by the privileged information is integrated into a new objective function, and the alternating optimization strategy is adopted to optimize the parameters of ISCN + and update the comments generated by the privileged information. Moreover, the L 1 / 2 L1/2 -norm-regularization-based sparse ISCN+ (S-ISCN+) is proposed to further improve the generalization capacity and reduce the complexity of ISCN+. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of the optimization process is provided.

This paper unifies CSTNUDs with other temporal network formalisms by providing Conditional Temporal Networks with Uncertainty and Decisions (CTNUDs) and proposes a semantics for dynamic controllability modeled as a two-player game between Controller and Nature where each player can react instantaneously to the other player moves. Such a game is designed to guarantee termination with exactly one winner (i.e., the game is determined). We prove that adopting the instantaneous reaction semantics allows for modeling any possible reaction time, absorbing de facto previous proposed semantics of dynamic controllability. We provide an encoding into Timed Game Automata to synthesize an execution strategy for any dynamically controllable CTNUD.

However, these two steps may miss a co-optimal solution, leading to unreasonable results. Furthermore, the implementation of eigendecomposition is significantly time-consuming and requires a computational complexity of 0 ( n 3 ) 0(n3) . To address these issues, in this study, we propose a new framework for jointly performing spectral embedding and improving spectral rotation using an anchor-based acceleration strategy. In addition, we replace the spectral rotation term with a more mathematically rigorous form. To effectively solve the proposed model, we iteratively use the generalized power iteration method and the improved version of the coordinate descent method to solve our unified framework directly. Extensive experimental results on real benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art spectral-based methods. The proposed algorithm achieves the best performance on six-eighths of small-scale datasets, five-sixths of large-scale datasets, and three-fourths of high-dimensional datasets, while maintaining superior implementation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In portfolio optimization, we may be dealing with misspecification of a known distribution, that stock returns follow it. The unknown true distribution is considered in terms of a Wasserstein-neighborhood of P to examine the tractable formulations of the portfolio selection problem. This study considers a distributionally robust portfolio optimization problem with an ambiguous stochastic dominance constraint by assuming the unknown distribution of asset returns. The objective is to maximize the worst-case expected return and subject to an ambiguous second-order stochastic dominance constraint. The expected return robustly stochastically dominates the benchmark in the second order over all possible distributions within an ambiguity set. It is also shown that the Wasserstein-moment ambiguity set-based distributionally robust portfolio optimization can be reduced to a semidefinite program and second-order conic programming. We use a cutting plane to solve our second-order stochastic dominance constraint portfolio optimization problem with ambiguity sets based on the Wasserstein metric. Then we decompose this class of distributionally robust portfolio optimization into semi-infinite programming and apply the cutting surface method to solve it. The captured optimization programs are applied to real-life data for more efficient comparison. The problems are examined in depth using the optimal solutions of the optimization programs based on the different setups.},

Under the coupled effect of time-delay and sampling, there is a complex mismatch between the system and the controller modes, which increases the difficulty of quantization rules design. Moreover, the switching of system modes brings challenges to the state reconstruction based on output signals. The purpose of this paper is designing a feedback controller based on a state observer to ensure the exponential convergence and Lyapunov stability of the switched systems . First, a virtual system is introduced to update the observer state to deal with the complex mismatch between the system and controller modes. Second, quantization rules are designed separately relying on the switching situations during the state reconstruction. Last, the upper bound of the system state is obtained by discussing the increasing/decreasing rate of Lyapunov function , and the system stability is guaranteed.

  abstract     = {K-means is a popular clustering method that has consistently failed to produce a balanced cluster structure. While changes in cardinality, variance, and density have arisen due to the importance of balancing in different fields, balancing has never been viewed from a qualitative viewpoint. The current paper takes a new look at cluster balancing by presenting a soft (balance-driven) and hard (balance-constrained) hybrid qualitative balanced clustering (SHHQBC). It starts by identifying and prioritizing key features using a random forest algorithm and the mean decrease in the Gini coefficient criterion. It then uses a weighted linear combination of features with the importance of above 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% to construct a feature called value criterion. The developed clustering approach is then implemented to establish clusters with the highest value with the least cardinality or a value similar to other clusters. By implementing the SHHQBC on 14 different datasets, first soft clustering is implemented for all three cases and balanced conditions are checked. Hard clustering is then performed to make balanced conditions. Finally, the best-balanced case with the least objective function is selected. Formulating the value criterion facilitates the interpretation and labeling of clusters, and quantitative clustering criteria are improved.},

Most existing clustering methods focus on single-view data streams. In this paper, we propose a multi-view representation learning (MVRL) method for multi-view clustering of data streams. We first introduce an integrated representation learning model to learn a fused sparse affinity matrix across multiple views for spectral clustering. Motivated by the optimization procedure of the integrated representation learning model, we propose three consecutive stages: collaborative representation, the construction of individual global affinity matrices using a mapping function, and the calculation of a fused sparse affinity matrix using Euclidean projection. These stages allow the effective capture of the global and local structures of high-dimensional data objects. Moreover, each stage has a closed-form solution, which determines the upper bound of the computational cost and memory consumption. We then employ the construction residuals of the collaborative representation to adaptively update a dynamic set, which is used to preserve the representative data objects. The dynamic set efficiently transfers previously learned useful knowledge to the arriving data objects. Extensive experimental results on multi-view data stream datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MVRL method.},

To explore why these perturbations are visible,four primary factors that affect the perceptibility of human eyes are summarized in this paper. Based on this investigation, we design a multi-factor metric MulFactorLoss for measuring the perceptual loss between benign examples and adversarial examples. To test the imperceptibility of the multi-factor metric, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack that is referred to as GreedyFool. GreedyFool applies differential evolution to evaluate the effects of perturbed pixels on the confidence of a target DNN and introduces greedy approximation to automatically generate adversarial perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFRA-10 datasets and a comprehensive user study with 60 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that MulFactorLoss is a more imperceptible metric than the existing pixelwise metrics, and GreedyFool achieves a 100\% success rate in a black-box manner.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a successful method on graph structured data. Limited by expensive labeled data, contrastive learning has been adopted to the graph domain. In most existing node-level graph contrastive learning methods, when applying contrastive learning to a certain unlabeled node (the center node), its corresponding “similar” node (positive sample) is usually generated by data augmentation . Other nodes in the graph are served as the “dissimilar” nodes (negative samples), which leads to two major problems. First, the computational cost can be prohibitively expensive, especially when the graph is large. Second, utilizing some nodes which share the same label with the center node as the negative samples will damage the learning process. Hence, to address these issues, we explore the feasibility of only sampling a part of nodes for graph contrastive learning process. And unlike the previous self-supervised contrastive methods, we use joint training to exploit supervised signals as much as possible in contrastive learning. Hence, we propose a Negative Samples Selecting Strategy to utilize the classification prediction to guide the selection of the negative samples for sampled nodes. Then, we further incorporate this strategy for performing contrastive learning on graphs and propose a framework named Graph Contrastive Learning with Negative Samples Selecting Strategy (GCNSS). We demonstrate that GCNSS can be trained much faster with much less computation memory than graph contrastive learning baselines, and GCNSS can effectively boost the performance of existing GNN models on semi-supervised node classification tasks across many different datasets.

To cope with this issue, an encryption method called visually meaningful image encryption (VMIE), by which the encrypted image can have visual meaning, is proposed to protect image privacy and visual observability . This visual meaning, however, is unrelated to the original image, which, like traditional encryption, compromises the primitively visual meaning. Motivated by this, we investigate the term ‘visual meaning’ in depth and suggest a new VMIE paradigm, namely, primitively visually meaningful image encryption, as well as accompanying goals. A novel permutation-diffusion architecture is specifically designed to match the paradigm, which can preserve the primitively visual meaning in the encrypted image. Furthermore, the prototype of this paradigm is constructed using a chaotic system and DNA coding. It is then applied to do experiments to demonstrate the superiority of this work.

The state constraint of multi-agent systems is also a great challenge. Based on a backstepping technique and integral barrier Lyapunov functions (iBLFs), all states are constrained, and an adaptive controller is designed. Compared with imposing constraints on the error and then constraining the state, the method in this article compensates for defects in the constraint conditions.

  abstract     = {In the past years, a number of benchmarks have been developed to characterize dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) consisting of a series of static problems over time. The solutions found for a static problem in a previous environment are required to be completely implemented so that the static problems in future environments are independent of the implementation of the solutions in the previous environment. Nevertheless, there is a wide range of real-world DOPs in which the problems in future environments are considerably influenced by the components of the solutions that are not implemented in previous environments, since the optimization for the problem in each environment continuously proceeds while the solutions are continuously implemented until the end of a working day or makespan. This type of DOPs can be termed as an online DOP (OL-DOP). To compensate for the lack of a systematical OL-DOP test suite, in this study we propose a benchmark generator for online dynamic single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems . Specifically, different types of influences of the solutions found in each environment on the problems in the next environment can be adjusted by different types of functions, and the dynamism degree can be tuned by a set of predefined parameters in these functions. Based on the proposed generator, we suggest a test suite consisting of ten continuous OL-DOPs and two discrete OL-DOPs. The empirical results demonstrate that the suggested OL-DOP test suite is characterized by time-deception in comparison with existing DOP benchmark test suites, and is able to analyze the ability of dynamic optimization algorithms in tackling the influence of the solutions found in each environment on the problem in the succeeding environment.},

  abstract     = {Skin lesions and thyroid cancer have become diseases with a high incidence. The computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for dermatological diseases offers one of the most remarkable performance where deep learning technologies demonstrate their superiority in surpassing human experts. For developing a CAD system, a critical step is skin lesions and thyroid nodules diagnosis from dermoscopic images and ultrasound images , respectively. Although notable successes have been obtained using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models, several challenges hamper the practical applications in clinical due to the complexity of clinical data, e.g., skin lesions or thyroid nodules are irregular shapes or low contrast. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel dual encoder-decoder network, called H-Net, for automated thyroid nodule and skin lesion segmentation . Specifically, a shallow CNN is applied at its left to learn the low-level details information called L-Net and a deep CNN is employed at its right to capture the high-level information called R-Net. Furthermore, to transfer information between the L-Net and the R-Net mutually, we propose a novel crossed skip connection strategy , which is a specific reliability skip connection way. In addition, to enhance the representation learning ability of the proposed pipeline, we propose a novel contextual information encoding module, which replaces conventional convolutional layers in H-Net. Meanwhile, we propose a novel hybrid loss to alleviate the imbalance training problem. To validate the effectiveness of H-Net, 600 pairs of dermoscopic images and 139 pairs of ultrasound images have been used for evaluation in experiments. Seven latest biomedical image segmentation approaches are compared, and ten metrics are utilized to evaluate the segmentation performance . Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our H-Net yields the new record, achieving a mIoU value of 84.8\% on the ISIC-2017 dataset and a mIoU value of 87.5\% on the TNUI-2021 dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both visual comparisons and quantitative evaluation . The codes are available at https://github.com/zxg3017/H-Net.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous Knowledge Amalgamation (HKA) algorithms attempt to learn a versatile and lightweight student neural network from multiple pre-trained heterogeneous teachers. They encourage the student not only to produce the same prediction as the teachers but also to imitate each teacher’s features separately in a learned Common Feature Space (CFS) by using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). However, there is no theoretical guarantee of the Out-of-Distribution robustness of teacher models in CFS, which can cause an overlap of feature representations when mapping unknown category samples. Furthermore, global alignment MMD can easily result in a negative transfer without considering class-level alignment and the relationships among all teachers. To overcome these issues, we propose a Dual Discriminative Feature Alignment (DDFA) framework, consisting of a Discriminative Centroid Clustering Strategy (DCCS) and a Joint Group Feature Alignment method (JGFA). DCCS promotes the class-separability of the teachers’ features to alleviate the overlap issue. Meanwhile, JGFA decouples the complex discrepancy among teachers and the student at both category and group levels, extending MMD to align the features discriminatively. We test our model on a list of benchmarks and demonstrate that the learned student is robust and even outperforms its teachers in most cases.},

However, due to essential differences in volatility characteristics among diverse types of non-stationary multivariate time series (NSMTS), it is difficult for traditional methods to maintain robust prediction performance. This study proposes a novel dynamic recurrent neural network to achieve stable and robust prediction performance. First, a multifractal gated recurrent unit (MF-GRU) based on the multifractal method is proposed to extract volatility characteristics. Meanwhile, to strengthen the parameters of the historical hidden layer state that has a more significant impact on the output, a self-attention mechanism is introduced into the MF-GRU, leading to a multifractal gated recurrent unit multi-head self-attention model. The efficiency of the proposed model was verified on public datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), the gated recurrent unit (GRU), and the minimal gated unit (MGU). etc.},

On this basis, considering the supply chain link cycle structure and the coalition restriction caused by the technology, the division of the labor, the politics and the history reasons, this paper adopts the average tree solution to distribute the profit. To illustrate the superiority of the new distribution scheme, a numerical example is given to compare the new scheme with five previous allocation mechanisms. The results show that the new scheme is more practical and more reasonable than the previous ones.

Currently, numerous deep learning-based prediction models have been proposed, often with a biencoder architecture that commonly focuses on how to extract expressive representations for drugs and targets but overlooks modeling explicit drug-target interactions. However, known DTA can provide underlying knowledge about how the drugs interact with targets that is beneficial for predictive accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical graph representation learning model for DTA prediction, named HGRL-DTA. The main contribution of our model is to establish a hierarchical graph learning architecture to integrate the coarse- and fine-level information from an affinity graph and drug/target molecule graphs, respectively, in a well-designed coarse-to-fine manner. In addition, we design a similarity-based representation inference method to infer coarse-level information when it is unavailable for new drugs or targets under the cold start scenario. Comprehensive experimental results under four scenarios across two benchmark datasets indicate that HGRL-DTA outperforms the state-of-the-art models in almost all cases.},

However, scenarios involving multiple data streams are indeed common in practice. They involve several correlated data streams and can be viewed as multi-task data streams. Instead of considering them separately as individual data streams, it is beneficial to leverage the correlations among the multi-task data streams in data stream modeling. In this regard, a novel classification method called double-coupling support vector machines (DC-SVM) is proposed to classify multiple data streams simultaneously, where both the external correlations between multiple data streams and the internal relationships within each individual data stream are considered. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world multi-task data streams show that the proposed method outperforms traditional data stream classification methods.},

Great efforts have been made to solve the small-scale CHPED problem, and there is considerable scope for research in the large-scale CHPED problem with lots of local optima. This paper presents a neighborhood-based differential evolution algorithm with direction induced strategy (NDIDE) to solve the large-scale CHPED problem. In NDIDE, a novel mutation strategy, named neighborhood nonelite direction induced strategy based on DE/rand/1 (DE/ldrand/1), is proposed to explore some untrodden areas of a search space using the direction information of pointing to inferior solutions within a small neighborhood. Such a strategy helps to strengthen the exploitation of some selected neighborhoods. Consequently, a good balance between exploration and exploitation abilities could be achieved. NDIDE is implemented on the CHPED systems with 7, 84, 96 and 192 units. The dispatch schedules obtained from NDIDE are feasible in three large CHPED systems and show the advantages of NDIDE in terms of cost savings and the robustness over the results obtained by three state-of-the-art differential evolution algorithms as well as recent works in this field.},

The ISPM adjusts the reference points by individual-based self-learning, which differs from existing approaches based on fixed reference points. The self-learning reference points are given according to the information from the previous population to divide the Pareto-optimal front (POF) into the objective space as uniformly as possible. One of the ISPM’s advantages is it can improve the influence of the corresponding non-uniform POF for the population’s prediction. Furthermore, it is known that each reference point and the original point can form a vector in the objective space. Each vector can present a subregion in the objective space. The moving direction of each subregion in the last two environments is the reference when improving the population in the new environment to realize local search. Meanwhile, we roughly calculate the change degree of the environment using the self-learning reference point sets at the last two environments to realize the global search. The comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively balance convergence and diversity compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

The production of heterologous proteins is important in different fields, such as medicine, environmental biology, and agriculture. Protein encoding is a difficult task and can be defined as a many-objective optimization problem, where four objectives must be optimized concurrently: codon adaptation, guanine-cytosine content, difference between sequences, and avoidance of hairpin loops. These objectives are why we propose and describe a many-objective approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) for protein encoding. The proposed algorithm was designed to work with novel mutation operators that are problem-aware and consider the different optimization objectives. The results of the proposed algorithm were compared to those of different tools that were reported by other authors to determine its efficiency. Comparisons were made using several quality metrics and with statistical analyses. The average improvements in hypervolume and set coverage were between 5.34\% and 55.75\%, and 53.01\% and 100\%, respectively. Based on the statistical analyses, the proposed algorithm was found to produce statistically significant improvements compared to other algorithms, thus highlighting the relevance of the proposed approach for protein encoding.},

First, TE TE is often used to quantify the pairwise causal direction; yet, in real-world applications, one is always interested in identifying more complex causal relationships , such as indirect causation, common causation, and synergistic effect . Second, the estimation of TE usually relies on probability estimation , which is particularly complicated, or even infeasible for high-dimensional data. In this work, we take TE TE one step further and develop a pair of measures, the matrix-based conditional transfer entropy ( CTE M CTEM ) and the matrix-based high-order transfer entropy ( HTE M HTEM ). The former can detect both indirect and common causation, while the latter can detect synergistic effect . Making use of the recently proposed matrix-based Rényi’s α α -order entropy functional , CTE M CTEM and HTE M HTEM are defined on the eigenspectrum of a normalized Hermitian matrix of the projected data in kernel space, which avoids the necessity of density estimation and the curse of dimensionality . Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our measures in high-dimensional space, and their superiority in recovering complex causal structures for more than two time series.},

  abstract     = {Non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof systems are very useful for statement verification without interaction in cryptography; they entail just one message, called the proof, that convinces the verifier of the truth of the statement without leaking any extra information. Many NIZK proof systems are related to quadratic residuosity languages and follow three main steps. First, the prover and the verifier sample a common reference string (CRS) in some particular form. Second, the prover proves that n is a Blum integer ( BL , n = p 1 t 1 · p 2 t 2 BL,n=p1t1·p2t2 , where p 1 p1 and p 2 p2 are different primes both congruent to 3 modulo 4, and t 1 t1 and t 2 t2 are odd). Third, various statements (e.g., NQR n , OR n , AND n , T ( k , t ) NQRn,ORn,ANDn,T(k,t) , and 3 SAT 3SAT ) can be proven by the prover based on the properties of BL . In this study, we improve the NIZK proof system for n ∈ BL n∈BL based on the special distribution of the square roots modulo n and embed this proof in the third step. Moreover, we show that the CRS can be sampled more efficiently using the improved process.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that integrate niching techniques are among the most effective methods for multimodal optimization problems . However, most algorithmic contributions are based on empirical performance observations rather than rigorous mathematical convergence support; this makes most existing methods parameter sensitive. Inspired by a recently proposed deterministic global optimization method, granular sieving (GrS), an extended global optimization method named collaborative GrS (Co-GrS) and a novel deterministic multi-EA design framework are proposed in this paper. The innovations are threefold. (1) Existing EAs are stochastic methods, and this paper introduces the principle of deterministic global optimization into EA for the first time in the literature. (2) A deterministic multi-EA framework is designed and implemented in the paper; from the perspective of population evolution, an easy-to-operate survival-of-the-fittest strategy based on mathematical principles is established in Co-GrS. (3) Unlike existing stochastic EAs, where the reproducibility of optimal solutions is achieved in a statistical sense, Co-GrS does not involve random parameters, and it automatically runs the algorithm only once with pre-set fixed parameters to find all optimal solutions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our method compared to 16 state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms on the CEC’2013 benchmark suite.},

A resilient model-based hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism (HDETM) is proposed to defend against DoS attacks and reduce communication in sensor-controller-actuator networks. Owing to the introduction of regularization variables, Zeno behavior is naturally excluded, even if there exist disturbances. By using model-based computing, the novel HDETM outperforms the existing event-triggered mechanisms in terms of network utilization and robustness. To model and analyze the proposed HDETM, we propose a novel framework based on hybrid systems, which is different from the traditional discrete-time system framework. Meanwhile, the exponential stability and the L 2 L2 -gain performance of the closed-loop system are guaranteed by utilizing the stability theorems for hybrid systems. In addition to the centralized model-based HDETM, a decentralized HDETM is also provided for large-scale systems which are composed of multiple interconnected subsystems. Finally, two examples are given that verify the improvement of the proposed model-based HDETM.},

However, clustering of the multilayer graph, in which multiple networks divide the graph nodes into categories or communities, is still at a nascent stage. Existing graph-clustering methods are often restricted to exploiting the multiview attributes or multiple networks and ignore more complex and richer network frameworks. Thus, we propose a generic and an effective autoencoder framework for multilayer graph-clustering called a multilayer graph contrastive clustering network (MGCCN). The MGCCN consists of three modules: (1) attention mechanism that is applied to better capture the relevance between nodes and their neighbors for better node embeddings . (2) A contrastive fusion strategy that efficiently explores the consistent information in different networks. (3) A self-supervised component that iteratively strengthens the node embedding and clustering. Extensive experiments on different types of real-world graph data indicate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, this task is also challenging. In recent years, the role of stock relationship information in ranking prediction has been gradually recognized, and the hypergraph has been introduced to analyze the complex group-wise relationships between stocks. However, the application of hypergraph to stock relationship analysis still faces two major issues: unreasonable hyperedge construction and inappropriate aggregation operation in graph convolution that does not conform to the actual market. To solve these problems, we propose an attribute-driven fuzzy hypergraph network (AFHGN). Compared to the traditional hypergraph, AFHGN provides the following advantages: (1) The incidence matrix is constructed via fuzzy clustering to describe the relationships between stocks more reasonably. (2) An attribute-driven gate unit is introduced in the graph convolution to simulate the influence of stocks in the real market. (3) Trend weights are created to enhance the ability of stock embeddings to represent trends. The effectiveness of our algorithm has been verified by conducting a large number of experiments on real data. In addition, the investment simulation proves that our algorithm has better profitability than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.},

It is generally known that the standard model (SM) is more reliable than the ROM. Currently, there are only three CLE schemes with provable security in SM. Unfortunately, all three schemes require pairing operations, enjoy high computation costs, and are not suitable for mobile devices . In this paper, we constructed a new CLE scheme. Compared with other schemes, the new scheme is with two advantages: First, the security proofs of the new scheme are done in SM. Second, the new scheme does not use pairing operation and enjoys higher computation efficiency. Efficiency analysis shows that the computation cost of the new scheme is only 12.4\% of that of the most efficient scheme known, which is suitable for mobile devices .},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) are the optimization problem with multiple conflicting objectives. Generally, an optimization algorithm can find a large number of optimal solutions for MOPs, which easily overwhelm decision makers (DMs) and make it difficult for decision-making. Preference-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) aims to find the partial optima in the regions preferred by the DM. Although it narrows the scope of the optimal solutions, it usually still returns a population of optimal solutions (typically 100 or larger in EMO) with a small distance between adjacent optima. Top-K, which is a well-established research subject in many fields to find the best K K solutions, may be a direction to reduce the number of optimal solutions. In this paper, first, we introduce the top-K notion into preference-based EMO and propose the top-K model to obtain the best K K individuals of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Then, with the top-K model, we propose NSGA-II-TopK and SPEA2-TopK to search for the top-K preferred solutions for preference-based continuous and combinatorial MOPs, respectively. Finally, the proposed algorithms with several representative preference-based EMO algorithms are compared in different preference situations for MOPs. Experimental results show the proposed algorithms have strong performances against the compared algorithms.},

Next, instead of manually adjusting soft labels by LSTime, knowledge distillation for InceptionTime (KDTime) is proposed to automatically generate soft labels by the teacher model while compressing the inference model. Finally, to rectify the incorrectly predicted soft labels from the teacher model, knowledge distillation with calibration for InceptionTime (KDCTime) is proposed, which contains two optional calibrating strategies, i.e., KDC by translating (KDCT) and KDC by reordering (KDCR).

In this case study, Likely Bots (fully automated accounts) and Likely Semi-Bots (partially automated accounts) interacted with the same tendencies as Likely Humans (non-automated users), generating similar virality (information cascades) over time and without compromising the network connectivity. However, Likely Bots particularly stood out as close, visible, and reachable to other users. Likely Semi-Bots attracted particular attention, created proportionally more retweets, and were placed in strategically key positions in the core of the network.

The increase in dimensionality and complexity of data along with superfluous and noisy attributes, results in significant and tricky issues when reasoning data. To address the ineffectiveness of classical attribute reduction within the neighborhood framework, a competent attribute reduction scheme based on a novel concept of nearest mutual neighbor-based personalized information granularity is proposed in this paper. This study comprises three phases. First, we intend to integrate the strategies of personalized radius and two-sided neighbors into the modeling of information granularity , and both personalized and mutual neighborhood rough sets are developed. In the second phase, the concept of the belief function from evidence theory is introduced to construct an adaptive neighborhood information granule with the guidance of the principle of justifiable granularity; in this sense, the search for a justifiable granularity is transformed into an optimization issue. In the third phase, a new neighborhood homogeneous evidence-based attribute significance evaluation is discussed to avoid the inadequacy of voting-based attribute measures. In addition, an enhanced forward greedy algorithm is proposed to address non-monotonic circumstances. For the experimental evaluation, fifteen benchmark data sets, involving six high-dimensional microarray data sets, are chosen to display the performance of the method and algorithm.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose S imilarity A ttributed G raph-embedding E nhancement (SAGE) approach to model similarity-aware semantic connections among entities according to their triplets’ granularity. SAGE is a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding Enhancement (KGEE) method that constructs Entity-relevance -based Similarity-attributed Subgraph (ESS) to remove noise from the underlying data. It propagates interactions-enhanced knowledge over ESS to learn higher-order semantic connections among entities; and simultaneously utilizes feedbacks to enhance the interactions and regularize the model to highlight influential targets (nodes). Further, it samples influential targets in KG, independently move their preferences to the Local Central Nodes (LCN) of current influential areas, and streamline the collected information from all LCN to the main unit. Finally, a prediction module is used to determine generalized preferences for recommendation. We performed extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of SAGE where it outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with significant improvements in effectively providing the desired explainable recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Although deep learning has made great progress in many fields, they are still vulnerable to adversarial examples. Many methods for generating adversarial examples have been proposed, which either contain adversarial perturbation or patch. In this paper, we explore the method that creates compound adversarial examples including both perturbation and patch. We show that fusing two weak attack modes can produce more powerful adversarial examples, where the patch covers only 1\% 1\% of the pixels at random location in the image, and the perturbation changes only by 2/255 in the original pixel value (scale to 0–1). For both targeted attack and untargeted attack, compound attack can improve the generative efficiency of adversarial examples, and can attain higher attack success rate with fewer iteration steps. The compound adversarial examples successfully attack the models with defensive mechanisms that previously can defend perturbation attack or patch attack. Furthermore, the compound adversarial examples show good transferability on normal trained classifiers and adversarial trained classifiers. Experimental results on a series of widely used classifiers and defense models show that the proposed compound adversarial examples have strong robustness, high effectiveness, and good transferability.},

In distributed scenarios, the communication networks that store data are modeled as algebraic graphs and the learning problems are formulated as distributed optimization problems. The FTDDL algorithm persists the universal approximation of the SCN learner. The process of the FTDDL algorithm is divided into two phases, namely “distributed hidden parameters configuration” and “distributed output weights determination”. It has been theoretically proved that the FTDDL algorithm works in distributed manner and achieves the same efficiency as the centralized SCN. According to the FTDDL algorithm, each node over the communication network transmits the updated output weights of the SCN with its direct neighbors. Thus, the FTDDL algorithm preserves data privacy and saves network bandwidth . The FTDDL algorithm is theoretically proved to converge to the global optimal output weights of the SCN within finite time. Compared with the other distributed learning algorithms using SCNs, the FTDDL algorithm can significantly reduce the iteration times . At last, some experiments are shown in Simulations part to verify the effectiveness of the FTDDL algorithm.},

To this end, we propose a decision-support framework for data anonymization, which relies on a novel approach that exploits data correlations, expressed in terms of relaxed functional dependencies ( rfd s) to identify data anonymization strategies providing suitable trade-offs between privacy and data utility. Moreover, we investigate how to generate anonymization strategies that leverage multiple data correlations simultaneously to increase the utility of anonymized datasets. In addition, our framework provides support in the selection of the anonymization strategy to apply by enabling an understanding of the trade-offs between privacy and data utility offered by the obtained strategies. Experiments on real-life datasets show that our approach achieves promising results in terms of data utility while guaranteeing the desired privacy level, and it allows data owners to select anonymization strategies balancing their privacy and data utility requirements.},

  abstract     = {Temporal network data have recently received increasing attention due to the rich information content and valuable insight that appropriate modeling of links’ dynamics can unveil. While most of the literature on temporal network models focuses on binary graphs, each link of a real networks is often associated with a weight, a positive number describing the intensity of the relation between the nodes. Here we propose a novel dynamical model for sparse and weighted temporal networks as a combination of an extension of the fitness model and of the score-driven framework. We consider a zero-augmented generalized linear model to handle the weights and an observation-driven approach to describe time-varying parameters. We propose a flexible approach where the existence probability of a link is independent of its expected weight. This fact represents a crucial difference with alternative specifications proposed in the recent literature, with relevant implications both for the model’s flexibility and for the forecasting capability. Our approach also accommodates the network dynamics’ dependence on external variables. We present a link forecasting analysis to data describing the overnight exposures in the Euro interbank market and investigate whether the influence of EONIA rates on the interbank network dynamics has changed over time during the sovereign debt crisis.},

Heterogeneous evaluation information includes crisp numbers, interval numbers, intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs), trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) and hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs). This paper introduces the fairness concern to calculate the HFL consistency and the HFL inconsistency indices. Based on the framework of LINMAP, a bi-objective HFL programming model is built to derive the criteria weights, the positive ideal fairness vector (PIFV) and the negative ideal fairness vector (NIFV) for each decision maker (DM) simultaneously. Based on the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution), a multi-objective programming model is built to obtain DMs’ weights. The alternatives ranking is derived by comprehensive collective relative closeness degrees. Finally, a real example is applied to verify effectiveness and superiority of this heterogeneous MCGDM method . The proposed heterogeneous MCGDM method provides a very useful approach for MCGDM with heterogeneous information.},

Secondly, we introduce two new types of GNSs which are called co-directed intersection closed and exchangeable. Then we establish the compatible relationships between convex structures (resp. convex matroids) and co-directed intersection closed (resp. exchangeable) GNSs by using matroidal exterior operators and matroidal interior operators as the linkages. Finally, we present axiomatic characterizations of rough approximation operators corresponding to a co-directed intersection closed generalized neighborhood system operator (gns operator) as well as its combinations with serial, reflexive, weak-transitive and weak-unary gns operators.},

Users may input an image and a text as a query and expect the system to retrieve an image. The retrieved image should be close to the users’ desires expressed in the query. Nowadays, digital media generates more than petabytes of imagery data in one day. Moreover, due to the internet, this massive amount of data is readily available to users. However, extracting the desired images from such a colossal databank is a challenging task. Users always prefer to extract an image that reflects their wishful thinking, and the user may desire to alter their visionary thoughts according to their abstract thoughts. For example, Elizabeth wants to have a laptop that is similar to her friend’s laptop. However, she wants to have the same kind of laptop with a built-in GPU and in silver color. So she expects the e-business platform to show a laptop according to her wish. This paper attempts to devise a multi-modal algorithm for such tasks. It takes care of the user’s visual and textual query. It has a query image and text as input and retrieves an image similar to the input image but modified according to the text query. This study focuses on a multi-modal image retrieval system that processes both image and text as input queries. Users can input an image and a text query to modify the image or add more information on it. The text reflects the desired modifications in the image. We proposed a bi-modal image retrieval system named “ DenseBert 4 Ret ” “DenseBert4Ret” that learns image and text features concurrently. As the name indicates, DenseNet and BERT models are used for image and text features extractions, respectively. It is based on deep learning techniques used for the joint representation of image and text features. We trained the model, which forces the input image to be modified according to the user’s textual query. We used deep information learning to train and test our model on three challenging real-world datasets, i.e., MIT States, Fshion200K and FashionIQ. We also show that the proposed model outperforms its predecessor with tuned parameters.},

Evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMT), which can solve several optimization tasks simultaneously using evolutionary algorithms , continues to be a young research field but is growing rapidly. Due to the parallelism of population-based search, the performance of component tasks can be improved through effective knowledge transfer between different tasks. The main challenge in the EMT field is addressing the negative transfer. Aiming to overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an EMT algorithm that transfers effective knowledge through semi-supervised learning. In addition, a semi-supervised classification method is designed based on the cluster assumption, which is part of the geometric basis of semi-supervised learning. By using both labeled and unlabeled samples generated in the optimization process, the proposed method can identify individuals that contain valuable knowledge and select them to transfer the knowledge between tasks. In this way, the performance of the EMT algorithm can be significantly improved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by empirical tests and comparison with two benchmarks. Further, a case study is conducted. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve highly competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art EMT algorithms.},

However, Lloyd’s heuristic sometimes performs poorly in finding the local minimum and is heavily influenced by the initial points. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization method for the K-Means model. First, we establish that the K-Means minimization problem can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem, which can be seen as a unified view of spectral clustering . Then, we relax the constraint of the scaled cluster matrix and implement an improved spectral rotation to bring the cluster matrix infinitely close to the binary indicator matrix . To this end, an efficient and redundancy-free coordinate descent (CD) method is used to optimize the spectral rotation. Extensive experiments including a hybrid test on several different datasets showed that the proposed algorithm achieved better local objective values compared to Lloyd’s heuristic under different initialization strategies (random or K-Means++). In the hybrid test , the proposed algorithm could further decrease the convergence value of the objective function obtained by Lloyd’s heuristic; conversely, Lloyd’s heuristic did not work. Moreover, statistical hypothesis and comparison tests further validated the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

In AMSEPSO, an evolutionary state estimation (ESE) strategy selection framework is proposed based on the SNR distance metric, named ESE-SNR. The appropriate learning strategy is adaptively selected through the ESE-SNR framework. To balances diversity and convergence better, nonlinear acceleration coefficient based on Singer mapping is adopted. Finally, a global best perturbation mechanism is employed to help the population escape from the local optimum. On the CEC2017 benchmarks, comparison with other advanced PSO variants and meta -heuristic algorithms show that AMSEPSO achieves remarkable performance in solving functions with different characteristics, ranking first in the results. The results show that the ESE-SNR framework can effectively evaluate the search state of the population and can greatly save the computational time of the evaluation. The ESE-SNR framework proposed in this paper provides an innovative idea for the development of multistrategy ensemble learning, and the introduction of metric learning into the PSO community helps further promote the organic integration of machine learning and swarm intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Chronic complications refer to defects that initially have a limited impact on chronic patients’ normal lives, but that may accumulate into a major danger if they are not treated in a timely manner. A natural problem is how to take appropriate intervention strategies to prevent chronic patients from developing severe chronic complications. We develop a personalized preventive intervention model (abbreviated as PPIM) to intelligently administer chronic patients’ oral medications across their lifespans based on the reinforcement learning framework. In the developed model, the states include the patient’s medication state and chronic complication status, the actions include medication choice and dosage adjustment, and the reward depends on the patient’s health status after the medical treatment. A state transition matrix is established to formulate the change in the patient’s states and to estimate the reward. The action that maximizes the reward will be chosen. Theoretical analysis proves that PPIM can effectively prevent or delay the progression of chronic complications. Simulations on a dataset of 1429 diabetic patients show that compared with the “one size fits all” intervention strategy, PPIM reduces the five-year incidence rate of Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) by 17.78\% and delays the time to develop DN by 7.38 years on average.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms are widely used to solve multimodal optimization problems . The two main challenges faced while solving MMOPs are locating multiple optimal solutions and improving the accuracy of these solutions. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive algorithm based on differential evolution using the distributed framework in mutation strategy and an elite archive mechanism termed Adaptive Differential Evolution with Archive to deal with these challenges. The following techniques have been proposed and integrated to locate multiple diverse optimal solutions with refined accuracy. Firstly, each individual in the population is treated as a possible exemplar and is expected to reach an optimal value by exploring the nearby search space. The search space is controlled by using an adjustable range mechanism. An adaptive mutation strategy is then used to ensure that all the good solutions or individuals of the population move to better positions. Next, an elite archive is constructed for stagnated individuals to avoid getting stuck in local optimas. The experimental results on the 20 multimodal functions from IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2013 illustrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the existing multimodal optimization algorithms in terms of finding more number of accurate solutions.},

Secondly, we present the concepts of granular-efficient solutions and weakly granular-efficient solutions for optimization problems under an interval type-2 fuzzy setting.

In particular, the considered signed networks are not only allowed to be structurally balanced, but also structurally unbalanced, which are more appropriate descriptions for a class of real-life networks including antagonistic interactions. First, an approach based on augmented digraph is put forward, under which it transforms the initial MAS into an augmented system through an effective parameter selection scheme. Then, the convergence of the developed augmented system is analyzed by calculating the product convergence matrix of infinite sub-stochastic matrices. Finally, the behavior of bipartite containment tracking is performed under the connectivity condition that for each follower there exists a directed path rooted at the leaders in the union of the signed digraphs associated with specified time intervals . The effectiveness of the presented general connectivity condition for bipartite containment tracking performance is illustrated by means of several simulation tests.},

Electronic medical records include extremely confidential and sensitive information, and blockchain technology can enable the safe exchange of these records across various medical organizations. The current blockchain system is susceptible to quantum computer attacks, nevertheless, as a result of the advent of quantum computers. This research designs a novel distributed quantum electronic medical record system and suggests a new private quantum blockchain network based on security considerations. The blocks in this quantum blockchain’s data structure are linked via entangled states. The time stamp is automatically formed by connecting quantum blocks with controlled activities, which lowers the amount of storage space needed. Each block’s hash value is recorded using just one qubit. The quantum information processing is detailed in depth in the quantum electronic medical record protocol. Every medical record can be tracked, and the security and privacy of electronic medical records in Internet of Medical Things systems can be guaranteed. The protocol also ditches the traditional encryption and digital signature algorithms in favor of a quantum authentication system. According to the mathematical analysis, the quantum blockchain network has strong security against attacks from quantum computers since it can withstand External attack, Intercept-Measure-Repeat attack and Entanglement-Measure attack.

However, because of the appearance of the tricky derivative compression coefficients and coupling relation with piecewise constant arguments, the previous Gronwall inequality is not applicable here. Thus, by means of generalized Gronwall inequality and norm inequality techniques, an independent parameters and interdependent variables (IPIV) principle is designed to solve the implicit bivariate transcendental equations to provide the respective supremum of the two interference factors, and the major criteria for guaranteeing the RoGES for NBAM-dp systems are obtained accordingly. Meanwhile, according to the IPIV principle, the relationship between the above two interference factors reflected in the linkage-constraint criteria is ensured to be mutually constrained and dynamically interconnected. Finally, comparative simulations and auxiliary data are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {As the training process of deep neural networks involves expensive computational cost, speeding up the convergence is of great importance. Nesterov’s accelerated gradient (NAG) is one of the most popular accelerated optimizers in the deep learning community, which often exhibits improved convergence performance over gradient descent (GD) in practice. However, theoretical investigations of NAG mainly focus on the convex setting. Since the optimization landscape of the neural network is non-convex, little is known about the convergence and acceleration of NAG. Nowadays, some works make progress towards understanding the convergence of NAG in training over-parameterized neural networks, where the number of the parameters exceeds that of the training instances. Nonetheless, previous studies are limited to the two-layer neural network , which are far from explaining the remarkable success of NAG in optimizing deep neural networks . In this paper, we investigate the convergence of NAG in training two architectures of deep linear networks: deep fully-connected linear neural networks and deep linear ResNets. Based on the over-parameterization regime, we first analyze the residual dynamics induced by the training trajectory of NAG for a deep fully-connected linear neural network under random Gaussian initialization. Our results show that NAG can converge to the global minimum at a ( 1 - O ( 1 / κ ) ) t (1-O(1/κ))t rate when the width is near-linear in the depth of the network, where t is the number of iterations and κ &gt; 1 κ&amp;gt;1 is a constant depending on the condition number of the feature matrix. Compared to the ( 1 - O ( 1 / κ ) ) t (1-O(1/κ))t rate of GD, NAG achieves an acceleration over GD. For deep linear ResNets, we utilize the same analytical approach and obtain a similar convergence result, while the width requirement is independent of the depth. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first theoretical guarantees for the convergence and acceleration of NAG in training deep neural networks. Numerical results show the acceleration of NAG compared to GD in terms of iterations. In addition, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of the depth on the convergence rate of NAG, which validate our derived conditions of the width. We hope our results may shed light on understanding the optimization behavior of NAG for modern deep neural networks.},

  abstract     = {The outsourced distributed database is frequently used to tackle the large amounts of data in various smart city scenarios. The data partition technique is a significant research topic in the outsourced distributed database because it can directly affect the database performance in data exchange and sharing. Multiple objectives, including communication cost, load balance, and data privacy, should be considered during data partition . Previous approaches remain narrow in dealing with one of these objectives. However, the emphasis on any single objective cannot improve the entire performance of the outsourced distributed database. In this paper, a distributed segment-based genetic algorithm (DSGA) is proposed, which can protect data privacy as well as achieve the trade-off between communication cost and load balance. For privacy protection, a digit-based anonymity strategy is proposed based on the characteristic of attributes, which can maintain information integrity and achieve fuzzy identification. After that, a three-layer distributed framework is proposed for the multi-objective optimization to enhance the search efficiency and to achieve the trade-off between communication cost and load balance. Specifically, two segment-based operators, i.e., segment-based recombination and segment-based mutation, are proposed to sufficiently exchange evolutionary information to accelerate the convergence speed and to maintain population diversity to cover the whole multi-objective space, respectively. The performance of the proposed DSGA is verified in terms of solution accuracy and convergence speed. The effect of proposed strategies and operators in DSGA is also confirmed.},

Besides modeling instance-level feature similarity, GPCL explores the underlying semantic structure of the whole data. Specifically, we introduce an instance-prototype contrastive objective to learn representations that are invariant to intra-class variance and discriminative to inter-class variance. Meanwhile, a prototype-prototype contrastive objective is proposed to encourage clustering consistency between instances in the same cluster and their augmentations. To optimize the model, we formulate GPCL as an online Expectation–Maximization framework. We iteratively perform E-step to estimate the posterior probability of prototype assignments through online clustering and M-step to optimize model parameters through graph prototypical contrastive learning . We evaluate GPCL on various graph benchmarks, and the experimental results verify the superiority of our method.},

Further, to solve the derived optimization problem effectively, an improved tabu search algorithm is proposed, in which an appropriate memory function is included to strengthen its adaptability. The improved algorithm is found to have outstanding efficiency when compared to arithmetic software and the genetic algorithm, for both small and large size instances.

  abstract     = {Traditional correlation filter trackers only rely on a search window to localize the object in each frame. However, such approaches are prone to fail in case of e.g.uncertain motion or distractor , where a simple motion model alone is insufficient for robust tracking. To address this problem, we propose a novel tracking architecture that can utilize target-objectness proposals (TOP) effectively. Firstly, we reformulate the Markov Chains Monte Carlo method as a region proposal mechanism from a new perspective. It integrates learning features into the feature space sampling strategy for global object candidates boxes generator. Secondly, to improve the quality of candidates boxes, we constructe objectness labels to guide the sampling process. With the help of objectness information, this interaction of spatial constraints increases the effectiveness of region proposals. In the end, a unified tracking framework is designed to enable sampling and regression strategies to exploit and complement each other to cope with uncertain motion tracking . The proposed TOP tracker performs favorably against advanced trackers, especially in uncertain motion scenarios, on four benchmark datasets including OTB-2013, OTB-2015, Temple Color-128 and UAV-123.},

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020, it has significantly affected the global health system. The use of deep learning technology to automatically segment pneumonia lesions from Computed Tomography (CT) images can greatly reduce the workload of physicians and expand traditional diagnostic methods. However, there are still some challenges to tackle the task, including obtaining high-quality annotations and subtle differences between classes. In the present study, a novel deep neural network based on Resnet architecture is proposed to automatically segment infected areas from CT images. To reduce the annotation cost, a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) branch is added to reconstruct the input images for purpose of regularizing the shared decoder and the latent maps of the VQ-VAE are utilized to further improve the feature representation. Moreover, a novel proportions loss is presented for mitigating class imbalance and enhance the generalization ability of the model. In addition, a semi-supervised mechanism based on adversarial learning to the network has been proposed, which can utilize the information of the trusted region in unlabeled images to further regularize the network. Extensive experiments on the COVID-SemiSeg are performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method, and the results are in line with expectations.},

  abstract     = {The classification efficiency of majority classes for imbalanced data is so concerned in real-world applications. Almost fuzzy neighborhood radius still needs to be manually set and many entropy measures may ignore the boundary region of data, these limitations will result in the poor classification effect. To address these limitations, this paper designs a novel adaptive fuzzy neighborhood-based feature selection method for imbalanced data with adaptive synthetic over-sampling. First, the closeness is defined according to the variance distance between the samples of the minority class, the pair set of neighboring samples is designed, and then an improved adaptive synthetic over-sampling model is presented for constructing balanced decision systems consisting of the synthetic samples and original samples. Second, an adaptive fuzzy neighborhood radius is developed when using the data margins of all homogeneous and heterogeneous samples. Then the adaptive fuzzy neighborhood granule and upper and lower approximations are defined to construct a new FNRS model. Thus, approximate accuracy and roughness are presented to measure the uncertainty from the fuzzy and rough perspectives for imbalanced data. Third, by combining the roughness with adaptive fuzzy neighborhood entropy, adaptive fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy is constructed to evaluate the uncertainty in fuzzy neighborhood decision systems from two viewpoints of algebra and information. Then the reduced set and the significance of the feature are further developed. Finally, this improved adaptive synthetic over-sampling algorithm is designed to aim to build this balanced decision system, and an adaptive fuzzy neighborhood-based feature selection algorithm with the tolerance parameter is developed to achieve an optimal feature subset. Experiments on 26 imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the constructed algorithms compared to the other related algorithms are effective.},

However, current methods tend to use the cost estimated by the optimizer in the database management system (DBMS) to measure the benefits of the index and, due to inaccurate cost estimates, do not bring to the most optimal solution. In addition, existing reinforcement learning methods treat the creation of different indexes as independent actions, ignoring the relationships among indexes, which may bring to unnecessary training costs. To address these problems, we propose DeepIndex, an automatic index selector with a learning-based cost estimator to improve the quality of index selection. To accurately estimate the benefit of an index, we design a learning-based cost estimator to predict the execution time of queries on certain indexes. In particular, we treat query plans as graphs and develop a model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn features from queries and indexes. After that, we design a reinforcement-learning-based index selection model considering the relationships among indexes and combine our cost estimator to select indexes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark workloads JOB and TPC-DS show that our model performs better than state-of-the-art models with the lowest storage costs, and our lowest relative execution cost outperforms the baselines by 38.59\% on JOB and 10.42\% on TPC-DS.},

In subspace clustering, the common method is to use the specific regularization strategy to correct these corrupted data by virtue of the prior knowledge, which could result in a suboptimal clustering solution. To alleviate the problem, we develop a novel formulation named subspace clustering via joint ℓ 1 , 2 ℓ1,2 and ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 (L12-21) norms (SCJL12-21). Specifically, we identify and exclude the heavily corrupted data points (unimportant data points) from participating in the linear representation of other points by imposing the ℓ 1 , 2 ℓ1,2 norm on the representation matrix , and improve the robustness to outliers by enforcing the ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 constraint on the error matrix. The joint ℓ 1 , 2 ℓ1,2 and ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 minimization leads to a good representation matrix which enhances the clustering performance. Related ℓ 1 , 2 ℓ1,2 and ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 norm constrained optimization problem is solved by utilizing the augmented Lagrange multiplier method . The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on the constructed datasets as well as the two practical problems of motion segmentation and face clustering.},

The minimum quasi-clique (or γ γ -clique) partitioning problem (MQCPP) consists in partitioning the vertices of the graph in γ γ -cliques to minimize the number of elements in the partition. In this paper, we formally introduce the minimum quasi-clique partitioning problem, which has not yet been addressed in the literature from an optimization point of view. We show by using a reduction from the unweighted maximum cut problem that even deciding whether a graph can be partitioned into two γ γ -cliques is NP-complete. This result contrasts with that of the clique partitioning problem, whose decision version is polynomially solvable for bipartition. We propose four integer programming formulations and a multi-start greedy randomized heuristic to provide initial feasible solutions for MQCPP. Computational experiments show that two formulations that employ the principles of representatives outperform the others regarding the best-obtained solutions and the number of instances solved optimally within the imposed time limit. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that the instances with medium values of γ γ are more challenging for the proposed formulations than those with larger or lower values.},

This paper presents a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on online prediction of self-evolving fuzzy system (SEFS). In this algorithm, the decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) acts as the static optimizer. When the environment changes, individuals are first put into an associate set of their corresponding weight vectors . Then, the time series of each variable is constructed based on the associate set, and the SEFS online prediction model is established. Finally, an environmental response strategy based on SEFS is designed to quickly generate an initial population with high performance in the new environment.

  abstract     = {Bike traffic prediction is essential to operations management in bike-sharing systems (BSS). The spatio-temporal distribution of shared bikes is imbalanced; therefore, it is necessary to predict the number of bikes that are available at each station to facilitate operations. Many researchers have developed deep neural network methods to improve predictive performance. Predicting bike demand from a higher level by clustering mobility trends has been shown to increase prediction accuracy. However, complex iterative optimization problems need to be solved to stabilize the trend iteration, and such solutions are missing in previous works. In this paper, we propose a novel hyper-clustering approach that enhances a spatio-temporal deep neural network for traffic prediction in bike-sharing systems. In particular, our hyper-clustering approach captures mobility trends among individuals and clusters. Experimental results show that the designed hyper-clustering-enhanced spatio-temporal deep neural network model can predict the number of available bikes more accurately. Compared with ten state-of-the-art benchmark methods, our model demonstrates better performance in reducing prediction error by 10.9\%–43.1\%.},

The previous backdoor attack schemes cannot ensure that the backdoor in the pre-trained network will not be damaged during network transfer. To deal with this issue, we propose a universal robust backdoor attack scheme to injecting the backdoor into the feature maps of the pre-trained network. First, we show that abnormal values have favorable consistency and conductivity in the neural network . By using these properties, attackers can fine-tune the pre-trained network to create a path that can cause the feature maps of backdoor examples at the target layer to exhibit abnormal values. The backdoor injected with our scheme is robust and can cope with the following three challenging network transfer types: (a) the user fine-tunes all the layers. (b) the user retrains some layers of the network from scratch (c) the user adds the new layers for other categories of tasks. Finally, we experimentally verify that our scheme has a favorable attack success rate and is more robust than the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {As the connecting hub of the airport runways and gates, the taxiway plays a very important role in the rational allocation and utilization of the airport resources. In this paper, a multi-strategy particle swarm and ant colony hybrid optimization algorithm, namely MPSACO is proposed to solve the airport runway planning problem and avoid taxiway conflicts and conflict propagation. Firstly, a reasonable mathematical model of airport taxiway planning is constructed. Secondly, the multi-strategy particle swarm optimization algorithm (CWBPSO) is employed to propose a new pheromone initialization approach for ACO . And a new pheromone allocation mechanism is designed and a new pheromone update strategy based on the principle of wolf predation is developed, which are combined to design a new pheromone hybrid strategy to enhance the pheromone influence of the optimal solution, dynamically adjust the search direction, and avoid to decline the best search ability, so as to greatly improve the optimization performance of the algorithm. Finally, an airport taxiway planning approach based on MPSACO is proposed, and a conflict adjustment strategy based on speed priority and the idea of first come and first serve (FCFS) is designed to effectively optimize the airport taxiway path. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm/method, 10 traveling salesman problems (TSP) with different scales and an actual airport taxiway planning problem are selected in here. The experiment results show that the proposed MPSACO can effectively solve TSP and obtain the better optimal solutions, and the proposed airport taxiway planning approach can effectively plan the airport taxiing path, avoid the airport taxiing conflicts, and improve the utilization rate of taxiway resources.},

  abstract     = {For a multi-view learning task, it is crucial to assign appropriate weights to each view in order to learn complementary and consistent information across different views. In the field of multi-view clustering, most existing methods have been able to handle the weights of different views. However, these algorithms face the problem of unacceptable time complexity when dealing with large-scale datasets, and the learned similarity matrix fails to satisfy the graph regularization . In this paper, we propose an auto-weight learning method called multi-view clustering with graph regularized optimal transport. First, an anchor-based method is employed to overcome the problem of heavy time complexity when processing large-scale datasets, and it is able to automatically learn an appropriate weight for each view. Second, by introducing optimal transport we learn a regularized doubly-stochastic similarity matrix applicable to multi-view clustering tasks . Third, the optimal regularized anchor graph can be classified into specific clusters by adding a rank constraint. Finally, an effective optimization method is designed to optimize the formulated problem. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-arts algorithms.},

A variety of methods have been developed to address this problem based on different information in the time series.

The similarity between nodes is measured by the topological structure information based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The information from top- φ φ most similar nodes is considered to determine the final predicted value with the weighting coefficient obtained by the Gaussian membership function.

  abstract     = {Age estimation is a fundamental task in forensic anthropology for both the living and the dead. The procedure consists of analyzing properties such as appearance, ossification patterns, and morphology in different skeletonized remains. The pubic symphysis is extensively used to assess adults’ age-at-death due to its reliability. Nevertheless, most methods currently used for skeleton-based age estimation are carried out manually, even though their automation has the potential to lead to a considerable improvement in terms of economic resources, effectiveness, and execution time. In particular, explainable machine learning emerges as a promising means of addressing this challenge by engaging forensic experts to refine and audit the extracted knowledge and discover unknown patterns hidden in the complex and uncertain available data. In this contribution we address the automation of the decision making process of Todd’s pioneering age assessment method to assist the forensic practitioner in its application. To do so, we make use of the pubic bone data base available at the Physical Anthropology lab of the University of Granada. The machine learning task is significantly complex as it becomes an imbalanced ordinal classification problem with a small sample size and a high dimension . We tackle it with the combination of an ordinal classification method and oversampling techniques through an extensive experimental setup. Two forensic anthropologists refine and validate the derived rule base according to their own expertise and the knowledge available in the area. The resulting automatic system, finally composed of 34 interpretable rules, outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy. In addition, and more importantly, it allows the forensic experts to uncover novel and interesting insights about how Todd’s method works, in particular, and the guidelines to estimate age-at-death from pubic symphysis characteristics, generally.},

  abstract     = {The imbalanced data problem exists in many real-world datasets. Neural networks are one popular method for classifying imbalanced data . However, data imbalance often negatively affects neural networks. This problem is exacerbated when data are highly imbalanced. Existing neural network approaches for handling this problem heavily rely on rebalancing or reweighting known data. Essentially, these strategies focus on recovering the characteristics of balanced data. However, due to the serious lack of positive samples, the problem of insufficient empirical representation has not been thoroughly considered. Therefore, to solve the problem of highly imbalanced data, we explore the characteristics of the gradient norm in gradient descent optimization. We find that the key indicator of balanced data is that the gradient norms of positive and negative classes are approximately equal. Specifically, neural networks can classify known data that is highly imbalanced by considering the unit gradient direction of positive and negative classes. Furthermore, a local boundary expansion strategy is considered to alleviate the insufficient empirical representation problem of the positive class. Here, we propose a controllable gradient rotation strategy to realize local boundary expansion for positive samples. We validate the proposed approach on 34 highly imbalanced datasets and two synthetic datasets , and the proposed method exhibits impressive performance.},

In the design process, neural networks are used to approximate the nonlinear function existing in the system, and the upper bounds for the approximation error and the external disturbance together form an adaptive law with one parameter to achieve the asymptotic tracking performance. Additionally, the problem of “explosion of complexity” is avoided by utilizing the command-filtered technique in the backstepping framework. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat’s lemma, this developed scheme guarantees that the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero.

However, in realistic cases, unlabeled data may worsen performance because they contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data that differ from the labeled data. To address this issue, safe semi-supervised deep learning has recently been presented. This study suggests a new safe semi-supervised algorithm that uses an uncertainty-aware Bayesian neural network . Our proposed method, safe uncertainty-based consistency training (SafeUC), uses Bayesian uncertainty to minimize the harmful effects caused by unlabeled OOD examples. The proposed method improves the model’s generalization performance by regularizing the network for consistency against uncertain noise. Moreover, to avoid uncertain prediction results, the proposed method includes a practical inference tip based on a well-calibrated uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in the experimental results on CIFAR-10 and SVHN by showing that it achieved state-of-the-art performance for all semi-supervised learning tasks with OOD data presence rates.},

Since there is not a proper formal definition of anomaly, different algorithms have arised to cope with the different variations of this idea, like novelty detection or outlier detection. Some of these algorithms have traditionally relied on prior knowledge on the data domain, or some degree of supervised learning in order to detect the irregular samples. In this work we propose a simulation based algorithm to detect those observations, based on gravitational forces, that requires not prior knowledge nor data labels to identify spurious observations. We do so by studying different generalizations of the aggregation of gravitational forces, and the resulting clusters obtained when the particles attract each other. We also compare our algorithm with other unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, obtaining favourable results to our proposal.},

The focus of large-scale group decision-making is how to objectively and reasonably generate a collective opinion accepted by most decision makers. To this end, this study investigates a novel consensus model with no threshold based on social networks. In the model, inspired by the “similarity-attraction paradigm” in psychology, we first propose a novel adjustment method for the trust degree between decision makers. A clustering method that depends on the similarity-trust score between decision makers is presented to reduce the complexity of decision-making. In the consensus reaching process, we provide an approach to managing the overconfident or unconfident behaviour of decision makers. Moreover, the social network DeGroot model is used to adjust the preferences of decision makers in the feedback mechanism. In addition, we design an objective condition to terminate the consensus reaching process. Based on this, the no threshold consensus model is established, which makes the decision results more rational and scientific. Finally, the applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated by an illustrative example. Simulation experiments and comparative analysis illustrate the validity of the proposed model in promoting consensus reaching.},

Moreover, a diversity maintenance method is designed to maintain the diversity of solutions in each task. Finally, the selection strategy of transferred solutions is put forward to find valuable solutions with good diversity, which can improve the efficiency of positive knowledge transfer. Experiments on two MTO test suites and a real-world case demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and competitive.},

The DETCA is introduced to adjust the amount of data transmission in the network based on variation of the tracking error while keeping the tracking performance of the system. Stochastic cyber-attacks such as the denial-of-service and deception attacks are assumed to be encountered during the signal transmitted in the network. A sufficient condition to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the tracking error system is achieved with the Lyapunov stability theory . The tracking controller gain and the event-triggering parameter are co-designed by solving a linear matrix inequality.

It is composed of large numbers of decision makers, several continuous periods, alternative set and attribute set changed with time. Given the characteristics implicited in decision-making elements and the advantages of probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) in modelling uncertainty and complexity of decision makers’ subjective opinions, this paper constructs a probabilistic linguistic DLMAGDM method. First of all, a dynamic weight determination model based on trust relationships and evidential conflicts between decision makers is proposed to obtain current dynamic weights of decision makers. Then, a comprehensive hierarchical clustering method that divides large numbers of decision makers into several subgroups is constructed based on three clustering constrains. Moreover, some probabilistic linguistic extended evidential power aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate PLTSs. These operators can appropriately handle the extreme PLTSs and fully consider the role of incomplete probabilistic distributions in PLTSs. In addition, a dynamic decision-making method based on PROMETHEE is developed to determine the final priority order of alternatives according to preferences between alternatives over several periods. Lastly, a case study for supply chain finance risk assessment for several firms in Chinese household appliance industry is utilized to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the probabilistic linguistic DLMAGDM method. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with some other existing methods and the sensitivity analysis are made to verify its advantages.},

The existing tracking control schemes for nonlinear systems with backlash-like hysteresis inputs may have singularity problems, and it is difficult to obtain a high-precision tracking effect. To resolve the above issues, a novel adaptive asymptotic tracking control strategy is proposed for multi-input and multi-output nonlinear systems with unknown backlash-like hysteresis inputs, where the dependence on the system model is removed through fuzzy logic systems and elaborately designed adaptive laws. In contrast, the proposed tracking control scheme is free of any singularity problem, and the constructed controllers and adaptive laws including positive and continuous functions with zero limit make the output tracking error asymptotically converge to zero rather than near the origin. Moreover, this asymptotic convergence is proven by rigorous theoretical analysis. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracking control scheme are also verified by numerical and practical simulations.},

  abstract     = {The maximal flow problems (MFPs) are among the most significant optimization problems in network flow theory with widespread and diverse applications. To represent qualitative aspects of uncertainty in the maximal flow model, which asks for the largest amount of flow transported from one vertex to another, the use of linguistic variables has effective means for experts in expressing their views. In this paper, we first define trapezoidal Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (TrPFNs) along with some new arithmetic operations which cover the gaps in previously defined operations. For defuzzification of TrPFNs, we introduce a ranking procedure based on value and ambiguity indices. This work puts forward a theoretical framework for a new Pythagorean fuzzy maximal flow algorithm (PFMFA), which helps to solve different optimization problems with PF information by considering linguistic capacities and flows. The implementation of the algorithm is elaborated by considering two case studies. Firstly, we examine the maximum flow of a water distribution pipeline network in Pyigyitagon Township, Mandalay, Myanmar. Secondly, we compute maximum PF power flow in a 14-bus electricity network provided by the IEEE working group, concerning the example data from the University of Washington. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed method and give a detailed analysis of flow connected with several practical performances. In addition, the Pythagorean fuzzy optimal flows corresponding to each network arc are compared and performance comparison of our method is investigated which shows the increasing and decreasing trends of backward and forward arcs of the network, respectively. Moreover, the runtime analysis of existing well-known maximal flow algorithms is provided. Finally, we present the advantages of our technique to promote its cogency.},

  abstract     = {In real business platforms, recommendation systems usually need to predict the CTR of multiple business. Since different scenarios may have common feature interactions, knowledge transferring based methods are often used by re-optimizing the pre-trained CTR model from source scenarios to a new target domain. In addition to knowledge transfer, it is noteworthy that generalizing target domain data outside of the CTR model accurately is also important when re-training all of the fine-tuned parameters. Generally, the pre-trained model trained on large source domains can represent the characteristics of different instances and capture typical feature interactions. It would be useful to directly reuse fine-tuned parameters from source domains to serve the target domain. However, different instances of the target domain may need different amounts of source information to fine-tune the model parameters, and these decisions of freezing or re-optimizing model parameters, which highly depend on the fine-tuned model and target instances, may require much manual effort. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end transfer learning framework with fine-tuned parameters for CTR prediction, called Automatic Fine-Tuning (AutoFT). The principal component of AutoFT is a set of learnable transfer policies that independently determine how the specific instance-based fine-tuning policies should be trained, which decide the routing in the embedding representations and the high-order feature representations layer by layer in deep CTR model. Extensive tests on two benchmarks and one real commercial recommender system deployed in Huawei&#39;s App Store show that AutoFT can greatly increase CTR prediction performance when compared to current transferring methodologies.},

  abstract     = {The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), as an important logistic problem, has been widely investigated in recent decades. However, it is still a great challenge for most existing approaches to solve multiobjective VRPTWs (MOVRPTWs) with many conflicting objectives. In this study, a hybrid evolutionary multitask algorithm, termed HEMT, is proposed to address MOVRPTWs under the framework of evolutionary multitasking, where multiple MOVRPTWs are optimized simultaneously by leveraging the similarity between them. In particular, HEMT is characterized by three aspects: (1) an exploration stage with knowledge transfer (ESKT) is designed to globally explore the search space by transferring knowledge across different MOVRPTWs; (2) an exploitation stage with knowledge reuse (ESKR) is employed to further promote the quality of solutions by conducting local searches and reusing problem-specific knowledge; and (3) a tradeoff mechanism (TOM) is suggested to adaptively switch the search between ESKT and ESKR. Furthermore, to verify the efficacy of the proposed HEMT, four suites of new multitasking instances are generated based on 45 real-world MOVRPTW benchmarks under different multitask environments. The experimental results show that HEMT not only effectively solves multiple MOVRPTWs simultaneously but also achieves better performances than the traditional single-task counterparts.},

Due to the risk of private user information being leaked during the machine learning application process, the widespread application and development of IoMT applications are hampered. Encrypting data is a good way to protect user privacy. However, given the participants’ limited resources, processing and analyzing ciphertext data presents a significant challenge. As a result, this paper proposes a secure and efficient assisted decision-making scheme (SEMMI) that is appropriate for the IoMT applications. SEMMI performs a thorough analysis of each participant’s resource constraints, divides the data circulation process into four stages, and constructs a data circulation and ciphertext calculation protocol. Data transmission security is ensured through the use of stream encryption and homomorphic encryption . Each participant sends the ciphertext to the cloud, and the cloud calculates the ciphertext data, effectively relieving each participant’s computational load. The security of the final result is guaranteed by matching the result with pre-decryption. The scheme’s security and efficiency are demonstrated experimentally. The results indicate that the accuracy loss of each data set under the ciphertext is no more than 3\% at most and that the cloud performs most of the calculations for each participant. Finally, SEMMI is applied to the FedAvg algorithm, demonstrating the scheme’s universality.},

Models are trained until near-convergence on the updated hyperparameters and the parameters of the best performing model are shared to warm start the other models in the next hyperparameter tuning iteration. In the PBT-UOA, all models are trained using the same dataset. This framework performed better than the Bayesian Optimisation algorithm. This paper also introduces the Ulimisana Optimisation Algorithm enabled Federated Learning (FL-UOA) framework which is an extension of the PBT-UOA. This framework is introduced to address the challenges of scattered datasets and privacy that is presented by the increase in connected end-devices. The FL-UOA learns on local data in scattered end-devices without sending datasets to a central server. The training datasets in local end-devices are used to evaluate models trained in other end-devices. The performance metrics are used to update the Social Trust Network (STN) of the FL-UOA framework. The FL-UOA outperformed the classic Federated Learning framework. This STN updating technique was tested in Machine Learning (ML) Unfairness to see how well it functioned as a regularisation term. This was achieved by training different models on subsets that contained datasets representing only specific sensitive groups. Results showed that by updating the hyperparameters while learning the parameters on the dataset scattered across different devices, the FL-UOA, takes advantage of diversified learning and reduces the ML Unfairness for models trained on group specific datasets.},

However, the fusion of unquantized analog quantity and quantized digital quantity is more common in engineering, but has received minimal attention. Given the characteristics of the ER rule, the biggest challenge imposed by this fusion is to consider the reliability of digital quantity reasonably. In this paper, a new fusion approach of digital and analog quantity based on the ER rule is proposed. In order to improve the fusion accuracy, the combination of quantization error and external noise is adopted to measure the reliability of digital quantity. On this basis, the digital and analog quantities are fused together according to the ER rule. To further explore the intrinsic mechanism of the proposed approach, a detailed performance analysis is conducted to study the variation law of evidence reliability and fusion results. Finally, a numerical example and a case study are intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {With the development of data acquisition technology, high-dimensional data clustering is an important yet challenging task in data mining . Despite advances achieved by current clustering methods , they can be further improved. First, many of them usually unfold the high-dimensional data into a large matrix, consequently resulting in destroying the intrinsic structural property. Second, some methods assume that the noise in the dataset conforms to a predefined distribution (e.g., the Gaussian or Laplacian distribution), which violates real-world applications and eventually decreases the clustering performance. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel tensor dictionary learning method for clustering high-dimensional data with the coexistence of structure noise. We adopt tensors, the natural and powerful tools for the generalizations of vectors and matrices, to characterize high-dimensional data. Meanwhile, to depict the noise accurately, we decompose the observed data into clean data, structure noise, and Gaussian noise . Furthermore, we use low-rank tensor modeling to characterize the inherent correlations of clean data and adopt tensor dictionary learning to adaptively and accurately describe the structure noise instead of using the predefined distribution. We design the proximal alternating minimization algorithm to solve the proposed model with the theoretical convergence guarantee. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods for high-dimensional data clustering.},

Many variants of such systems have interesting computational properties, usually assuming that their basic elements, spikes, are propagated from one neuron to other neuron(s) in a broadcast way, sending copies to all postsynaptic neurons at the same time. By removing such a mechanism of duplication, we propose a new class of these systems: SN P systems without duplication (SNP-WOD systems), in which only one of the postsynaptic neurons can get the spikes produced when the origin neuron fires . To keep the necessary number of spikes present in the system during computation, the amplification of pulses during the firing of spiking rules is allowed, to produce a number exceeding that consumed. To control the flow direction of spikes, channel labels are introduced to mark different synapses. SNP-WOD systems are proved to be universal in the generation of numbers. A small universal SNP-WOD system is built using 25 neurons for computing functions.},

  abstract     = {The approximation inaccuracy of the value function in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms unavoidably leads to an overestimation phenomenon, which has negative effects on the convergence of the algorithms. To limit the negative effects of the approximation error, we propose error controlled actor-critic (ECAC) which ensures the approximation error is limited within the value function. We present an investigation of how approximation inaccuracy can impair the optimization process of actor-critic approaches. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the approximation error of the Q function approximator and discover that the error can be reduced by limiting the KL- divergence between every two consecutive policies during policy training. Experiments on a variety of continuous control tasks demonstrate that the proposed actor-critic approach decreases approximation error and outperforms previous model-free RL algorithms by a significant margin.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews play an important role in consumers’ purchasing decisions. However, many online reviews confuse consumers when they wish to make a purchase but lack experience. To solve the problem of product ranking based on online reviews, two important issues must be addressed: sentiment analysis and product ranking based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated MCDM method for product ranking through online reviews based on evidential reasoning (ER) theory and stochastic dominance (SD) rules. First, online reviews are preprocessed to obtain product attributes and weight values. Then, we use naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) for the sentiment analysis of online reviews, and the results of the three classifiers are aggregated using ER theory. In addition, according to the confidence distribution matrix of sentiment orientations, SD rules are used to determine the stochastic dominance relations between pairwise alternatives for each attribute. Furthermore, we use the stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA)-PROMETHEE method to obtain the final product ranking results and conduct sensitivity analysis. Finally, a case study on ranking computer products from JD Mall through online reviews is provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.},

With the development of smartphones, crowdsensing-based urban environmental monitoring systems have become a promising research topic. In this system, because the distribution of participants is uneven, a lack of measured data will exist in the times and locations where there are no participants. These missing data need to be inferred. However, the existing inference algorithms do not consider GPS location errors and outlier data . To solve these problems, a grid distance-based tensor completion missing data inference algorithm considering the local outlier factor (LOF) and GPS location error processing is proposed, called the LGGDTC algorithm. In the algorithm, the LOF is used to detect and eliminate the outlier data . On this basis, the probabilities that each environmental data may be collected in different locations are calculated, and then the environmental data of each location are calculated. Then, the similarity distance between two different locations is calculated by the geographic and feature distance, and the objective function is constructed. Finally, the block coordinate descent method is used to obtain the solution of the objective function. The simulation results show that the LGGDTC algorithm can obtain good performance.},

However, label ambiguity in the case of label imbalance has not been well solved. In this paper, a novel label imbalance-aware algorithm named PL-LIMAP is proposed to effectively solve this problem. Firstly, a partial manifold constrained low-rank representation method is proposed to learn the instance affinity matrix , which can identify instances with the same label by fully mining the manifold structure of the data. Moreover, for making full use of the information hidden in candidate labels, the Jaccard distance is introduced to measure the similarity between candidate labels to obtain the label affinity matrix . The combination of these two affinity matrices can achieve the purpose of disambiguation through complementary information. Meanwhile, aiming to determine the imbalance of ambiguous labels, specialized measures are proposed to evaluate the imbalance level in PLL. According to the imbalance level of different labels, an alternative weighting scheme is proposed to mitigate the imbalance of ambiguous labels. As a consequence, the ground-truth label of an instance can be found out even though its label information is not available in advance. Experiments reveal the overwhelming performances of PL-LIMAP.},

Manually tuning these parameters of the mechanism model may even result in worse performance. To resolve this problem, an advanced randomized learner model, termed stochastic configuration network (SCN), is employed to build a data-driven prediction model which can be trained by using a dataset collected from a real-world hot-rolling production site. Based on the rolling theory and gray relational analysis (GRA), 36 features are selected as the inputs of the prediction model.

Nevertheless, almost all of the existing HABE schemes are in the ciphertext-policy setting and do not support non-monotonic access structures. In this work, we propose the first key-policy hierarchical-authority ABE with non-monotonic access structures, dubbed KP-HABE-NMaCS, which supports the authority key delegation, constant size ciphertexts and the large universe simultaneously. We further define the security model of KP-HABE-NMaCS and prove the selective security of it in the standard model. Then we optimize our scheme to realize the outsourced decryption. Subsequently, we present the detailed theoretical analysis of our constructions and the existing HABE constructions in computation and storage costs, and meanwhile implement ours and conduct a series of experiments. Both results indicate that our KP-HABE-NMaCS construction makes improvements in expressiveness and features, and achieves efficiency comparable to the previous HABE constructions. Furthermore, they also show that our extension construction is suitable for resource-limited applications. Eventually, we explore how to apply our KP-HABE-NMaCS to build an ABE with equality test and time-based authorization.},

In this paper, we investigate the concepts of feature relevance, redundancy, and complementarity based on fuzzy information-theoretic measures to address continuous features. More specifically, we examine some fuzzy information-theoretic measures for any finite number of fuzzy T -equivalence relations. From a conceptual point of view, we present theoretical definitions of feature relevance, redundancy, and complementarity by using these fuzzy information-theoretic measures. According to these theoretical definitions, we introduce a computationally effective feature evaluation criterion that employs a weighting scheme to combine feature relevance, redundancy, and complementarity. We propose a feature selection algorithm by combining the feature evaluation criterion with the sequential forward search strategy. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we compare it with some state-of-the-art feature selection methods through extensive experiments.

The proposed algorithm comprises three main modules: feature and cutting point-selection, node fuzzy splitting, and cluster merging. The first two modules are repeated to generate an initial unsupervised decision tree, and the final module is designed to combine similar leaf nodes to form the final compact clustering model. Our algorithm optimizes an internal clustering validation metric to automatically determine the number of clusters without their initial positions.

However, the influence weights among different road sections are usually distinct in real life and are difficult to analyze manually. The traditional GCN mechanism, which relies on a manually set adjacency matrix , is unable to dynamically learn such spatial patterns during training. To address this drawback, this study proposes a novel location graph convolutional network (location-GCN). The location-GCN solves this problem by adding a new learnable matrix to the GCN mechanism, using the absolute value of this matrix to represent the distinct influence levels among different nodes. Subsequently, long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed in the proposed traffic prediction model. Moreover, trigonometric function encoding was used in this study to enable the short-term input sequence to convey long-term periodic information. Finally, the proposed model was compared with the baseline models and evaluated on two real-world traffic flow datasets.

However, the definitions of NRS are so strict that most algorithms based on NRS perform poorly on datasets with label noise. Existing classifiers mainly learn using the most fine-grained unit, that is, the sample or pixel point; thus, they have limited robustness to label noise. Moreover, few models can deal with both attribute reduction and classification with label noise. Granular-ball computing (GBC) is a novel granular computing model with a significant advantage in terms of robustness. Inspired by GBC, a robust variable parameter granular-ball model (VPGB) is proposed in this study to achieve both attribute reduction and classification in a label noise environment from a coarse granularity perspective. In VPGB attribute reduction, first, the related notions of NRS are defined for the label noise environment. Second, the universe is granulated into granular-balls of the same size (called FGBs), with the centers and radii being fixed. Third, attribute reduction is performed based on the FGBs. In VPGB classification , the universe is granulated into adaptive granular-balls of different sizes (called AGBs), with adaptive centers and radii. Then, the test samples are predicted based on the distance between the test samples and AGBs.

It is shown that the proposed improved GNN (IGNN) method has finite-time convergence when it is applied to time-varying LEs, even if there are bounded additive time-varying noises. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy and advantages of the proposed method over the existing GNN methods and other dynamic neural network methods for time-varying LEs solving.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the recent success of self-supervised methods applied on images, self-supervised learning on graph structured data has seen rapid growth especially centered on augmentation-based contrastive methods. However, these methods pay little attention to the inherent distinction between images and graphs: while augmentation is well defined on images, it may behave arbitrarily on graphs. That is, without carefully designed augmentation techniques, augmentations on graphs may behave arbitrarily in that the underlying semantics of graphs can drastically change. As a consequence, the performance of existing augmentation-based methods is highly dependent on the choice of augmentation scheme, i.e., hyperparameters associated with augmentations. In this paper, we propose a novel augmentation-free self-supervised learning method for graphs, named AFGRL , which learns graph representations without using any arbitrary augmentation scheme. Specifically, we generate an alternative view of a graph by discovering nodes that share the local structural information and the global semantics within the graph. Extensive experiments toward various node-level tasks (i.e., node classification , clustering, and similarity search) and graph-level tasks (i.e. graph classification) on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AFGRL .},

  abstract     = {The attention mechanism is usually equipped with a few-shot learning framework and plays a key role in extracting the semantic object(s). However, most attention networks in existing few-shot learning algorithms often work on the channel and/or pixel dimension, leading to the size of attention maps being large. Due to lack of training examples, these attention networks are prone to over-fitting, and may fail to find the semantic target(s). In this paper, we split the original image into patches, extending a new dimension in image data, namely, the patch dimension. On the one hand, the number of patch dimensions is usually much smaller than the traditional three dimensions , thus greatly reducing the number of attention module parameters. On the other hand, the patch dimensional attention mechanism can benefit from multi-instance learning and achieve a good compromise between global and local features . Four comparison experiments on four typical real-world data sets (miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, Fewshot-CIFAR100, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200–2011) have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm achieves consistent improvement over 6 baseline models (Matching Networks, Relation Networks, Prototypical Networks, MAML, Baseline++, Meta Baseline) and 11 state-of-the-art models (DC, TapNet, SNAIL, TADAM, MetaOptNet, CAN, CTM, DCEM, AFHN, LEO, AWGIM).

  abstract     = {This paper presents Adaptive Batch-ParEGO, an adaptive batch Bayesian optimization method for expensive multi-objective problems. This method extends the classical multi-objective Bayesian optimization method, sequential ParEGO , to the batch mode. Specifically, the proposed method exploits a newly proposed bi-objective acquisition function to recommend and evaluate multiple solutions. The bi-objective acquisition function takes exploitation and exploration as two optimization objectives , which are traded off by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm . Since there’s usually a certain number of limited hardware resources available in reality, we further propose an adaptive solution selection criterion to fix the number of candidate solutions in each iteration. This strategy dynamically balances exploitation and exploration by tuning the hyper-parameter in the exploitation-exploration fitness function. In addition, the expected improvement is exploited to select another candidate solution to ensure convergence and make the algorithm more robust. We verify the effectiveness of Adaptive Batch-ParEGO on three multi-objective benchmarks and a hyperparameter tuning task of neural networks compared with the state-of-the-art multi-objective approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that the bi-objective acquisition function with the adaptive recommendation strategy can balance exploitation and exploration well in batch mode for expensive multi-objective problems.

  abstract     = {The performance of face recognition methods predominantly depends on the quality of facial images . Therefore, by filtering low-quality facial images , face recognizers can be effectively implemented. Moreover, the factors causing degradation in the quality of facial images include the face acquisition environment (e.g., illumination, motion blur , and resolution) and facial characteristics (e.g., pose and occlusion). Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel two-stage unsupervised facial image quality measure (TUFIQM) algorithm to evaluate the degradations caused by the acquisition environment and face factors. The proposed TUFIQM consists of an environmental degradation estimation module (EDEM) and a face factor degradation measurement module (FFDMM). Specifically, the EDEM introduces meta-learning to learn prior knowledge from the subjective quality assessment of natural scene images; subsequently, it employs the acquired prior knowledge to estimate the face quality degradation caused by the face acquisition environment. The design principle of the EDEM is based on the similar effect demonstrated by the acquisition environment on the quality of facial and natural scene images. Considering that face factor degradation leads to loss of highly identifiable high-frequency facial features , the FFDMM quantifies the amount of high-frequency information in visible face areas to represent the degradation in quality due to varying facial factors. The EDEM and FFDMM were combined in this study to achieve the proposed TUFIQM. Experiments on public datasets showed that the proposed TUFIQM algorithm is better than other state-of-the-art image quality measurement methods devised for natural scene and facial images.},

Although important information about customers’ habits can be revealed by HAUIs, they can expose sensitive information . To address this concern, the problem of hiding frequent HAUIs (FHAUIs) is studied, which is to modify a transaction database to ensure that sensitive FHAUIs cannot be discovered. An algorithm is designed, named H-FHAUI, which relies on an extended border approach based on the support (occurrence frequency) and the average-utility of itemsets. Moreover, to hide all FHAUIs, H-FHAUI utilizes a novel extended lower border named B d E - BdE- based on weak upper bounds on the average-utility to only hide a small number of FHAUIs. Then, all remaining FHAUIs are also hidden. Besides, H-FHAUI utilizes a novel weight-based strategy named ICS ICS to choose items and transactions to be modified, a novel TIU-VIU structure to quickly update weak upper bounds, and a strategy named D U S WUB DUSWUB to quickly hide FHAUIs while ensuring that the total utility of D D is preserved as much as possible.

For the first way, necessary and sufficient conditions for a fuzzy implication to be a complement of a given family of fuzzy implications such that the ordinal sum is a fuzzy implication are provided, which generalize some results of fuzzy implications on the real unit interval.

This work investigates the effect of noises in multi-agent environments and proposes a multi-agent actor-critic with collaboration (MACC) model. The model uses lightweight communication to overcome the interference from noises. There are two policies for each agent in MACC: collaboration policy and behavior policy. The behavior of an agent not only depends on its own state but also be influenced by each other agent through a scalar, collaboration value. The collaboration value is generated by the collaboration policy for each individual agent, and it ensures a succinct consensus about the environment. This paper elaborates on the training of the collaboration policy and specifies how it coordinates the behavior policy in a manner of temporal abstraction mechanism, while the observation sequence is considered for more accurate perception. Several experiments on multi-agent collaboration simulation platforms demonstrate that the MACC performs better than baselines in noisy environments, especially in partially observable environments.},

However, there is no doubt that these algorithms are suboptimal in maintaining the relationships between high-dimensional data spaces. To overcome this problem, this paper advances a new weakly supervised discrete discriminant hashing (WDDH) to ensure a more effective representation of data and better retrieval of information. First, we consider the nearest neighbour relationship between samples, and new neighbourhood graphs are constructed to describe the geometric relationship between samples. Second, the algorithm embeds the learning of the hash function into the model and optimises the hash codes by a one-step iterative updating algorithm. Finally, it is compared with the existing classical unsupervised hashing algorithm and supervised hashing algorithm on different databases. The results and discussion of the experiments clearly show that the proposed WDDH algorithm in this paper is more robust for data representation in learning low-quality label data, coarse-grained label data and noisy data.},

  abstract     = {Robot control tasks are typically solved by reinforcement learning approaches in a circular way of trial and learn. A recent trend of the research on robotic reinforcement learning is the employment of the deep learning methods. Existing deep learning methods achieve the control by training the approximation models of the dynamic function, value function or the policy function in the control algorithms. However, these methods usually handle the modeling from a statistical perspective without considering the physics characteristics of the robot’s motion. One of the typical problems is the force transmission through different parts of a robot and the calculations of the robotic dynamics quantities are prone to be ignored. To this end, we propose to use the force transmission graph to interpret the force transmission mechanism obeyed by the motion of the robot and estimate the dynamics quantities of the robot’s motion with a quadratic model . Following this concern, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning framework for robotic control in which the dynamic model comprises two components, i.e. the Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and the Two-Layer Perception (TLP) network. The GCN serves as a parameter estimator of the force transmission graph and a structural feature extractor. The TLP network approximates the quadratic model that should be able to estimate the dynamics quantities of the robot’s motion. For this reason, the proposed framework is named as GCN of Dynamics estimation in Reinforcement Learning method (GDRL for short). The deployed method interprets the intrinsic mechanism of robotic force transmissions through robot limbs , therefore the model is highly interpretable. Experimental results show that GDRL can predict the gesture and location of the robot for the next move well such that the performance of our method surpasses that of the previous methods in robot control task in our task setting of multiple types of robots. We also designed to compare with the previous model-free methods in our task setting, and the results are outstanding, which is owing to the interpretation of the physical characteristics.},

Nevertheless, the existing domain adaptation based diagnosis approaches mainly focus on the alignment of source domain and target domain at global level, which may lead to the confusion between subdomains and finally restrict the improvement of target domain accuracy. In this work, the subdomain adaptation capsule network (SACNet) is developed, and the contributions of the proposed method mainly reflected in the following aspects. Firstly, in the proposed architecture, a novel distance metrics named local joint maximum mean discrepancy (LJMMD) is developed and embedded as part of the objective function. Utilizing the LJMMD, the joint distribution of feature and prediction space of target domain can be matched with that of source domain at subdomain level, which can avoid the limitations of global or single marginal distributions match. Secondly, the capsule network with vector-output is substituted for the classical fully connected adaption layer. Instead of matching specific values, the module value of the capsule vector is set as the object of domain adaption. Thus, the discrepancy between different domains can be admitted to a certain extent, which can endow the model with more excellent generalization ability . The experimental results indicate that, compared with other methods, the suggested LJMMD can achieve higher diagnostic accuracy in most transfer tasks. Besides, the diagnostic accuracy of the developed SACNet can be further improved by nearly 2\% after adopting the capsule adaptation layer.},

One challenge is to identify the treatment effect in three-way arrays of outcomes with missing data.Thus, this paper proposes a novel method, PIM estimator (PIME), for inferring the differential effect of treatment. This method aims to estimate the average treatment effect using the three-way outcome array of a two-level design. This method can identify the selection bias and quantify it with the difference in outcome means between complete and incomplete cases. With the sensitivity analysis of dropout fractions, the results suggest there exists a minimum point of the upper bound of the difference estimation with the specified models. The results with real applications show that the proposed method is efficient for the treatment effect estimation.

  abstract     = {Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing non-Euclidean data. GCNs update the feature representations of each sample by aggregating the structure information from K -order (layer) neighborhood samples. Existing GCNs variants rely heavily on the K -th layer semantic information with K -order neighborhood information aggregating. However, semantic features from different convolution layers have distinct sample attributes. The single-layer semantic feature is only a one-sided feature representation. Besides, the semantic features of traditional GCNs will be oversmoothing with multi-layer structure information aggregates. In this paper, to solve the above-mentioned problem, we propose adaptive graph convolutional collaboration networks (AGCCNs) for the semi-supervised classification task. AGCCNs can fully use the different scales of discrimination information contained in the different convolutional layers . Specifically, AGCCNs utilize the attention mechanism to learn the relevance (contribution) coefficient of the deep semantic features from different convolution layers for the task, which aims to effectively discriminant their importance. After multiple optimizations, AGCCNs can adaptively learn the robust deep semantic features via the effective semantic fusion process between multi-layer semantic information. Compared with GCNs that only utilize the K -th layer semantic features, AGCCNs make the learned deep semantic features contain richer and more robust semantic information. What is more, our proposed AGCCNs can aggregate the appropriate K -order neighborhood information for each sample, which can relieve the oversmoothing issue of traditional GCNs and better generalize shallow GCNs to more deep layers. Abundant experimental results on several popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed AGCCNs compared with traditional GCNs.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies on one-class classification have achieved a remarkable performance by employing the self-supervised classifier that predicts the type of pre-defined geometric transformations applied on in-class images. However, they cannot correctly identify in-class images as in-class at all when the input images have various viewpoints (e.g., translated or rotated images), because their classification-based in-class scores assume that in-class images always have a fixed viewpoint. Pointing out that humans can easily recognize such images having various viewpoints as the same class, in this work, we aim to propose a one-class classifier robust to geometrically-transformed inputs, named as GROC. To this end, we remark that in-class images match better with the in-class transformations than out-of-class images do. We introduce a conformity score indicating how strongly an input image agrees with one of the predefined in-class transformations, then utilize the conformity score with our proposed agreement measures for one-class classification. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GROC is able to accurately distinguish in-class images from out-of-class images regardless of whether the inputs are geometrically-transformed or not, whereas the existing methods fail.},

Meanwhile, psychological behaviors of decision makers usually have an influence on the decision-making results. In light of these facts, the paper explores a new three-way decision approach by using prospect theory for an incomplete information system, which handles the default information of an incomplete information system by virtue of a probability dominance relation. First, a probability dominance relation of an incomplete information system is defined to process a binary relation between evaluation values, and the way for calculating the relative value function in the behavior decision-making process is also given. Moreover, the conditional probability with a decision attribute in an incomplete decision information system is put forward, and an objective weight function via prospect theory is further obtained. On this basis, a prospect-theory-based three-way decision approach with a probability dominance relation for an incomplete information system is proposed. Finally, the stability, effectiveness and superiority of the presented approach are validated via corresponding experimental studies and comparative analysis with two realistic cases.},

We investigate homogenous neighbors between users or items to mine collaborative signals for embedding learning. In the case of multiple and complex composition of user interests and item attributes, traditional uniform embedding is insufficient to depict matching between a specific user-item pair. Therefore, we propose a siamese graph-based dynamic matching (SGDM) model for collaborative filtering. A target-aware dual attention module is introduced to update neighbors with their varying contributions to unveil users’ interests, which explicitly encodes the clue of the candidate matching target. For a target user-item pair, homogeneous neighbors participate in the interest propagation through graph convolution , which learns user/item embeddings respectively on the siamese homogeneous graphs. The dual dynamic aggregation in graph convolution endows a specific user-item pair with dynamic matching, which is expected to meet the needs of fine-grained filtering and promote the performance of collaborative filtering. Extensive experimental results confirm the collaboration between siamese homogeneous graphs of users and items. It further illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed SGDM in mining homogeneous collaborative signals for embedding learning and collaborative filtering.},

In this study, a new noisy label learning framework is proposed by leveraging supervised contrastive learning for enhanced representation and improved label correction. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of a class-balanced prototype queue, a prototype-based label correction algorithm , and a supervised representation learning module. The proposed framework produces closely aligned representations and model predictions for instances from the same classes and facilitates label correction by aggregating noisy and prototype labels. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis of the proposed framework is provided from the perspective of an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm.

In this study, we proposed a category-aware venue embedding model with similarity constraints (CAVE-SC), which is an automatic feature engineering method to infer category labels for venues. CAVE-SC first models the co-occurrence relations between a given venue and its two types of sequential contexts (namely, the venue context and the category context) based on a softmax loss and then projects both venues and categories into the same latent space. Furthermore, CAVE-SC models the similarity constraints posed by the relationships between venues and their categories based on a newly designed triplet loss, assuming that the distance between a venue and its category is smaller than the distance between the venue and a randomly sampled category in the embedding space. Finally, linear interpolation is used to balance the two losses, thereby generating discriminative feature representations of venues. Venue labeling can be performed based on the distances between venue representations and category representations. Extensive experiments on two check-in datasets demonstrate the superiority of CAVE-SC over the baseline methods .},

  abstract     = {Graphs, also known as networks, are an expressive data representation used in many domains. Numerous algorithms have been designed to find interesting patterns in graphs. However, they have at least one of two major drawbacks. First, most algorithms focus on finding complex subgraphs but ignore relationships between attributes. But attributes play a major role in several real-life applications such as for profile completion in social networks. Second, the user must generally set multiple parameters that greatly influence results but are unintuitive to set. To provide a solution to these issues, this paper introduces a novel algorithm named CSPM (Compressing Star Pattern Miner) for discovering compressing patterns in an attributed graph. The algorithm is parameter-free and discovers star-shaped attribute patterns that reveal strong relationships between attribute values by utilizing the concept of conditional entropy and the minimum description length principle. Extensive experiments on real data show that CSPM is efficient and can find insightful patterns. In particular, it is observed that the discovered patterns can boost the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph attribute completion models on social network databy up to 15.39\%. Moreover, it is found that CSPM can uncover many interesting patterns describing alarm correlations in data from a large-scale industrial telecommunication network .},

The use of partial order between symbols may result in far more efficient compression schemes than the most commonly used compression techniques , which use total order. We suggest a new algorithm for compressing sequences defined in alphabets with a partial order. This new algorithm is named the Lempel–Ziv with Partial Order (POLZ) and stands for a Lempel–Ziv (LZ78) generalization. We will show how to compress and decompress sequences by utilizing the POLZ. In addition, we establish the methods for determining the upper bounds for sequence complexity by using the notion of equivalence classes. We will also demonstrate that POLZ is asymptotically optimal, achieving an even greater compression rate when compared to the LZ78 when applied to sequences emanating from concurrent processes. Furthermore, we will show that the complexity obtained by using the LZ78 is also an upper bound for the POLZ complexity. We have developed examples in robotics and real-time systems to show how to use and the benefits of using our algorithm for compression within the context of concurrent systems. When the concurrency of the processes is taken into account, all experimental results show a significant compression gain .},

We define convex geometry (cg) approximation spaces on a grand set , and we produce novel cg-upper and cg-lower approximation operators. Their basic properties are presented. Then we show that the model that arises has connections with well-established models in the rough set literature, both from relation and covering-based approaches. We identificate three types of subsets of the grand set that have different behaviors with respect to their cg-approximations, and we refine this classification in some benchmark cases.

Then, we construct a novel semi-supervised reconstruction anomaly detection framework named MANomaly by combining MAN with the HAS determination mechanism. Meanwhile, we design three different mutual adversarial training approaches to MANomaly and evaluate them on two publicly available network traffic datasets: NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15.

  abstract     = {A ventilator is a device that mechanically assists in pumping air into the lungs, which is a life-saving supportive therapy in an intensive care unit (ICU). In clinical scenarios, each patient has unique physiological circumstances and specific respiratory diseases, thus requiring individualized ventilator settings. Long-term supervision by experienced clinicians is essential to perform the task of precisely adjusting ventilator parameters and making timely modifications. Moreover, a tiny clinical error can result in severe lung injury, induce multi-system organ dysfunction, and increase mortality. To reduce the workload of clinicians and prevent medical errors, machine learning (ML), or more specifically, reinforcement learning (RL) methods, have been developed to automatically adjust the ventilator’s parameters and select optimal strategies . However, the ventilator settings contain both continuous (e.g., frequency) and discrete parameters (e.g., ventilation mode), making it challenging for conventional RL-based approaches to handle such problems. Meanwhile, it is necessary to develop models with high data efficiency to overcome medical data insufficiency. In this paper, we propose a model-based hybrid soft actor-critic (MHSAC) algorithm that is developed based on the classic soft actor-critic (SAC) and model-based policy optimization (MBPO) framework. This algorithm can learn both continuous and discrete policies according to the current and predictive state of patient’s physiological information with high data efficiency. Results reveal that our proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline models , achieving superior efficiency and high accuracy in the OpenAI Gym simulation environment. Our proposed model is capable of resolving mixed action space problems, enhancing data efficiency, and accelerating convergence, which can generate practical optimal ventilator settings, minimize possible medical errors, and provide clinical decision support .},

  abstract     = {Image quality assessment (IQA) is a critical issue in computer vision, which intends to simulate human visual system (HVS) with a view to evaluating the error degree of distorted images from reference images. The algorithms based on deep learning have been successfully introduced to quality evaluation of no-referenced images in the last years. Unfortunately, they are confronted with the problems of over-fitting and weak generalization ability caused by insufficient labeled data. The emergence of meta-learning has brought new ideas, which have been proved to address the issues regarding few-shot learning. However, the commonly used meta-learning metrics only learn the initialization of weights, which can’t guarantee the optimal gradient direction. The manual design mode leads to lower accuracy and speed. In our work, an improved meta-learning framework is applied to no-reference (NR) IQA to meet the above challenges. It can achieve maximum generalization performance through only a few update iterations. Specifically, we collected a great many NR-IQA tasks with different distortions to pre-train meta-model and optimizer to learn a general weight initialization and optimization rule. Then, the meta-model acquired meta-knowledge and learned unique learning rate for each task. Finally, it could be directly adapted to new NR-IQA tasks only by fine-tuning a few images. Experiments on synthetic and authentic datasets proved that our approach has more vital learning ability and better generalization performance for evaluating real distorted images, effectively reducing dependence on manual marking.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised short text classification is a challenging problem due to the sparsity and limited labeled data . Due to the lack of labeled data, many models focus on the generation of text samples, which is cumbersome and has poor scalability. To overcome this deficiency, in this paper, we propose a Self-Training Text method based on Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-Text-GCN). Differently from the previous literature, our self-training method is convenient. The labeled information is propagated to target samples along the structure of the manifold, instead of introducing the extra knowledge. Specifically, instead of adding text training samples, our method adds keywords to training set. The model will calculate the confidence of each word. Confidence indicates the degree of ambiguity of a word. Some words with high confidence are automatically marked as pseudo-labeled data. Meanwhile, word confidence is added to the calculation of the edge weights of the graph to reduce the classification error caused by word ambiguity. Our method makes full use of the keywords in short texts when labeled data is scarce. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging task in the community of data mining but frequently appears in real-world applications. A popular strategy for FSL is transferring information from the domain with extensive amounts of data to the domain with few data. However, two main issues are still open for transfer learning : what kind of information and how much should be transferred. In this work, an Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) is designed to adaptively transfer distribution informase classes for calibrating the biased distributions of novel classes. More specifically, ADC automatically determines the correlations between base classes and novel classes by considering the optimal transport among them. Then, ADC adaptively calibrates the distribution of each novel class according to its correlated base classes. More novel class data can be sampled from the calibrated distribution to train a robust classifier. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the generalization error bound of the proposed ADC, which shows that the best hypothesis that considers both support and generated data performs at least as good as the best hypothesis learned on support data alone. This generalization error bound guarantees theoretically the effectiveness of the proposed method. Extensive experiments, including comparing with baselines(0.17\% ∼ ∼ 2.6\% improvement on different datasets compared to the next best), ablation studies and hyper-parameter analysis, have been conducted on three widely used FSL datasets ( miniImageNet , tieredImageNet and CUB ) to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADC.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on search space decomposition (MOEA/D-M2M) is a promising framework for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). It is crucial yet challenging for an MOEA to balance convergence and diversity. Few studies have been attempted to deal with the balancing problem under the MOEA/D-M2M framework. In this paper, a two-stage hybrid learning-based MOEA, dubbed HLMEA, is proposed to address this problem. In the first stage, we propose a genetic operator with an adaptive scaling parameter in order to accelerate the convergence of the search, while the environmental selection method maintains the diversity. In the second stage, the K -means clustering method is employed within each subpopulation to construct a mating pool for each individual. In each mating pool, an adaptive method based on hypervolume is proposed to choose a suitable differential evolution operator for offspring generation. Different from the first stage, the environmental selection method used in NSGA-II is applied to select a new population. Thereafter, subpopulations are obtained by dividing the newly created population. Extensive experimental results show that HLMEA has better performance than nine state-of-the-art MOEAs. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of each component of HLMEA.},

In general, the choice of the objective functions only considers the desired clustering properties, and most EMOCs present in the literature do not consider aspects of multi-objective optimization, such as the search direction, in their design. Aiming to support a better choice and definition of the objectives in the EMOCs, this paper proposes an analysis of the clustering criteria admissibility to examine the search direction and evaluate their potential in finding optimal results. We consider the fundamentals of the evaluation of a heuristic function to analyze the clustering criteria and demonstrate how they can influence the optimization. As a result, this study provides a detailed analysis of the main objective functions found in the literature and evaluates how the initialization interferes with their admissibility . Also, we highlight some common practices and issues found in some established EMOCs. Furthermore, we provide insights regarding how to combine and use the clustering criteria in the EMOCs.},

  abstract     = {The development of hybrid algorithms or the application of multiple strategies is one of the focal points for research on improving evolutionary algorithms. However, since most of the evolutionary equations of different algorithms can be transformed into each other, it is difficult to change the established properties of the given algorithm through a hybrid algorithm based on a mixture of evolutionary equations. In addition, multi-strategy methods tend to adopt the best strategy for the current local domain through greedy strategies in the solution process, which does not ensure validity in the global domain. Recently, Federated Learning has achieved remarkable results in machine learning, where the idea of model independence, parallelism and data sharing can essentially compensate for the weaknesses of hybrid and multi-strategy algorithms. Inspired by the idea of Federated Learning, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm named as parallel based Evolutionary Algorithm with primary-auxiliary knowledge. Specifically, a Spark-based primary-auxiliary knowledge model is developed, with different evolutionary algorithms used on each parallel sub-model. Then, an effective topological knowledge (individual) migration method is devised, which enables the primary knowledge model to learn the best knowledge from different auxiliary knowledge models through a topological structure. In this way, the best knowledge on the auxiliary knowledge models can be transferred to the primary knowledge model. Through a test conducted on the CEC2013 test set, it can be found out that the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms the 10 algorithms compared, which demonstrates the excellent performance of our proposed parallel based evolutionary algorithm with primary-auxiliary knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Attribute reduction is an important application of rough sets. Efficiently reducing massive dynamic data sets quickly has always been a major goal of researchers. Traditional incremental methods focus on reduction by updated approximations. However, these methods must evaluate all attributes and repeatedly calculate their importance. When these algorithms are applied to large datasets with high time complexity, reducing large decision systems becomes inefficient. We propose an incremental acceleration strategy based on attribute trees to solve this problem. The key step is to cluster all attributes into multiple trees for incremental attribute evaluation. Specifically, we first select the appropriate attribute tree for attribute evaluation according to the attribute tree correlation measure to reduce the time complexity. Next, the branch coefficient is added to the stop criterion, increasing with the branch depth and guiding a jump out of the loop after reaching the maximum threshold. This avoids redundant calculation and improves efficiency. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for incremental attribute reduction based on attribute trees using these improvements. Finally, a Spark parallel mechanism is added to parallelize data processing to implement the parallel incremental efficient attribute reduction based on the attribute tree. Experimental results on the Shuttle dataset show that the time consumption of our algorithm is more than 40\% lower than that of the classical IARC algorithm while maintaining its good classification performance. In addition, the time is shortened by more than 87\% from the benchmark after adding the Spark parallelizing mechanism.},

  abstract     = {During the past few years, many neighborhood-based ABC variants have been developed to utilize the valuable information of neighbors for guiding searches instead of using the best individual or elite individuals. However, neighbor selection is determined by the neighborhood topology, and different neighborhood topologies are suitable for different problems. Unfortunately, previous neighborhood-based ABC variants have often used a single type of neighborhood topology, which significantly affects algorithm performance. Hence, to take advantage of different neighborhood topologies, we propose a new neighborhood-based ABC variant using adaptive neighborhood topologies, called ABC-ANT. In ABC-ANT, to determine which type of neighborhood topology should be selected, the fitness distance correlation technique is first used to identify the feature of the fitness landscape for a given problem. Then, according to the identified feature, the most suitable neighborhood topology is adaptively selected, which is beneficial to adapt the search to the fitness landscape. Moreover, in ABC-ANT, the scout bee phase is modified by developing a dual-elite search strategy to save the search experience. Extensive experiments are conducted on two test suites, i.e., CEC2013 and CEC2017, and one real-world optimization problem, i.e., the dynamic economic dispatch problem. Seven ABC variants and six non-ABC variants are included in the performance comparison. The results verify that ABC-ANT has very competitive performance.},

Based on the Hx loss function, this method establishes a novel robust adaptive local structure learning strategy, reducing the interference of noise (outliers) on data reconstruction and space exploration. In addition, a new orthogonal regularization term is incorporated into the model, ensuring the orthogonality of the factor matrix and enhancing the discriminant ability. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the resultant model and analyze its convergence from theoretical and experimental aspects.

In recent times, the selection of healthcare waste treatment (HCWT) technology can be considered as multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem due to the involvement of multiple conflicting criteria. To reduce the unhealthy impact on the ecosystem and promote sustainable disposal, researchers have investigated MCDM problems to select apt HCWTs. In a bid to the minimize negative environmental impact of healthcare waste, researchers adopted MCDM, and faced challenges such as: (i) handling uncertainty/subjective randomness; (ii) imputation of missing values; and (iii) consideration to experts’ attitude and interdependencies during MCDM process. To remedy these, this paper has attempted to establish a novel decision model with generalized orthopair fuzzy information (GOFI). Initially, missing values are systematically imputed. Experts&#39; preferences were fused to obtain an aggregated matrix by considering the interdependencies among experts. Also, criteria weights were computed utilizing attitude-based entropy measures, and HCWTs were ranked using the GOFI-evaluation based on distance from average solution (GOFI-EDAS) approach. Lastly, the methodology&#39;s superiority was validated using an illustrative example, followed by a comparison with extant models. The results confirm that the developed framework is more efficient than and consistent with earlier methods under uncertainty.},

Among them, centrality measures based on local properties of nodes are widely used, which assess the importance of nodes based on their degrees. However, they do not take the global information of networks into consideration. In this paper, a Local Degree Dimension (LDD) approach to identify influential nodes in complex networks is proposed. Different from the existing work, LDD regards the numbers of central node’s each layer neighbor nodes as the basis of nodes’ importance calculation. LDD creatively combines the increasing rate and decreasing rate of the numbers of each layer neighbor nodes to obtain its Local Degree Dimension value, which is comprehensive and reasonable. A node with a larger LDD value has a more significant impact on networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LDD, six experiments are conducted on six real-world complex networks. Experimental results show that LDD has a higher identification accuracy and a stronger ability to quantify node’s importance.},

An extended dynamic consensus model is proposed to measure the weights of FMEA experts and revise the individual preference information until reaching an acceptable consensus. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed FMEA are verified with a practical case study on the risk analysis of supercritical water gasification systems.

The traditional Tradeoff procedure, which is based on the axiomatic foundation of multi-attribute value theory, considers the ranges of the attributes, but decision-makers/analysts find it hard to check the consistency of the paired comparisons when using this method. The traditional BWM, on the other hand, uses two opposite references (best and worst) in a single optimization, which not only frames the elicitation process in a more structured way, but helps decision-makers/analysts check the consistency. However, the BWM does not explicitly considers the attributes ranges in the pairwise comparisons . The method proposed in this study uses the “consider-the-opposite-strategy” and accounts for the range effect simultaneously. Specifically, the decision-maker considers the ranges of the attributes and provide two pairwise comparison vectors, then an optimization model is designed to determine the optimal weights of the attributes based on these two vectors. After that, consistency thresholds are constructed to check the consistency of the judgements. Finally, a case study is used to examine the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Scene recognition plays an important role in many computer vision tasks. However, the recognition performance hardly meets the development of computer vision , since scene images show large variations in spatial position , illumination, and scale. To address this issue, a joint global metric learning and local manifold preservation (JGML-LMP) approach is proposed. First, we formulate a new global metric learning problem based on the cluster centers of each specific class, allowing to capture the global discriminative information with more informative samples. Second, in order to exploit the local manifold structure, we introduce an adaptive nearest neighbors constraint through which the local intrinsic relationships can be preserved in the new metric space instead of the Euclidean space . Third, through performing global metric learning and local manifold preservation jointly within a unified optimization framework, our approach can take advantage of both global and local information, and hence produces more discriminative and robust feature representations for scene recognition. Extensive experiments on four benchmark scene datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {As data collected from different sources have multiple representations, multi-view learning has become an important paradigm of machine learning . To exploit multi-view data, previous works either tackle each view separately or concatenate all views directly, such that the distinctions as well as correlations of different views are often ignored. Furthermore, existing models usually involve intractable parameters that need to be manually determined to balance the contributions of different views, degrading the efficiency and applicability of models. In this paper, a novel multi-view learning framework, namely Robust Multi-view learning via Adaptive Regression (RMAR), is derived to discriminate diverse views in a self-supervised weighting manner without extra parameters. Meanwhile, RMAR coalesces multiple feature projections with adaptive view-wise weights and adopts L 2 , 1 L2,1 -norm regression loss to learn a joint projection subspace compatible across all views, not only increasing the robustness of model but also preserving the consistency and diversity among views. Furthermore, RMAR can be naturally extended for feature selection by imposing L 2 , 1 L2,1 -norm constraint on feature projections. Additionally, an efficient convergent algorithm is developed to solve RMAR. Extensive experiments have been performed to validate the effectiveness of RMAR for classification and feature selection and show its superiority over state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a population-based optimization method that adopts survival-of-the-fittest rules. The performance of EAs can be greatly affected by offspring quality. Many researchers hope to adjust the parameters of evolutionary operators to improve offspring quality, but most current methods are regulated by the feedback model, which does not recognize offspring quality. Instead, it adjusts an operator’s search structure dynamically based on its historical performance. In fact, there is a co-evolutionary effect between different operators. An operator will not always produce offspring with the best quality, so the feedback model only selects the best operator in history to generate offspring, which ignores the capacity for co-evolution. In this paper, we propose an operator pre-selection strategy (OPS). First, to ensure operators’ capacity for co-evolution, we construct an operator pool using five operators. Second, we select the best offspring based on the classification and feedback models. Finally, we evaluate the offspring and include it in the evolution. Compared with the traditional feedback model, OPS directly identifies higher-quality offspring. Even if the historical performance of an operator is poor, as long as it can generate excellent offspring, it is selected. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OPS.},

Inspired by polynomial fitting, this paper proposes a polynomial fitting-based prediction algorithm (PFPA) and incorporates it into the model-based multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) for solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems. When an environment change is detected, the main mission of PFPA is to predict high-quality search populations for tracking the moving Pareto-optimal set effectively. Firstly, the non-dominated solutions obtained in past environments are utilized to predict high-quality solutions based on a multi-step movement strategy. Secondly, a polynomial fitting-based strategy is designed to fit the distribution of variables according to the obtained search populations, and capture the relationship between variables in the new search environment. Thirdly, some effective search agents are generated for improving population convergence and diversity based on characteristics of variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experimental results on a set of benchmark functions , with a variety of different dynamic characteristics and difficulties, and two classical dynamic engineering design problems show that PFPA is competitive with some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, expert credibility and its dynamic variation are rarely considered in the consensus reaching process (CRP) for MCGDM problems. In reality, experts are not completely reliable, and their credibility changes dynamically during the CRP. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel CRP method based on dynamic expert credibility for GDM under Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). First, expert credibility is defined by measuring the extrinsic discrepancy and intrinsic ambiguity of decision information to quantify experts’ abilities to provide high-quality evaluations. Then, a novel consensus measure is proposed based on the inverse-square law to check whether the current consensus level satisfies the designated threshold. If not, a new feedback mechanism considering dynamic expert credibility is activated to promote group consensus. Furthermore, the attribute weights are comprehensively determined from both objective and subjective perspectives. Finally, an illustrative example and comparative analysis are presented to validate the proposed method.},

In some real-life scenarios, the DFG of an event log contains hundreds of edges, hindering its understandability . To overcome this shortcoming, process mining tools generally offer the possibility of filtering the edges in the DFG. We study the problem of efficiently filtering the DFG extracted from an event log while retaining the most frequent relations. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem , specifically, the problem of finding a sound spanning subgraph of a DFG with a minimal number of edges and a maximal sum of edge frequencies. We show that this problem is an instance of an NP-hard problem and outline several polynomial-time heuristics to compute approximate solutions. Finally, we report on an evaluation of the efficiency and optimality of the proposed heuristics using 13 real-life event logs.},

However, there are practical problems, such as classification via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the data to be aggregated are not modeling membership degrees in the unit interval. In this scenario, systems could benefit from the application of operators defined in domains different from [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] , although, presenting similar behavior of some aggregation functions whose subclasses are currently defined only in the fuzzy context (e.g., overlap functions and t-norms). So, the main objective of this paper is to present a general framework to characterize classes of fusion functions with floating domains, called ( a , b ) (a,b) -fusion functions, defined on any closed real interval [ a , b ] [a,b] , based on classes of core fusion functions defined on [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] . The fundamental aspect of this framework is that the properties of a core fusion function are preserved in the context of the analogous ( a , b ) (a,b) -fusion function. Construction methods are presented, and some properties are studied. We also introduce a framework to define fusion functions in which the inputs come from an interval [ a , b ] [a,b] but the output is mapped on a possibly different interval [ c , d ] [c,d] .

Suppose decision data or scenarios in the target domain are insufficient to guarantee the consistency of learning preferences, and there exists one similar source domain with sufficient effective data. Then, knowledge from the source domain can help learn preferences in the target domain. Following this idea, this paper proposes a cross-domain decision making method using a parameter transfer strategy with homogeneous and heterogeneous criteria. A decision model based on the value function is constructed using a generalized additive model to ensure the interpretability of the model. The marginal value functions are adjusted using Sturm’s theorem to keep the monotonicity of the learned marginal value functions on the criteria. Then, the parameter transfer strategy is adopted to transfer the obtained value functions to help learn the real preferences of the decision maker for the decision problem where preferences in historical data may not be consistent. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by solving the problem of diagnosing breast lesions in a hospital.},

Initially, the FPA is used to search for the optimal solution, which improves the search efficiency. When the solution obtained by the FPA is no longer updated, MC simulation is adopted to further find the optimal solution. The sorting function prevents the loss of objective function information, and the result obtained is objective and practical. A test function is used to verify whether the combination of the FPA and MC simulation can improve the search accuracy. The results confirm that the search accuracy is improved. Finally, MFPAMC is used for empirical analysis, and the experimental results are compared with those of four other methods.

However, current methods are insufficient to handle unseen groups (i.e., transductive models) or struggle to compute cost-effective attention networks and regularizations . In this study, we propose the novel Bayesian inductive learning method, called IndiG, for making recommendations to seen and unseen groups. To learn inductively, a function distribution consisting of efficient attention-based aggregation is used as shared information across groups. By incorporating a transductive model as a posterior into the proposed Bayesian method, an inductive model as a prior can learn robustly. We adopt cost-effective regularization to prevent degenerated solutions by maximizing a correlation between group representations of a transductive model and an inductive model, while decorrelating dimensions of group representations. Through experiments, we demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed other existing methods. The experiments also showed that the utilization of uncertainty on the predicted ratings of items worked effectively to improve the performance.},

Due to complicated emotion interactions and emotion bias among multiple emotion cues, current techniques still fall short when it comes to detecting complex group emotion. In this study, we propose a context-consistent cross-graph neural network (ConGNN) for accurate GER in the wild. It can model multi-cue emotional relations and alleviate emotion bias among different cues, thus obtaining the robust and consistent group emotion representation. In ConGNN, we first extract the facial, local object, and global scene features to form multi-cue emotion features. Then, we develop a cross-graph neural network (C-GNN) for modeling inter- and intra-branch emotion relations, obtaining a comprehensive cross-branch emotion representation. To alleviate the effect of emotion bias during C-GNN training, we propose an emotion context-consistent learning mechanism with an emotion bias penalty to help obtain context-consistent group emotion, and then achieve robust GER. Furthermore, we create a new, more realistic benchmark, SiteGroEmo, and use it to evaluate ConGNN. Extensive experiments on two challenging GER datasets (GroupEmoW and SiteGroEmo) demonstrate that our ConGNN outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, with relative accuracy gains of 3.35\% and 4.32\%, respectively.},

At the first stage of the algorithm, primary clusters are formed by identifying dense points that have a higher number of natural neighbors. Then, the heads of the clusters are extracted in dense points, based on the local natural density criterion. Afterward, a novel natural neighborhood-based method is applied to identify the points having a low number of natural neighbors, which called weak or noise data points. Finally, the desired clusters are obtained by ignoring the weak/noise points. The computational complexity of the proposed method is O ( n l o g n ) O(nlogn) . The proposed method is independent of any specific parameter setting. The results of experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that it achieves a higher performance compared to the competitors.},

In order to defend against the attacker who can inject false data without being detected by the detector, an encryption mechanism is proposed. Different from the existing results, the energy constraints are introduced to limit the attack times of attacker and encryption rank of defender, respectively. Under the framework of Stackelberg game, the optimal encryption strategies against worst-case stealthy attacks are designed for accumulative and terminal estimation performance, which increase the difficulty of launching stealthy attacks and diminish the impact of attacks on system performance simultaneously. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary computation is promising in tackling with the feature selection problem, but still has poor performance in obtaining good feature subset in high-dimensional problems. In order to efficiently obtain the optimal feature subset with higher classification accuracy and lower feature dimensions, a binary individual search strategy-based bi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm has three advantages and contributions. Firstly, an improved fisher score is utilized to preprocess the feature space to remove the irrelevant and redundant features. It can decrease the feature dimensionality and compress the search space of feature subset effectively. Secondly, a binary individual search strategy is developed that contains a nearest neighbor binary individual crossover operator and an adaptive binary individual mutation operator , which can search the global optimal feature combination. Thirdly, enhanced population entropy and improved average convergence rate are adopted to monitor the correlation between the diversity of the population and the convergence of optimization objectives . Promising experimental results on twelve high-dimensional datasets reveal that the proposed algorithm can obtain competitive classification accuracy and effectively reduce the size of feature subset compared with ten state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.},

We propose a network generation method based on Delaunay triangulation to ensure the Nash equilibrium convergence of population dynamics. To speed the convergence of large-scale populations, we introduce a second-order communication network and form the distributed population dynamics for investigation. We also design a learning rule for strategic interactions to fit the second-order network population. The corresponding Nash equilibrium can converge from the perspectives of both numerical analysis and simulation results.

These results may provide new ideas for guaranteeing convergence and developing the strategic interaction rule.},

Accordingly, in this study, we use decomposition-based multiobjective optimization to solve nonlinear equation system, an attempt is made at deploying the decomposition-based multiobjective optimization to solve nonlinear equation systems, including those with infinite roots. In our novel approach, a given system is transformed into a bi-objective optimization problem using reference points. An improved decomposition-based multiobjective optimization is then applied to solve a transformed bi-objective optimization problem . To ensure this optimization suits the characteristics of the problem, we develop an adaptive multiobjective differential evolution and local search approach. The roots of the original nonlinear equation system can then be identified, together with the Pareto-optimal solutions of the transformed problem. We conducted extensive experiments to compare the performance of our novel approach with that of 16 state-of-the-art algorithms in solving 30 nonlinear equation systems derived from industrial applications. The results clearly show that our novel approach achieves better performance with a shorter execution time than that of the selected single-objective-based evolutionary approaches or Pareto-dominance-based multiobjective optimization algorithms.},

To address them, this work presents a C oarse-to- F ine few-shot classification framework under the guidance of M etric-based A uxiliary learning, abbreviated as CFMA . In particular, it discriminates the image pairs with large difference by capturing global features, and models the similarity relation of the image pairs with small difference by mining the local region of interests. Moreover, CFMA adopts deep metric learning to improve the model adaptivity on the set of limited samples, and generates pseudo labels to dynamically guide the coarse learning in iteration.

However, wind-field identification is difficult for low-to-medium speed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which makes it challenging for UAVs such as powered parafoils to perform targeted wind compensation. To observe and compensate for this, we must accurately identify the wind field for the powered parafoil. In this study, we designed a deep Q-learning iterative inversion (DQII) algorithm for wind-field identification to concretely analyze wind-field identification through model inversion. Using a deep Q-learning (DQ) inverting dynamic model, a powered parafoil can identify the wind field within 2 s. In addition, iterative chaotic particle swarm optimization was performed based on DQ inversion, which achieved a high-precision wind-field identification effect. Simulation experiments showed that, compared with the traditional dead reckoning (DR) algorithm, DQII can reduce the error by 80\%–90\%. In a powered parafoil homing experiment, DQII achieved a wind-field identification effect that was significantly better than that of the DR algorithm.},

It has many applications, such as pattern recognition, detecting plagiarism, and finding communities in social networks. Current real-world applications generate massive amounts of data that cannot be stored on the memory of a single machine, which raises the need for distributed storage and processing. Recent relaxed GPM models, although of polynomial time complexity, are nevertheless not distributed by nature. Moreover, the existing relaxed GPM algorithms are limited in terms of scalability. In this paper, we propose Bounded Dual Simulation (BDSim) as a new relaxed model for a scalable evaluation of GPM in massive graphs. BDSim captures more semantic similarities compared to graph simulation, dual simulation, and even strong simulation. It preserves the vertices’ proximity by eliminating cycles of unbounded length from the resulting match graph. Furthermore, we propose distributed vertex-centric algorithms to evaluate BDSim. We prove their effectiveness and efficiency through detailed theoretical validation and extensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets . To the best of our knowledge, BDSim is the first relaxed GPM model that captures the cyclic structure of the query graph while being feasible in cubic time.},

  abstract     = {Accurate classification of heartbeats is essential for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. In real-world applications, many existing methods suffer from the imbalance between heartbeat classes since the number of normal heartbeats heavily outnumbers that of abnormal heartbeats. To address the class imbalance problem effectively, this study proposes a novel class-specific weighted broad learning system (CSWBLS) based on the broad learning system (BLS). The proposed CSWBLS constructs the least squares error term by class and uses weights to constrain the contribution of each class to the model. The weights are computed by employing class distribution and fine-tuning with preset scale factors. Minority classes are allocated higher weights to increase their contributions. Furthermore, the proposed CSWBLS can be quickly remodeled by our newly developed incremental learning algorithms when additional nodes are added. The proposed CSWBLS improves the generalization performance for imbalanced classification tasks while inheriting the fast learning efficiency compared to traditional BLS. To validate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on five imbalanced heartbeat datasets obtained from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The results show that the overall accuracy and G-mean of our method exceed 99\% and 97\%, respectively, outperforming traditional BLS and some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Automated emotion recognition using brain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is predominantly used for the accurate assessment of human actions as compared to facial expression or speech signals. Various signal processing methods have been used for extracting representative features from EEG signals for emotion recognition. However, the EEG signals are non-stationary and vary across the subjects as well as in different sessions of the same subject; hence it exhibits poor generalizability and low classification accuracy for an emotion classification of cross subjects. In this paper, EEG signals-based automated cross-subject emotion recognition framework is proposed using the Fourier-Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) method. This method is used to decompose the EEG signals from each channel into four sub-band signals. Manually ten channels are selected from the frontal lobe, from which entropy and energy features are extracted from each sub-band signal. The subject variability is reduced using an average moving filter method on each channel to obtain the smoothened feature vector of size 80. The three feature selection techniques, such as neighborhood component analysis (NCA), relief-F, and mRMR , are used to obtain an optimal feature vector. The machine learning models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), k -nearest neighborhood ( k -NN) with two (fine and weighted) functions, and ensemble bagged tree classifiers are trained by the obtained feature vectors. The experiments are performed on two publicly accessible databases, named SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP). The training and testing of the models have been performed using 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out-cross-validation (LOSOCV). The proposed framework based on FBSE-EWT and NCA feature selection approach shows superior results for classifying human emotions compared to other state-of-art emotion classification models .},

The granulation of the weight linguistic information is closely linked with that of the alternative preference linguistic information in a way that two sets of control factors are introduced. Second, an estimation method for expert/attribute weights is developed based on the optimal control factors and solutions to the aforesaid linguistic information granulation models. The proposed linguistic information granulation models are in fact constrained non-linear optimization problems which may be neither effectively nor efficiently solved by general optimization methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel network (called DA-Net) based on dual attention to mine the local–global features for multivariate time series classification. Specifically, DA-Net consists of two distinctive layers, i.e., the Squeeze-Excitation Window Attention (SEWA) layer and the Sparse Self-Attention within Windows (SSAW) layer. For the SEWA layer, we capture the local window-wise information by explicitly establishing window dependencies to prioritize critical windows. For the SSAW layer, we preserve rich activate scores with less computation to widen the window scope for capturing global long-range dependencies. Based on the two elaborated layers, DA-Net can mine critical local sequence fragments in the process of establishing global long-range dependencies. The experimental results show that DA-Net is able to achieve competing performance with state-of-the-art approaches on the multivariate time series classification.},

Z-numbers are also widely used in decision-making for the reason that they can describe real-world information and human cognition more flexibly. However, the classical arithmetic complexity of Z-numbers is a burden in real applications, especially under large data sets. How to both retain the inherent meaning of Z-numbers and reduce the calculation complexity is a critical issue in the real Z-number-based applications. Limited theoretical progress has so far been discussed. To balance the gap between the arithmetic complexity and the inherent meaning of Z-numbers, we propose an approximate calculation method of Z-numbers (Z-ACM) based on kernel density estimation . The main ideas are as follows: first, kernel density estimation is used to partition/group Z-numbers with the total utility of Z-numbers; second, aggregate the representative Z-number in each partitioned interval using the classical arithmetic framework of Z-numbers. Based on the proposed Z-ACM, a fast decision model (FDM) is designed to deal with the issue of multi-criteria decision-making.

The starting point is that the ranked data generated in linguistic contexts can be viewed as the realisations of a discrete states Markov chain , whose stationary distribution behaves according to a discretisation of the best fitted rank-size law. The employed methodological toolkit is Markov Chain Monte Carlo , specifically referring to the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. The theoretical framework is applied to the rank-size analysis of the hapax legomena occurring in the speeches of the US Presidents. We offer a large number of statistical tests leading to the consistency of our methodological proposal. To pursue our scopes, we also offer arguments supporting that hapaxes are rare (“extreme”) events resulting from memory-less-like processes. Moreover, we show that the considered sample has the stochastic structure of a Markov chain of order one.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a class of optimal couple-group tracking control (OCGTC) problems for heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HeMASs) based on reinforcement learning (RL) method, whose goal is to minimize the local tracking errors (states) and control inputs (actions) of followers by learning the dynamic knowledge of a single leader. The weakly connected multi-agent network is randomly divided into coupled sub-networks, and each agent in the same sub-network cooperates to accomplish tracking control such that the positions and velocities of all the agents converge to the same value, while the agents from different subgroups compete with each other to dissimilar tracking goals. In particular, in the discussed HeMASs, we consider agents with unknown dynamics of first-order and second-order. To solve the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE), an policy-value-based actor-critic technique is applied. Using the Lyapunov-like theorem, we verify that the local tracking error and the estimated weights of actor-critic neural networks are deduced to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Eventually, several simulations demonstrate the correctness of the retrieved theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Network pruning aims to reduce the inference cost of large models and enable neural architectures to run on end devices such as mobile phones. We present NEON, a novel iterative pruning approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). While most reinforcement learning-based pruning solutions only analyze the one network they aim to prune, we train a DRL agent on a large set of randomly-generated architectures. Therefore, our proposed solution is more generic and less prone to overfitting. To avoid the long-running times often required to train DRL models for each new dataset, we train NEON offline on multiple datasets and then apply it to additional datasets without additional training. This setup makes NEON more efficient than other DRL-based pruning methods. Additionally, we propose a novel reward function that enables users to clearly define their pruning/performance trade-off preferences. Our evaluation, conducted on a set of 28 diverse datasets, shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms recent top-performing solutions in the pruning of fully-connected networks. Specifically, our top configuration reduces the average size of the pruned architecture by × 24.59 ×24.59 , compared to × 13.26 ×13.26 by the leading baseline, while actually improving accuracy by 0.5\%.},

Non-reciprocal fuzzy preference relation (NRFPR) can represent the incomparability; however, the assessment, aggregation and prioritization of NRFPRs need to be improved. Additionally, for the consensus issue, existing methods yielded a maximum consensus sequence (MCS) without experts’ compromise attitudes. To fill these research gaps, this study applies NRFPRs in MCGDM to handle the incomparability of alternatives, and mine the MCS based on experts’ compromise attitudes and information exchange. First, a distance-based method is applied to enhance the indirect assessment of NRFPRs. A layered preference aggregation method is developed to aggregate NRFPRs and a straightforward conflict analysis method is proposed to perform prioritization. Afterwards, a compromise-or-not mechanism is introduced to derive experts’ compromise attitudes. Then, two kinds of conflicting items requiring additional information are identified. Discussions among experts are activated to exchange information so as to mine an MCS. We apply our method to the site selection of electric vehicle charging stations.},

Specifically, when taking convolution operator as the combinations of differential operators , deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can be regarded as partial differential equation (PDE). Learn such PDEs have become popular in image restoration especially for image denoising . While current methods for learning the denoising PDEs face two critical issues. On the one hand, the learned PDEs are not guaranteed to behave as progressive denoising as traditional denoising PDEs. On the other hand, the low level feature may diminish with time increases in PDE. To resolve these issues, this paper designs to learn a specialized PDE network (PDNet) which depicts the information propagation in the network as a reaction-diffusion–advection process. Specifically, a reaction-term is introduced to prevent the low-level features from diminishing in the PDE network, and a decreasing residual gain strategy with stochastic supervision is adopted to facilitate the progressive denoising property. The progressive denoising property not only reveals the semantic of the network path but also regularizes the network training. Compared to vanilla DCNNs, the PDNet has clear physical meaning. Meanwhile PDNet simplifies the ResNet in that batch normalization is removed from the residual blocks and there is only one nonlinear unit in a residual block (2 for ResNet). Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets verified that PDNet is not only efficient but also effective.},

This is especially true for power systems with comparatively low inertia, such as smart grids. To mitigate the impact of renewable intermittency on smart grid operation, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is widely employed. Nonetheless, the proper sizing of HESS in smart grids remains a technical challenge. Most of the existing energy storage sizing methods rely on historical data or deterministic renewable generation/load forecasting. Their results can be unconvincing with the presence of uncertainties. To figure out the optimal size of HESS in smart grids using probability-based long-term forecasting, this paper proposes a novel sizing approach with an improved forecasting accuracy .

Finally, the final cipher image with the same resolution as the plain image is acquired by embedding the two encrypted and measured secret images into a carrier image through FFT. To achieve a higher level of security, a new chaotic system combining infinite collapses and a tent map (ICTM) is introduced for disturbing the strong correlation of images and randomly embedding encrypted data into carrier images. The parameters of ICTM are generated by the hash value of the plain images, which enhances the ability of the cryptographic system to resist plaintext attacks . Moreover, the parameters related to the plaintext are embedded into the alpha channel of the visually meaningful cipher image to reduce unnecessary key transmission.

Existing MLAL methods usually perform a one-way selection by considering the examples’ informativeness, representativeness, or diversity. These methods acknowledge only the importance of the examples to the labels, but not vice versa. Due to the imbalanced nature of multi-label data, the selected dataset might also be highly imbalanced, causing negative effects on the learning performance. In this paper, we treat the selection of example-label pairs in MLAL as a two-way matching problem instead of a one-way selection problem. First, the label’s preference for example, defined as the informativeness of the example regarding the label, as well as the example’s preference for the label, which is defined as the probability of the example belonging to a positive class, are both considered. Then, a simple and effective stable matching (STM) model is adopted to realize the two-way selection. In addition, to provide reasonable candidates for the STM model, the roulette algorithm is utilized to allocate the annotation number for sub-classifiers. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach and its effectiveness in selecting a relatively balanced dataset.},

This paper proposes CAE-AD, a novel contrastive autoencoder for anomaly detection in MTS, by introducing multi-grained contrasting methods to extract normal data pattern. First, to capture the temporal dependency of series, a projection layer is employed and a novel contextual contrasting method is applied to learn the robust temporal representation. Second, the projected series is transformed into two different views by using time-domain and frequency-domain data augmentation . Last, an instance contrasting method is proposed to learn local invariant characteristics. The experimental results show that CAE-AD achieves an F1-score ranging from 0.9119 to 0.9376 on the three public datasets, outperforming the baseline methods.},

How to ensure data reliability in an industrial environment is a challenging problem. In this article, we proposed a Truth Detection based Task Assignment (TDTA) scheme to assign micro-tasks to reliable workers and establish a credible task execution environment for crowdsourced IIoT. The TDTA scheme mainly contains three methods for different application scenarios: (1) Direct truth detection method. The Edge Node (EN) will calculate partial micro-tasks results as true results when idle, and compares them with the results reported by workers to detect their reliability directly. (2) Indirect truth detection method. After the platform obtains some trusted workers through the direct method, it distributes the same micro-tasks to workers with unknown credibility and trusted workers, and compares their results to verify reliability indirectly. (3) Post audit truth detection method. When idle, the platform recalculates historical reporting results for suspicious workers to verify their credibility. And the effect of time decay on credibility is considered. Moreover, the TDTA scheme also considers the factors of integrity and delay of the results to calculate the Quality of Service (QoS) value. Then the most active and credible workers are chosen to execute the task. Theoretical analysis and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, which has higher EN resource utilization, task result accuracy, and malicious worker recognition rate.},

These approaches are limited and inefficient because they provide no opportunity to change citizens’ opinions once they have been formed. Furthermore, incorporating auxiliary information to enrich semantic representations is vital and challenging due to limited texts, and a lack of both semantic information and strict syntactic structure. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to extract and integrate multidimensional features from user-related and policy-related social media information and predict policy comment polarity in the policy release phase. First, we construct four machine learning models for model-induced features to capture topic-related and opinion-related features and identify the policy-opinion nexus. In addition, we integrate basic and behavioral user features. Then, we leverage multidimensional features to construct a stacked learning model for predicting the policy opinion. Finally, we conduct experiments on 20 policy comment datasets to demonstrate that our prediction framework can effectively predict public opinion about a policy once it is released. Our model provides key insights into policy opinions in advance and can enable policymakers to engage in better policy communication before opinion formation.},

There are many cluster centers relatively far away from the datum, though. The datum must not be an element of the distant clusters; therefore, it does not need to repeatedly calculate the distances between the datum and the distant cluster centers. In this research, an r -reference points based k -means ( r -RPKM) algorithm is proposed to exclude the distant centers so that only the distances from the datum to the nearer cluster centers are computed in each iteration. The traditional k- means algorithm is susceptible to initial cluster centers, so a maximal distance based initial cluster center (MDICC) decider is hence presented to provide a set of initial cluster centers, therefore accelerating the r -RPKM algorithm.

  abstract     = {Spatio-temporal prediction has drawn much attention given its wide application, of which traffic flow prediction is a typical task. Within the vision of smart cities, traffic flow prediction plays a vital role in traffic control and optimization. The current approaches commonly use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture any spatial correlations and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to mine any temporal correlations. However, GCNs cannot detect spatial heterogeneity and time-varying spatial correlations , and RNNs cannot model the periodicity of traffic series data. Further, iterative training of RNNs may come at a high computational cost and result in problems with error propagation. To this end, we propose STSSN, a spatio-temporal sequence-to-sequence network, that not only explores heterogeneous and time-varying spatial correlations, but also efficiently exploits sequential and periodic temporal correlations. STSSN is based on an encoder-decoder framework. In the network, the model’s input is processed to extract the periodic daily and weekly patterns in traffic flows. Both the encoder and decoder mainly consist of an enhanced diffusion convolutional network (EDCN) and a temporal convolutional network (TCN). In the EDCN module, the diffusion convolution incorporates time-varying node representations so as to capture both node-specific patterns and time-varying spatial correlations. In the TCN module, we take full advantage of the parallel computing in the dilated causal convolution to mine local (short-term) temporal correlations. More importantly, global (long-term) temporal correlations are discovered through an encoder-decoder attention (EDA) module. This EDA mechanism directly models the relationship between the encoder and decoder to mitigate problems with error propagation. Experiments on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of STSSN, with STSSN’s MAE at between 3.85\% - 6.17\% 3.85\%-6.17\% lower than the state-of-the-art baselines on the PEMS-BAY dataset.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in image-denoising tasks. However, increasing the network depth arbitrarily results in vanishing/exploding gradients, which does not improve the image denoising quality. In this study, we propose a true wide CNN (WCNN) to reorganize several convolutional layers . Through wavelet decomposition , all convolutional layers that are originally concentrated on a single information stream to train one image are now distributed among multiple independent subnetworks , each of which has few convolutional layers and is arranged in parallel in the WCNN. Each subnetwork has its own input and output and is supervised by its own loss function to capture image features with a specific direction and scale, allowing the WCNN to have sufficient convolutional layers to capture image features while avoiding vanishing/exploding gradients. In addition, each subnetwork can adopt a suitable CNN structure based on the characteristics of a subband, ensuring that the WCNN is competent in handling a specific range of noise levels using a single set of trained parameters. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations of benchmark datasets and real images reveal that the WCNN outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods.},

  abstract     = {For the planning of integrated energy system (IES), it is of great significance to accurately evaluate the performance of the system’s energy supply in a number of aspects including e.g., economy, operational efficiency, environmental effects and security. In order to address the difficulties associated with uncertainties of evaluation indices, one probabilistic multi-criteria evaluation (PMCE) framework is proposed in this study for a class of integrated energy supply systems. In this framework, the evaluation is carried out based on probability distributions instead of deterministic values of evaluation indices, and to determine the criterion weights in PMCE, a Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is applied to determine the weights required in PMCE to represent the priorities of different criteria. A case study has been carried out to evaluate the overall performce of five energy supply systems with a smart community demonstrative project. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing average-based and maximum entropy principle (MEP)-based approaches and demonstrate good robustness when encountering changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas.},

It can accelerate the convergence speed via reducing adverse effects of outliers on the population. (2) Secondly, a random differential mutation (RDM) inspired by the DE is devised to avoid the individuals trapping into local optimum via getting one more chance to explore optimal position while exploiting local region in each evolution. (3) Thirdly, a targeted exploration method i.e., back-diffusion operation, is proposed inspired by the duality principle to further accelerate the convergence rate and enhance robustness of algorithm.

In this context, Isolation Forest is a popular algorithm able to define an anomaly score by means of an ensemble of peculiar trees called isolation trees. These are built using a random partitioning procedure that is extremely fast and cheap to train. However, we find that the standard algorithm might be improved in terms of memory requirements, latency and performances; this is of particular importance in low resources scenarios and in TinyML implementations on ultra-constrained microprocessors . Moreover, Anomaly Detection approaches currently do not take advantage of weak supervisions: being typically consumed in Decision Support Systems, feedback from the users, even if rare, can be a valuable source of information that is currently unexplored. Beside showing iForest training limitations, we propose here TiWS-iForest, an approach that, by leveraging weak supervision is able to reduce Isolation Forest complexity and to enhance detection performances.

Existing multi-view clustering methods have explored nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose a matrix into multiple matrices for feature representations from multi-view data, which are not discriminative enough to deal with the natural data containing complex information. Moreover, most of multi-view clustering methods prioritize the consensus information among multi-view data, leaving a large amount of information redundant and the clustering performance deteriorated. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-view clustering framework that adopts a diversity loss for deep matrix factorization and reduces feature redundancy while obtaining more discriminative features . We then bridge the relation between deep auto-encoder and deep matrix factorization to optimize the objective function. This method avoids the challenges in the optimization process.

Additionally, two social factors, i.e., emotion and familiarity, were identified in negotiations, the Web-Fechner law was applied to model an agent’s generation of emotion, and a familiarity function was constructed to measure the level of familiarity between negotiating agents. Finally, a stage model for agent-based emotional negotiation which integrates similarity, emotion, and familiarity was established. A series of numerical experiments were conducted and comparative analyses of the proposed model with other similarity measures and existing negotiation models were conducted to test the performance of the proposed model.

The abuse of tampered images would mislead people’s judgment, or even make the society suffer from instability if without any interference. To address this issue, a dual-stream UNet named DS-UNet is presented in this paper to detect image tampering and localize forgery areas. The DS-UNet employs an RGB stream to extract both high-level and low-level manipulated traces for a coarse localization , and adopts a Noise stream to expose the local noise inconsistency for a refined localization . The lightweight hierarchical fusion way provides the DS-UNet with the ability to perceive tampered objects at different scales for the reason that tampered objects always vary in shapes and sizes. After that, the DS-UNet applies a single decoder to receive the abundant low-level manipulated traces and spatial localization information in the skip connection path. Through the decoder, the object details and spatial dimensions are gradually recovered, and the high-resolution prediction maps are generated. In the comparative analysis, more evaluation indices are introduced than the existing works in order to obtain a more comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments with satisfying results on five datasets demonstrate its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set theory can tackle feature redundancy in data and select more informative features for machine learning tasks. Gaussian kernel is often coupled with fuzzy rough set theory to measure fuzzy relation between data instances. However, Gaussian kernel has a serious long-tail phenomenon, which would perform poorly in modeling the fuzzy relation for high-dimensional data. Moreover, a robust feature evaluation function is also nontrivial in a fuzzy rough set model because a naive model may select those non-optimal feature subsets due to the perturbations from redundant features. This paper delves into Student- t kernel and fuzzy divergence to address these challenges for fuzzy rough feature selection. This paper proposes a new Student- t Kernelized Fuzzy Rough Set (SKFRS) model. The new model uses fuzzy divergence to evaluate uncertain information in the data. It also explores a newly-defined feature evaluation function on the biases of the dynamic relation between the relevance and indispensability of features in feature selection process. A novel forward greedy search algorithm is then presented to solve the final objective function. The selected features are subsequently evaluated on downstream classification tasks . Experimental results using real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its superiority against the baseline methods .},

However, limited research has been devoted to learning from partially labeled data with discrete and continuous attributes using TWD. In this study, we propose a TWD-based tri-training model for partially labeled data with heterogeneous attributes. First, a measure of semi-supervised neighborhood mutual information is defined, based on which a heuristic algorithm is developed to generate an optimal semi-supervised reduct of partially labeled data. Then, a tri-training model is trained on the original view along with two views transformed by data discretization and principal component analysis, and the strategy of TWD with entropy minimization is further introduced to classify unlabeled data into useful, uncertain, and useless samples, whereas the multiview tri-training model is iteratively retrained on only a certain number of useful samples with low entropy to improve the performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is theoretically analyzed from the perspective of noise learning. The experimental results of semi-supervised attribute reduction and semi-supervised classification on UCI datasets show that our method is effective in handling partially labeled data and outperforms supervised models trained on all data with full supervision.},

Specifically, adversaries who conducted attacks lacked interpretation from the point of view of DNNs , and the perturbation was not further considered. To address these, we propose an interpretable white-box AE attack approach, DI-AA, which not only explores the application of the interpretable method of deep Taylor decomposition in selecting the most contributing features but also adopts the Lagrangian relaxation optimization of the logit output and L p Lp norm to make the perturbation more unnoticeable. We compare DI-AA with eight baseline attacks on four representative datasets. Experimental results reveal that our approach can (1) attack nonrobust models with low perturbation, where the perturbation is closer to or lower than that of the state-of-the-art white-box AE attacks; (2) evade the detection of the adversarial-training robust models with the highest success rate; (3) be flexible in the degree of AE generation saturation. Additionally, the AE generated by DI-AA can reduce the accuracy of the robust black-box models by 16–31\% in the black-box manner.},

In practice, the ELD problem becomes a non-convex, multi-constraint, non-linear optimization problem when considering the valve point effects, the prohibited operation zones, the ramp rate limit, and the multi-fuel options. To effectively solve this problem, this paper puts forward an improved differential evolution (DE) named OMLIDE based on opposition-mutual learning, hybrid mutation strategy, and parameters adaptive mechanism. OMLIDE differs from the traditional DE in that: (1) an opposition-mutual learning strategy is employed for population initialization to increase the probability of finding an optimal solution; (2) two novel mutation operators named DE/elite-to-ordinary/1 and DE/elite-to-ordinary/2 are hybridized and a selection probability is introduced to regulate them adaptively at different evolutionary stages; and (3) a parameters adaptive mechanism is presented to adjust the scaling factor and crossover rate. The proposed OMLIDE is first validated by the numerical benchmark functions of CEC 2014. Then it is applied to five non-convex ELD problems with valve-point effects and multi-fuel options. Simulation results demonstrate that OMLIDE provides better or highly competitive results in different terms compared with other peer algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The identification of influential nodes in complex networks has been a topic of immense interest. In most cases, the local approach represented by degree centrality performs well but has limitations when dealing with the bridge nodes. In order to solve the problem of being trapped in the locality, researchers have proposed many useful methods. The gravity model is an emerging research direction among them. However, such models have to exhaust the shortest distance between all nodes, which renders them impractical and difficult to run over large graphs. In order to address this issue, we propose a random walk-based gravity model to identify influential spreaders. Our proposed model decreases the time complexity of calculating the shortest distance—a critical step in the conventional gravity models, from O ( | V | 2 ) O(|V|2) to O ( | V | * γ * l r ( l - r ) ) O(|V|*γ*lr(l-r)) , and reduces space complexity of O ( | V | 2 ) O(|V|2) to O ( 2 | V | ) O(&amp;lt;K&amp;gt;2|V|) , where 2 ≪ | V | &amp;lt;K&amp;gt;2≪|V| and γ * l r ( l - r ) ≪ | V | γ*lr(l-r)≪|V| . Some random walk properties are also investigated to support our model. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed gravity centrality, we have verified its spreading ability and convergence speed under different random walk strategies. Experimental results indicate that our method performs far better than most gravity models.},

  abstract     = {It has a long tradition to study trust behavior among humans or artificial agents by investigating the trust game. Although previous studies based on evolutionary game theory have revealed that trust and trustworthiness can be promoted if network structure or reputation is considered, they often assume that interactions among agents are one-shot and investors do not consider the investment environment before making decisions, which collide with many realistic situations. In this paper, we introduce the conditional investment strategy into the repeated N -player trust game, in which conditional investors decide to invest or not depending on their assessment of the trustworthiness level of the group. By using the approach of the Markov decision process , we study the evolutionary dynamics of trust in repeated group interactions with the conditional investment strategy. We find that conditional investors can form an effective alliance with trustworthy trustees, hence they can sweep out untrustworthy trustees. Moreover, we verify that such alliance can exist in a wide range of model parameters. These results may explain why trusting in others and reciprocating them with trustworthy actions can be sustained in game interactions among intelligent agents.},

  abstract     = {Changes in stock markets impact the optimal policies for governments, businesses, and even individual households. Causal networks summarizing pairwise directed dependencies between stocks can be used to characterize these changes, as well as to identify influential stocks whose variations have unusually strong effects on the movements of other stocks. In this paper, we apply Granger causality tests in sliding windows to build directed causal networks representing the interactions of stock markets in the world’s second largest economy, China, during recent economic, trade and epidemiological crises. We propose identifying influential stocks by using distance correlation and surrogate tests, rather than linear Pearson correlation and asymptotic distributions , to quantify the strength of general nonlinear dependencies between network centrality and financial indicators. We find that, at the onset of a crisis, influential stocks gain their position by themselves being attentive to the stock market. As the crisis progresses, the stock market steadily adjusts to give a stronger leadership role to influential stocks at the expense of non-influential stocks. Interestingly, the industries to which influential stocks belong are closely related to the nature of crisis events. Finally, we show that industries which contained influential stocks represented better investments.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-based optimization methods are usually employed to solve expensive black-box optimization problems . Constraints bring more challenges for optimization than unconstrained problems. This study proposes a novel three-stage infilling framework to solve expensive single-objective problems with equality and/or inequality constraints . In the first stage, a criterion for locating a feasible region is designed. Until a feasible solution is found, the first stage is removed in the subsequent process. The second stage exploits the current best feasible solution and explores potentially better solutions. If the infilled site is infeasible, the third stage will proceed to improve the surrogate accuracy around the feasible region boundary and an extra constraint derived from the objective is proposed to reduce the candidate infill region in this stage. Otherwise, the process stays in stage two. Stage two continues once one third-stage point has been sampled. For brevity, the three-stage framework is called CEGO-DI. The efficacy of CEGO-DI is demonstrated by comparing it with two variants of it. In addition, the method is also compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on extensive problems. The experimental results show that CEGO-DI has a better or competitive performance on most problems.},

The MASs are given in a continuous-time setting while information exchange occurs only at the sampling instants. Therefore, the traditional methods for continuous-time or discrete-time models are not applicable. To resolve the problem, a discretization-reconnection method is developed to investigate the consensus control of first-order and second-order MASs, respectively. Some sufficient conditions, explicitly related to the control gains and the sampling step size, are established for both mean-square (m.s.) and almost sure (a.s.) consensus. Under these conditions, consensus can be achieved by designing appropriate control gains and the sampling step size for MASs with given noise intensity and time-delays.

Inspired by this, this paper proposes a Self-exploratory Competitive Swarm Optimization algorithm for Large-scale Multiobjective Optimization (SECSO). Its idea is very simple and there are no parameters that need to be adjusted. Particles evolve by exploring their neighboring space and learning from other particles in the swarm, thereby simultaneously enhancing the diversity and convergence performance of the algorithm. Compared with eight state-of-the-art large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms , the proposed method exhibited outstanding performance on LSMOP problems with up to 10,000 decision variables. Unlike most existing large-scale evolutionary algorithms that usually require a large number of objective evaluations, SECSO shows the ability to find a set of well converged and diverse non-dominated solutions.},

In EOPSO , particles are divided into elite and ordinary members based on their fitness performance. Each elite individual learns from itself to maintain population diversity and achieve high-level global exploration. The ordinary ones fly toward a unified target and carry out some assistant local exploitation. In addition, an information interaction based jump-out strategy is designed to overcome particles stagnation situations. The benchmark functions in CEC 2017 CEC2017 are employed to compare the performance between the proposed EOPSO with 18 optimization methods (8 state-of-the-art PSO variants and 10 recently proposed non - PSO methods). Experimental comparisons demonstrate that, in EOPSO , the particles have the abilities to reasonably adjust population diversity, effectively avoid local optima, and accurately converge to the global optimum.},

  abstract     = {Solving the convergence issues of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of the most outstanding problems in generative models. In this work, we propose a novel activation function to be used as output of the generator agent. This activation function is based on the Smirnov probabilistic transformation and it is specifically designed to improve the quality of the generated data. In sharp contrast to previous works, our activation function provides a more general approach that deals not only with the replication of categorical variables but with any type of data distribution (continuous or discrete). Moreover, our activation function is derivable and therefore, it can be seamlessly integrated in the backpropagation computations during the GAN training processes. To validate this approach, we firstly evaluate our proposal on two different data sets: a) an artificially rendered data set containing a mixture of discrete and continuous variables, and b) a real data set of flow-based network traffic data containing both normal connections and cryptomining attacks. In addition, three publicly available data sets were added to the evaluation to generalize the obtained results. To evaluate the fidelity of the generated data, we analyze their results both in terms of quality measures of statistical nature and regarding the use of these synthetic data to feed a nested machine learning-based classifier. The experimental results evince a clear outperformance of a Wasserstein GAN network (WGAN) tuned with this new activation function with respect to both a naïve mean-based generator and a standard WGAN. The quality of the generated data allows to fully substitute real data with synthetic data for training the nested classifier without a significant fall in the obtained accuracy.},

The filter design technique includes both measurable and immeasurable premise variable cases. In the latter case, the H ∞ H∞ performance criterion is newly defined to minimize the effect of immeasurability on filtering performance. This study also focuses on deriving less conservative design conditions of the filter. First, a novel two-sided looped Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to make full use of the actual sampling pattern. Then, by utilizing an extended reciprocally convex matrix inequality along with Writinger-based integral inequality, less conservative design conditions are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)-based optimal problem. Finally, the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed filtering design techniques are demonstrated through two simulation examples.},

Specifically, the averaged fitness after individual resampling is used as the training sample of the RBN, and then, the trained RBN is used to simulate the fitness functions and estimate the noise-free fitness. Also, to better simulate the shape of the fitness functions, the RBN is adaptively updated based on its estimated error, and its training samples are gradually increased based on the population distribution in the search space.

In particular, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based oversampling can capture the true data distribution of minority class samples and generate new samples, and this approach has demonstrated an outstanding ability to address class imbalance. However, GAN-based oversampling suffers from the issue of class overlap. As a result, in this work, we propose a novel a novel GAN-based hybrid sampling method. The new approach first uses GAN-based oversampling to generate the initial balanced dataset and then applies a novel adaptive neighborhood-based weighted undersampling method to remove generated instances and original majority class instances. This approach not only produces instances that fit the actual data distribution but also significantly reduces the influence of class overlap. Experimental results on artificial data and real-world customer datasets show that the proposed GAN-based hybrid sampling method has better performance than other benchmark methods with both accuracy-based and profit-based evaluation metrics .},

  abstract     = {Owing to the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, deep learning has found applications in data analysis and problem-related decision-making processes. However, because of the “black-box” characteristics of deep neural networks , the explanations of decision-making processes are ambiguous. Therefore, model developers face challenges while establishing users’ trust in these processes and the associated decision results. Understanding and explaining the decision-making processes implemented by deep learning-based predictive models has importance in various fields. Based on existing interpretation algorithms, this study proposed a novel interpretation algorithm for deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The proposed algorithm, known as the neural network interpreter-segmentation recognition and interpretation (NNI-SRI) algorithm, uses the general ideas of segmentation and recognition to interpret models. Compared with other mainstream interpretation algorithms, this algorithm has the following advantages. First, it has a higher model interpretation speed. Second, it can label the positive and negative features observed during the model prediction process. Third, fewer parameters and hardware resources are required because only the forward propagation is used. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm showed better scene adaptability under the premise of ensuring the accuracy of interpretation, which is consistent with the CNN convolution process. Theoretically, the NNI-SRI algorithm can be applied to any model, particularly CNN models, such as InceptionV3, Xception, and ResNet . In this study, the interpretation algorithm was applied to the standard Inception deep network model and the spider sex recognition model developed by us, which achieved excellent results and verified the feasibility of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in robot control, video games , and multi-agent systems. However, most of existing RL models do not generalize. Even a small visual change will greatly deteriorate the performance of RL agents, which limits the generalization and flexibility of RL in real-world applications. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage model in which reinforcement learning agents learn adaptation to changes in the visual environment before learning optimal behavioral policies . In the first stage, we employ domain adaptation to align the distribution of domain-invariant state representations from different domains in the latent feature space. Specifically, we introduce feature-level and pixel-level multi-granularity adversarial loss to constrain the learning of domain-invariant state representations. In the second stage, the RL agent is trained based on the learned domain-invariant state representations. Since the adjusted observation is domain-invariant, the learned policy has strong cross-domain generalization performance . We name the proposed method as Adversarial-based Domain Invariant State Representation (Ad-DISR). At last, we evaluate Ad-DISR on various variants of Car-Racing games and CARLA, an autonomous driving simulator. The results show that our method can achieve better performance on both reward scores and living time in both source and target domains.},

Further, so as to make further improvement of the learning effect of our method, the Adaboost method is embeded to ARABUTWSVM.

In this paper, we propose a Noise Tolerant Drift Detection Method (NTDDM), which is based on two-step detection and validation function to detect drifts, and filters out the false drifts caused by the noise. The NTDDM is compared with six well-known drift detection methods and tested on four benchmarks having different levels. Three performance indicators are proposed to determine whether the drift detection is made within a reasonable time, and the length of time to the known drift starting point. The comparative studies demonstrate that NTDDM outperforms the existing methods, over these performance indicators. Our proposed method has achieved a statistically significant improvement on drift detection compared to the methods in experiment. The proposed NTDDM makes it possible to efficiently and effectively detect drift in a noisy data stream.},

In particular, in industrial fields such as factories, it is also important to find patterns with low value and remove them in order to overcome the economic crisis. Erasable pattern mining has emerged to solve the concern. Traditional erasable pattern mining targeted a binary database containing only information on the existence of items. However, in the real world, data has a variety of properties, such as quantity and profit. Considering these properties makes it possible for more meaningful result patterns to be mined. Therefore, we propose a maximized erasable pattern mining algorithm that uses a list structure as a data structure and takes into account the quantity and price of the item. The proposed method considers the amount and relative benefit of each item to estimate the profit of a transaction and extracts the maximized erasable patterns considering the user’s preference. Moreover, the list structure utilized in the proposed method contains only the essential information for the mining process, which not only allows the mining to be performed efficiently, but also reduces memory usage. Using various real-world and synthetic datasets , we evaluate runtime, memory efficiency, and scalability of the suggested technique and state-of-the-art competitors.

Models typically have their input sizes hardcoded, and have limitations in handling data with high missing rates or changes in available variables. We propose an attention-based neural network combined with a novel real number representation, which requires little work on manually selecting variables, and in which missing data can be overlooked, making imputation unnecessary. In this proposed model, data analysis can be one step, omitting the first step of imputing missing values.

This work proposes a general opinion dynamics framework of bounded confidence and repulsion, which includes social network interactions and agent-independent time-varying rationality. We extensively analyze the performance of our model to show that the degree of extremization among a population can be controlled by the repulsion rule, and social networks promote extreme opinions. Agent-based rationality and time-varying adaptation also bear a strong impact on opinion dynamics. The high accuracy of our model is determined in a real-world social network well referenced in the literature, the Zachary Karate Club (with a known ground truth).

  abstract     = {A novel nonlinear hybrid vehicle routing problem is examined, and its nonlinear component is linearised considering the transportation costs associated with electricity and traditional fuel-based driving. Due to the fact that the transportation cost and fuel consumption involve the twofold uncertainty of randomness and fuzziness, and only partial probability distribution information may be available. Therefore, these two parameters are considered as random fuzzy variables with ambiguous probability distributions. An ambiguous equilibrium risk value objective function and an ambiguous equilibrium chance constraint are formulated. Accordingly, a distributionally robust equilibrium approach is proposed, in which the ambiguity sets are used to characterize the ambiguous probability distributions of the random fuzzy variables. Specifically, this paper first applies the central limit theorem to construct the ambiguity sets. Subsequently, the inner ambiguous probability constraint and the outer credibility constraint are derived into their equivalent counterparts, respectively. In this manner, the proposed model is successfully converted into a mixed integer second-order cone programming model, where the conventional branch-and-cut algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal routing. Finally, the performance of the proposed model and its price of distributional robustness are verified in the numerical experiments. Overall, the main achievements of this paper are summarized as (1) the proposal of a distributionally robust equilibrium optimization model for a nonlinear hybrid vehicle routing problem, (2) the definitions of an ambiguous equilibrium risk value objective function and an ambiguous equilibrium chance constraint under twofold uncertainty, and (3) the derivation of an equivalent second-order cone programming model for computationally solvable.},

This work touches upon the opacity problem in discrete event systems modeled with labeled Petri nets , by assuming the existence of an active intruder. Herein, an active intruder, whose abilities exceed passive observations, is assumed to be able to manipulate the behavior of a system through sensor attacks in a practical manner, i.e., in an embedded way, in order to compromise the opacity of a system. In this setting, a framework for opacity verification is first proposed from the intruder’s viewpoint, where opacity is referred to as “language-based opacity”. A verification algorithm is then derived to identify opaque secret words. Two stealthy attack models named sensor-failure-making strategy and sensor-injection-making strategy are introduced, allowing the intruder to implant/damage some sensors, i.e., add/delete some events, in line with the original behavior of a system, in order to infer the secret information. An algorithmic procedure for attractability analysis is provided for each attack strategy. Once a system is proved to be attackable, a stealthy attack structure that synthesizes different sensor-failure-making (resp. sensor-injection-making) attacks is constructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed approaches by implementing the presented algorithms and running experiments on a manufacturing system example.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer is critical in making use of data from multi-source domains, but most existing techniques are not privacy-preserving. Nowadays, data leakage, together with the advancement of big-data-driven Artificial Intelligence , has raised huge concerns over data security. The neglect of privacy makes such approaches impractical. For addressing intrusion detection tasks, the Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) concatenates and jointly optimizes a compression and an estimation network in an unsupervised manner . However, DAGMM still suffers from the lack of diversely distributed intrusion samples in real-life scenarios where organizations are neither willing nor legally allowed to engage in data sharing. Given the increasing public concern over data privacy and scandals, federated learning which only allows model parameter sharing is thus proposed to enhance model performance while preserving data privacy. Moreover, it also addresses the competitive concerns on the part of organizations when sharing data with their rivals. This study proposes a Federated Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (F-DAGMM) to build up privacy-preserving knowledge transfer, to further support inter-organizational cooperation and high-level decision making. A two-phase federated optimization strategy is proposed to address the performance degradation caused by the significant differences in the individual clients’ data distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed F-DAGMM.},

Additionally, we verify that Principal Component Analysis allows summarizing the information contained in the initial variables from the first new component. Our findings confirm that a filtering asset screening rule strategy is relevant and necessary. In this respect, passive management of midterm equal-weighted pharmaceutical portfolios outperforms both the pure financial and the healthcare investment strategies used during the pandemic.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised partial label learning is an emerging weakly supervised learning paradigm dealing with partially labeled data and unlabeled data simultaneously. The supervision information is weak and even missing for training instances. Most existing researches simply propagate labels to unlabeled data and focus on inducing a weighted classifier model , ignoring the importance of acquiring reliable label confidences for training instances. In this paper, by label set assignment, the valid label supervision information can be preserved and propagated to unlabeled instances to a greater extent. Then, the training instances are projected into a lower-dimensional feature space. Reliable label confidence can be obtained by maximizing the dependence between the feature description and the associated label information. After that, the predictive model can be induced by preserving the intrinsic manifold structure in both feature space and label space. Accordingly, a novel semi-supervised partial label learning approach via dependence-maximized label set assignment ( Dlsa ) is proposed, where an accurate and robust model can be induced based on reliable label confidences obtained by label set assignment and dependence-maximized dimensionality reduction. Extensive experiments on five real-world data sets validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

It can optimize the allocation of testing resources by indicating the defect-prone software modules. In recent years, ensemble learning has been frequently used in SDP. Ensemble learning can effectively improve the generalization ability of individual learners, but how to increase the diversity of individual learners is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a random approximate reduct-based ensemble algorithm called ERAR. To increase the diversity of learners generated by ERAR, a novel technique, called random approximate reduct (RAR), is proposed to perturb the attribute space, and the resampling technique is used to perturb the instance space. RAR is derived from the random subspace method and the granular decision entropy-based reduct in rough set theory. We then investigate the application of ERAR in SDP. In order to alleviate the class imbalance issue in SDP, we further design a hybrid mechanism by combining ERAR with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Experimental results on 20 benchmark data sets show that the hybrid mechanism can provide competitive solutions for SDP.},

  abstract     = {The multi-view learning is a fundamental problem in the multimedia analysis. However, most existing multi-view learning methods need to calculate a similarity matrix for each view. This operation has two drawbacks. Firstly, the construction of the similarity matrix needs a fixed function. But, in fact, the internal relationship between data points changes continuously. The fixed graph representation matrix is not conducive to fully consider the heterogeneous information about different views. Secondly, the similarity matrix of each view is used to participate independently in the subsequent calculation, which ignores the correlation and importance of different views. In our paper, an adaptive K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and graph-based auto-weighted multi-view consensus spectral clustering (KGWMC) is proposed. An adaptive KNN method is used to calculate a similarity matrix for each view, which is updated in the subsequent iteration process . An adaptive joint optimization strategy is used to fuse multiple views for obtaining a consensus graph. In this step, instead of using a fixed function to calculate the weight of each view, we transform the weight calculation into an optimization problem for iteratively updating the weight of each view in a non-parametric form. The main novelty of KGWMC is the learning method of each similarity matrix and consensus graph in a mutual reinforcement manner. When the consensus graph converges, the spectral clustering algorithm is implemented to it for obtaining the final clustering . Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it with nine state-of-the-art algorithms on six real datasets.},

In spectral clustering, the efficient construction of a sparse similarity graph is one of the primary concerns because it influences both the clustering performance as well as the computational time. The sparser the similarity graph , the faster the computation of the eigenvectors , thus improving the overall clustering time. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free method to construct a sparse proximity graph based on the intrinsic structural information of the data points. The proposed method first divides the data into several partitions and then determines the pairs of neighboring partitions using the representative points of each partition. We propose a method called inter-partition MST (IPM) to capture the local proximity information of a neighboring pair. The size of the proposed graph is O ( N ) , where N is the number of data points. For clustering, we apply multi-way spectral clustering on the proposed sparse similarity graph. Experimental analyses demonstrate that in terms of cluster quality, computational time and sparsity of the graph, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other spectral clustering methods.},

It is of paramount importance to exploit label correlations in previous methods. However, there exist two unsolved issues in most of existing methods. First, most of existing methods explore label correlations based on the original label space with redundant and irrelevant label information. Second, previous methods either consider second-order label correlations or high-order label correlations, in fact, both two types of label correlations are significant and complementary for capturing label information. To this end, this paper proposes a robust multi-label feature selection method with both two types of label correlations. To start with, we introduce the self-expression model to consider the high-order label correlations, additionally, the l 2 , 1 l2,1 -norm is imposed onto the self-expression coefficient matrix to eliminate redundant and noisy information. Furthermore, we employ a label-level regularizer to achieve pairwise label correlations. Finally, an optimization scheme with convergence proof is designed to deal with the objective function. Multiple experimental analysis results on fourteen multi-label data sets manifest that the classification performance of the proposed method outperforms other baselines.},

  abstract     = {Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms have been widely employed for solving optimization problems . Their ability to find optimal solutions depends heavily on the parameterization of the pheromone trails. However, the pheromone parameterization mechanisms in existing ACO algorithms have two major shortcomings: 1) pheromone trails are instance-specific; hence they need to be generated for each new problem instance, 2) solution is constructed based on static pheromone trails, which ignores the impact of the evolving decisions on the final solution. In this paper, we study the personalized journey route planning problem on multimodal public transport networks (MMPTN) that considers multiple travel criteria. The problem is addressed with a weighted sum method , which provides a journey route that best matches passenger’s preference vector consisting of multiple travel criteria. We propose a Machine Learning (ML) based Max–Min Ant System (called ML-MMAS) to solve optimization problems by incorporating ML techniques into Ant Colony Optimization algorithms. ML-MMAS learns a pheromone function to directly produce prominent pheromone trails in order to construct solutions for any new instance, without the need to initialize and update the pheromone trails from scratch. We propose a self-learning framework to train the ML-MMAS using incremental solutions generated by MMAS, hence avoiding the need for pre-computed optimal solutions. Specifically, we develop a deep learning-based pheromone prediction model. We design several groups of features to train the model to characterize the evolving states of the search space during solution construction. Finally, we propose a solution component embedding (SCE) model to learn representations of solution components (transit services), which takes into account the transferability among transit services and passenger transfer preferences. The SCE model enables the extraction of high-quality features for the solution components. It can also be directly applied to solve other optimization problems with solutions that can be modeled as sequences of solution components. We evaluate the proposed ML-MMAS by comparing with exact algorithms and the underlying MMAS, using the MMPTN and passenger demands of Singapore. Results show that ML-MMAS is significantly faster than both the exact algorithm and the original MMAS, while achieving near-optimal solutions.},

Because of the high cost of manual annotation of the datasets, topic model-based approaches that model the joint distributions of both topics and sentiments have been studied previously. Some studies proposed models that leverage the prior knowledge derived from the pre-trained word embeddings and have proven effective. However, most of the existing models are based on the assumption that words and topics are conditionally independent, ignoring the dependency relations among them. Additionally, the fine-tuning of the pre-trained word embeddings to incorporate the contextual information is also neglected in these models. This could result in the ambiguous representations of topics. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised graph-based joint sentiment topic model (W-GJST) that integrates an edge-gated graph convolutional network (E-GCN) into a joint sentiment-topic model. An importance sampling-based training method is proposed to learn the contextual representations of topics and words efficiently. Additionally, a self-training multi-topic classifier is designed for the multi-label topic identification. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed W-GJST compared to the baseline models in terms of topic modelling, topic identification and topic-sentiment identification.},

This article assesses the impact of widely applied techniques, mainly data augmentation and multilevel and ensemble configurations, in deep learning-based CAD systems. Our assessment included five scenarios: three binary classification problems and two multiclass classification problems. The evaluation was performed using 3,536 images from 18 datasets, and it was possible to conclude that data augmentation techniques improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Furthermore, there is an improvement in the classification results using a combination of CNNs . For the binary problems, the performance of the ensemble configuration was superior to that of the multilevel configuration. However, the results were statistically similar in multiclass scenarios. The results were promising, with accuracies of 94.73\% and 94.59\% obtained using multilevel and ensemble configurations in a scenario with four classes. The combination of methods helps to reduce the error or variance of the predictions, which improves the accuracy of the used deep learning-based model.},

Previous PU learning methods always ignore the additional information called privileged information, which is just provided during the training process while unavailable during testing. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced algorithm for PU learning with privileged information (SPUPI). The proposed SPUPI extracts some reliable negative samples from unlabeled samples at first, and then generates weights for the unlabeled samples according to the similarity with each class. After that, it builds a more accurate classifier based on privileged information and similarity weights by self-paced learning. By taking the self-paced learning into training, we can build the model with a few labeled samples from easy to complex. We also solve the problem by transforming the primal problem of the proposed model into its dual problem and achieving the PU classifier. Various experiments on the practical datasets indicate that the SPUPI has a better performance compared with previous methods.},

In ZSL tasks, unseen classes share local attribute semantics with seen classes. However, most ZSL methods directly learn an embedding from global feature space to semantic space, which may fail to discover local attribute semantics and cause the strong bias problem. In this paper, a novel method called region interaction and attribute embedding (RIAE) is proposed. RIAE consists of two modules: the region graph network (RGN) and the attribute feature embedding (AFE). RGN constructs a region graph where each region (image patch) is regarded as a graph node for region interaction. That is, through the graph-convolution operations of RGN, the node features can aggregate the information from their neighboring node features and update themselves. In order to learn the compatibility between the updated node features and local attribute semantics, AFE is designed to assign high attention weights to the node features which have large compatibilities with attribute semantic vectors . Relying on attribute semantic vectors rather than human annotations, RIAE can adaptively extract and update local attribute features, and further learn an embedding from attribute feature space to semantic space. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that RIAE gets state-of-the-art or competitive performances.},

Firstly, a new covert channel is established to conceal the existence of the secret data exchange by exploiting the dynamical system’s measurements with no extra communication overhead . The covert channel evades the imperceptible and statistical detections in an effective manner. Next, combining covert transmission with data consistency, a data-based attack detection methodology is explored, which is capable of detecting a broad class of cyber-attacks and differs from the existing detection methods that enhance detection performance by degrading system performance or adding redundant systems. Then, combining covert transmission with simple linear encryption, an eavesdropping defense methodology is proposed, which guarantees that the authorized user’s estimation performance is optimal and renders the eavesdropper’s error covariance unbounded. Moreover, the detection and defense methods take small memory and computational overhead of the embedded system , which ensures the ease of implementation in real-world systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed security framework is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept implementation on a CPS prototype called permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) monitoring system.},

The construction of a full connection graph with heavy computational complexity , however, is separated from the optimization of transformation matrix . In order to solve significant computational burden, we design anchor-based graph and unify the construction of graph and optimization of transformation matrix into a framework called fast unsupervised embedding learning with anchor-based graph (FUAG) which not only can avoid the impact of noises and redundant features in original space, but also can capture local structure of data in subspace precisely. Our method additionally incorporates the discriminant information of data captured by using trace difference form. Meanwhile, it optimizes the anchor-based graph partitioning problem with Constrained Laplacian Rank in order to ensure that the number of connected components is exactly equal to the number of classes. We also impose ℓ 0 ℓ0 norm constraint on each point to avoid trivial solutions and propose an efficient iterative algorithm . Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm.},

To describe the dynamic stochastic jumping behavior of system states, a novel nonhomogeneous Markov process is proposed, whose time-varying transition probabilities are orchestrated by a higher-level deterministic switching signal. Additionally, a novel control law is built by considering the random occurrence of cyber-attacks, and cyber-attacks rates are uncertain. Meanwhile, the saturation mechanism is adopted in designing an asynchronous controller, which is capable of eliminating the impact of cyber-attacks to a certain extent. In the end, two simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Most current captioning metrics rely on token-level matching between candidate caption and the ground truth label sentences. It usually neglects the sentence-level information. Motivated by the auto-encoder mechanism and contrastive representation learning advances, we propose a learning-based metric I 2 CE I2CE (Intrinsic Image Captioning Evaluation). For learning the evaluation metric , we develop three progressive model structures capturing the sentence level representations–single branch model, dual branches model, and triple branches model. For evaluation of the proposed metric, we select one automatic captioning model and collect human scores on the quality of the generated captions. We introduce a statistical test on the correlation between human scores and metric scores. Our proposed metric I 2 CE I2CE achieves the Spearman correlation value of 51.42, which is better than the score of 41.95 achieved by one recently proposed BERT-based metric. The result is also better than the conventional rule-based metrics. Extensive results on the Composite-coco dataset and PASCAL-50S also validate the effectiveness of our proposed metric. The proposed metric could serve as a novel indicator of the intrinsic information between captions, which complements the existing ones.},

  abstract     = {Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) is a new multi-modal weakly supervised task which aims to detect and localize events leveraging the partial alignment of audio and visual streams and weak labels. We identified two significant challenges in the AVVP: Cross-mode semantic misalignment and Contextual audio-visual dataset bias. For challenge 1, the existing methods tend to leverage the temporal similarity of the features. However, it is inappropriate for our AVVP task because multi-modal features with the same label do not always have the same semantics. Thus, we propose an instance-adaptive multi-modal time series max-margin loss (MTSM) which uses the temporal information to align features adaptively. Furthermore, to restrict the inescapable noise introduced during the feature fusion , we reuse the expression of MTSM in the single-mode. For the second challenge, we argue that bias mitigation should seek help from model generalization. Thus, we propose collocating pre-trained models: either” traverse” or based on domain-adaptation. First, we prove a hypothesis and then propose a method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM) to decouple the optimal pre-trained model collocation solution, which reduces the time consumption. Experiments show that our method outperforms the contrastive methods.},

They either conduct deep representation learning and clustering in a separate manner, or use the pseudo cluster labels to supervise deep representation learning. In this paper, we propose a centroids-guided deep multi-view k -means clustering method, which organically incorporates deep representation learning into the multi-view k -means objective by using the cluster centroids in multi-view k -means to guide the deep learning of each view. In turn, more k -means-friendly representations are produced to further optimize the multi-view k -means objective. The cluster centroids of each view obtained under a common clustering partition not only represent the semantic information of the clusters but also imply consistency among different views. By reducing the loss between each representation and its assigned cluster centroid with respect to the network parameters of each view, the representations of different views will be more k -means-friendly toward a common partition.

Specifically, in the proposed model, the indicator matrix is directly learned from multiple orthogonal spectral embeddings, avoiding the random clustering results caused by post-processing; The orthogonal form of the indicator matrix approximates multiple orthogonal spectral embeddings on the Grassmann manifold, fully uncovering subspace information of views and thus improving clustering performance; Both implicitly and explicitly weighted learning mechanisms are established to capture inconsistencies among different views. Moreover, an efficient algorithm with rigorous convergence guarantee is derived to optimize the proposed model.

Besides that, when compared to the traditional SFC framework, a time-varying delay is involved with the AEDADT switching rule in control gain matrices that are considered for the first time to tackle the stabilization problem. Further, the AEDADT switching property is considered for proposed nonlinear systems, and it contributes to getting more information about previous modes. Based on the proposed membership function dependent exponential LKF, new sufficient conditions are carried out to stabilize the proposed nonlinear systems in terms of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique. To support the applicability and efficacy of the proposed controller scheme, the tunnel diode circuit system model is illustrated.

However, real multi-view data is not only simply high-dimensional, but also contains noise and redundant information, so the learned affinity graphs may be unreliable, let alone optimal, and produce inaccurate clustering results . Moreover, existing graph learning based multi-view projection models only learn a common graph or a shared low-dimensional embedding matrix , which fails to preserve the flexible local manifold geometry of each view. To alleviate these problems, a novel consensus graph-based auto-weighted multi-view projection clustering (CGAMPC) is developed, which performs dimensionality reduction, manifold structure preservation and consensus structured graph learning simultaneously. To be specific, the ℓ 2 , 1 ℓ2,1 -norm is leveraged to resist noise and adaptively select discriminative features . Meanwhile, to preserve the manifold structure information of all views, we construct informative similarity graphs for the projection data, and fuse them into a consensus structured graph via an auto-weighted synthesis strategy. Furthermore, an effective alternating iterative algorithm is presented to optimize our CGAMPC.

Current GNN approaches focus on learning representations in a Euclidean space , which are effective in capturing non-tree-like structural relations, but they fail to model complex relations in many real-world graphs, such as tree-like hierarchical graph structure. This paper instead proposes to learn representations in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces to model these two types of graph geometries. To this end, we introduce a novel approach – Joint hyperbolic and Euclidean g eo m etry c ontrastive graph neural networks (JointGMC). JointGMC is enforced to learn multiple layer-wise optimal combinations of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries to effectively encode diverse complex graph structures. Further, the performance of most GNNs relies heavily on the availability of large-scale manually labeled data. To mitigate this issue, JointGMC exploits proximity-based self-supervised information in different geometric spaces (i.e., Euclidean, hyperbolic, and Euclidean-hyperbolic interaction spaces) to regularize the (semi-) supervised graph learning. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world graph datasets show that JointGMC outperforms eight state-of-the-art GNN models in diverse graph mining tasks, including node classification , link prediction, and node clustering tasks , demonstrating JointGMC’s superior graph representation ability.

Carbon regulatory and environmental changes around the world, as well as growing consumer concerns about carbon emissions, are forcing supply chain managers to redefine carbon emissions. This paper uses big data technology to investigate an integrated transportation planning and retailing optimization problem of supply chain network under different carbon regulatory policies. Different from previous literature, we adopt the uncertainty theory to deal with the uncertainty in big data information and characterize the parameters in the integrated optimization problem as uncertain variables. Four uncertain optimization models under different carbon regulatory policies are established, and their equivalent forms and mathematical properties are discussed based on the inverse uncertainty distribution. The impacts of the different carbon regulatory policies on supply chain performance are analyzed through computational experiments. The research results can not only help supply chain managers make transportation planning and product retailing decisions in the sustainable supply chain network, but also assist governments to formulate effective carbon regulatory policies.},

The HAHA 2019 challenge corpus and the Adult dataset were used to evaluate the system. The experimental results show that: i) a better solution can be built by ensembling a subset of the already tested models; ii) the performance of ensemble methods depends on the collection of base models used; and, iii) ensuring diversity using the double-fault measure produces better results than the disagreement measure.

The online social network (OSN) provides researchers with another perspective for detecting individuals suffering from depression. However, existing machine learning-based depression detection studies still leave relatively low classification performance, suggesting that there is significant improvement potential in their feature engineering. In this paper, we manually build and publish a large dataset on Sina Weibo (a leading OSN with the largest number of active users in the Chinese community), namely the Weibo User Depression Detection Dataset (WU3D). It includes more than 20,000 normal users and more than 10,000 depressed users, both of which are labeled and rechecked following the DSM-5 official medical and psychological depression document by professionals. Then, we conclude and propose ten statistical features by analyzing the user’s text, social behavior, and posted pictures. In the meantime, text-based word features are extracted using the popular pretrained model XLNet. Moreover, we fuse these features from heterogeneous modalities and implement a multitask learning scheme to train our proposed deep neural network classification model , i.e. FusionNet (FN). The experimental results show that FN has excellent to recognize depressed users on the OSN, achieving the highest F1-Score of 0.9772 on the test set. Compared to existing studies, the proposed method has better classification performance and robustness for unbalanced training samples, as well as reasonable training and inference time. Our work provides a method to fuse multimodal information to detect individual-level depression and has reference significance for similar studies on other OSNs.},

In this paper we analyze the landscapes of convolutional neural network architecture search spaces to provide insight into appropriate search algorithms for these spaces. Using a classical fitness landscape analysis approach (fitness distance correlation) and a more recent tool (local optima networks) we study the global structure of these spaces. Our analysis on six image classification datasets reveals that the landscapes are multi-modal, but with relatively few local optima from which it is not hard to escape with a simple perturbation operator. This led us to explore the performance of iterated local search, which we found to more effectively search the training landscapes than three evolutionary algorithm variants. Evolutionary algorithms, however, outperformed iterated local search in terms of generalization on problems with larger discrepancies between the training and testing landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) images that are capable to quantitatively measure the cerebral blood flow receive increasing research attention in recent dementia diagnosis studies. However, this important imaging modality is unfortunately not commonly seen in many well-established image-based dementia datasets. Hence, synthesizing ASL images to supplement the important modality in these datasets for further improving the accuracy of dementia diseases diagnosis is quite important and valuable. In this study, a novel locally-constrained generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based ensemble is introduced to fulfill the ASL image synthesis task for improving the dementia diseases diagnosis performance. Technically, new attention-based feature pyramid-GAN models are designed as local models of the novel ensemble. Also, multi-Gaussian-distributed noise is generated from a new flow-based generative model and utilized in medical image synthesis , for the first time. Experiments have been conducted to reveal the effectiveness of the novel GAN ensemble. Comparisons between the novel GAN ensemble and many other state-of-the-art methods in medical image synthesis have been carried out. Statistical analyses have suggested that, accuracies of dementia diseases diagnosis can be significantly improved with the help of the novel GAN ensemble, which brings about 41.62\% 41.62\% performance improvement based on a 355-demented-patient dataset and approximately 25\% 25\% performance improvement from the well-known ADNI-1 dataset.},

However, the approximate inference could be performed in the embedding space, if confidence, real-value representation of the uncertainty of knowledge facts, can be learned by neural networks . To tackle this, a simple yet effective confidence predicting method is proposed, and several approximate inferring are efficiently performed based on these predictions. The model is a two-step model: knowledge elements embedding step, in which knowledge facts regarded as short sentences are fed into the natural language model to get entity and relation embedding vectors; and confidence learning step, in which the confidence distribution of knowledge facts in the knowledge graph are learned utilizing the recurrent neural network in order to carry out approximate inference. The experience demonstrates that the model achieves better results than state-of-the-art on the link prediction task over uncertain knowledge graph embedding . Uncertainty inferring grounded on predicted confidence is more accurate, feasible, and meaningful for serval knowledge inferring tasks: transitivity , composition inferring, and probabilistic soft logic inferring. Likewise, the proposed approach achieves the best tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy of uncertain knowledge graph embedding and inferring, and can be used to handle large size knowledge graphs at lower time consumption because of the simplicity.},

In such scenarios, the task is to suggest items to users to consume next, given their past interaction history, e.g., the next movie to watch or the next item to place in the shopping cart. A number of machine learning models were proposed recently for the task of sequential recommendation, with the latest ones based on deep learning techniques, in particular on Transformers. Given the often surprisingly competitive performance of simpler nearest-neighbor methods for the related problem of session-based recommendation, we investigate the use of nearest-neighbor methods for sequential recommendation problems. Our analysis on four datasets shows that nearest-neighbor methods achieve comparable or better performance than the recent Transformer-based bert4rec method on two of them. However, the deep learning method outperforms the simple methods for the two larger datasets, confirming previous hypotheses that neural methods work best when more data is available. As a further result of our experiments, we found additional evidence that sampled metrics must be used with care, as they may not be predictive of an algorithm ranking that would be observed with the non-sampled, full evaluation.},

The goal is to devise a novel control method which can not only reduce actuator consumption but also guarantee the state consensus of the controlled systems. Two event-triggered mechanisms are considered, namely, the static event-triggered mechanism and the dynamic event-triggered mechanism. To this end, a novel distributed static event-triggered control algorithm is presented at first. Then the distributed dynamic event-triggered control algorithm is developed. The major superiority of the presented distributed static and dynamic event-triggered control algorithms is that the controller of each agent is only triggered at its own event time, which effectively reduces the update frequency of the controller in practice. Further, the minimum inter-event time is adjustable by the parameter of the parametric Lyapunov equation , which makes it easier to find a trade-off between the inter-event times and the control performance of the controlled system. Subsequently, it is proved that the consensus of the multi-agent systems is reached asymptotically and non-occurrence of the Zeno phenomenon is proved. The superiority of the designed algorithms is testified by the simulation.},

Several approaches for the estimation of Laplacian spectrum of the Kronecker product of graphs have been proposed in recent years. However, it turns out that not all the methods are practical to apply in network science models, particularly in the context of multilayer networks. Here we develop a practical and computationally efficient method to estimate Laplacian spectra of this graph product from spectral properties of their factor graphs , which is more stable than the alternatives proposed in the literature. We emphasize that the median of percentage errors of our estimated Laplacian spectrum almost coincides with the x -axis, unlike the alternatives having sudden jumps. The percentage errors confined up to ± ± 10\% for all considered approximations , depending on graph density. Moreover, we theoretically prove that the percentage errors become smaller when the network grows or the edge density level increases. Additionally, some novel theoretical results considering the exact formulas and lower bounds related to the certain correlation coefficients corresponding to the estimated eigenvectors are presented.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation aims at alleviating distribution discrepancy when transferring knowledge from a large-scale labeled source domain to a new unlabeled target domain. A prevailing method is adversarial feature adaptation, which generates transferable features via aligning feature distributions across domains to bound domain discrepancy. However, such approach renders suboptimal performances and vulnerable to negative transfer when target domain has less number of classes compared to source domain as in partial domain adaptation. To address this issue, previous methods adopt a transferable feature norm strategy to adapting feature norms of two domains achieving significant transfer gains. Nonetheless, these works do not consider the intrinsic limitation of the architecture design of deep neural networks which greatly influences the loss function of transferability. In this paper, we propose Transferable Regularization and Normalization ( TRN ), which simultaneously avoids negative transfer via adapting feature norms of both domains and facilitates positive transfer via replacing the existing normalization techniques in mainstream deep backbones. As a general approach, TRN can be simply embedded into deep transfer learning approaches. After a thorough evaluation of proposed method utilizing several benchmark datasets (Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, Office-Home and VisDA-2017). TRN yielded the state-of-the-art results and outperformed other approaches (IFAN, PADA) by a large margin (0.5\%, 7.74\%) for various domain adaptation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Selecting seed nodes (most influential nodes) in networks has attracted attention due to seed nodes’ ability to influence and spread information. Seed nodes are essential to understanding the spreading and controlling of the information dynamics of the networks. Influence maximization (IM) is predominant in monolayer networks. After the advancements and widespread usage of social networks, applying influence maximization to multilayer networks is gaining popularity. Identifying influential nodes precisely in multilayer networks is a challenging and yet unexplored task. Based on studies, individuals in a community interact frequently and are more likely to influence each other. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes community-based influence maximization (CBIM) model to find k seed nodes in multilayer networks. CBIM has two phases: In the first phase, CBIM uses the function FIC ( M ) FIC(M) to find the small communities from a multilayer network based on dice neighborhood similarity. It uses the function CSC ( CS init , θ ) CSC(CSinit,θ) to merge smaller communities and generate larger communities to improve communities’ quality. In the second phase, CBIM computes Edge Weight Sum (EWS) for each node in a community and ranks the nodes based on EWS. CBIM uses the quota-based approach to select the seed node set from the communities based on the ranks. A comparative study of various influence maximization (IM) algorithms shows that the CBIM algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art. The simulation studies have shown that CBIM can detect a set of most influential nodes on real-time datasets under various settings and environments.},

To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a new learning model named as Superpixel-guided Locality Quaternion Representation (SLQR) for color face hallucination. Rather than handling squared patches with fixed size, the proposed method handles superpixels with adaptive shapes segmented from face images according to semantic contents, which can well preserve the face spatial features . Moreover, the superpixels are mapped into quaternion space to exploit the inherent spectral information for color image reconstruction. In addition, considering that images are inevitably corrupted by noise in practice, we extend the SLQR to the robust version (W-SLQR) by introducing a proper reweighting strategy into the objective function to suppress noise. Compared to some state-of-the-art methods, various experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our proposed methods in hallucinating clean and noisy face images.},

Considering the complexity and randomness of users’ movement, most of the existing service migration strategies based on two-way decisions (namely either migrate or not migrate) may make wrong decisions, which will increase the energy consumption and significantly impact users’ experience. To address such an issue, we employ three-way decisions for service migration. Specifically, first, based on users’ movement trajectory, we allocate users into three regions: migration region, non-migration region and delay region. Afterwards, we execute different operations for users in different regions accordingly. In the migration region, considering the energy consumption and service delay time , we propose a new service migration method which utilizes the latest migration radius and the lowest energy consumption for service migration. In the delay region, the edge server will keep collecting users’ movement information to prepare for the further decision making. In the non-migration region, no action is required by the edge server. Comprehensive simulation experiments using parameter settings consistent with real-world edge computing environments are conducted to show its superior performance compared with other strategies.},

We propose a novel dictionary learning method to recognise images of handwritten numbers. Our focus is to maximise the sparse-representation and discrimination power of the class-specific dictionaries. We, for the first time, adopt a new feature space, i.e., histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), to generate dictionary columns (atoms). The HOG features robustly describe fine details of hand-writings. We design an objective function followed by a minimisation technique to simultaneously incorporate these features. The proposed cost function benefits from a novel class-label penalty term constraining the associated minimisation approach to obtain class-specific dictionaries. The results of applying the proposed method on various handwritten image databases in three different languages show enhanced classification performance ( ∼ 98\% ) (∼98\%) compared to other relevant methods. Moreover, we show that combination of HOG features with dictionary learning enhances the accuracy by 11\% 11\% compared to when raw data are used. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves comparable results to that of existing deep learning models under the same experimental conditions but with a fraction of parameters.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based sparse feature selection plays an important role in semi-supervised feature selection. However, traditional graph-based semi-supervised sparse feature selection separates graph construction from feature selection, which may reduce the performance of model because of noises and outliers. Moreover, sparse feature selection selects features based on the learned projection matrix . Therefore, redundant features are always selected by sparse model since similar features often have similar weights, which will weaken the performance of the algorithm. To alleviate the impact of the above problems, in this study, a novel semi-supervised sparse feature selection framework is proposed, in which the quality of the similarity matrix is improved by adaptive graph learning and the negative influence of redundant features is relieved via redundancy minimization regularization . In addition, based on this framework, two specific methods are given and a unified iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the objective function. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with seven advanced semi-supervised methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 score. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods are superior to some advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multiobjective optimization problems commonly arise in real-world applications. In the presence of constraints and multiple conflicting objectives, finding a set of feasible solutions which can best tradeoff different objectives is quite challenging. In this study, an ε ε -constrained multiobjective differential evolution using linear population size expansion is proposed to solve such a kind of problems. First, the ε ε -constraint-handling method, which originally solves constrained optimization problems with only one objective, is further improved to handle constraints in a multiobjective optimization way. Second, to achieve a better approximation to the feasible Pareto front , a linear population size expansion strategy is developed. Once enough feasible solutions have been found, the population size will be linearly increased to find more promising solutions. As a result, a simple yet efficient constrained multiobjective differential evolution is proposed. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on 35 benchmark test functions with different numbers of constraints and objectives. Obtained results are compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Empirical results and comparisons demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves better or at least comparable performance to the competitors, and is capable of obtaining a set of representative feasible solutions for the selected real-world constrained multiobjective optimization problems, especially for highly constrained problems.},

If the task is too complicated, the expert sample trajectories obtained artificially often have different preferences, resulting in a relatively large variance in the learned reward function. For this purpose, this study proposes a behavior fusion method based on adversarial IRL. We decompose complex tasks into several simple subtasks according to different preferences. After decoupling the tasks, we use the inherent relationship between IRL and generative adversarial network (GAN): the discriminator network fits the reward function and the generator network fits strategy, and the reward function and policy are learned respectively. Moreover, we improve the adversarial IRL model by using multiple discriminators to correspond to each subtask, and provide a more efficient update for the whole structure. The behavior fusion in this work acts a weighted network on the reward functions in different subtasks. The proposed method is evaluated on Atari enduro racing game with baseline methods , and we implement a wafer inspection experiment for further discussions. The experimental results show our method can learn more advanced policies in complicated tasks, and the training process is more stable.},

On the majority of data sets, the most representative shape-based clustering algorithm, KShape, which defines a shape-based distance with shift invariance, has been shown to outperform other algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new shape-based clustering algorithm named Fractional Order Shape-based k-cluster(FrOKShape), which defines a multi-variable shape-based distance by normalized fractional order cross-correlation and uses the DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA) as a center computation strategy. Our distance exhibits excellent shape shift deviating properties and good compatibility integrated with a variety of existing clustering center strategies so that it can provide more potential good results. Experiments show that combining our distance with a traditional clustering algorithm produces excellent clustering indicators. In a series of comparative experiments , FrOKShape also exhibits a comparable result to the existing better shape-based clustering algorithm KShape.},

In this paper, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on artificial neural networks is proposed to tackle the MO-VRPSD. Particularly, during the evolutionary process, a radial basis function network (RBFN) is exploited to learn the potential knowledge of individuals, generate hypothesis and instantiate hypothesis. The RBFN evaluates individuals with different scores and generates new individuals with higher quality while taking into account the non-dominated relationship between individuals. Moreover, integrated with a specific non-dominated sorting strategy, i.e., ENS-SS, along with several effective heuristic operations, the proposed algorithm performs favorably for solving the MO-VRPSD. The experimental results based on the modified Solomon benchmark instances verified the effectiveness of the respective components, and the superiority to other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

The uniqueness of BDVS is that the best discarded trial vector for an individual and the best vector for the individual are used to improve the individual. First, an external archive is constructed to record the best discarded trial vectors for each individual. During the survivor selection operation, if a trial vector is worse than the target vector and the target vector is in a stagnant state, then the target vector is replaced with the best vector of the target vector or a vector chosen at random from the external archive. BDVS is a general framework that can easily be integrated into various DE algorithms. In our experiments, BDVS was applied to eight DE algorithms, which were then compared to their original algorithms. BDVS was verified using the 2013 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2013), CEC 2014, and CEC 2017 benchmark test sets and 88 test functions were considered.

The controller design of the proposed method is online; therefore, an accurate model and plant parameters are not required. In the proposed method, a new rule for updating the Q-learning policy is used to estimate the tracking error according to the Bellman equation , and the stability of the designed controller is derived by applying graph theory and the Riccati inequality and is determined based on the Lyapunov stability . Furthermore, to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, two simulated cases based on an inverted pendulum between the new deterministic neural network scheduling and a radial basis function neural network are compared. Additionally, convergences are also compared. The simulation results indicate that the controller designed by the new deterministic neural network scheduling is better than that designed by the radial basis function neural network.

Based on our proposed strategy, the mapped codes are redefined by creating a new Huffman table rather than selecting them from the unused codes in the original Huffman table. The critical issue of designing the CM-based RDH method, that is, constructing code mapping, is converted into a combinatorial optimization problem .

In general, most existing deep hashing approaches mainly focus on constructing the pairwise similarity matrix by exploiting the supervised information . However, they rarely construct a label network using the labels to guide hash code learning and thus cannot generate accurate hash codes in some cases. To alleviate this issue, a novel supervised hashing model, named Specific Class Center Guided Deep Hashing (SCCGDH), is proposed in this paper. The purpose of SCCGDH is to learn the specific class centers from the neural network and guide the hashing learning of multi-media data. We design three different neural networks: label network, image network and text network. Specifically, the label network outputs the hash codes of the center of each category. The hash codes from the image network and the text network are encouraged to approximate the corresponding specific centers, reducing the intraclass variation of multi-media data. Furthermore, we seek hash codes of different modalities to be consistent by minimizing the inter-modal invariance loss. We integrate three neural networks into a unified end-to-end hashing learning framework. Experimental results on three cross-modal datasets show that our proposed SCCGDH approach can obtain the better performance than other state-of-the-art hashing approaches.},

Among them, the most representative symbolic methods such as Symbol Aggregation Approximation(SAX) and Symbol Fourier Approximation(SFA) have been widely used in various scenarios. However, they all have some flaws in some way. For SAX, the converted data in the approximation phase displays a shrinkage distribution(standard deviation σ σ shrinkage) that does not meet the assumptions in the definition. For SFA, it only obtains global frequency domain information, which leads to poor recognition ability for reciprocating frequency conversion sequence. Simultaneously, the symbol distance defined has poor interpretability due to spanning two spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel symbolic method called Symbol Fractional Fourier Approximation(SFFA), which shows multivariate approximation capabilities by Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) and adds a new supervised strategy for symbol mapping based on the chi-square distribution. It not only effectively avoids the influence of shrinkage distribution, but also has a strong ability to distinguish special sequences. Moreover, the SFFA symbol distance is proved to satisfy the low boundary lemma. Furthermore, it can achieve the same effect as SFA when the appropriate parameters and strategies are selected. Finally, when combined with the Vector Space Model (VSM) to classify time series, a large number of experiments show that SFFA-VSM outperforms SFA on all open-source data sets.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the distribution difference between the source and target domains, there have been many unsupervised domain adaptation methods to achieve class-level alignment by aligning the prototypes of two domains. Since the labels of the target domain are unobserved, the target prototypes are constructed based on pseudo-labels. However, the inaccuracy of pseudo-labels may lead to biased prototypes, which introduce noise into the distribution alignment. Moreover, a shared feature extractor or two separate feature extractors are used to extract domain-invariant features. But the former is limited by the large domain gap and the latter increases the network parameters. To this end, we propose a Softmax-Based Prototype construction and Adaptation (SBPA) method, which constructs prototypes based on the softmax output of the classifier instead of ground-truth labels or pseudo-labels. SBPA performs domain-level alignment through adversarial training , and class-level alignment by aligning prototypes of the same class. In addition, SBPA contains a residual block to explicitly model the difference between the source and target domain features extracted by a shared feature extractor. We evaluate our method on four widely used datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms recent domain adaptation methods, especially on DomainNet, the hardest domain adaptation dataset by far.},

  abstract     = {During the last two decades, evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs) have attracted more and more attention owing to their capacity to self-adapt both system structures and parameters dynamically. Conventional EFSs optimize the consequent parameters using the recursive least square (RLS) alg orithm based on mean square error (MSE) criterion. It only works well in Gaussian noise or noise-free situations. In this paper, we further propose an alternative approach to update consequent parameters based on the novel least mean dual p-power (LMDP) error criterion. By contrast with the MSE criterion, the LMDP criterion has a stronger noise rejection ability on non-Gaussian noise environments. Moreover, the LMDP criterion extends the range of p value in conventional LMP criterion from positive integer to floating point for more fine-grained optimum solutions. Details in this work, the recursive solution of LMDP criterion is respectively derived from global learning and local learning to update consequent parameter and the theoretical stability analyses for both learning cases are proven in that the stability of our considered EFS is guaranteed. The experiments on various benchmark datasets and a real-world typhoon path prediction validate that the proposed method is more accurate and owns better generalization performance under multiple noise conditions.},

For the first time, the information propagation mechanism of group polarization effect is detected and modeled by real-world data in this paper. In addition, the adverse impact of opposing opinions is considered, which well portrays the reality that negative reviews in viral marketing could damage reputations and long-term profits. The realistic dynamic enhanced independent cascade (EIC) model is designed based on group polarization effect and individual preferences. The problem is called the effective influence maximization with group polarization effect (EIMGP) problem, where individuals are selected to post information while maximizing the positive impact of approval and minimizing the negative impact of disputes. Secondly, the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Then, the group-based effective influence maximization (GEIM) algorithm is proposed to select seeds using network structures and model features. Finally, experimental results show that the GEIM algorithm could identify the group polarization effect, improve the quality of the seeds and reduce the running time.},

  abstract     = {Significant place mining in spatiotemporal trajectory data is a key task for mobile pattern mining, useful for supporting location-aware services. State-of-the-art trajectory clustering algorithms utilize a density-based distance measure. However, some major problems with this approach are that (1) results are often inaccurate, especially on data of varying density, (2) the user must fine-tune many thresholds that are unintuitive to set, and (3) boundary points between clusters are often assigned to the wrong locations. Performance is also a major issue as many state-of-the-art algorithms have a very high time complexity. Motivated by these issues, this paper proposes an approach inspired by the data field theory and community detection. It is a graph-based significant place mining algorithm, called GB-SPM, for capturing and characterizing the essence of similarity between nodes. GB-SPM first applies a novel low index neighborhood velocity point filtration method to extract characteristic points. Then, a characteristic point index neighborhood is used to map them to graph nodes. In this way, the original problem is transformed into a community detection problem in complex community networks. Finally, a new edge weight metric is proposed to capture and characterize the nature of similarity between nodes. To evaluate clustering quality, we used the Silhouette (SI) for unannotated data to value inter-cluster separation and intra-cluster homogeneity. To evaluate mining effectiveness, we used Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) for annotated data. Numerous experiments were carried out on real world datasets, and the accuracy and performance of the designed algorithm was compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that GB-SPM improves on average SI by 13.9\%, MCC by 20.7\%, and runtime by 5.15 times.},

The main idea in BVNSbucket is the bucket sorting technology, which greatly reduces the calculation time of the algorithm to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, to improve the performance on large graphs, we propose a top-swap strategy and an information perturbation strategy to improve BVNSbucket , resulting in the BVNSbucket2 algorithm. The top-swap strategy is a strategy to maintain the balance between the quality of the new solution and the time required to search for the new solution. The information perturbation strategy is used to help local search escape from local optima and restart the search in a new area. We adopted several sets of popular graph instances to evaluate our algorithms, and the experiments show that the proposed algorithms are significantly better than the current optimal algorithm for most graph instances.},

  abstract     = {With the improving capacity to collect massive amounts of data, distribution-valued data are increasingly used in many applications, where they are presented in a clustered, summarized, or aggregated form to provide detailed information, as opposed to single-valued data. Most of the existing models for distribution-valued data are subject to limitations attributed to the inherent constraints caused by the special expressions of probability distributions. This makes the practical usage of distribution-valued data highly challenging. This paper introduces a novel feature embedding method to characterize a probability distribution, and on this basis, an effective linear regression model that does not contain additional constraints is proposed. Unlike previous models with nonnegative constraints on coefficients, our model is capable of addressing negative coefficients . The detailed parameter estimation procedure applying partial least squares for this model is presented to guarantee more stable results, especially in the presence of a relatively small sample size or multicollinearity among variables. Overall, the proposed method fundamentally facilitates distribution-valued data regression analysis . Extensive simulation experiments and empirical PM 2.5 2.5 concentration modeling not only verify the effectiveness of our regression method for distribution-valued data but also demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method compared with existing approaches.},

Since the adaptive laws for updating fuzzy weights are developed based on hyperbolic tangent function , estimation results are updated slowly, even if the initial tracking errors are large. A novel nonsingular practical terminal sliding-mode (PTSM) reduced-order system is proposed for drive tracking errors fast converge with high precision. Benefiting from the absence of information coupling in the derivative of the PTSM function, an observation-based super-twisting algorithm (STA) is employed to establish the PTSM manifold with weakened chattering.

  abstract     = {Although regional wind speed prediction is of great value in the development of wind power, it is rarely studied in the past years. To fill this gap, we introduce a deep learning method for multi-step regional wind speed prediction, which aims to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of wind speed in a given region and make predictions across time steps. There are several important challenges for it: (1) how to simultaneously build long-term temporal dependencies and long-range spatial interactions of wind speed; (2) how to capture the fluctuant, intermittent, and chaotic nature of wind speed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Sequence-to-one Predictive Learning Net (SPLNet) for multi-step regional wind speed prediction. To effectively utilize historical information and build the long-term temporal dependencies, SPLNet regards multi-step prediction as multi-time sequence-to-one (Seq2one) learning, where each prediction is made based on a previous historical sequence. Besides, a new spatiotemporal dynamics attention (STD-Atten) unit is developed as the key component of SPLNet, which can realize Seq2one learning and capture long-range spatial dependencies. Moreover, to better model the non-stationary and violent nature of wind speed, SPLNet adopts a time-variant structure, where different STD-Atten units are used for predicting wind speed at different time steps. To stabilize model training and enhance prediction performance, a step-separated training procedure is put forward. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world datasets, where regional wind speed is illustrated as images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, it may bring a premature convergence of a population. In this work, a novelty-based driving force is put forward to overcome deficiencies of the fitness-based driving force. In the new proposed adjustable driving force based PSO, named as ADFPSO, two types of exemplars respectively with high fitness and high novelty are saved in two archives. In each generation, a particle respectively chooses two exemplars from the two archives to update its velocity. In addition, three time-varying parameters are introduced to adjust the particle’s learning weights for the two exemplars aiming to satisfy distinct requirements of different evolution stages. Comprehensive properties of ADFPSO are extensively testified by a set of experiments, in which nine PSO variants are adopted as peer algorithms and two CEC test suites are selected as optimization problems. Moreover, distinct characteristics of the proposed novelty-based driving force are also analyzed based on a few experiments.},

Even for multiway or tensor data, which is prevalent in reality, traditional SC methods should convert each sample to a vector and then form a data matrix. However, the vectorization process will damage the underlying inherent spatial structure of the data. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel consensus tensor low-rank representation (CTLRR) method, which is directly implemented on tensor data. First, the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) and t-product, which is defined as the multiplication of two tensors, are employed to model the data and obtain the low-rank representation tensor. Second, spectral clustering is unified into CTLRR to explore the consensus information among the low-rank representation tensor, which helps obtain the final fusion similarity matrix with the k connected components, where k is the number of clusters. Third, the cluster structure is characterized, and the clustering performance is substantially improved. Last, an optimization procedure for CTLRR is presented. Experimental results on certain challenging datasets show that the proposed CTLRR method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Large data frequently contain various redundant attributes and types of noise. This leads to the problems of overfitting and inefficiency in data processing. To address these problems, this paper proposes a general sampling method for attribute reduction by introducing three-way decisions, namely, three-way sampling (3WS), which is the first sampling method that describes the decision boundary accurately while improving the data quality significantly. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of attribute reduction, we designed a rapid attribute reduction method based on three-way sampling (3WS-RAR). The 3WS-RAR method consists of three main steps: data sampling, attribute reduction, and model effectiveness evaluation. For data sampling, we define the three regions of the 3WS using support vectors to describe the data and use the boundary region as the sampling results. For the attribute reduction, we compute the neighborhood self-information for each attribute while considering the upper and lower approximations. For the effectiveness evaluation, we conducted experiments on 15 relatively large-scale datasets and analysed the influence of parameters. The experimental results reveal that, compared with state-of-the-art attribute reduction models, 3WS-RAR performs better on public benchmark datasets.},

More precisely, a parameterization of the derivative of the hyperbolic penalty function is proposed for the construction of the regression model. The coefficients of the hyperbolic regression model can be obtained by either the least squares or the maximum likelihood methods . The hyperbolic regression belongs to the class of generalized linear models and has similarities with the logistic regression . Thus, a comparison of the logistic and hyperbolic regression models is presented. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, a set of computational experiments is performed, making use of the traditional instances described in the literature. In almost all experiments, the hyperbolic regression had lower residues as well as greater accuracy and F 1 F1 score than the logistic regression .

  abstract     = {Session-based recommendation aims to predict users’ next preference based on the sequence of their own history preferences in a short period. Most state-of-the-art methods model the session as a graph using graph neural networks (GNN) to capture the dynamic transitions between items within sessions. However, the complex and hidden correlations between different sessions are not adequately addressed, especially during the testing stage. We argue that session-based recommendation tasks can be improved by exploiting the correlations between different sessions in both training and testing. To this end, we propose a novel three-GNN-based recommendation framework to exploit the intra- and inter-session item correlations and the session-session correlations. The first one is a graph-based multi-layer perceptron to learn the inter-session item representations in a contrastive learning scheme guided by a contrastive loss function. The second one is a multi-relation graph attention network for intra-session item representations. The two item embeddings are combined through a position attention scheme to form the session representation, which is modulated and enhanced by the third extra session GNN by capturing the session-session correlations. The three levels of correlations are used in the training and testing stages in a joint prediction manner. To alleviate the data sparsity issue faced by the session GNN, we expand the session items by incorporating the neighboring items in the global item graph built from the entire training sessions. We have evaluated our method on multiple benchmark datasets. The results have shown that our joint recommendation method based on session correlation has significantly improved the recommendation accuracy over the state-of-the-art by more than 10\%.},

This paper describes how the principles of minimum mutual information and maximum entropy are used to evaluate the amount of information in neural responses. Its main contribution is as follows: (1) that the expression of neural information is closely related to the utilization of neural energy, and it is found that the highly evolved nervous system strictly follows the two basic principles of economy and efficiency in energy consumption and utilization; (2) In order to verify the relationship between neural information processing and energy utilization, this paper uses the concept of energy-efficiency ratio to measure the economy and high efficiency of the nervous system in term of energy utilization by using the maximum entropy principle; (3) The numerical results show that the energy consumed by the nervous system reflects not only the internal law of neural information conduction and processing, but also the self-organization structure of neural information coding. The results suggest that energy neural coding, a novel neural information processing method, can be used to understand how brain activity works. Such a coding pattern can not only be extended to research the large-scale neuroscience field, but also unify brain models at all levels by use of the energy theory. This will provide a scientific theoretical basis for the exploration of how the brain works and the computational principles of brain-like artificial intelligence .},

First, we extract features in terms of spatiotemporal information and its visual perception from the videos as inputs of our proposed artificial neural network-based VQA model. Second, to facilitate the video quality evaluation, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the VQA model to generate weight factors for the input features adaptively according to the different types of CG content in videos. Third, we build a subjective CG video quality database for validation of VQA metrics. Experiments demonstrated that our method achieved superior performance in terms of evaluating the quality of CG animation videos.

  abstract     = {With the development of novel technological and societal paradigms, consensus in multi-attribute large-scale group decision making is of great significance. The confidence derived by evaluation is considered in this paper and it is named as endo-confidence. Then, a novel adaptive consensus model to manage endo-confident behavior is proposed. First, the experts are classified by their evaluations as the first cluster, and then by their endo-confidence levels in each cluster named as sub-cluster. Furthermore, the new method considering endo-confidence level is introduced to determine the weights. To better manage consensus reaching process, we further discuss three types of experts in the non-consensus cluster to adjust their evaluations, including i) experts who are lack of endo-confidence, ii) experts who are over endo-confidence, and iii) experts whose evaluations greatly deviate from the overall level. Next, an automatic feedback mechanism which considers both evaluations and endo-confidence levels of experts is proposed for the non-consensus experts. Finally, a case study is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model, and a series of comparative analyses are used to show its stability.},

However, DMs always influence each other, and practical trust relationships among DMs in the SN are often incomplete. In this study, we propose a picture fuzzy LSGDM approach in a trust-relationship-based SN environment to solve decision-making problems. To achieve this, the incomplete trust relationship of SNs was considered first and the missing information was estimated using a picture fuzzy trust propagation operator. Next, a novel picture fuzzy Jensen a - norm a-norm dissimilarity measure was defined and the corresponding consensus detection model was developed for LSGDM in a trust-relationship-based SN environment. Afterward, based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach, a picture fuzzy dissimilarity-based selection method was proposed for the selection process. Finally, two case studies were provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The sensitivity and comparison analyses demonstrated the stability and reliability of the decision-making results obtained using this method.},

In our proposed method, the mass function degenerates into probability distribution under the circumstance that the uncertainty of the Z-restriction is 0. In this case, the information volume degenerates into Shannon entropy . The information volume of a given Z-number increases approximately linearly with the unreliability of its Z-restriction. In addition, the information volume varies with the value of Z-restriction and fuzzy number A. Some illustrative examples are shown to demonstrate the properties of the proposed information volume of Z-number.

Aiming at this issue, a link prediction algorithm based on the initial information contribution of nodes is proposed in this paper. First of all, the initial information contribution of nodes is quantified by utilizing some topological information around them and an adjustable parameter. In the next, three ways of bidirectional information transmission between nodes are analyzed. After that, the total information amount that received by two nodes through three ways of information transmission is applied to measure the structural similarity between them, to design the link prediction algorithm. At last, the experimental results on sixteen real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has great advantages in effectiveness and robustness, compared with ten mainstream benchmark indices.

  abstract     = {A brain tumor is one of the fatal cancer types which causes abnormal growth of brain cells. Earlier diagnosis of a brain tumor can play a vital role in its treatment; however, manual segmentation of the brain tumors from MRI images is a laborious and time-consuming task. Therefore, several automatic segmentation techniques have been proposed, but high inter-and intra-tumor variations in shape and texture make accurate segmentation of enhanced and core tumor regions challenging. The demand for a highly accurate and robust segmentation method persists; therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic technique for brain tumor regions segmentation by using multiscale residual attention-UNet (MRA-UNet). MRA-UNet uses three consecutive slices as input to preserve the sequential information and employs multiscale learning in a cascade fashion, enabling it to exploit the adaptive region of interest scheme to segment enhanced and core tumor regions accurately. The study also investigates the application of postprocessing techniques (i.e., conditional random field and test time augmentation), which further helps to improve the overall performance. The proposed method has been rigorously evaluated on the most extensive publicly available datasets, i.e., BraTS2017, BraTS2019, and BraTS2020. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the BraTS2020 dataset with the average dice score of 90.18\%, 87.22\%, and 86.74\% for the whole tumor, tumor core, and enhanced tumor regions, respectively. A significant improvement has been demonstrated for the core and enhancing tumor region segmentation showing the proposed method’s evident effectiveness.},

This model mainly depicts a pair of boundary operators and a pair of approximation operators with a certain threshold from the perspective of single knowledge granularity . And it not only relaxes the complete inclusion relation but also retains the basic properties of the classical rough set. Secondly, an attribute reduction approach is given for a covering-based decision information systemusing the proposed CVPRS model, which keeps the lower or upper approximation unchanged. The different performances of boundary operators and their related three indices in these reduction methods are compared. The results show that boundary operators and distribution functions have outstanding advantages in these applications.

One of the most famous attacks in this category is selfish mining . This attack is essentially a strategy that a sufficiently powerful mining pool can follow to obtain more revenue than its fair share. The reason that selfish mining is effective is the difficulty adjustment algorithm used in the Bitcoin network. In this paper, we analyze the profitability of selfish mining with respect to time and propose an alternative difficulty adjustment algorithm that discourages selfish mining while allowing the Bitcoin network to remain scalable. We analyze our proposed solution, present the results, and discuss its effectiveness. Based on our analysis, our proposed algorithm effectively increases the profitability waiting time for the attackers to almost double its original value. For example, for a miner with 40\% of the network’s hash power, the algorithm extends the waiting time from 4 weeks to more than 11 weeks. This will discourage attackers from performing their malicious activities . We also show that our proposed algorithm allows the network to scale while it increases the waiting time.},

  abstract     = {The batch-based hash learning paradigm for uni-modal or cross-modal retrieval has made great progress in recent decades. However, methods that are based on this paradigm cannot adapt to the scenario of incoming new data streams continuously; in addition, they are inefficient in terms of training time and memory cost in big data searches because they have to accumulate all the database data and new incoming data before training. Although a few online hash retrieval methods have been proposed to address these issues in recent years, they are based on shallow models, and none of them can perform uni-modal and cross-modal retrieval in one framework. To this end, we propose a novel method, namely, Online Deep Hashing for both Uni-modal and Cross-modal retrieval (ODHUC). For online deep hashing, ODHUC first trains image and text neural networks with image and text fundamental databases, and their hash codes are learned. When new data arrive, ODHUC samples images and texts from the newly arriving data and fundamental databases to update the image and text networks and learn the hash codes of the new data, the aim of which is to keep the similarity of the hash codes of the incremental and old data consistent with the supervised semantic similarity . ODHUC is also trained with sampled old data by knowledge distillation to learn new knowledge and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. In this way, ODHUC achieves online deep hash learning continually without performance decline. For two categories of retrieval tasks, ODHUC learns image and text deep hash functions in two stages to align image and text features; it generates image hash codes first and then utilizes them to supervise the text hash code learning. Thus, ODHUC can perform both uni-modal and cross-modal retrieval tasks in one framework. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ODHUC outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

Aiming at these problems, in this paper we devise a semi-supervised overlapping community detection method named SSGCAE which is based on graph neural networks. This method is composed of three modules: graph convolutional autoencoder (GCAE), semi-supervision and modularity maximization, which are respectively utilized to fuse link information and attribute information, integrate prior information and detect overlapping communities. We treat GCAE as the backbone framework and train it by using the unified loss from these three modules. Through this way, these three modules are jointly correlated via the community membership representation, which is very beneficial to improve the overall performance.

  abstract     = {Competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) is an efficient algorithm for solving larger-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs). However, the winners are not updated in original algorithm, and the random parameters model affects the convergence speed. To improve the performance of CSO for solving LSMOPs, an adaptive competitive swarm optimizer with inverse modeling is developed. In the method, an adaptive parameter model is designed to accelerate the convergence speed when the population not traps in local convergence, and the random parameter model is used to help the losers jump out of local convergence when the population traps in stagnation. Moreover, inverse modeling is used to update the winners, and the number of them is maintained by a new designed environment selection method. The exploitation ability of algorithm is improved and the drawback that convergence speed of the algorithm might be slowed by few winners in the early stage of evolution is avoided. In addition, an adjacent individual competition method is proposed to improve the distribution of solutions. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested on nine benchmark optimization problems, and the results indicate that the average ranks in terms of IGD and HV of the proposed algorithm outperform those of seven compared algorithms.},

It is well known that population feature information that refers to some mathematical statistic feature information of all individuals in the dimension of decision space, and it can reflect the features of the problem to be solved. However, the population feature information has not been fully utilized by DE’s adaptive variants. As a result, those adaptive variants do not obtain promising performance in optimizing nonlinear, non-differentiable and non-separable multi-modal problems. To make adequate extraction and effective use of population feature information, we propose an adaptive differential evolution framework based on population feature information in this paper, named PFI for short. In the PFI framework, the population feature information consists of the standard deviation of fitness value and the sum of standard deviation of each dimension of population. Besides, population feature information archive is designed to store the population feature information and success parameters, and the utilization mechanism of population feature information assigns historical success parameters with high population feature similarity to the current corresponding population. Four widely used mutation strategies of DE are incorporated into the PFI framework to evaluate its performance by optimizing CEC2005, CEC2015, CEC2020 benchmark functions and two real world applications to verify the performance of the PFI framework. Experiment results have demonstrated that PFI framework can significantly improve the performance of 4 popular mutation strategies of DE.},

To address the above problems, we propose a new interpretable network, which capable of performing LIE on UHD images in real time on a single GPU . The proposed network consists of two CNNs: the first part is to use the first-order unfolding Taylor’s formula to build an interpretable network, and combine two UNets in the form of first-order Taylor’s polynomials. Then we use this constructed network to extract the feature maps of the low-resolution input image, and finally process the feature maps to form a multi-dimensional tensor termed a bilateral grid that acts on the original image to yield an enhanced result. The second part is the image enhancement using the bilateral grid. In addition, we propose a polynomial channel enhancement method to enhance UHD images. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for UHD LIE on a single GPU with 24G RAM (100 fps).},

In this article, we develop the theory of directed fuzzy incidence graphs (DFIG), that aid in the analysis of a number of dynamic networks. The relations found in DFIGs are asymmetric, so that the extent of node-arc interactions can be well studied. In this work, we take a different approach to connectivity by focusing legal and illegal flows through the network. In addition, we study the concepts of cycles and characterize some special type of nodes, arcs, and d -pairs in DFIGs . Also, we examine the migration of refugees across Mexico and the U.

Adaptive dynamic programming is an efficient method to break through the bottleneck. However, most current works assume that the evolution of uncontrollable state satisfies Markovian property . This paper proposes a time-delayed adaptive dynamic programming framework for optimal energy control, utilizing more comprehensive historical data for state reconstruction. The uncontrollable state is reconstructed by an attention mechanism-based Transformer network based on online measured data. Then, a self-learning iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal state feedback control policy under a discounted performance index function. The problem of solving iterative control policy, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem with an enormous computational burden, is decomposed into three sub-problems, i.e. nonlinear programming with no discrete variable, which is solved by the Projected Newton method , mixed-integer quadratic programming , and quadratic programming . Numerical results illustrate that the developed control algorithm minimizes the electricity cost in the long term and avoids peak load.},

  abstract     = {Recently, functional brain network analysis via graph neural networks has achieved state-of-the-art results as it can directly extract information from irregular graphs without any approximation. However, current methods remain limited in exploring the high-order structural information of brain networks. To address this issue, we propose a hypergraph attention network for functional brain network classification (FC–HAT). First, we build a dynamic hypergraph generation phase and model each brain network as a hypergraph to preserve the high-order information. The pair-wise and community-wise similarities in functional brain networks are separately captured by k nearest neighbors and k -means. Theoretical analysis shows that the constructed hypergraph exhibits superior spectral properties . Then, we design a hypergraph attention aggregation phase to further extract information in hypergraphs. This includes node and hyperedge attention layers that can separately aggregate features among nodes and hyperedges. Finally, the two phases are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, which can dynamically update hypergraphs and node embeddings along with the training process. Experimental results on ABIDE- I and ADHD-200 demonstrate the effectiveness of FC–HAT in cerebral disease classification. Moreover, the abnormal connectivity patterns and brain regions identified by FC–HAT are found to be more likely to become biomarkers associated with cerebral diseases.},

First, the dominant matrix is obtained according to the evaluation between objects, and the object relationship is constructed by using the dominant matrix. Second, the graph convolutional network is used to extract the object relationships, deeply learned the relationship between objects, and classified and sorted the objects. Finally, on film review data of Douban (douban.com), the films are classified and sorted by the OR-GCN model, and the effectiveness and the non-randomness of this method are verified by the accurate analysis and ROC. At the same time, our method is applied to the public dataset to illustrate the performance and universality.

To tackle this issue, a resilient control strategy is presented in this paper for CPSs under actuator saturation resulting from cyberattacks. It consists of an extended state observer and an anti-saturation resilient controller. The state observer estimates unknown system states and attacks, while the controller aims to resist the actuator saturation. The controller is designed by adopting Barrier Lyapunov function , Hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function , and the Nussbaum function.

However, in the decision-making process, there may be some alternatives whose ranking cannot be directly judged from this perspective. Therefore, researchers have proposed some sorting formulas, which can accomplish the overall sorting of alternatives. But, these formulas can only be used to deal with the sorting of alternatives. To expand the application scope and decision prospect of the TOPSIS method, we introduce decision-theoretic rough fuzzy sets , and design a novel TOPSIS method that simultaneously deals with the sorting and classification of alternatives. Using the basic principle of the TOPSIS method to acquire the optimistic and pessimistic ideal distances, we regard these two distances as two fuzzy concepts, here their features are opposite, and utilize the newly defined decision-theoretic rough fuzzy set models to obtain the corresponding decision areas. Then, according to these two distances, we analyze connection between the ordering of alternatives and the total loss of alternatives and summarize the sorting rules when alternatives are classified into the same decision area and the sorting rules when alternatives are classified into different decision areas. Further, the concept of joint decision area is defined. Meanwhile, we summarize the sorting rules when alternatives are classified into the same joint decision area and the sorting rules when alternatives are classified into different joint decision areas. Using these rules, we introduce the detailed process of the novel TOPSIS method and analyze the rationality of the method. Subsequently, we test the feasibility of our method with project investment decision example and illustrate its superiority and stability through comparative analysis and parameter test. Besides, we conduct simulation experiment to further verify the similarities and differences of the sorting function of the traditional TOPSIS method and our method.},

To deeply analyze the causes of this phenomenon, it is inseparable from the detailed study of micro individuals and their interaction process. In social network, the reposting behavior of a specific user reflects his individual preference regarding the process of interaction. The frequency of interaction between friends with high preference is much higher than that of friends with low preference. For the first time, we try to study the interaction behavior of users from the perspective of micro individuals by considering user selection preferences. We establish a mathematical expression model of user interaction behavior in social network. The model give the mathematical description dual-mode characteristics of the physical phenomenon of bimodal characteristics.

  abstract     = {Low-quality face images present two typical problems: perceptual distortion and a significant reduction in verification accuracy. Prevailing works address these two problems by face image enhancement. Generally, they require low- and high-quality image pairs or facial priors, e.g., facial landmarks, which are relatively rare in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a fresh perspective to address these problems, by hypothesizing that there is a positive correlation between cross-domain image enhancement and adversarial defense. With the incorporation of cross-domain image enhancement, paired images or facial priors are no longer necessary. Furthermore, we introduce two types of adversarial perturbations, namely appearance and semantic perturbations, and defending these perturbations aims to solve the aforementioned two typical problems. Defending appearance perturbations decreases perceptual distortion and improve image quality, while defending semantic perturbations promotes identity preservation during the image enhancement process, which improves verification accuracy. To this end, we propose a collaborative face enhancement module (COFEM) for face verification based on two types of adversarial perturbation examples. COFEM incorporates three components. First, an adversarial example generator attacks high-quality images (source domain) in two different ways to obtain appearance and semantic perturbation examples. Next, an image enhancement network denoises these perturbation examples and enhances the quality of low-quality images (target domain). Then, an image reconstruction network is utilized to preserve the identity of the enhanced image such that it is consistent with that of the corresponding input. Unlike prevailing image enhancement models which mainly focus on high perceptual quality , COFEM emphasizes identity-related feature preservation, which is vital to face verification . Combined with COFEM, we also design a face verification module to form a low-quality face verification approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the low-quality face image quality and verification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is a stochastic optimization algorithm based on probability distribution model and has been widely applied in global optimization. However, the random sampling of Gaussian EDA (GEDA) usually suffers from the poor diversity and the premature convergence, which severely limits its performance. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of the random sampling and develops an efficient mixture sampling model (EMSM). EMSM can explore more promising regions and utilize the unsuccessful mutation vectors, which achieves a good tradeoff between the diversity and the convergence. Moreover, the feasibility analysis of EMSM is studied. A new GEDA variant named EMSM-EDA is developed, which combines EMSM with enhancing Gaussian estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA 2 ). The experimental results on IEEE CEC2013 and IEEE CEC2014 test suites demonstrate that EMSM-EDA is efficient and competitive.},

Furthermore, data characteristics have a significant impact on the performance of imbalanced classifiers, which are generally neglected by existing evaluation methods. The objective of this study is to introduce a new criterion to comprehensively evaluate imbalanced classifiers. Specifically, we introduce an efficiency curve that is established using data envelopment analysis without explicit inputs (DEA-WEI), to determine the trade-off between the benefits of improved minority class accuracy and the cost of reduced majority class accuracy. In sequence, we analyze the impact of the imbalanced ratio and typical imbalanced data characteristics on the efficiency of the classifiers. Empirical analyses using 68 imbalanced data reveal that traditional classifiers such as C4.5 and the k-nearest neighbor are more effective on disjunct data, whereas ensemble and undersampling techniques are more effective for overlapping and noisy data. The efficiency of cost-sensitive classifiers decreases dramatically when the imbalanced ratio increases. Finally, we investigate the reasons for the different efficiencies of classifiers on imbalanced data and recommend steps to select appropriate classifiers for imbalanced data based on data characteristics.},

Although many deep learning models have achieved good classification results on histopathological image classification tasks, these models do not take full advantage of the staining properties of histopathological images. In this paper, we propose a novel Deconv-Transformer (DecT) network model, which incorporates the color deconvolution in the form of convolution layers. This model uses a self-attention mechanism to match the independent properties of the HED channel information obtained by the color deconvolution . It also uses a method similar to the residual connection to fuse the information of both RGB and HED color space images, which can compensate for the information loss in the process of transferring RGB images to HED images. The training process of the DecT model is divided into two stages so that the parameters of the deconvolution layer can be better adapted to different types of histopathological images. We use the color jitter in the image data augmentation process to reduce the overfitting in the model training process. The DecT model achieves an average accuracy of 93.02\% and F1-score of 0.9389 on BreakHis dataset, and an average accuracy of 79.06\% and 81.36\% on BACH and UC datasets.},

But the resultant uncertainty has not been paid sufficient attention. A stochastic AHP is proposed based on theoretical development. The development is driven by a practical case regarding the evaluations in China’s governmental audits, in which the collected opinions are with high uncertainty degrees and low consistency indices. First of all, the proposed process measures uncertainty degrees within the pair-wise comparisons based on their variances, checks the uncertainty degrees of a stochastic comparison matrix (SCM) based on random uncertainty degrees. For uncertainty reduction, an algorithm is proposed to re-estimate the probabilistic distributions of the entries whose uncertainty degrees are not acceptable. Then, the consistency of a SCM is measured by its similarity to an ideal comparison matrix. Priority vector of a set of SCMs is then obtained by programming models which maximize the consistency indices. Quantitative comparisons clarify that the proposed process is supported by interesting theoretical properties, provides admissible results due to the consideration of uncertainties, outputs interpretable results which could be easily understood and accepted by experts.},

To adaptively adjust the population diversity and balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of a differential evolution algorithm during the evolution process, this study proposes a sawtooth-linear population size adaptive (SLPSA) method and an improved scaling factor and crossover rate control method . Subsequently, an improved differential evolution algorithm called SLDE is proposed. The SLPSA method constructs an external archive for storing the abandoned trial vectors and periodically adds vectors from external archive to the population during the iterative process, thereby periodically increasing the diversity of the population, which enhances the algorithm’s ability to jump out of locally optimal values. Based on a distance-based parameter adaptation method, the update formulas for the scaling factor weight and crossover rate weight are improved. By using 84 benchmark functions from CEC 2011, CEC 2014, CEC 2015, and CEC 2017, the SLDE performance was verified experimentally by analyzing and comparing the proposed SLDE to six state-of-the-art differential evolution algorithms. The experimental results demonstrated that the SLDE performance was significantly better than that of the six state-of-the-art differential evolution algorithms.},

Such tasks usually have open solution spaces and non-unique true answers, which pose great challenges for designing effective crowdsourcing algorithms. In this work, we are concerned specifically with complex text annotation crowdsourcing tasks, where each answer of a task is in the form of free text. We propose an error consistency-based approach to inferring a satisfying result from a set of open-ended answers. First, each answer is represented with two vectors that capture the local word collocation and the global sentence semantics respectively. Second, the true answer is approximated by the sum of the answer vectors weighted by the reciprocals of their respective errors. Third, an algorithm called AEC ( A ggregation based on E rror C onsistency) is designed to infer the aggregated result by maximizing the consistency of the errors of an answer in two vector spaces. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

However, the connectivity of an MAS with a limited sensing range is vulnerable to the evolution of agents with high mobility, so converging to one common equilibrium rapidly while maintaining connectivity under a large-scale and high-density topology has been a research challenge. To address this problem, we develop a heuristic combinatorial algorithm that combines a distributed sector-division-based (SDB) consensus algorithm and a d -subgraph (DSG) connectivity maintenance algorithm. First, the communication region is heuristically divided into multiple sectors, and agents select representative neighbors to calculate control inputs by simultaneously considering the number and the distribution of perceived neighbors. Second, the d -subgraph is designed to update agents in accordance with constraint set constructed from the nearest neighbors in their locally perceived connected components. Thus, sequentially combining the SDB and the DSG algorithms affords a heuristic combinatorial (SDB&amp;DSG) algorithm that can effectively accelerate convergence to a common equilibrium and retain global connectivity. The theoretical proofs of connectivity and convergence are given geometrically. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, especially in large-scale and high-density topologies.},

Most current detection methods are based on a hypothesis test framework. As a result, in these detection methods, a hypothesis test is need to be set, and more importantly, cannot obtain the type of drift. The setting of a hypothesis test requires an understanding of data streams, and cannot obtain the type of concept drift results in the loss of drift information. Hence, in this paper, to get rid of the setting of hypothesis test, and obtain the type of concept drift, we propose Active Drift Detection based on Meta learning (Meta-ADD), a novel framework that learns to classify concept drift by offline pre-training a model on data stream with known drifts, then online fine-tuning model to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, in the pre-trained phase, we extract meta-features based on the error rates of various concept drift, after which a pre-trained model called meta-detector is developed via a prototypical neural network by representing various concept drift classes as corresponding prototypes. In the detection phase, the meta-detector is fine-tuned to adapt to the real data stream via a simple stream-based active learning. Hence, Meta-ADD does not need a hypothesis test to detect concept drifts and identify their types automatically, which can directly support drift understand.

Next, this paper proposes an adaptive dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithm (DMOA) focusing on the change types, to solve DMOPs with variable change types. It can detect the different types of environmental changes. The main purpose of a DMOA is to find the Pareto-optimal set ( PS ) of each environment. Therefore, the change types of DMOPs mainly contain two categories: PS changes over time and PS remains constant. After detecting the change type, an adaptive response strategy is activated to react to environmental changes. If PS changes over time, a classification prediction (CP) strategy is active to respond to environmental changes. If PS remains constant, a dynamic mutation (DM) strategy works to react to environmental changes. The proposed algorithm is extensively studied through comparison with several advanced DMOAs, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness in working out complex DMOPs with variable change types and on the parameter-tuning problem of PID controllers for dynamic systems.},

We will relate these particularities with a finite cyclic group action on the cellular automaton, and prove that the inverse transition dipolynomial is an invariant dipolynomial under this action. Secondly, we use a recursive estimation of neighbours (REN) algorithm to produce direct examples of virtual cyclic cellular automata, which moreover generalize some of the cellular automata used in applications like collective control or traffic patterns. We also propose a new REN algorithm which allows us to reinterprete a ( 2 R + 1 ) (2R+1) -cyclic cellular automata as a recursive sequence originated from the elementary cellular automaton with base rule 150, and which motivate us to introduce a new notion of a recursive Wolfram number for a ( 2 R + 1 ) (2R+1) -cyclic cellular automaton. Finally we show that this recursive Wolfram number can be computed by the new REN algorithm applied to the base rule 150 and its complementary 105 rule.},

  abstract     = {Long-tailed classifications make it very challenging to deal with class-imbalanced problems using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Existing solutions based on re-balancing methods perform well and use single-task CNNs to train each fine-grained class independently. However, classification tasks are multiplex and involve a coarse-to-fine hierarchical relation. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine knowledge transfer based multi-task CNN, which utilizes the coarse-to-fine structure to promote long-tailed learning. First, we construct a tail hierarchical structure in a coarse-to-fine way to pay greater attention to tail classes than head classes. Second, a multi-task CNN is adopted to simultaneously train coarse- and fine-grained tasks to extract a more generalized knowledge representation than the single-task CNN. Third, we design a coarse-to-fine knowledge transfer strategy to adaptively adjust the task weights to improve fine-grained performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better gains than the re-balancing methods. In particular, the proposed model is 3.25\% more accurate than the second-best method on the long-tailed tieredImageNet dataset.},

  abstract     = {In our daily life, we are often greatly assisted with recommendation engines in finding the required information efficiently and accurately. In this paper, we focus on an emerging and important recommendation problem in enormous real-world applications, i.e., sequential heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (SHOCCF). In the studied problem, we have some users’ sequential and heterogeneous one-class feedback, i.e., sequences of (item, behavior) pairs, where the behaviors can be of different types such as examinations and purchases. We propose a generic solution called behavior-aware recommendation (BAR), which is able to adapt an existing RNN-, CNN-, attention- or GNN-based sequential recommendation method to SHOCCF. The main idea of our BAR is to provide the behavior information to the input and output of a representation module that models the item sequence. Specifically, we design a behavior attention layer that uses the behavior at the next timestamp in order to digest the behaviors at different positions in the sequence and obtain more accurate attention scores that will be fed to the input of the representation module. Moreover, we further design a task-specific layer to fuse the real behavior at the next timestamp with the sequential feature generated by the representation module to distinguish different prediction tasks w.r.t. the behavior types. We then conduct extensive empirical studies on four public datasets and find that our BAR is able to significantly improve the performance of a certain sequential recommendation method when it is adapted to SHOCCF.},

Since the controller is designed in the framework of backstepping method, to handle the “explosion of complexity” problem, an adaptive fixed-time filter is constructed. It ensures that the filter error converges to an arbitrarily small vicinity of zero in fixed time. A state transformation function is applied to solve full-state constraints. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and adaptive technique are respectively used for dealing with uncertainties and actuator faults . Based on Lyapunov theory , the closed-loop system is proved to be bounded in fixed time and all states are kept in their constraints. At the end, the effectiveness of the designed control strategy is verified by numerical simulation and an application of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system.},

Previously, the multi-party random number generator (mRNG), which is a mechanism for creating a single value from the contributions of decentralized multiple parties, was mainly designed based on the verifiable random function. In this study, we first construct novel, efficient verifiable mRNG protocols from any one-way function. The protocols can achieve the properties of fairness, no trusted third party, public verifiability , and manipulation resistance. Subsequently, we propose a delegated PoS (DPoS)-based consensus algorithm that adopts the verifiable mRNG. The new algorithm can solve the problem of low fairness caused by the artificial election of master nodes using DPoS, while addressing the issue of manipulating the consensus process owing to the pseudo-random number generated by the traditional RNG, thereby improving the credibility of the consensus algorithm.},

In this paper, we consider security in CPS due to FDI attacks at a single as well as multiple locations. The CPS is modeled as a discrete linear time-invariant system with white Gaussian noise . The system is equipped with a Kalman filter as a state estimator and a Chi-square detector for attack detection. We studied FDI attacks at the sensor, actuator, and physical system. Attackers may guess the system parameters in the worst-case and remain undetectable by carefully designing the attack sequences. The attacker always attempts to increase the state estimation error in the system. Based on the system model, we have identified seven kinds of FDI attacks and analyzed their effects on the system’s security. It is found that the attacker can produce bounded errors in some cases and unbounded errors in some others. Simulation of the attacks on the system model is performed through numerical examples to illustrate their effectiveness.},

At the moment, CLWEs are normally constructed on the monolingual corpus of bilingual texts through an iterative induction process. Homonymy and polysemy have become major obstacles in this process. On the other hand, contextual text representation methods often fail to outperform static CLWE methods significantly for CLIR. We propose a method utilizing a novel neural generative model with Wasserstein autoencoders to learn neural topic-enhanced CLWEs for CLIR purposes. Our method requires minimal or no supervision at all. On the CLEF test collections, we perform a comparative evaluation of the state-of-the-art semantic CLWE methods along with our proposed method for neural CLIR tasks. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing CLWE methods and multilingual contextual text encoders. We also show that our proposed method obtains significant improvements over the CLWE methods based upon representative topical embeddings.},

In addition, it also removes noisy data that can affect the learning quality. While the two objectives are often in conflict, in most current approaches, it is impossible to control the balance between them. We propose a reinforcement learning-based approach for instance selection, called curious instance selection (CIS), which evaluates clusters of instances using the curiosity loop architecture. The output of the algorithm is a matrix that represents the value of adding a cluster of instances to existing instances. This matrix enables the computation of the Pareto front and demonstrates the ability to balance the noise and volume reduction objectives. CIS was evaluated on five datasets, and its performance was compared with the performance of three state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results show that CIS not only provides enhanced flexibility but also achieves higher effectiveness (reduction times accuracy).

Named entity recognition (NER) accurately marks essential information in the literature based on the characteristics of the target entity, providing a method for extracting clinical and biomedical concepts. The performance of NER is heavily embedding-dependent, so recent studies have proposed the method of generating word embedding from character-level information, which can strengthen the representation ability for word embedding. In this paper, we present a novel neural network model including an attention mechanism network and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to further improve character-level embedding. First, an attention mechanism is applied simultaneously to the local and global character embedding. Then, a CNN with multi-size filters is used to extract more information from the character level, which can capture more meaningful features from words with various lengths. In addition, a cross-attention method is used to leverage the interaction between word embedding and character embedding to generate the final word representation. Finally, we modified Mogrifier LSTM to make it suitable for NER tasks and integrated it into our model. Experimental results show that our method is effective and that the model performs better than the baseline models. We also apply our methods proposed in this paper to the transformer-based model and obtain a 90.36 F1-score on NCBI-Disease.},

  abstract     = {Network security has always been a concern because it remains to be an unresolved problem. Unlike signature-based methods, anomaly-based methods can detect novel attacks and thus have gained increasing attention over the past decades. However, as the huge and unbounded network data samples continuously arrive at an unprecedented rate and always evolve and change, building a precise network normal pattern has become extremely difficult. In this study, an evolving anomaly detection method for network streaming data is proposed. Clusters are incrementally updated as the new network samples arrive at the incremental updating phase. The outliers, which include not only the global outliers but also the local outliers, are detected using the local density and global density thresholds at the anomaly detection phase. Meanwhile, a buffer is used to store temporary outliers, which may subsequently become normal samples, to avoid normal network samples being deleted as outliers. Three prominent streaming data (packet-based KDDCUP’99, NSL_KDD, and flow-based CIDDS-001) are used to validate the proposed algorithm. The detection rate of the proposed algorithm can achieve the best result. The result is nearly 100\% on KDDCUP’99 and CIDDS-001. The false positive rate and accuracy are 0.0125 and 0.9886 on CIDDS-001, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can process real-time network anomaly detection with a much lower time and memory computational cost, and it outperforms other unsupervised anomaly detection methods and most supervised anomaly detection methods reported in the literature in terms of detection rate, false-positive rate, and detection accuracy.},

Though most existing methods attempt to characterize spatial correlation and temporal correlation in traffic congestion, few of them consider spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity: spatial correlation depends on temporality, and temporal correlation depends on spatiality in traffic congestion. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach called TCP-BAST with bilateral alternation to simultaneously capture both the correlation and the heterogeneity between spatiality and temporality to improve traffic congestion prediction. First, to capture spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity, we propose a spatial–temporal alternation (STA) module with multi-head graph attention networks and temporal embedding. Second, to capture temporal correlation and temporal heterogeneity, we propose a temporal-spatial alternation (TSA) module with multi-head masked attention networks and spatial embedding. Third, to predict the traffic congestion of multiple road sections in a traffic network, we propose a spatial–temporal fusion (STF) module to fuse the multi-grained spatial-temporal features derived from the STA and TSA modules. The experimental results on a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate that the proposed TCP-BAST approach outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). Both spatial-temporal alternation and temporal-spatial alternation are important for improving traffic congestion prediction, with the former being more critical than the latter.},

The results show that the formulated machines perform better with respect to other classifiers on more than 80\% of comparisons but are extraordinarily similar between themselves, as they agree with each other up to even four decimal places in almost 100\% of cases. Moreover, these optimization algorithms form a perfect example of partially random machines which are claimed to be hypercomputational. But, here it can be shown that unless one has an access to the uncomputable input and uses it intelligently one cannot hypercompute.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel methodology to perform topological regularization in multivariate probabilistic modeling by using sparse, complex, networks which represent the system’s dependency structure and are called information filtering networks (IFN). This methodology can be directly applied to covariance selection problem providing an instrument for sparse probabilistic modeling with both linear and non-linear multivariate probability distributions such as the elliptical and generalized hyperbolic families. It can also be directly implemented for topological regularization of multicollinear regression. In this paper, I describe in detail an application to sparse modeling with multivariate Student-t. A specific expectation–maximization likelihood maximization procedure over a sparse chordal network representation is proposed for this sparse Student-t case. Examples with real data from stock prices log-returns and from artificially generated data demonstrate applicability, performances, robustness and potentials of this methodology.},

  abstract     = {Spatial data often exhibit a tendency highly similar to spatial objects located close to each other. Thus, prevalent co-location pattern (PCP) mining has been studied extensively to discover this tendency. The organization of neighboring relationships on spatial data, called neighborhood materialization (NM), is critical to the PCP problem. However, the previous NM methods suffer from poor efficiency and a large set of results. To this end, a new NM model based on maximal cliques with ego-centric points is proposed in this study, called the maximal ordered ego-clique (MOEC). Here, the correctness of the materialized neighboring relationships of spatial data is proven, and the complexity is further analyzed. In addition, a generalized algorithm GMOEC is designed to effectively transform the neighboring relationships of a spatial data set into MOECs. The geometry of the spatial data set is fully exploited to develop several optimization strategies to enhance efficiency. Furthermore, a novel generalized PCP mining method, GPCP, is proposed to avoid multiple scans of the materialized neighborhood. The GPCP method discovers all PCPs based on the materialized neighborhood using the vertical data format. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the proposed solution is highly effective and efficient.},

Different from the traditional IVF algorithm that conducts a full search at the coarse quantization stage, we introduce (1) cell-level rejection, (2) vector-level rejection, and (3) subspace-based pyramid model with multi-resolution to speed up this high time-consuming stage. Since our proposed fIVF concentrates on finding the exact w nearest coarse codewords at the coarse quantization stage and follows the same product quantization stage, it can achieve the same search accuracy as the traditional IVF. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate that our proposed fIVF can significantly speed up the search process while keeping the same search accuracy as the traditional IVF.},

The main difficulties to make these decisions are to consider the severity of each fire point with regards to the limited resources of vehicles. Hence, this paper motivates to develop a new multi-objective scheduling model for extinguishing the fire of forests considering rescue priority with the limited rescue resources.

  abstract     = {The double-input-rule-modules stacked deep fuzzy method (DIRM-DFM) has attracted much attention because of its interpretability and prediction accuracy. However, when confronted with high-dimensional data and large numbers of fuzzy rules, the original DIRM-DFM has three limitations. First, the identity mapping that appears in the depth layer causes degradation of the prediction performance. Second, redundant fuzzy rules increase the complexity of the structure. Third, the overfitting phenomenon in the parameter-learning process imposes restrictions on the generalization ability of the system. Therefore, achieving structural simplification and high-accuracy prediction remains challenging. In this paper, a compression and regularized optimization scheme for the modules stacked residual deep fuzzy system (CDIRM-RDFS) is presented to address the above-mentioned limitations. To overcome the first limitation, a residual approximation mechanism was developed to approximate the actual output layer by layer. To obtain more compact fuzzy modules, singular value decomposition was conducted to eliminate the unimportant fuzzy rules, thus surmounting the second limitation. Finally, to prevent overfitting, regularization terms combining the l 1 norm with the l 2 norm were added to the loss function to penalize the parameters in the learning process and thereby solve the third problem. The performance of the proposed CDIRM-RDFS was validated using various types of datasets, including seasonal and non-seasonal as well as cyclical and non-cyclical time series. Compared with some existing popular shallow and deep models, the experimental results indicate that the proposed methodology can simplify the system architecture while improving the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the prediction model.},

Most existing outlier detection algorithms have difficulty detecting outliers that are mixed within normal object regions or around dense clusters. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph neural network structure called the graph autoencoder (GAE), which is capable of handling the task of outlier detection in Euclidean structured data. The GAE can perform feature value propagation in the form of a neural network that changes the distribution pattern of the original dataset, which can accurately detect outliers with low deviation. This method first converts the Euclidean structured dataset into a graph using the graph generation module, then inputs the dataset together with its corresponding graph into the GAE for training, and finally determines the top- n objects that are difficult to reconstruct in the output layer of the GAE as outliers. The results of comparing eight state-of-the-art algorithms on eight real-world datasets showed that GAE achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) on six datasets. By comparing GAE with the autoencoder-based outlier detection algorithm, it was discovered that the proposed method improved the AUC by 16.9\% on average for eight datasets.},

The selected time-delayed traffic series are transformed into traffic state vectors, from which traffic flow is predicted by adopting the combination of support vector regression method and k-nearest neighbors method. We employ the proposed framework for real-world traffic flow prediction.

To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a hybrid particle swarm optimizer with fitness-distance balance and individual self-exploitation strategies, namely, HPSO-FDB-ISE. First, to reduce the probability of becoming trapped in a local optimum for the population, fitness-distance balance is employed to construct an alternative learning exemplar to the global best position. Second, individual self-exploitation is introduced to achieve intelligent exploitation by learning from individual current information for particles. Finally, a nonlinear time-varying inertia weight is used to efficiently balance the exploitation and exploration in the search process. The proposed HPSO-FDB-ISE is evaluated on the CEC 2017 test suite against six state-of-the-art meta -heuristics and seven state-of-the-art PSO variants. Experimental results and statistical analysis reveal that the proposed HPSO-FDB-ISE algorithm yields excellent performances compared to other algorithms that are considered in this paper in the majority of cases.},

Unlike previous studies, the extracted features from each branch of the Siamese network are disentangled into three feature subspaces, namely, an expression-related feature subspace, identity-related feature subspace, and shared feature subspace, to reduce the potential negative effects caused by expression-related features contaminated by identity components. To further enhance the ability to pull the same expressions together and push different expressions apart in the feature space, the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is introduced to design an identity-sensitive and expression-sensitive loss function because of its excellent ability to measure the similarity between high-dimensional vectors. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can produce competitive recognition results compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

Being an emerging paradigm that utilizes widely distributed wireless communication network and smart sensing devices to collect sensing data, crowdsensing service offers a plausibility for collecting real-time data. However, previous studies ignored the complex competition among participants in the free data trade market and the fresh data demands of increasingly popular real-time applications. This paper introduces the age of information (AoI) as a criterion to measure the freshness of data geared towards constructing incentive models for the data provider and data requester. Subsequently, considering the opening of the market, we design a price mechanism framework based on non-cooperative games, which can help the crowdsensing platform provide each participant a stable sensing strategy to maximize profit. For the AoI-sensitive case, i.e., when the data quality deteriorates with the time. A co-evolutionary algorithm based on heuristic search is designed to solve the sensing strategy for each provider to achieve Nash equilibrium . Furthermore, for the case where AoI is insensitive. An improved relaxation algorithm is proposed to provide a stable strategy for the data provider. Numerical findings reveal that the developed algorithm can effectively identify stable sensing strategies in a Nash equilibrium .},

  abstract     = {There is a dilemma regarding the accuracy and reality of vehicle trajectory prediction. Balancing and predicting the effective trajectory is a topic of debate in autonomous driving . We investigated this issue using knowledge-driven and data-driven methods to estimate the performance of the two most common methods and found that improving the accuracy, in reality, is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework for heterogeneous traffic agents, where knowledge residuals are associated with data-driven methods and correct the results to make them more consistent with actual traffic conditions on the premise of high accuracy. Experiments on six public datasets showed that the proposed framework outperforms benchmarks. With an ablation study, we further verified that our method has a good generalisability for new scenarios and high generality in data-driven model selection.},

However, it remains challenging for more efficient scheduling and allocation of users’ application demands with dependence constraints to edge cloud servers. Due to the randomness of the initial population, traditional intelligent optimization algorithms have poor convergence speed in addressing resource scheduling. Therefore, to minimize the execution time of the application, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm to solve the resource scheduling problem with parallelism and subtask dependency. To improve the convergence speed of the algorithm, this paper makes full use of the features of deep Q networks (DQN) and genetic algorithms (GA). The initial population of GA is generated using DQN . Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, this paper selects three real scientific workflows for experiments. The experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm can converge quickly and improve the optimization effect in a short time.},

Spread based indices are introduced to measure vagueness of [0, 1]-valued triangular fuzzy judgments and TFARPRs. A transitivity equation with parameters is devised to define additive consistency of TFARPRs. Values of parameters are then determined to introduce an equivalent definition of additively consistent TFARPRs. Pivotal properties of additively consistent TFARPRs are put forward and a computational formula is designed to obtain additive consistency indices of TFARPRs. A novel method is proposed to generate additively consistent TFARPRs from [0, 1]-valued triangular fuzzy utility vectors. By examining the equivalency of [0, 1]-valued triangular fuzzy utility vectors, a framework is presented to normalize triangular fuzzy utility vectors. A goal programming model is subsequently built to derive normalized triangular fuzzy utility vectors from TFARPRs. This optimization model is transformed into a linear program and its analytical solution is achieved for additively consistent TFARPRs. The performance and validity of the proposed models are demonstrated by three illustrations with comparative analysis.},

They have the capability similar to type-2 fuzzy systems in some regards with less computational costs. This paper presents a nonstationary fuzzy neural network (NFNN) model by combining NFISs and neural networks (NNs). The proposed model synthesizes the logical inference and language expression abilities of NFIS with the learning mechanism of NNs. Hence, it makes NNs more translatable and also achieves self-learning of fuzzy rules. Besides, a fuzzy c-means network (FCMnet) clustering and a modified conjugate gradient method with constrained Armijo-type rule (MCGA) are proposed to initialize and train NFNN, respectively. The proposed FCMnet first combines the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm with NNs. Thus, it not only improves the performance of FCM, but also makes NNs more interpretable. For MCGA, we construct a specific conjugate coefficient to ensure the sufficient descent property and propose a constrained Armijo-type rule to search a suitable learning rate in each iteration. By adopting these two techniques, MCGA achieves a fast convergence speed. In addition, both weak and strong convergence results are proven rigorously. Experiments on 14 datasets are carried out to illustrate the competitive performance of our models.},

For this reason, we first construct four new fuzzy β β -neighborhood operators by using the existing fuzzy β β -neighborhood operator and generalized fuzzy logic operators, and investigate their properties. To better portray the similarity between samples, inspired by the definition of fuzzy similarity relation, we define the concept of fuzzy β β -covering relation. On this basis, we develop a new framework of fuzzy β β -covering rough set models. We further propose an attribute reduction method by employing the new fuzzy β β -covering relation, and design a heuristic attribute reduction algorithm with reference to an uncertainty measure called attribute significance.

It develops a new measure T 2 T2 complexity that quantifies the model’s ability to distinguish classes irrespective of the class imbalance and the threshold applied. The efficiency of the new measure on a real dataset for binary and multiclass classification problems compared with commonly used classification metrics Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F 1 F1 score, Matthews Correlation coefficient, AUC-ROC score, and AUC-PR score. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed measure gives a necessary condition for an optimal classification model.

Nevertheless, the description space of the current evidence theory is only real space, and it cannot effectively describe and process the uncertain information in the face of multidimensional characteristic data and periodic data with phase angle changes. Thus, in this paper, evidence theory is extended to the complex Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The mass function that is used to describe the uncertain information extends from the real space to the complex space, named as complex mass function. The modulus of the complex mass function indicates the degree of support for the proposition . Moreover, other basic concepts that are used to describe uncertainty information are also defined and discussed. To perfect the complex evidence theory, the complex Dempster rule of combination is supplemented. The complex Dempster rule of combination is an extension of Dempster rule of combination, which satisfies the commutative and associative laws just as Dempster rule of combination does, and it can degenerate into Dempster rule of combination. This paper also proposes a method to generate complex mass function and apply it to target recognition. The recognized results show that compared with the mass function, the target recognition rate is larger by using the complex mass function.},

The fleet is able to exhibit a collective behavior without any communication among the aerial vehicles, and if one aircraft is lost, the other vehicles are not affected. Furthermore, the generated number of time steps is kept linear as the number of aerial vehicles increases, and each aircraft is capable of avoiding static and dynamic obstacles, even in the presence of noise. The proposed designing pattern reduces the programming effort necessary for including new formations in the scheme. Besides, all subroutines’ running times are finished within the proposed real-time scheduling. Conclusions are validated by means of simulations.},

  abstract     = {Selecting the appropriate manufacturer is important in customized product development because a poor selection may delay the delivery schedule, increase costs, and even affect product quality. This selection task inherently involves ambiguous and imprecise information from decision-makers. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) sets theory has been proven as a valuable instrument to model human uncertain expressions. However, the existing q-ROF score functions , an essential tool to rank q-ROF values, have some deficiencies, such as generating counterintuitive solutions and antilogarithm or division by zero problems. Furthermore, little research presented the modified best-worst methods (BWM) under q-ROF environments. Nevertheless, these models only generate crisp weights rather than q-ROF weights, which is against the original intention of the q-ROF BWM. To address these problems, this paper first introduces a novel q-ROF score function for measuring q-ROF values. A new q-ROF-BWM is then presented based on the q-ROF preference relations to determine the fuzzy criteria weights. Subsequently, an improved weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) with q-ROF settings is presented. Based on them, an integrated q-ROF-BWM-WASPAS model is introduced to rank manufacturers. Additionally, a case study, sensitivity analysis, and several comparisons are conducted to illustrate and validate the usefulness of the developed model.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm has been used to address the multiview registration of point clouds problem. Most approaches suppose that each data point is generated from the Gaussian mixture model , which notably has difficulty handling outliers and heavy-tail noise. Consequently, this study proposes a novel multiview registration approach based on Student’s-t mixture model (SMM). Specifically, we assume that each data point is generated from a unique SMM, where its nearest neighbors (NNs) in other point clouds are SMM centroids with fixed degrees of freedom, equal covariances, and membership probabilities . Therefore, the multiview registration problem is formulated as the maximization of the likelihood function. Subsequently, the EM algorithm is employed to optimize the rigid transformations used for multiview registration and the only Student’s t-distribution covariance. Because only a few model parameters are optimized, our algorithm achieves promising registration performance. Additionally, all SMM centroids are obtained using the NN search algorithm, which is exceedingly efficient. Moreover, the Student’s t-distribution renders our algorithm inherently robust to outliers and heavy-tail noise. The results of tests on benchmark datasets demonstrate our algorithm’s superior registration performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Furthermore, if X is also a bounded lattice, under suitable conditions preserving the orders on L and X , the induced operator belongs to the lattice of monotone mappings from X to L . The procedure is quite simple, versatile and allows to obtain plenty of different examples in a wide range of lattices. In particular, by appropriate choices of X and L , it can be applied to the most important types of fuzzy sets. The relation with some properties associated to popular types of operators is studied.

  abstract     = {As one of the most important modes of industrial production, the batch process often involves complex and continuous physicochemical reactions, making it challenging to produce identical products between different batch runs even under the same working condition. Optimization and parameter adjustments depend mainly on a good quality prediction model. However, this industrial process has “3M” characteristics of multiple process variables, multiple production phases, and multiple quality indicators, which bring considerable challenges to the accuracy and robustness of the model. This study proposes a multiphase information fusion strategy for data-driven quality prediction of industrial batch processes . Firstly, aiming for real-world industrial datasets with different sampling frequencies, two types of state variables are summarized, and the multiphase-based cumulative quality model is developed. Secondly, information theory with copula entropy is employed to characterize the association relationships between each state variable and the set of multiple quality indicators; thus, phase-specific critical variables are selected by ranking copula entropy. Lastly, a stacking multiway random forest algorithm is proposed to develop the prediction relationship between phase-specific critical variables and multiple quality indicators. Experiments on a real-world industrial dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method has better accuracy and stronger robustness than previous baseline methods .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of low-speed convergence in Reinforcement Learning (RL). As a solution, various potential-based reward shaping techniques were proposed to form the potential function. Learning a potential function is still challenging and comparable to building a value function from scratch. In this work, our main contribution is proposing a new scheme for reward shaping, which combines (1) the Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRN), (2) augmented Krylov, and (3) look-ahead advice to form the potential function. We propose an architecture for GCRN that combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to capture spatial dependencies and Bi-Directional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRUs) to account for temporal dependencies. Our definition of the loss function of GCRN incorporates the message passing technique of the Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Since the transition matrix of the environment is hard to compute, we use the Krylov basis to estimate the transition matrix , which outperforms the existing approximation bases. Unlike existing potential functions that only rely on states to perform reward shaping, we use both the states and actions through the look-ahead advice mechanism to produce more precise advice. Our evaluations conducted on the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo games show that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art that utilizes GCN as the potential function in most games in terms of the learning speed while reaching higher rewards.},

Based on the above motivation, we adopt binary sequences to express letters/numbers, and then specify that the inspiratory and expiratory actions represent one bit information respectively. Breath-holding action serves as an indication of symbol value change (0 ⇄ ⇄ 1). We leverage commercial RFID devices to capture user’s respiratory waveform. A novel recursive algorithm called Dual-Channel Follow-Keep-Pump (DFKP) is proposed to extract channel signals of respiratory waveform. Then we adopt the first-order differential features of channel signals to detect and identify respiratory actions. ExHIBit adaptively adjusts parameters to cope with the non-stationary changes of respiration. Experiments demonstrate that ExHIBit can obtain 95.14\% recognition accuracy and an input speed of 1.86 word/minute.},

However, sometimes data gathered from multiple sources may be lost; it is meaningful and necessary to study the fusion of multi-source incomplete interval-valued data. We propose a novel information fusion method based on information entropy for multi-source incomplete interval-valued data and four incremental fusion mechanisms characterized by the change in information sources and attributes. The corresponding static and dynamic fusion algorithms are designed, and their time complexities are analyzed. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the mean, max, and min fusion methods.

These virtual networks connect people worldwide and provide them excellent platforms for promoting their products and ideas. It is often the case that certain users are more influential than others present on social networks. The process of efficiently recognizing influential users to maximize a particular piece of information across a network is known as Influence Maximization (IM). In this paper, we propose a novel method of influence maximization by using the idea of graph embedding and graph neural networks . This study intends to convert the problem of influence maximization in complex networks into a pseudo-regression problem. As part of our approach, first, we employ the struc2vec node embedding to generate the embedding for every node in the network, and the obtained embedding acts as the feature for each node. The nodes and their features are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based regressor . The labels required for training the GNN for the regression task are obtained by calculating every node’s influence under the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Independent Cascade (IC) information diffusion model . After that, we select an optimal training network by performing a parametric analysis on synthetic test networks. Finally, the trained model is used to predict the probable influence of nodes on the target network. Experimental results on several real-life networks based on various evaluation metrics show that the proposed approach outperforms some of the classical and recently proposed influence maximization methods.},

  abstract     = {In industrial scenarios, knowledge of the severity of defects is needed to distinguish different levels of defects and adapt to the possible modification of defect identification criteria. Well-calibrated detection models are crucial, especially for these decision-making applications. Previous works have measured and calibrated biased confidence estimates of classification and object detection models, while the field of severity calibration has not yet been addressed. Through experiments, we find that the severity also has a specific relationship with the probabilistic prediction of models. Therefore, we present a framework to measure and calibrate severity calibration for defect detection applications by constructing maps between probabilistic prediction , precision, and severity. We find that unlike confidence calibration, the reliability diagram of a well-calibrated model for severity calibration is funnel-shaped instead of linear-shaped. To approximate the funnel-shaped mapping function, we introduce a Gaussian distribution -based function with parameters that are fitted by marked data. Additionally, extending algorithms are proposed to adjust classical confidence calibration methods (e.g., histogram binning , isotonic regression, vector scaling, and temperature scaling) for severity calibration. By mapping the probabilistic prediction to precision, severity calibration is transformed to confidence calibration. The proposed severity calibration methods are evaluated by the expected severity calibration error (ESCE) in comparative experiments , which show that the extended isotonic regression achieves the best performance. In Zhongce’s 21 intelligent detection lines, we applied severity calibration and received good feedback from inspectors.},

Using Lyapunov stability theory and a projection technique, we prove that the proposed protocol not only makes all agents achieve consensus in a fixed-time interval but can also solve the global optimization problem asymptotically. Moreover, the optimization problem with box constraints is studied, and a δ δ -exact penalty method is employed to eliminate the constraints. Similarly, a distributed fixed-time consensus protocol with gradient measurement is developed, and we prove that the optimal solution can be reached asymptotically.

This study improves VP-MFRSs for extension and balance, and thus, decision-theoretic multigranulation fuzzy rough sets (DT-MFRSs) are proposed by systematically fusing the multigranulation maximum and minimum. For DT-MFRSs, their tri-level analysis of measurement, modeling, and reduction is deeply acquired via three-way decisions. First, maximum and minimum membership degrees are linearly combined, and the weight parameter guides a generalized multigranulation membership degree. This adjustable measure motivates DT-MFRSs with positive, negative, and boundary regions, while attitude-preference values of 1, 0, and 0.5 respectively produce optimistic, pessimistic, and compromised models. Then, nonmonotonicity and uncertainty of membership degrees and model regions are determined, and these fundamental characteristics induce new reduction criteria of region preservations. Also, three-way attribute reducts are proposed by preserving positive, negative, and positive–negative regions, and their systematic relationships are obtained. Finally, tri-level results of measures, models, and reducts are validated by table examples and data experiments. In this study, DT-MFRSs extend and improve VP-MFRSs via systematic fusion of membership measurement, and contain optimistic, pessimistic, compromised models, etc., thereby exhibiting extended diversity and applied robustness.

  abstract     = {Optimization problems not only become more and more ubiquitous in various fields, but also become more and more difficult to optimize nowadays, which seriously challenge the effectiveness of existing optimizers like different evolution (DE). To effectively solve this kind of problems, this paper proposes a random neighbor elite guided differential evolution (RNEGDE) algorithm. Specifically, to let individuals explore and exploit the solution space properly, a novel random neighbor elite guided mutation strategy named “DE/current-to-rnbest/1” is first proposed to mutate individuals. In this mutation strategy, several individuals randomly selected from the population for each individual to be updated along with the individual itself form a neighbor region, and then the best one in such a region is adopted as the guiding exemplar to mutate the individual. Due to the random selection of neighbors and the directional guidance of elites, this strategy is expected to direct individuals to promising areas fast without serious loss of diversity. Notably, it is found that two popular mutation strategies, namely “DE/current-to-best/1” and “DE/current-to-pbest/1”, are two special cases of the proposed “DE/current-to-rnbest/1”. Further, to alleviate the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to the involved parameters, this paper utilizes the Gaussian distribution and the Cauchy distribution to adaptively generate parameter values for each individual with the mean value of the Gaussian distribution and the position value of the Cauchy distribution adaptively adjusted based on the evolutionary information of the population. With the above two techniques, the proposed algorithm is expected to effectively search the solution space. At last, extensive experiments conducted on one widely used benchmark function set with three different dimension sizes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves highly competitive or even much better performance than several compared state-of-the-art peer methods.},

  abstract     = {Learning from class-imbalanced data is a tough task, which often leads classifiers to fail on identifying the minority class. To balance the class ratio, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) has shown its improvement in classifying minority class by generating synthetic minority instances. However, in some scenarios, SMOTE and its extensions will generate noise instances and thus causing the performance degradation . This is because of that they were developed based on k NN ( k nearest neighbors), which cannot identify the class distributions between pairs of two minority instances. Furthermore, the number of synthetic instances is left to be discussed in this field of study. To conquer these issues, we propose a new algorithm here named Region-Impurity Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (RIOT). Specifically, a region radius, we locate neighbors for minority instances and whereby to identify the relatively hard-to-learn minority instances, by the class ratio within the region and selecting building the base of sample generation. Then, generating synthetic instances until the region is approximately balanced. In the experiment, the results revealed that RIOT can perform better than some SMOTE extensions with less synthetic instances in terms of several model performance indicators for twelve real-world datasets.},

The extant uncertain machine learning methods with shadowed sets include the unsupervised clustering on only unlabeled data and the supervised classification on only labeled data. However, for the partial labeled data containing both labeled and unlabeled data instances, the studies of uncertain learning methods with shadowed sets are very limited. Aiming at the requirement, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised shadowed set on partial labeled data and thereby construct semi-supervised shadowed neighborhoods to implement the three-way classification of uncertain data. To construct the semi-supervised shadowed set, we reformulate the objective function of shadowed sets, in which the membership loss in fuzzy-rough transformation is weighted by labeled and unlabeled data. We also analyze the influence of labeled data to the shadowed set construction. Experiments validate that the proposed three-way classification method with semi-supervised shadowed sets is effective to utilize partial labeled data to achieve low-risk uncertain data classification .},

Then, we construct the converted matrix based on the proposed score function of IVIFVs by calculating the score value of each IVIFV in the decision matrix (DM) offered by the decision maker (DMK). Then, we construct the NLP model via the obtained converted matrix and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) weight of each attribute given by the DMK. Then, we solve the NLP model to obtain the optimal weight for each attribute. Then, based on the obtained converted matrix and the obtained optimal weight of each attribute, we calculate the weighted score of each alternative. Finally, the alternatives are ranked on the basis of the obtained weighted scores of the alternatives. The larger the weighted score of an alternative, the better the preference order of the alternative. The proposed MADM method can overcome the drawbacks of the existing MADM methods.

The new measure and its bounds are derived from a mass transportation approach in which the expected inner product of two random vectors is taken as a measure of their covariance and then standardized by the maximal attainable value given their marginal covariance matrices . The new correlation is maximized when the average squared Euclidean distance between the random vectors is minimal and attains value one when, additionally, it is possible to establish an affine relationship between the vectors. In several simulative studies we show the limiting distribution of the empirical estimator of the newly defined index and of the corresponding rank correlation. A comparative study based on financial data shows that our proposed correlation, though derived from a novel approach, behaves similarly to some of the multivariate dependence notions recently introduced in the literature. Throughout the paper, we also give some auxiliary results of independent interest in matrix analysis and mass transportation theory, including an improvement to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for positive definite covariance matrices.},

Most existing methods rely on annotated or external data and require retraining models following a region change, thus preventing their large-scale applications. Herein, we propose an unsupervised method denoted as UPAPP for the semantic place annotation of individual trajectories using spatiotemporal information. The Bayesian Criterion is specifically employed to decompose the spatiotemporal probability of visiting the candidate place into spatial probability, duration probability, and visiting time probability. Spatial information in two geospatial data sources is comprehensively integrated to calculate the spatial probability. In terms of the temporal probabilities, the Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency weighting algorithm is used to count the potential visits to different place types in the trajectories and to generate the prior probabilities of the visiting time and duration. Finally, the spatiotemporal probability of the candidate place is then combined with the importance of the place category to annotate the visited places. Experimental results in a trajectory dataset collected by 709 volunteers in Beijing showed that our method achieved an overall and average accuracy of 0.712 and 0.720, respectively, indicating that the visited places can be annotated accurately without any annotated data.},

The user’s authorization is determined by a policy managed by the organization’s trusted authority, while the signature preserves the privacy of the organization’s policy. Signing keys in PBS do not include user identity information and thus can be passed to others, violating the intention of employing PBS to restrict users’ signing capability. In this work, we introduce the notion of traceability for PBS by including user identity in the signing key such that the trusted authority will be able to open a suspicious signature and recover the signer’s identity should the needs arise. We provide rigorous definitions and stringent security notions of traceable PBS (TPBS), capturing the properties of PBS suggested by Bellare-Fuchsbauer and resembling the “full traceability” requirement for group signatures put forward by Bellare-Micciancio-Warinschi (Eurocrypt 2003). As a proof of concept , we provide a modular construction of TPBS, based on a signature scheme, an encryption scheme and a zero-knowledge proof system. Furthermore, to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving TPBS from concrete, quantum-resistant assumptions, we give an instantiation based on lattices .},

The first stage generates the foreground results, and the third stage synthesizes the final image results. The second stage results include two situations: one is to continue to synthesize the foreground results; the other is to synthesize the image results with background information. Experiments demonstrate that the method of continuing to generate the foreground results in the second stage can achieve better results on the Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB) and Oxford-102 datasets, while the way of synthesizing foreground results only in the first stage can obtain better performance on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset. Besides, our synthesized results on the three datasets are subjectively more realistic with better detail processing. It also outperforms most existing methods in quantitative comparison results, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of our method.},

However, designing good approximation algorithms for JSSPs often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for solving JSSPs by using graph neural networks (GNNs) and deep Q-Learning. This single-policy model is suitable for solving instances that have similar sizes and is trained only by observing reward signals and following feasible rules. The trained model behaves like a constructive heuristic algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and each action is determined by the output of a GNN, which captures the current state of the partial solution. We test the proposed approach on JSSP instances with multiple sizes and demonstrate its competitive performance in all cases (after training). Our proposed framework also has the potential to be applied to other JSS subproblems.},

  abstract     = {The heavy dependence on human-curated labels makes supervised algorithms hit a bottleneck in real applications. Fortunately, a more data-efficient learning paradigm—self-supervised learning (SSL) disrupts this dilemma. By creating pretext tasks, self-supervised algorithms learn from the data itself without external supervision. Until recently, SSL has yielded immense success in the image domain, but its research in graph mining has received relatively little scrutiny. In fact, rich topological links and affiliated attributes promise more potential for self-supervised graph learning. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new pretext task called geodesic distance prediction to guide node representation learning . Specifically, this task demands neural nets to learn to infer the geodesic distance of one node relative to the other. Our underlying hypothesis is that doing well on reasoning about the pairwise distance requires the model to extract relation rules between topological distances and attributes. In this way, the complex correlation between nodes can be measured with a simple distance scale. Experiments demonstrate that our S 2 S2 GRL achieves competitive or better performance than many state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. A case study on distance inference shows that S 2 S2 GRL can effectively evaluate the risk of business transactions or make recommendations from a topological view.},

Discriminative feature abstraction is indispensable for boosting the overall performance of learning models. For 3D data, in both point cloud and mesh models, the inner product (cosine similarity) is frequently applied for similarity estimation without normalization. In this paper, we first demonstrate that softmax loss will produce a lower bound and cause a convergence problem if we directly perform feature comparison by cosine similarity. Second, we propose a revised formulation of the softmax loss function that uses an optimized scaled cosine similarity with normalization in the training phase rather than the inner product of two vectors, allowing the network to converge correctly. Experiments show significant improvements over previous methods on several datasets.

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is an intelligent optimization algorithm inspired by biological evolution. Setting a mutation strategy and control parameters that meet the optimization requirements are the premise for DE to achieve good performance. This paper proposes a parameter and strategy adaptive differential evolution algorithm based on accompanying evolution (APSDE). Through the accompanying population, in which individuals are composed of suboptimal solutions, the mutation strategy and control parameters are optimized to realize the adaptation of the strategy and parameters of the main population. Population diversity is enhanced in evolution by generating reverse individuals. In addition, radial spatial projection technology is utilized to track the change in evolution direction with optimization. The performance of APSDE is validated under four sets of benchmark problem suites from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), and compared with state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better optimization performance than the competitive algorithms because of its efficient adaptive mechanism and its excellent population diversity.},

Extraction of wall, ceiling, floor and many objects in the room is the key for many applications including object identification, facility management and reconstruction of building. In view of this, this paper uses exponential function to construct density clustering model according to the local density within cutoff distance . First, the distances between boundary and indoor point cloud are used to construct the constraint condition of wall density clustering. Second, ceiling and floor are extracted according to the density clustering of z direction and local density model. Third, the distance δ i δi is determined according to the size of local density. Simultaneously, we find that the cluster centers are recognized as points for which the product value of the local density and distance δ i δi is anomalously large. Finally, the cluster belonging of each point to the cluster center is determined according to the distance between each point and cluster center. Finally, indoor objects extraction is achieved by judging the distance between neighboring clusters . We conduct the extraction of indoor objects of different type scenes and compare with clustering and deep learning methods. Comparison results show that the proposed method is superior to the clustering and deep learning methods when adjacent objects are not close to each other, but inferior to the deep learning methods when they are next to each other. Additionally, the extraction accuracy, recall and F1-score are calculated according to the matching rate, TP, FP and FN. It illustrates that the performance of the proposed method is affected by the degree of closeness between objects.},

Movement-based three-way decision (M-3WD) and change-based three-way decision (C-3WD) are two emerging studies of three-way decision. A central notion to studies of outcome measures is the change of trisection. In this paper, a novel outcome evaluation model of 3WD is established from a change viewpoint. The purpose of this model is to facilitate some ideal changes and prevent unideal changes. Moreover, the effectiveness measure of outcome aims to change, and it is also reflected in the change. Generally, three-way change (3WC) exists in the research results of many three-way decision models, i.e., Bayesian confirmation rough set, movement-based three-way decision, etc. Of course, three-way changes can also be regarded as a further extension and expansion of these models. With such ideas in mind, evaluation-based 3WC is presented by examining its basic ingredients and application. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by some numerical experiments carried out on public datasets. The considered framework can provide a convenient novel tool for the researches of 3WD.},

However, when modeling this clustering algorithm , it is necessary to initialize two new low-dimensional matrices that are independent of the objective matrix and continuously approximate the objective matrix through alternating iterative updating, thus inevitably introducing some noise factors that are undesirable for the model. Especially in the objective function constructed by square loss , the noise factors have a more significant influence on the clustering performance. To solve this issue, a dual graph-regularized sparse concept factorization (DGSCF) algorithm is proposed in this paper. In addition to maintaining the geometric structure of the data using dual graph regularization , DGSCF adopts an optimization framework based on l 1 l1 and Frobenius norms , which enhance the ability of feature selection and sparsity to eliminate the influence of noise factors on the algorithm performance. The corresponding alternating iterative updating rules and convergence proof of the DGSCF are provided. Finally, experiments on eight public datasets show its effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract     = {The training of accurate deep neural networks using noisy labels is attracting tremendous attention as of late. Several studies have been devoted to noisy-label-based learning using label correction methods. The latest label correction methods provide a theoretical guarantee and avoid the accumulation of irreversible errors. However, these methods often encounter class-biased problems: some classes (“easy”) are easier to correct than others (“hard”). It has been observed that the noisy samples with a lower class confidence are harder to correct, and the class confidence is measured by the average of the model predictions, resulting from the correctly predicted samples across all classes. To address this class-biased problem, we provide a theoretical analysis of the correction procedure by investigating model predictions. Furthermore, we propose a new balance label correction method by employing the statistics of contrastive loss as a dynamic balancing factor that focuses more on the lower confidence hard classes. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we performed experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with various noise patterns and levels. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a superior classification accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art noisy label learning frameworks.},

The server can collude with the user and exploit the search patterns to infer the information of other users, which may cause search pattern leakage. However, current forward privacy solutions can only partially solve the problem. In this paper, a multi-user image retrieval scheme, called multi-user image retrieval with suppression of search pattern (MIRSP), is presented to suppress the search pattern leakage. This scheme uses a blockchain structure to establish an optimized tree index. Meanwhile, compressive sensing is used to convert high-dimensional feature vectors into similarity-preserving binary codes , which reduces the similarity calculation cost and guarantees the security of nodes. Then, a path shuffling algorithm is proposed to hide the identifier and position of the search nodes. Finally, a fully trusted certificate authority center is added to ensure the security management and distribution of keys and avoid unnecessary communication overhead . Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed MIRSP is 3 × faster than the state-of-the-art schemes in search computation times, which demonstrates that MIRSP contributes significantly in providing security and privacy protection in multi-user scenarios.},

There have been researched works of recommender systems in various fields, but few of them lucubrates systems that recommend statutes for cases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research on recommending statutes by modeling the relationship between case content and law content with interpretable hand-crafted features. In this paper, we define five novel types of features for calculating relevance between a case and a statute for resorting all statutes retrieved through collaborative filtering for the input case. Both pair-wise and list-wise ranking models are trained based on all these features for re-ranking the statutes list. Besides, we also test the combinations of different learning algorithms and popular pre-trained language models . Experimental results show that adopting the proposed novel features in pair-wise ranking achieves the best performance. It improves the recommendation recall of the Top 1 statute by almost 5\% compared with the collaborative filtering approach.},

First, the plain image is sparsely represented in the wavelet packet domain. Then, the coefficient matrix is scrambled and compressed using parallel compressive sensing with assistance from the newly developed adaptive-thresholding sparsification model. Next, the compressed image is re-encrypted by the FAN transform and diffusion to generate a noise-like secret image . Finally, the reversible matrix encoding-based embedding method is employed to create a meaningful cipher image. To improve the execution efficiency of the encryption algorithm without affecting the security performance, a low-dimensional discrete memristive chaotic map is designed and applied in the compression, encryption and embedding stages. Additionally, the Lp matrix norm is utilized to establish an adaptive threshold model to effectively enhance the compression performance .

However, most of the existing methods rely on heavy backbone networks , require high-performance hardware platform support and take a long time to calculate, which are difficult prerequisites to apply in practice. In consideration of the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a lightweight traffic density estimation method based on structured knowledge transfer (Le-SKT). This method consists of a teacher network and student network. In the teacher network, in order to solve the problem of variable vehicle scales in video images, a multiscale fusion structure is designed, which can fully fuse the low-level and high-level features of an image. To solve the problem of background interference in video images, a fusion module based on an attention mechanism is constructed to enhance the useful traffic flow feature information and suppress the background information. At the same time, the fused traffic flow feature information is dilated convoluted to expand the receptive field and obtain richer contextual vehicle feature information, which generates a trained teacher network. Finally, a lightweight student network is generated by using the structured knowledge of the teacher network, which solves the problems of long computing times and high hardware requirements. The MAE and GAME of this method are reduced to 3.92 and 5.69, respectively in the TRANCOS dataset and 3.74 and 5.57, respectively in the VisDrone2019 vehicle dataset, respectively; The parameter quantity of the student network is only 0.65\% of that of the teacher network, which greatly reduces the scale of the neural network model and is suitable for an embedded computing platform with low performance.},

To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing task planning algorithms either ignore energy constraints or make energy scheduling decisions based on simple rules. To bridge these research gaps, we propose a combinatorial optimization model for the simultaneous task and energy planning (STEP) problem. In this paper, we propose three variants of STEP problems (i) the vehicle can visit stationary charging stations multiple times at various locations; (ii) the vehicle can efficiently coordinate with mobile charging stations to achieve zero waiting time for recharging, and (iii) the vehicle can maximally harvest solar energy by considering time variance in solar irradiance. Besides, in order to obtain fast and reliable solutions to STEP problems, we propose a neural combinatorial optimizer using the deep reinforcement learning algorithm with a proposed link information filter. The near-optimal solutions can be obtained very fast without solving the problem from scratch when environments change. Our simulation results demonstrate that (i) our proposed neural optimizer can find solutions close to the optimum and outperform the exact and heuristic algorithms in terms of computational cost; (ii) the end-to-end learning (directly mapping from perceptions to control) model outperforms the traditional learning (mapping from perception to prediction to control) model.},

The iLDCBOF has many advanced advantages compared to previously reported iLOF-based studies: (1) it is based on a newly-developed core k-nearest neighbor (CkNN) concept to reliably and scalably detect outliers from data streams and prevent the clustering of outliers; 2) it uses a newly-developed algorithm that automatically adjusts the value of the k (number of neighbors) parameter for different real-time applications; and 3) it uses the Mahalanobis distance metric, so its performance is not affected even for large amounts of data. The iLDCBOF method is well suited for different data stream applications because it requires no distribution assumptions, it is parameterless (determined automatically), and it is easy to implement. ROC-AUC and statistical test analysis results from extensive experiments performed on 16 different real-world datasets showed that the iLDCBOF method significantly outperformed benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in transportation and necessary for congestion mitigation, traffic control, and intelligent traffic management. Deep learning models can aid in high-accuracy traffic flow forecasting; however, the current research focuses only the ability of the model to capture dynamic spatiotemporal features, and studies on the effect of deeper network layers on spatiotemporal features—a critical factor affecting traffic flow forecasting accuracy—are limited. In this paper, we propose an attention-based spatiotemporal graph attention network (ASTGAT) model designed for network degradation and over-smoothing problems to investigate in-depth spatiotemporal information. Compared to other networks, ASTGAT can capture dynamic spatiotemporal correlations in data and deepen the network to improve prediction accuracy through multiple residual convolution and high-low feature concat. ASTGAT comprises three components that separately model the temporal relationships of the recent, daily, and weekly periods. Each component stacks multiple spatiotemporal blocks constructed using the attention mechanism, dilated gated convolution , and graph attention network . The graph and temporal attention layers capture spatiotemporal information dynamically, and the graph attention layer alleviates the over-smoothing phenomenon to deepen the network. The combined utilization of the attention mechanism and dilated gated convolution layer improves the medium and long temporal span prediction ability. We validated ASTGAT using two open highway datasets, and the results demonstrated that our ASTGAT model effectively extracts in-depth spatiotemporal information and the prediction results outperform those predicted by the current eight baselines. Our research is dedicated to establishing a better scientific basis for intelligent traffic management that can assist in decision making.},

Such QoS abuse has eluded systematic treatment; known defenses using Client authorization, payments, or service request inspection prior to QoS assignment, are heuristic and environment-specific. We offer a game-theoretic approach on the premise that a service request is occasionally trusted to reduce the inspection cost. We call Fake VIP attack (FVA) a form of QoS abuse that consciously exploits Server’s trust. An FVA strategy instills trust to maximize Client’s utility gained from successful FVAs, whereas a trust strategy maximizes Server’s utility by trading her loss due to successful FVAs against the request inspection cost. We consider a realistic scant-transparency setting where only long-term utilities are observable. Against a probabilistic FVA strategy we design a trust strategy based on double-blind reputation . Assuming a memoryless service request stream we analyze the impact of the request inspection cost and information leakage on the utilities at the Stackelberg equilibrium of the arising game. Experimental comparison with a real-world internally correlated stream is also shown.},

In the light of a fundamental principle in machine learning, that is, a model with smaller parameters holds improved generalization, we recommend using symmetric zero-centered distributions in constructing SCNs to improve the generalization performance . Further, we introduce a scalar in the distributions to make the SCN model adaptively feasible to different datasets. Simulation results are reported for both regression and classification tasks over twenty-one benchmark datasets using SCN.

In some situations, a trade-off of the distances to the two extreme reference points may not necessarily be meaningful. Inspired by the theory of three-way decision as thinking in threes (e.g., two opposite poles and a third middle), in this paper we generalize the classical TOPSIS by adding a third middle reference point. We use a common setting for investigating systematically reference-point-based TOPSIS-style multi-criteria decision-making methods. In particular, we examine three classes of approaches: a) a best reference point based model (i.e., B-TOPSIS) and a worst reference point based model (i.e., W-TOPSIS), b) the classical best and worst reference points based model (i.e., BW-TOPSIS), and c) a new best, mean, and worst reference points based model (i.e., BMW-TOPSIS). The three classes are one-way TOPSIS, two-way TOPSIS, and three-way TOPSIS, respectively. Based on one-way and two-way TOPSISs , we give two specific methods of three-way TOPSIS.

  abstract     = {In some stock markets, stock prices are not allowed to rise above a daily limit to restrain the surge of price (called price limit). When the price limit occurs, investors tend to chase the continuing upward momentum for profit-making. However, For the stocks that hit daily price limit, we observe whether they close at daily price limit will lead to the opposite price trends of the next trading day. Therefore, this work aims to predict whether a stock that hits its daily price limit will also close at the same price level ( i . e ., Type I or Type II). The occurrence of price limit is driven by different levels of market state. For example, it can result from macro-economic changes of the whole market, or it can be traced to some industry-specific factors. A challenging task is to learn a better stock representation with less uncertainty by comprehensively considering the hierarchical property of market state. Accordingly, we design a novel hierarchical architecture, called Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN), to investigate the market state at hierarchical view for stock type prediction. In HGNN, we construct the stock relation graph and merge stock information hierarchically extracted from multiple views of market state, including node view, relation view and graph view, which takes both historical sequence pattern and stock relation into consideration. Our key innovation is the introduction of hierarchical structure makes the predictive model able to more comprehensively infer the hierarchical property of market state. Further, it also provides the deeper insight for the actual investment practice. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct back-testing on the two-year historical data of more than 2500 main-board stocks in two China stock markets, SSE and SZSE. To support further study of the stock type prediction task, we have published two long-range stock datasets (Datasets are available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXiAyqt3rHveuzdGT6YtswU1e-tBSFUe/view?usp=sharing ). Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions including ALSTM, GCN and GAT with the improvements of at least 3.54\% on average in accuracy. In addition, the average return ratio of SSE and SZSE has improved by 18.57\% and 8.75\%, respectively.},

Considering IoT, where smart objects can be clients and providers of services for each other, trust between objects is a significant concern for selecting the most appropriate service providers. Trust is an uncertain concept, and its uncertainty originates from different sources, including context conditions, social relationships, and the accuracy of quantitative evaluations . Modeling and considering uncertainty in trust management for the IoT is the principal objective of this research. To this aim, several sources of uncertainty are modeled in trust calculations where interval neutrosophic numbers are used for modeling imprecision , indeterminacy , and inconsistency of the trustworthiness data . In the proposed model, trust in the quality of the provided services (QoS trust), as well as trust in the honesty of the socially related entities providing trust-related information (i.e. social trust), and trust in the suitability of context conditions (i.e. context-trust) are considered to calculate the overall trust used for the decision-making process. The impact of each of these dimensions on the final calculated trust has been evaluated in different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Recently, dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) with transfer learning have become popular for solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs), as the used transfer learning methods in DMOEAs can effectively generate a good initial population for the new environment. However, most of them only transfer non-dominated solutions from the previous one or two environments, which cannot fully exploit all historical information and may easily induce negative transfer as only limited knowledge is available. To address this problem, this paper presents a multiple source transfer learning method for DMOEA , called MSTL-DMOEA, which runs two transfer learning procedures to fully exploit the historical information from all previous environments. First, to select some representative solutions for knowledge transfer, one clustering-based manifold transfer learning is run to cluster non-dominated solutions of the last environment to obtain their centroids, which are then fed into the manifold transfer learning model to predict the corresponding centroids for the new environment. After that, multiple source transfer learning is further run by using multisource TrAdaboost, which can fully exploit information from the above centroids in new environment and old centroids from all previous environments, aiming to construct a more accurate prediction model. This way, MSTL-DMOEA can predict an initial population with better quality for the new environment. The experimental results also validate the superiority of MSTL-DMOEA over several competitive state-of-the-art DMOEAs in solving various kinds of DMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Medical Dialogue Information Extraction has attracted increasing attention due to its great potential for application in electronic medical record generation, automatic disease diagnosis, etc. Recent methods have achieved considerable success but still suffer from two inherent limitations. On the one hand, a medical dialogue is composed of multiple utterances from two speaker roles, i.e., doctor and patient. Existing methods often ignore the transition and interaction of speaker roles. It makes the model unable to handle personal pronoun ambiguity. On the other hand, traditional methods have a weak ability to capture the information of multi-turn dialogue and lack the guidance of global context. In this paper, we propose a novel C ontext- S ensitive D eep M atching model for medical information extraction in multi-turn dialogue, dubbed CSDM. Specifically, we first introduce a multi-view aware channel, which exploits multiple mask templates to capture different information in dialogues. Thus, the transition and interaction of speaker roles are considered in the model. Second, we utilize a bi-directional attention mechanism to assess the relative importance of different contexts. Therefore, the proposed model can perceive information of multi-turn dialogue. Extensive experiments on a public benchmark dataset show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CSDM.},

This method requires eliciting several preference parameters (namely, the weights and the veto thresholds). A direct elicitation of such parameters can be cognitively very demanding; thus, it is adequate to define the parameters in a way that requires much less cognitive effort from the decision-maker. The model parameters can be indirectly elicited by using holistic information provided by the decision-maker; this information can be given in the form of a ranking on a set of reference alternatives and some additional preference information. This paper proposes an aggregation-disaggregation approach for inferring the model parameters of the hierarchical E lectre III based on an evolutionary algorithm .

Frist, to extract structural clusters effectively, DBSCAN is considered as the basic clustering algorithm in this research.

Third, to realize an efficient online structural clustering, especially in big data analysis, a series of granular fuzzy models are built with consideration of structural information, then a rule-based model is formed for guiding online clustering of new testing data. Through the proposed method, the online clustering ability of DBSCAN is developed with reduced computation cost, meanwhile the structural clustering ability is also retained in online testing. Experiments on synthetic data, publicly available data and real-world data are discussed, online testing accuracy and computation time are evaluated to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

They are the most studied ones, and a vast literature on linear systems focuses on finding solutions and solvability criteria for such systems. The situation is quite different with the so-called weakly linear systems, in which an unknown fuzzy relation is on both sides of the equation or inequality. Precisely, the scholars have only given the characterization of the set of exact solutions to such systems. This paper describes the set of fuzzy relations that solve weakly linear systems to a certain degree and provides ways to compute them. We pay special attention to developing the algorithms for computing fuzzy preorders and fuzzy equivalences that are solutions to some extent to weakly linear systems. We establish additional properties for the set of such approximate solutions over some particular types of complete residuated lattices . We demonstrate the advantage of this approach via many examples that arise from the problem of aggregation of fuzzy networks.},

  abstract     = {With the development of deep learning , AI-synthesized techniques, such as DeepFake , are widely spread on the Internet. Although many state-of-the-art detection methods have been able to obtain a good detection performance, most neural network models based on data-driven training lack interpretability during feature extraction and analysis. In this study, we propose an interpretable DeepFake video detection method based on facial textural disparities in multi-color channels. We observe that the face region from the DeepFake video appears to be smoother than that of the real one. First, we analyze the statistical disparities between the real and fake frame in each color channel. Next, it is proposed to use the co-occurrence matrix to construct a low-dimensional set of features to distinguish the real video from the DeepFake video. Meanwhile, we evaluate the video-level and frame-level detection performance on the benchmark, where the method can achieve AUC value of 0.996 on FaceForensics++, and 0.718 on Celeb-DF. Our proposed method performs remarkably better than the traditional machine learning based detectors, and comparably to some current deep learning based detectors. More importantly, our proposed method is robust in the face of compression attacks, and more time-efficient compared to existing methods based on deep learning.},

AutoCNN is evaluated using MNIST, MNIST-rot-back-image, Fashion MNIST and the ADHD200 datasets to measure the performance on small datasets with varied feature distributions. The results indicate that AutoCNN optimizes the CNN network architecture and helps maximise the classification performance. The data-driven network determination approach introduced in this paper was found to not only provides competitive performance similar to existing evolutionary computation based network determination algorithms in literature, but was found to be an effective optimization tool to improve the performance of existing CNN architectures. Further, the AutoCNN was found to highly immune to noise in the dataset and has proven to be effective method to transfer knowledge between related datasets.

Spatial information is used for synchronization accompanied by state information, which is called hybrid coupling. By constructing appropriate controllers located in the boundary, synchronization matter for MDCRDNNHC with nonzero boundary values is solved. Inner coupling matrices (IMs) and outer coupling matrices (OMs) can be directed, competitive and even not connected in this paper. We propose a novel strategy to fuse current two technical routes for directed networks with multiweights. For MDCRDNNHC with diagonal IMs, we prove that if the weighted (added) combinations of multiple OMs for each dimension are strongly connected, and the Chebyshev distance among their normalized left eigenvectors of added OMs corresponding to zero eigenvalue for each dimension is less than a threshold, then synchronization can be attained. In addition, it is also applicable for positive definite but non-diagonal IMs under this fusion technique. Numerical examples are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theoretical results.},

RBSOM-CWMdd is a batch SOM algorithm for dissimilarity data where each cluster representative is a set of weighted objects whose cardinality is fixed, being the same for all clusters. These weights are computed according to each object relevance to the referred cluster. Likewise, RBSOM-ACWMdd is a batch SOM algorithm for dissimilarity data where each cluster representative is a vector of weighted objects selected according to its relevance to the referred cluster. Therefore, the dimensionality of the cluster representatives self adapt to the particular dataset analysed, change at each algorithm iteration and can differ from one cluster to another. Experiments with 12 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository regarding the metrics of Normalized Mutual Information, Topological error, and Silhouette Coefficient showed that the proposed methods improved, respectively, the traditional set-medoids and multi-medoids SOM methods with a competitive temporal complexity. In addition, it was performed an application study on Ecoli dataset where the proposed RBSOM-ACWMdd algorithms produced a better mapping from a clustering point of view.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, graph optimization dimensionality reduction methods have become a research hotspot in machine learning . The main challenge of these methods is how to choose proper neighbors for graph construction . For high-dimensional data clustering tasks , most methods often conduct a dimensionality reduction method at first and then perform a clustering method in sequence. However, such a sequential strategy may not be optimal because the reduced data obtained in the first stage may not be suitable for clustering. In this article, a novel method called Projected Fuzzy c-means with Probabilistic Neighbors(PFCM), which unifies graph optimization and Fuzzy c-means, is proposed. Our model projects the data into an optimal subspace at first and then learns the sparse weights matrix by considering probabilistic neighbors and membership matrix together on the projected data. The above two steps run iteratively until the algorithm converges. Especially, L 0 L0 -norm constraints are employed on the weights matrix to avoid the obstacles caused by outliers. An optimization procedure is designed to solve the proposed model effectively. We conducted numerous experiments on eight benchmark data sets. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is better than some available dimensionality reduction algorithms for clustering tasks .},

The overall kinematics model of the omnidirectional mobile platform and the manipulator fixed on omnidirectional platform are established. First, the analysis of the current repetitive movement generation (RMG) scheme for the kinematic control of the manipulator can find that the position error does not theoretically converge to zero and fluctuates. This paper analyzes the phenomenon from a theoretical viewpoint and reveals that the current RMG scheme has position errors associated with joint errors. Then, to solve the shortcomings of the current solution, an orthogonal projection repetitive motion generation (OPRMG) method is proposed, which theoretically eliminates position errors and decouples joint space and Cartesian space. Using the gradient descent method to establish the corresponding GNN aided with the speed compensation, and provide theoretical analysis to reflect the stability. Moreover, the joint speed limit in the RMG scheme is extended to nonconvex constraints. The advantages of the OPRMG scheme are demonstrated by the simulation results of the omnidirectional mobile manipulator (OMM) synthesized by the current GNNRMG and the proposed GNNOPRMG. In addition, by adjusting the feedback coefficient , the high performance of the OPRMG scheme can be verified by simulation and comparison of the position error (PE) and joint error (JE) of the OMM.},

In order to avoid feasibility verification in the traditional BLF method, a piecewise and differentiable function named the shift function is skillfully inserted into the coordination transformation of the controller design process, allowing not only the initial value of MASs states to be chosen arbitrarily, but also the settling time of bipartite consensus errors can be pre-designated. According to the backstepping framework, an approximated-free control algorithm is developed by combining the shift function with BLF, which guarantees that for any initial state of MASs, the outputs of all the agents can achieve the practical fixed-time bipartite consensus tracking, and all the signals in closed-loop systems are bounded. Especially, the settling time and the tracking error accuracy can be appointed by the designer. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method .},

Firstly, a stochastic configuration algorithm is employed to determine the number of hidden nodes, the input weights and biases. Secondly, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is used to evaluate the output weights of the SCN learner model under the assumption that outliers or noises obey the Student’s-t mixture distribution. Because the output weights cannot be solved directly due to the unknown hyper-parameters of the mixture distribution, we apply the well-known expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm for optimizing the hyper-parameters of the mixture distribution and update the output weights iteratively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by a function approximation, four benchmark datasets, and a case study on industrial data modelling for a waste incineration process .

To predict the future value of the target variable, STSM is required to learn a mapping from original attractors to delay attractors in an end-to-end framework. The results of ablation and contrast experiments on one simulated dataset and seven real-world datasets show that STSM not only performs better than a separate temporal or spatial module, but also predicts more accurately than other traditional methods.

These unconfirmed infected individuals move and spread the virus freely, presenting difficult challenges to the control of the pandemic. To reveal the actual pandemic situation in a given region, a simple dynamic susceptible-unconfirmed-confirmed-removed (D-SUCR) model is developed taking into account the influence of unconfirmed cases, the testing capacity, the multiple waves of the pandemic, and the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Using this model, the total numbers of infected cases in 51 regions of the USA and 116 countries worldwide are estimated, and the results indicate that only about 40\% of the true number of infections have been confirmed. In addition, it is found that if local authorities could enhance their testing capacities and implement a timely strict quarantine strategy after identifying the first infection case, the total number of infected cases could be reduced by more than 90\%. Delay in implementing quarantine measures would drastically reduce their effectiveness.},

Based on the diagnosis method, we address a novel design algorithm for a state-feedback corrective controller that matches the stable-state behavior of the closed-loop system to that of a reference model, while accommodating the permanent damage to the sensor.

In analog fading channels, a homogeneous Markov chain is forwarded to model the random time-varying amplitude attenuation. Aiming at alleviating the utilization of energy consumption and preventing data collision/congestion in constraint networks, a Markov communication protocol is exploited to orchestrate the data transmission, in which only one sensor can get permission to release the measurement during each time interval . In virtue of the merging strategy, a new joint Markov chain is presented to incorporate the fading channels and the communication protocol. Differently, in order to eliminate the obstacle of design conservatism, a novel peak-to-peak filter design methodology is developed, whose asynchronization is described by a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model. Under the aforementioned framework, the resulting system is stochastically stable with a desired peak-to-peak performance index. To this end, a practical example is addressed to indicate the validity and applicability of the presented peak-to-peak filter design strategy.},

In the first stage, the distributed prescribed-time event-triggered algorithm is proposed to minimize the local objective functions of each agent at the prescribed-time interval. In the second stage, the algorithm is driven to optimize the global cost function while maintaining the gradient sum of all local cost functions to zero. The criteria for achieving the consensus and optimization of MASs are obtained by using Lyapunov stability theory and optimization theory .

  abstract     = {In label distribution learning, high dimensionality is one of the most prominent characteristics of the data, which increases the model complexity and computational cost. Feature selection is an efficient technique to mitigate the “curse of dimensionality”. The current label distribution feature selection approach based on mutual information employs the heuristic search algorithm to identify the most discriminative features . However, this method can be time-consuming and fall into local optimum. Motivated by this, in this paper, an approach named relevance-based label distribution feature selection via convex optimization is proposed, which takes both feature relevance and label relevance (i.e., label correlation) into account. For features, the relevance to labels calculated by mutual information is considered into a convex optimization function to guide the feature selection process. Compared with the heuristic search , the learning framework for optimization purposes is more conducive to reducing repetitive computations and avoiding the local optimum. For labels, the Pearson correlation coefficient is exploited to describe the correlation information between labels, aiming to enhance the generalization ability of the learning model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on twenty datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with eight state-of-the-art methods in terms of six evaluation metrics .},

This study developed a hybrid stock price index forecasting modelling framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD), which can capture the inherent features of the complex dynamics of stock price index time series. In conjunction with time–frequency analysis and deep learning algorithms, the proposed modelling framework implemented multi-step-ahead forecasting for stock price indexes using a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) strategy, where MEMD was first employed to simultaneously decompose the relevant features of the stock price index. Then LSTM was used to train the forecasting model by using the components extracted by MEMD and performing multi-step-ahead forecasting of the closing price of the stock price index. The hyperparameters of the LSTM model were optimized using an orthogonal array tuning method (OATM) based on the Taguchi design of experiments for enhancing the performance of prediction. Three real-world datasets were used for model validation from three exchange markets including Standard &amp; Poor 500 index (SPX), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Hang Seng Index (HSI). The results of the experiments suggested that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the benchmark models and improves the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasting.},

In this study, we present a cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm by dynamically grouping decision variables to effectively tackle MOPs with changing decision variables. In the presented algorithm, decision variables are grouped into a series of groups using maximum entropic epistasis (MEE) at first, with decision variables in different groups owning a weak dependency. Subsequently, a sub-population is generated to solve decision variables in each group with an existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). Further, a complete solution including all the decision variables is achieved through the cooperation among sub-populations. Finally, when a decision variable is added or deleted from the existing problem, the grouping of decision variables is dynamically adjusted based on the correlation between the changed decision variable and existing groups. To verify the performance of the developed method, the presented method is compared with five popular methods by tackling eight benchmark optimization problems. The experimental results reveal that the presented method is superior in terms of diversity, convergence, and spread of solutions on most benchmark optimization problems.},

The essential idea is to force the latent features of hidden layer to be more concentrated, which enhances the generalization performance . Besides, the proposed modified graph regularization facilitates the calculation of gradient and is more capable to penalize the extreme values of weights. Furthermore, the graph regularization can also be integrated with deep neural networks to improve their generalization performance. In addition, we provide the convergence analysis of our method BPGR under some regularity conditions .

We address this issue by extending landscape analysis to constrained multiobjective optimization. By employing four exploratory landscape analysis techniques, we propose 29 landscape features (of which 19 are novel) to characterize CMOPs. These landscape features are then used to compare eight frequently used artificial test suites against a recently proposed suite consisting of real-world problems based on physical models. The experimental results reveal that the artificial test problems fail to adequately represent some realistic characteristics, such as strong negative correlation between the objectives and the overall constraint violation. Moreover, our findings show that all the studied artificial test suites have advantages and limitations, and that no “perfect” suite exists. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed features at predicting algorithm performance is demonstrated for two multiobjective optimization algorithms. Benchmark designers can use the obtained results to select or generate appropriate CMOP instances based on the characteristics they want to explore.},

Consequently, a large teacher network is not necessarily the most suitable teacher to guide the student. Therefore, this study proposes a multiple homogeneous teacher-guided KD method. First, multiple networks with the same structure as that of the student are pretrained to act as a teacher group, which is different from utilizing a large teacher network in traditional KD, to alleviate the capacity gap between the teacher and student. Second, a confidence-adaptive initialization strategy is developed to initialize the student network, which learns knowledge from the pretrained teacher group. Experiments are performed on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet using three networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KD method outperforms existing advanced KD methods. Furthermore, a similarity loss function is introduced to optimize the parameters of the classifier in the student network. The experimental results indicate that this loss function improves the performance for basic classification tasks without KD and efficiently works in the proposed KD method.},

Thus, edge-thing systems will replace the classic cloud-thing/cloud-edge-thing systems and become mainstream gradually, where IoT devices can offload their tasks to neighboring edge nodes. A common problem is how to utilize edge computing resources. For the sake of fairness, double auction can be used in the edge-thing system to achieve an effective resource allocation and pricing mechanism. Due to the lack of third-party management agencies and mutual distrust between nodes, in our edge-thing systems, we introduce blockchains to prevent malicious nodes from tampering with transaction records and smart contracts to act as an auctioneer to realize resources auction. Since the auction results stored in this blockchain-based system are transparent, they are threatened with inference attacks. Thus in this paper, we design a differentially private combinatorial double auction mechanism by exploring the exponential mechanism such that maximizing the revenue of edge computing platform, in which each IoT device requests a resource bundle and edge nodes compete with each other to provide resources. It can not only guarantee approximate truthfulness and high revenue, but also ensure privacy security.

  abstract     = {Sentence representation approaches have been widely used and proven to be effective in many text modeling tasks and downstream applications. Many recent proposals are available on learning sentence representations based on deep neural frameworks. However, these methods are pre-trained in open domains and depend on the availability of large-scale data for model fitting. As a result, they may fail in some special scenarios, where data are sparse and embedding interpretations are required, such as legal, medical, or technical fields. In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning method to exploit representations of sentences for some closed domains via topic modeling. We reformulate the inference process of the sentences with the corresponding contextual sentences and the associated words, and propose an effective context-enhanced process called the bi-Directional Context-enhanced Sentence Representation Learning (bi-DCSR). This method takes advantage of the semantic distributions of the nearby contextual sentences and the associated words to form a context-enhanced sentence representation. To support the bi-DCSR, we develop a novel Bayesian topic model to embed sentences and words into the same latent interpretable topic space called the Hybrid Priors Topic Model (HPTM). Based on the defined topic space by the HPTM, the bi-DCSR method learns the embedding of a sentence by the two-directional contextual sentences and the words in it, which allows us to efficiently learn high-quality sentence representations in such closed domains. In addition to an open-domain dataset from Wikipedia, our method is validated using three closed-domain datasets from legal cases, electronic medical records, and technical reports. Our experiments indicate that the HPTM significantly outperforms on language modeling and topic coherence, compared with the existing topic models. Meanwhile, the bi-DCSR method does not only outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods on closed domain sentence classification tasks, but also yields competitive performance compared to these established approaches on the open domain. Additionally, the visualizations of the semantics of sentences and words demonstrate the interpretable capacity of our model.},

  abstract     = {Q-learning (QL) is a popular method for control problems, which approximates the maximum expected action value using the maximum estimated action value, thus it suffers from positive overestimation bias. Various algorithms have been proposed to reduce overestimation bias. But some of these methods cause underestimation bias. Furtherly, about underestimation, which kind of estimators causes underestimation is less understood. In this paper, instead of a certain specific method, we focus on underestimation estimators, especially on K estimates of the action values. We generalize these estimators to propose an Underestimation Estimator Set (UES) and theoretically prove all of the estimators in this set suffer from underestimation bias. We further study the bias properties of these estimators and conclude that their biases are different from each other’s and depend on the specific conditions they meet. Thus, our set provides various estimators for QL in different settings. Finally, to better illustrate the properties of estimators, we test the performance of several estimators in our set. Empirical results show that Median estimator (Me) underestimates less than double Q-learning (DQL) and doesn’t suffer overestimation as QL, and Min estimator (M1E) underestimates more than DQL. Besides, Me and M1E perform as well as or better than other estimators on some benchmark environments.},

For the interval type-2 FNN , both the system states and control inputs are utilized as its inputs. Then, by using respectively the linear and the integral sliding variables depending on both the system state and control input, the design of novel interval type-2 FNN-integrated intelligent dynamic practical SMCs to achieve practical sliding modes in finite time is presented. The resulting practical sliding motions are proved to be semi-global practical finite-time stochastic stable based on the Lyapunov function. Furthermore, by exploring some adaptive laws based on the interval type-2 FNN, the unknown function can be approximated, and even the bound of the approximation errors of the interval type-2 FNN can be estimated, under the system perturbation.

In addition, PDMOEAs combat difficulties in achieving the proper balance between convergence and diversity. To overcome this issue, recently, additional convergence-related metrics have been proposed for PDMOEAs to improve their performance by enhancing the selection pressure towards the true Pareto front ; however, these approaches have limitations. To address the drawbacks of the previous approaches, in this paper, we propose an adaptive neighborhood based evolutionary algorithm with pivot-solution based selection (Pi-MOEA) to tackle multi- and many-objective optimization problems . The proposed Pi-MOEA approach identifies a set of pivot-solutions to improve the convergence performance. An adaptive neighborhood is designed among the individuals, and the average ranking method is employed to identify the pivot-solutions within the neighborhood. In addition, to preserve the population diversity, density estimation based on Euclidean distance is adopted in Pi-MOEA. The performance of the Pi-MOEA is investigated extensively on 26 test problems from three popular benchmark problem suites by comparing them with seven state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the Pi-MOEA algorithm performs considerably better when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Computing PageRank for large graphs is challenging and this has motivated the studies of distributed algorithms to compute PageRank. Previously, little works have been spent on the distributed PageRank algorithms with strong guarantees on both complexity and accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the theoretical aspect and study the complexity of distributed PageRank computation based on the well-known congested-clique model with a bandwidth generalization. An existing algorithm proposed by Sarma et al.

We present Radar-Push (RP), which is a distributed PageRank algorithm that is strictly better in round complexities. Specifically, Radar-Push uses O ( log log n ) O(loglogn) communication rounds and an edge bandwidth of O ( ( log n ) 3 ) O((logn)3) bits. We further show that Radar-Push can be adapted to efficiently compute an important variant of PageRank, namely, the batch one-hop personalized PageRank, in O ( log log n ) O(loglogn) communication rounds.},

However, the existing neural topic models may suffer from the feature sparsity problem when applied to short texts, due to the lack of context in each message. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Context Reinforced Neural Topic Model (CRNTM), whose characteristics can be summarized as follows. First, by assuming that each short text covers only a few salient topics, the proposed CRNTM infers the topic for each word in a narrow range. Second, our model exploits pre-trained word embeddings by treating topics as multivariate Gaussian distributions or Gaussian mixture distributions in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on two benchmark short corpora validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on both topic discovery and text classification .},

Based on these observations, a dynamic fitness landscape-based adaptive mutation strategy selection differential evolution (DFLDE) is proposed in this paper. In DFLDE, the optimal mutation strategy selection is based on each optimization problem&#39;s dynamic fitness landscape characteristics during the evolutionary process.

Given the importance of this task, various methods have already been proposed in the literature that focus on syntactic, semantic and neural representations of tables for determining table relevance. However, recent works have highlighted queries that are consistently difficult for baseline methods to satisfy, referred to as hard queries . For this reason, the objectives of this paper include: (1) effectively satisfying hard queries by proposing three classes of qualitative measures, namely coherence, interpretability and exactness, (2) offering a systematic approach to interpolate these three classes of measures with each other and with baseline table retrieval methods , and (3) performing extensive experiments using a range of baseline retrieval methods to show the feasibility of the proposed measures for hard queries. We demonstrate that the consideration of the proposed qualitative measures will lead to improved performance for hard queries on a range of state-of-the-art ad hoc table retrieval baselines. We further show that our proposed measures are synergistic and will lead to even higher performance improvements over the baselines when interpolated with each other. The improvements measure up to 22.94\% on the Semantic Table Retrieval (STR) method with an NDCG@20 of 0.5, which is superior to the performance of any state-of-the-art baseline for hard queries in the ad hoc table retrieval task.},

  abstract     = {Identifying DNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) sites is an essential step to study the biological functional mechanism. Feature representation is the primary step to identify 4mC sites due to its influencing the performance of the downstream 4mC site predictive model. Extracting numerical features having strong categorical information from DNA sequences is the key issue to build a 4mC predictive model having good performance. Therefore, a feature representation algorithm referred to as PSP-PJMI is proposed in this paper. It first proposes Pointwise Joint Mutual Information (PJMI), then the bidirectional k -nucleotide Position-Specific Propensities (PSP), so that the PSP-PJMI feature representation algorithm is developed. The parameter ξ ξ is used to indicate the interval from the current nucleotide to the forward or backward dinucleotide in the bidirectional trinucleotide PSP, so that the position information of nucleotides is extracted from a DNA sequence as far as possible. The features corresponding to various ξ ξ are concatenated to comprise the high dimensional feature vector having rich categorical information. The 4mC-BiNP model for identifying DNA 4mC sites is constructed using SVM and the extracted features. The experimental results of 10-fold cross validation test, cross-species validation test, and independent test on 6 species datasets show that the proposed PSP-PJMI algorithm can extract features having richer categorical information than the available feature representation algorithms can do. The 4mC-BiNP model is superior to the state-of-the-art predictive models for identifying DNA 4mC sites. Furthermore, the PSP-PJMI algorithm can be used to extract features for identifying other DNA methylation sites, and also be used for RNA sequences to predict RNA methylation sites.},

  abstract     = {The small sample problem is an open challenge in data-driven industrial fault diagnosis, which leads to low accuracy and weak generalization for modeling. Domain adaptation (DA) attempts to transfer samples of the source domain to the target domain for small sample enhancement. However, existing approaches cannot be directly applied to distant domains, due to insufficient exploration of domains with large discrepancies and negative transfer. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a transitive distant domain adaptation network (TDDA-Net), in which the sample features are decomposed into three orthogonalized dimensions to reliably express the sample information. Then, distant domain samples are explored and negative transfer is alleviated in different feature dimensions. In particular, distant domain samples are transitively explored to obtain abundant types of samples, wherein useful information from intermediate domains can be employed. Thus, the modeling generalization is improved. Additionally, the marginal and conditional distributions of the samples are adaptively matched to correct distribution drift, such that the negative transfer is alleviated. Thus, the modeling accuracy is improved. Benchmark simulated experiments and real-world application experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed network. All the results demonstrate that our TDDA-Net performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Interval-valued functional clustering is a novel approach for functional data analysis where each observation is represented by an interval. Existing interval-valued functional clustering methods typically rely on the interval-valued functional Hausdorff distance, which considers the upper and lower bounds of interval-valued functions but ignores the distribution of the original interval-valued data. This study proposes an interval-valued functional clustering method based on the Wasserstein distance to address this shortcoming. Taking into account the data distribution (i.e. the distribution’s centre and spread), this distance fully utilises the underlying data patterns. Furthermore, this study proposes a practical application of the interval-valued functional entropy method when multiple variables are used to comprehensively describe a phenomenon. Finally, an empirical example from the stock market demonstrates the proposed method’s effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract     = {As a building block in many graph-based applications, graph partitioning aims to divide a graph into smaller parts of roughly equal size, and meanwhile, minimize the number of cutting edges. Existing solutions for graph partitioning are mainly designed for static graphs and are not appropriate for many dynamic graphs in real-world scenarios, including social networks, knowledge graphs, and web graphs . Although there is an incremental method, called IncKGGGP, proposed to efficiently deal with dynamic graphs, it can only be deployed on top of a specific batch partitioning algorithm, called KGGGP, which inherently impairs the final partitioning quality. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel E dge- C ut P artitioning approach based on G ame theory for dynamic graphs ( ECPG ). Generally, ECPG is equipped with the following two nice properties. (1) High effectiveness. It can cope with dynamic graphs on top of any initial partitioning result, and then, achieve higher-quality results by choosing more effective static algorithms. (2) High efficiency. By exerting the advantage of game theory, ECPG can not only assign updated vertices into desirable partitions efficiently based on a low time complexity function but also can reduce redundant computations by reusing existing partitioning results. We also prove that there exists a Nash equilibrium in ECPG. From experimental results over several real-world graphs, it demonstrates that ECPG significantly outperforms the existing algorithms by up to one order of magnitude with comparable partitioning quality.},

  abstract     = {Among various multi-view clustering approaches , tensor-based multi-view subspace clustering methods aim to explore the high-order correlations across varying views and have achieved encouraging effects. Nevertheless, there are still some demerits in them: (1) View-specific information hinders the mining of global consensus. (2) The local structure inside individual view lacks consideration. (3) Clustering results are not utilized to reversely guide the low-rank tensor optimization. In order to tackle these drawbacks, we propose a unified model termed as Low-rank Tensor Approximation with Local Structure for Multi-view Intrinsic Subspace Clustering. Specifically, the proposed model learns multiple intrinsic subspace representations via the rank preserving decomposition, which is to mitigate the impact of view-specific information on enhancing the global consistency. Then, these intrinsic subspace representations are assembled into a 3-order target tensor with tensor nuclear norm constraint. To preserve the consistent locality, we adopt the manifold regularization to constrain each view when mapping into the intrinsic subspace. Furthermore, since the learned label indicator matrix implicitly characterizes the cluster structure, which is used to guide the optimization of the low-rank tensor representation. Finally, abundant experiments on six real-word datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is superior over other state-of-the-art clustering methods .},

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Learning Two-stream network (STILT) for action recognition. Our proposed two-stream (i.e., a spatial stream and a temporal stream) network has a spatial–temporal interaction learning module , which uses an alternating co-attention mechanism between two streams to learn the correlation between spatial features and temporal features. The spatial–temporal interaction learning module allows the two streams to guide each other and then generates optimized spatial attention features and temporal attention features. Thus, the proposed network can establish the interactive connection between two streams, which efficiently exploits the attended spatial and temporal features to improve recognition accuracy. Experiments on three widely used datasets (i.e., UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics) show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art models in action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised network embedding learns low-dimensional vector representations of nodes based on the network structure. However, typical graphs only contain positive edges. Hence, most network embedding models take sampled negative edges as input to avoid trivial solutions . However, conventional negative sampling methods follow fixed distributions to generate negative samples. Such a static sampling strategy could dramatically hurt the performance of node embeddings in downstream tasks. Researchers have proposed several adaptive sampling strategies to improve the quality of negative samples. However, existing methods do not sufficiently use the network structure to explore high-quality samples, resulting in complex and inefficient negative sampling. This paper develops a novel dynamic negative sampling scheme, which maintains a candidate sample population for each node. We update the populations dynamically and retain high-quality samples in each iteration. We develop a novel network embedding algorithm based on the proposed model, which selects high-quality negative samples adaptively from the population. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness based on several benchmark datasets.

Applications include aggregation strategies for these settings. Finally, three-way decision models are designed with both a qualitative and a quantitative character.

This is costly and time-consuming. To address this limitation, we formulate spammer group detection as a problem of finding distribution differences between normal user groups and spammer groups, and propose a review spammer group detection approach based on generative adversarial networks . First, we perform multiview sequence sampling on the dataset and utilize the Word2Vec model to obtain low-dimensional vector representations of users. Second, we construct the N -nearest neighbor user relationship graph according to the vector similarities in the embedding space. In the closed neighborhood of each node, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to find candidate groups. Finally, we construct a generative adversarial network model for spammer group detection, which uses the sum of generator reconstruction loss and discriminator loss to evaluate the spamicities of candidate groups. The experimental results on three real-world review datasets indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches in detection performance.},

Contrasting with existing works, a new resilient dynamic event-triggering mechanism (DETM) is employed in the design process of the controller in the event of hybrid cyber-attacks. It is concluded that the resilient condition of DETM is adaptively varied based on current sampling, latest available packets, and a discrete dynamic function. Using a piecewise Lyapunov functional (PLF), new stochastically exponential stability conditions are developed to ascertain the link among asynchronous DETM, DAs, non-periodic DoS attacks and mismatched membership functions (MMFs).

In contrast to previous concept drift detection methods, this application does not depend on the machine learning model in use for a specific target variable, but rather, it attempts to assess the concept drift as an independent characteristic of the evolution of a dataset. This major achievement enables data to be tested for the presence of drift, independently of the specific problem at hand. This is extremely useful when the same dataset is utilized for different classifications simultaneously, as it is often the case in a business environment. Moreover, unlike previous approaches, this method does not require the re-testing of each new model; a strategy which could prove expensive in computational terms. The fundamental intention of this work is to make use of graphical models to elicit the visible structure of data and represent it as a network. Specifically, we investigate how a graphical model evolves by looking at the creation of new links, and the disappearance of existing ones, in different time periods. We perform this task in four steps. We compute the adjacency matrix of a graph in each period, we apply a function that maps each possible state of the adjacency matrix over time into a transition matrix . We use the information in the transition matrix to produce a metric to estimate the presence of a drift in the data. Eventually, we evaluate this method with both three real-world datasets and a synthetic one.},

As this optimal solution is too complex to be used by humans, we proceed by introducing a heuristic based on the shortest paths between the source nodes and the target node. We prove that this heuristic is weakly better than a previously introduced heuristic based on random walks, and that it coincides with the optimal rule for star-like networks. With simulations, we assess the accuracy of the three type-judging rules and find that our heuristic is particularly accurate for networks with short distances and when there are multiple source nodes.

A key challenge in wearable-based hand gesture recognition is the fact that a hand gesture can be performed in several ways, with each consisting of its own configuration of motions and their spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing methods generally focus on the characteristics of a single point on hand, but ignores the diversity of motion information over hand skeleton, and as a result, they suffer from two key challenges to characterize hand gestures over multiple wearable sensors : motion representation and motion modeling. This leads us to define a spatio-temporal framework, named STGauntlet , that explicitly characterizes the hand motion context of spatio-temporal relations among multiple bones and detects hand gestures in real-time. In particular, our framework incorporates Lie group-based representation to capture the inherent structural varieties of hand motions with spatio-temporal dependencies among multiple bones. To evaluate our framework, we developed a hand-worn prototype device with multiple motion sensors. Our in-lab study on a dataset collected from nine subjects suggests our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with the achievement of 98.2\% and 95.6\% average accuracies for subject dependent and independent gesture recognition , respectively. Specifically, we also show in-wild applications that highlight the interaction capability of our framework.},

Differently from the state-of-the-art methods, LP-ROBIN can work with mutable sets of nodes, i.e., new nodes may appear over time without being known in advance. After the arrival of new data, LP-ROBIN does not need to retrain the model from scratch, but learns the embeddings of the new nodes and links, and updates the latent representations of old ones, to reflect changes in the network structure for link prediction purposes. The experimental results show that LP-ROBIN achieves better performances, in terms of AUC and F1-score, and competitive running times with respect to baselines, static node embedding approaches and state-of-the-art methods which use dynamic node embedding .},

  abstract     = {Personalized recommendations are becoming indispensable for assisting online users in discovering items of interest. However, existing recommendation algorithms rely heavily on the collection of personal information, which poses significant privacy concerns to users. In this paper, we propose a two-phase privacy-preserving framework called user sampling and semi-distributed training (USST) for personalized recommendations, which can protect user privacy while ensuring high recommendation accuracy. In the USST framework, rather than directly training the model with all user records, a shared model is first trained with a small set of records contributed by sampled users ( e.g. , paid users and volunteers). This shared model is then distributed to each user, who further trains a personalized model using personal information. Thus, the USST guarantees that all unsampled users never disclose their private information. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of USST, we designed two USST-based privacy-preserving recommendation algorithms , USST-SVD and USST-NCF based on SVD and NCF algorithms , respectively. We conducted evaluations using MovieLens and Netflix Prize datasets, and the results show that, using only 20\% of sampled users’ records, the recommendation accuracy of USST-based algorithms is very close to that of all users’ records. Thus, USST can significantly improve the level of privacy protection in recommender systems .},

  abstract     = {Partial occlusion is a key factor affecting the performance of person re-identification (re-ID). Although some solutions have been specially designed for occluded person re-ID, the ambiguity of pedestrian appearances and complex backgrounds still pose great challenges. Therefore, a key-point-aware occlusion suppression and semantic alignment (POS) method is proposed in this study to alleviate the existing challenges in occluded person re-ID. This method consists of three main modules: key point-aware semantic alignment (KPA-SA), self-similarity guided feature discriminability enhancement (SGFDE), and global feature extraction under occlusion suppression (GFE-UOS). In particular, the proposed KPA-SA semantically aligns the activated areas corresponding to specific pedestrian key points (e.g., head, shoulders, legs, feet) in multiple channels of different images. In addition, according to the paired left and right pedestrian key points, a cross-fusion mechanism can be applied to information compensation to alleviate information loss in occluded areas. The proposed SGFDE utilizes the self-similarity of non-occluded information of the same pedestrian captured from different views to enhance the discriminability of pedestrian identity features and suppress interference information unrelated to pedestrian identity. The proposed GFE-UOS fuses the heat maps of different key points to suppress the negative impact of occlusion on global feature extraction. The comparative experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed POS and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Individual differences among patients and the high cost of manual labeling are major challenges for electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis algorithms . To tackle this problem, we develop a novel deep active semi-supervised learning framework for myocardial infarction localization based on 12-lead ECG signals. First, a new deep learning model named multi-branch densely connected convolutional network (MB-DenseNet) is designed to automatically extract and fuse heartbeat features from 12-lead ECG signals. Moreover, to improve the classification results for new patients, we propose a novel active semi-supervised learning (ASSL) mechanism to update the model. Active learning (AL) is employed to improve the classification ability of the initial model firstly, and then a new semi-supervised learning method named self-training with spatial matching (STSM) is designed to update the model further. Based on the artificial knowledge from AL, STSM combines spatial matching algorithm and the trained model to label valuable unlabeled samples automatically. We conduct experiments based on intra-patient and patient-specific schemes using the PTB database. The MB-DenseNet yields an accuracy of 99.87\% under the intra-patient scheme. For the patient-specific scheme, the updated model achieves an accuracy of 96.09\%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method can effectively reduce manual labeling while achieving comparable performance.},

When the multitask estimation problem becomes complex and general, such as more complex parameters and more general networks, many multitask clustering algorithms may experience significant performance degradation . To overcome these situations, a highly robust multitask clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can be applied to more general and complex multitask estimation problems. The proposed algorithm is considered as a hybrid system. One subsystem is used to provide a reference estimation, which is further used to perform multitask clustering. Based on the clustering network, the other subsystem is performed to get a distributed adaptive estimation. In addition, each node is considered as a relaying node, so it can obtain the relaying information across the network for enhancing the performance. The convergence performance of the proposed algorithms is analyzed in the mean and mean-square senses. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithms as compared to other multitask clustering algorithms .},

In credit evaluations, the accepted sample is labeled and the rejected sample is unlabeled. This paper used S4VM to model both the accepted and rejected samples for reject inference. Because of the basic semi-supervised learning assumption that the accepted and rejected sample distributions are similar, this paper used a three-way decision method to filter the rejected samples to ensure the accepted and rejected sample distributions were closer. It was found that this method filtered out some rejected samples that were significantly different from the accepted sample distribution, which reduced the interference in the S4VM low-density separator. The proposed method was verified in four experiments on Chinese credit loan data, with the results verifying the effectiveness of the proposed reject inference S4VM method.},

Therefore, this paper proposes the ESM model (Selfish Mining under Ecological model). Our new model is fully compatible with fewer resource expenditure requirements. Meanwhile, we also describe a novel selfish mining attack that allows the malicious pool to gain additional revenue by using an ESM attack rather than SM1 when its power is less than 25\%. Furthermore, we present an EBSM (Bribery Selfish Mining under Ecological) attack that combines ESM together with the bribery attack. As a result, under EBSM, the malicious solo miner has a chance to gain additional revenue. Finally, we undertake quantitative analyses and simulations to assess the effectiveness of our attacks.},

  abstract     = {Until recently, the supply chain sector, which had been getting by with scattered spreadsheets, phone conversations, and even paper-based records until recently, was exposed for its antiquated methods during the epidemic. As a result, businesses have undergone a decade of digital change in only a few months, with the epidemic driving them to replace antiquated procedures with AI, machine learning, and data science technology. The supply chain sector has reached a point in its AI adoption where the technology is solid and powerful enough to improve decision-making significantly. For example, predictive analytics (e.g., time series forecasting) is already a proven benefit. Such technology is smart enough to recognise irregularities and learn how a stock market will move in real-time. With the advancement of digital innovation, researchers have focused on deep learning (DL) models to get a more accurate and unbiased estimation. Consequently, this paper presents a novel DL approach for time series prediction using a combination of poly-linear regression with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and data augmentation. It is consequently named Poly-linear Regression with Augmented Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (PLR-ALSTM-NN). The proposed DL model can be exploited to predict the future financial markets more accurately than existing state-of-the-art neural networks and machine learning tools. In order to make the model a more generic one, it is first validated on four financial market time-series datasets and then also implemented on a supply chain time-series dataset to predict sales data. LSTM , with its feedback connections, can process an entire series of data as well as single data points and statistical regression establishes the strength and character of the relationship between some dependent and independent variables. After doing experimental validations and based on the long-term and short-term predicted data, the suitability of the proposed PLR-ALSTM-NN is well-grounded against a few recent and advanced state-of-the-art machine learning, and DL approaches.},

However, tree-based indices have been outperformed by the learned index in skewed-distribution datasets of multidimensional point experimentally. The learned index performed faster because of its data distribution awareness and machine learning model-based prediction. Directly applying learned index to trajectories can lead to inefficient query performance due to repeating range queries according to the query trajectory length . Thus, we develop X-FIST, an extended Flood index to learn the Minimum Bounding Region of the trajectories and their sub-trajectories. In similarity search, X-FIST prunes dissimilar trajectories effectively independent to the query trajectory length. If the trajectory similarity distance function changes, X-FIST does not need to train new models of its Flood index. The experimental results on three real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our approach shortened query time in every distance function and produced better storage size reduction than the tree-based index and direct approach of learned index.},

Then, the estimation strategy is designed for estimating the amount of Pareto optimal sets (PSs), where the mean-shift algorithm is adopted to classify subpopulation into some clusters. In essence, the number of clusters is considered to be the estimated number of PSs. Finally, an environmental selection method, which combines the estimation strategy and the greedy selection, is adopted to dynamically adjust the subpopulation scale for maintaining the population diversity. The experimental results illustrate that the devised algorithm performs pass beyond the selected up-to-date competing algorithms.},

In the proposed approach, reliability and risk are used to better represent and model the generally existent uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed approach has a higher level of compatibility, which is independent of a specific surrogate model. These two aspects are the major theoretical contributions of the proposed approach. A practical case study of reducing building tilt rate (BTR) in tunnel engineering shows that the BTR can be reduced from the original [0.8516, 2.7573] to [0.4904, 1.0664] by 41.65\%-73.17\% with an average reduction of 56.64\%. When uncertainty was not considered, the average reduction of the BTR was 50.36\%, while overestimation and underestimation were observed in most sets of data. Three surrogate models were cross-checked to validate the compatibility of the proposed approach, namely the Gaussian process regression (GPR), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and belief rule base (BRB). The results of cross-checking show that: (1) GPR and BPNN are mutually recognizable, that is, the mutual MAPE is less than 1\%, (2) GPR has recommended the most robust parameter settings, and (3) BRB has underestimated the BTRs. Owing to the ability to represent and model uncertainty and the high compatibility of the surrogate models, the proposed approach can be extended to more engineering problems in various fields.},

Then, a robust adaptive terminal sliding mode controller is designed for the limb-level subsystem to resist the influence of model uncertainties and external disturbances on tracking performance. The designed gait mode generator and stride solver modules serve as two bridges connecting the body- and limb-level subsystems, thus coalescing the entire control system into a closed loop, which greatly improves the tracking accuracy of the whole system. Finally, two cases, the directed curved-trajectory tracking with tripod gait and the undirected polyline-trajectory tracking with quadruped gait, are given to illustrate the omnidirectional mobility of the multi-legged robot, and to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed control strategy.},

However, due to the scarce cases and expensive sampling costs in the biomedical area, the lack of samples has become the main obstacle to the performance improvement of traditional variable selection algorithms in the biomedical data. In this paper, we solve this problem by the feat of domain knowledge, which seems to be a unique method in the biomedicine area due to the abundant and reliable domain knowledge in it. Nevertheless, the empirical study demonstrated that the brute-force implantation of domain knowledge may be counterproductive, especially when unfaithful knowledge exists. To elegantly incorporate domain knowledge into the variable selection framework, this paper starts from the joint likelihood function of the discriminative model and derives the extended form of prior knowledge term based on the existing variable selection framework. Based on this, a novel method is presented. We prove and substantiate with both synthetic and real-world biomedical data that, the proposal could effectively utilize the information from domain knowledge to assist variable selection and simultaneously reject incorrect knowledge.},

The container loading problem (CLP) is a combinatorial optimization problem with complex constraints. Its solution process is complicated, and the amount of computation is large. Although some studies used exact algorithms, they could not obtain the optimal solution in a reasonable time. Therefore, heuristic algorithms and intelligent optimization algorithms have become the preferred choice for solving the three-dimensional container loading problem (3D-CLP). Differential evolution algorithm (DE) is an efficient intelligent optimization algorithm, which has remarkable effect in dealing with optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that combines a differential evolution algorithm with a ternary search tree model (TSTDE) to solve the 3D-CLP. TSTDE utilizes the ternary tree model to generate a set of suboptimal solutions as the initial population of DE. The improved differential evolution algorithm is used to search the feasible solution of the problem. In this paper, we used the Bischoff and Ratcliff instances to test the TSTDE algorithm, and the results solving the 3D-CLP were compared with those of other advanced algorithms. The experimental results verified the feasibility and superiority of TSTDE in handling the 3D-CLP.},

  abstract     = {Event detection is an extremely important step for extracting events, and its goal is to detect the occurrences of events and categorize them. Prior works use either a fine-grained approach or a coarse-grained approach to detect events. However, both approaches encounter two problems: (1) Enriched feature information obtained from external tools probably introduces unnecessary errors. (2) Ignoring the phenomenon of event co-occurrence in a sentence degrades the performance of event detection. To address these issues, a novel framework called D ependency M ulti- W eight- V iew G raph (DMWVG) is proposed to detect events without trigger tagging and external feature engineering. Specifically, DMWVG leverages the tree transformer to automatically generate syntactic relations with different weights to mitigate the errors generated by external syntactic parsing tools. In addition, an event correlation matrix is constructed with the help of the event label co-occurrence to deliver essential information on triggers and to promote the performance of event detection. Finally, the experimental results indicate that our approach is competitive with existing SOTA methods on four datasets (75.77\% F1-score on ACE 2005, 82.11\% F1-score on MLEE, 75.61\% F1-score on BioNLP 09, and 72.20\% F1-score on BioNLP 11).},

  abstract     = {Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) is popular in processing non-linear data over the past years. The main challenge is that the kernel matrix with the size n × n n×n leads to high memory and computational consumption, where n denotes the number of samples. Although the widely used static anchor sampling can mitigate such a challenging considerably, how to dynamically select anchor points with a learning manner from kernel matrix is a difficult problem. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel method dubbed as cluster center consistency guided sampling learning (3CSL) for multiple kernel clustering (3CSL-MKC). Specifically, by taking the cluster center consistency between the original partial kernel data and anchor points into consideration, 3CSL-MKC learns the shared anchor sampling matrix gradually. With the help of high-quality anchors, the essential clustering information of each kernel partition can be transformed largely into a concentrated low-dimensional representation matrix. Meanwhile, based on dictionary learning, 3CSL-MKC fuses these candidate representation matrixes to produce the resulting consensus representation, such that the clustering assignments can be directly obtained relying on simple k -means. A large number of experiments are conducted on different multiple kernel datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing provides an efficient way to obtain multiple noisy labels from different crowd workers for each unlabeled instance. Label integration methods are designed to infer the unknown true label of each instance from its multiple noisy label set. We argue that when the label quality is higher than random classification, the more the number of labels, the better the performance of label integration methods. However, in real-world crowdsourcing scenarios, each instance cannot obtain enough labels for saving costs. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel label integration method called label augmented and weighted majority voting (LAWMV). At first, LAWMV uses the K -nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find each instance’s K -nearest neighbors (including itself) and merges their multiple noisy label sets to obtain its augmented multiple noisy label set. Then, the labels from different neighbors are weighted by the distances and the label similarities between each instance and its neighbors. Finally, the integrated label of each instance is inferred by weighted majority voting (MV). The experimental results on 34 simulated and two real-world crowdsourced datasets show that LAWMV significantly outperforms all the other state-of-the-art label integration methods.},

From mathematical viewpoint, optimal nonlinear control depends on the solution of Hamilton–Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, but finding the equation’s analytic solution is almost impossible because of the strong nonlinearity. For addressing the problem in this work, the RL approximation strategy is employed by on-line iterating both critic and actor FLSs, where critic FLS aims for evaluating control performance and making feedback to actor, and actor FLS aims for executing the modified control behavior. Different with the previous RL-based optimization approach, the proposed approach derives RL training laws from negative gradient of a simple positive function rather than the square of HJB equation’s approximation . As a result, the control algorithm can be significantly simplified. Furthermore, it can avoid two general conditions, persistence excitation and known dynamic, required in most RL optimal control methods. Finally, the proposed optimized control is demonstrated from both aspects of theory proof and computation simulation.},

To address this issue, a domain adaptation learning strategy based dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this paper. The mapping matrix learned by subspace distribution alignment (SDA) is utilized to transform the search space between last and current environments for promoting efficient knowledge transfer. Especially, the process of constructing mapping is derived from the simpler calculation, saving computational cost. Based on this model, transferred individuals are generated from a part of historical optima at last time. Additionally, an increment information is defined as the difference between center points of POSs in past two environments, and employed to produce a noise obeying uniform distribution. After adding it on a temporary population consisting of transferred individuals and the rest historical optima, an initial population with good diversity under new environment is formed. Experimental results on 12 benchmark functions indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other six state-of-the-art comparative ones, achieving the promising performance in solving DMOPs.},

Generally, the most typical features of violence are its drastic, disordered, and chaotic motion in contrast to non-violence. To capture these features for violence analysis in a video clip, we propose a novel Angle-level Co-occurrence Matrix (ALCM). Given a video volume, we treat it as a tensor of rank 3, which consists of a bound of fibers in one plane. ALCM records the co-occurrence of two specific quantized angle levels between fibers with their neighbors, which is the distribution of the co-occurrence of fiber pairs with specific similarities in one plane of the tensor of rank 3. To completely characterize the violence in the volume, we compute three ALCMs for three orthogonal planes to form a TOP-ALCM, respectively. We also propose both conventional and deep-learning-based VVD frameworks, in which the former one leverages the features such as entropy, homogeneity, and energy computed from TOP-ALCM for classification, while the latter one directly uses CNN to classify the TOP-ALCMs. Experimental results analysis demonstrates that the proposed TOP-ALCM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for VVD.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved extraordinary success on many image classification tasks in recent years. The use of dilated convolution in a CNN can increase the network’s receptive field and improve its performance, and dilated convolution can also be used to compress a CNN to realize a lightweight model. In previous studies, multiscale dilated convolution has been adopted with a focus on improving the internal network structure of a specific CNN model. Because they enable the direct use of pretrained models, transfer learning CNNs (TL-CNNs) have been widely applied for image recognition based on small datasets. This paper proposes a novel multiscale dilated-convolution-based ensemble learning (MDCEL) method for effectively improving the performance of a pretrained CNN model. The authors&#39; primary assumption is that semantic representations of different images can be obtained based on multiscale dilated convolution. Therefore, constructing an ensemble of diverse TL-CNN classifiers makes it possible to achieve higher performance than that offered by the traditional TL-CNN methods. The MDCEL method is highly versatile and can be applied to various conventional pretrained CNN models and lightweight CNN models. Moreover, this method does not require the modification of the internal structures of the pretrained CNN models and has high training efficiency. Experimental results on three public image classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline traditional TL-CNN method. Compared with the baseline approach, the MDCEL approach improves the accuracy and F1 values by nearly 1–4\%. In addition, an experiment on a real case dataset obtained from a manufacturing enterprise further proves the practicability of the proposed method.},

CGE builds a unified graph with historical check-ins to reflect users’ geographical preferences and visiting intentions. It allows us to sample synthetic but realistic trajectories for augmenting data and enhancing contextual check-in embedding. We also successfully apply it to next check-in prediction task.

  abstract     = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is extremely vital for the diagnosis and prognosis of civil structures. As an important part of the SHM system, vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) methods have become a research hotspot with the development of sensor technologies. These methods are utilized to assess structural conditions or localize and classify damages. Recently end-to-end deep learning architectures have been widely used in VBDD tasks and achieved state-of-the-art results. However, there are seldom investigations on the attention mechanism in VBDD, which has been demonstrated as an effective module to extract features in other domains. In this paper, we propose a channel-spatial-temporal attention-based network to refine and enrich the discriminative sample-specific features in three dimensions , namely, channel, space, and time simultaneously. Specifically, the local and global block we designed is to extract the local and global spatial features adaptively, and the grouped self-attention is presented to extract the long- and short-term temporal features. Moreover, the squeeze-and-excitation block is selected to emphasize vital channels.

  abstract     = {Due to the differences of observation equipment and technical means, the size of the color digital image is not the same. In addition, most of digital watermarking methods used to protect the copyright of color digital images have weak robustness against geometric attacks . Therefore, this paper proposes a robust adaptive blind watermarking method to protect the copyright of color digital images. In the proposed method, the frequency domain characteristics of Slant transform are used to directly calculate the maximum energy coefficient of the pixel block, the maximum element of the coefficient matrix obtained after Slant transform in the spatial domain, and the color digital watermark is embedded by quantifying the maximum energy coefficient. At the same time, the adaptive strategies, which including the adaptive image size, the adaptive quantization step , the adaptive watermark encoding and the adaptive watermark embedding position, are proposed in this paper. Moreover, the proposed method can use geometric features of the image to correct many attacked images. Compared with the state-of-the-art watermarking methods, the proposed method can achieve acceptable imperceptibility and has larger watermark capacity, stronger robustness, higher security and better real-time performance.},

In this study, the local patchwise minimal values prior (MinVP) and local patchwise maximal values prior (MaxVP) are proposed for single RSI dehazing. As alternatives to the classical dark channel prior (DCP) and bright channel prior (BCP), the feasibility and reliability of MinVP and MaxVP are investigated. The transmission maps from MinVP and MaxVP are approximately equivalent to those from DCP and BCP but more efficient. To address the common problems of halo, oversaturation, and overexposure phenomena in dehazing processes, a dehazing method based on MinVP (named MinVPM) is proposed. The refined atmospheric light map and compensated transmission map are derived and formulated according to the atmospheric scattering model (ASM). Moreover, to improve the contrast in the dehazed images by MinVPM, a simple enhancement method based on MaxVP (named MaxVPM) is proposed, the formulae of which are analogously derived to those of MinVPM. The upgraded dehazing version of MinVPM, named EVPM, is the combination of MinVPM and MaxVPM. Extensive experiments and corresponding evaluations demonstrate that the proposed MinVPM and EVPM can achieve satisfactory results and high computational efficiency and outperform state-of-the-art dehazing methods for remote sensing image dehazing.},

  abstract     = {Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm mimics the foraging behaviour of bee colonies to solve optimization problems in which different types of bees adopt the same search equation. In this sense, bees that play different roles do not divide their labor. Moreover, the single search equation in ABC is strongly explorative but weakly exploitative, which limits its performance. To overcome that issue, this study proposes an improved algorithm (hereafter BDLDABC) that introduces the labor division of bee colonies based on behavioral development into ABC . In BDLDABC, employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees are regarded as three phases of the behavioral development of bees, and the labor division for the search process is obtained by individual specialization and role plasticity. According to individual specialization, three search equations guided by the global best solution, local best solution, and a random solution are designed for the three types of bees. Based on role plasticity, four patterns of behavioral development (i.e., normal development, accelerated development, delayed development , and reversed development) are designed for bees. Following the mechanics of dividing labor, bees adaptively adjust their search equations in response to changes in the search environment. Two groups of widely used benchmark functions (including fifty-two test functions) and the real-world circle packing problem are employed to verify the performance of BDLDABC, and the experimental results show that, in most cases, BDLDABC is superior, or at least comparable, to its competitors (including eight ABC variants, three DE variants, and three PSO variants).},

At present, attention-based methods can relieve recurrent neural networks’ limitations in MTS forecasting that are hard to focus on key information and capture long-term dependencies, but they fail to learn the time-varying pattern based on the reliable interaction. To reinforce the memory ability of key features across time, we propose a Graph Correlated Attention Recurrent Neural Network(GCAR). GCAR first nests Feature-level attention in the graph attention module to complement external feature representations on the extraction of multi-head temporal correlations. Then Multi-level attention is designed to add target factors’ impact on the selection of external correlation and achieve a fine-grained distinction of external features’ contribution. To better capture different series’ continuous dynamic changes, two parallel LSTMs are respectively applied to learn historical target series and external feature representations’ temporal dependencies. Finally, a fusion gate is employed to balance their information conflicts. The performance of GCAR model is tested on 4 datasets, and results show GCAR model performs the most stable and greatest predictive accuracy as the increasing of predicted horizons compared with state-of-the-art models even if the multivariate time series present strong volatility and randomness.},

Since the exclusion of low-quality image sequences is performed manually and image processing methods are evaluated using techniques developed for natural images, automatic and reliable MR image quality assessment (IQA) approaches are desirable. Therefore, in this work, a new no-reference (NR) MR-IQA technique is proposed. The method uses introduced quality-aware features addressing characteristics of MR images. Specifically, in the method, an MR image is scaled, filtered with two gradient operators, and subjected to identification of the local intensity extrema. Then, the entropy and κ κ curvature are calculated to characterize extrema sequences and used as perceptual features to train a quality model with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique. In this paper, an extensive comparative evaluation of the method against recent NR approaches, including deep learning-based models, is conducted on two representative MR-IQA benchmarks. The results reveal the superiority of the introduced approach over competing methods as it obtained better overall Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients by 5\% and 3\%, respectively.},

The FC-SLPSO algorithm establishes a fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier in each iteration. The fitness evaluation is performed only when the membership degree of the offspring particles belonging to potential particles is greater than that of the parent particles, which effectively reduces the number of fitness function evaluations and accelerates the PSO algorithm .

The effectiveness of the proposed approach was verified through experiments on several benchmark datasets.

Although existing cryptographic methods perform well on traditional blockchain architectures, they do not provide complete privacy in a hierarchical blockchain architecture for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The blockchain technology is centered at the gateway layer in the hierarchical blockchain architecture, which can easily reveal the transaction sender using network traffic information, thereby violating the sender’s anonymity. Furthermore, the gateway can perform eclipse attacks against transaction senders on a case-by-case basis. To this end, this paper proposes a novel security and privacy blockchain protocol that is better suited to the hierarchical blockchain architecture and thus more appropriate for the IoT environment. Specifically, it leverages the relationship among IoT devices at the perception layer of the hierarchical blockchain architecture for IoT, and constructs an overlay social IoT network by exploiting devices’ multi-agent capabilities. Furthermore, circuit establishment based on multilayered encryption is applied to conceal the transaction propagation path through the overlay social IoT. Theoretical analysis shows that our novel protocol is flexible, evades a malicious gateway, and is secure under the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, cloud computing plays a crucial role in many real applications. Thus, how to solve workflow scheduling problems, i.e., allocating and scheduling different resources, under the cloud computing environment becomes more important. Although some evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can solve workflow scheduling problems with a small scale, they show some disadvantages on larger scale workflow applications. In this paper, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is applied to optimize workflow scheduling problems. To enhance the search efficiency, this study proposes an initialization scheduling sequence scheme, in which each task’s data size is considered when initializing its virtual machine (VM) instance. Relying on the initial scheduling sequence, a proper trade-off between the makespan and the energy consumption, which are two optimization objectives in this study, can be achieved. In the early evolution stage, traditional crossover and mutate operators are performed to keep the population’s exploration. On the contrary, the longest common subsequence (LCS) of multiple elite individuals, which can be regarded as a favorable gene block, is saved during the later evolution stage. Based on the LCS, the probability of some favorable gene blocks being destroyed will be reduced when performing the crossover operator and the mutate operator. Hence, the integration of the LCS in GA can satisfy different requirements in different evolution stages, and then to attain a balance between the exploration and the exploitation. Extensive experimental results verify that the proposed GA combined with LCS, named as GALCS in this paper, can find a better Pareto front than the ordinary GA as well as other state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, effectivenesses of the new proposed strategies are also verified by a set of experiments.},

Knowledge in the teacher representations of source images is distilled and transferred to our student main autoencoder with the help of the perceptual saliency scheme. The scheme also derives a pixel level scheme of pixel compensation, which combines with source image to enhance the pixel intensity of the fused image. Moreover, a multi-autoencoder architecture is developed by assembling two auxiliary decoders behind the main autoencoder. The architecture is trained with self-supervision to consolidate fusion training against the limitation of teacher network. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed network achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multi-source image fusion compared with the existing fusion methods.},

However, the process of establishing a category of monotonic uncertainty measure with strong distinguishing ability for LRS remains ambiguous. To construct this model, both the monotonicity of local lower approximation set and the local structure of granularity should be considered. First, the monotonicity of local rough approximation measure(LRAM) is established by the local lower and upper approximation sets. Subsequently, the local knowledge distance(LKD) is proposed to measure the uncertainty derived from the disparities between local upper and lower approximation sets. The more rational uncertainty measure associated LRAM with LKD is designed as a feature selection algorithm.

  abstract     = {A well exploitation of computational resource is essential when solving high-dimensional multiobjective problems (MOPs). Since many recent strategies presented for decision space and objective space are in consideration of searching efficiency, the collaboration between the two spaces is a promising approach for high-dimensional optimization. In this article, resource allocation strategies for both decision and objective spaces are readjusted and cooperated for complex MOPs. A metric-based variable partition strategy is introduced and a simple reference adaptation strategy is adopted to specify the searching orientations in the decision space and the objective space respectively. Subsequently, based on the above-mentioned basic techniques, three different evolutionary strategies are further designed to strengthen the directional convergence and preserve the diversity of target regions in a collaborative fashion. Several benchmark instances and a practical optimization problem are adopted in the experimental study. The effectiveness and rationality of the proposed resource allocation approach have been demonstrated by the experimental results.},

Data anonymization is widely used to prevent shared data from being re-identified private or sensitive information from anonymized data with other available data. It is very important to understand the risks of re-identification of results and process of commonly used anonymization techniques before properly mitigating. This work proposes a data anonymisation evaluation framework that can evaluate commonly used data anonymization algorithms in terms of privacy preserving level, data utility, and performance. Specifically, data utility, privacy metrics, and information loss were used to evaluate data anonymization schemes that can further optimise the data anonymization process to keep risks of re-identification low. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solution can effectively evaluate the performance and de-identification features that can help to prevent inappropriate usage of anonymized data.},

Nevertheless, current research mainly focuses on the interaction between each information pair. In this study, we investigate the interaction of multiple types of information on multiplex networks by considering both the competition and the cooperation among them. To study the dynamic characteristics theoretically, a microscopic Markov chain approach is used to reveal the co-evolution of multiple information. Through extensive simulations, the outbreak threshold is analyzed theoretically. The results reveal that the pairwise interaction between each information pair has an obvious impact on its final outbreak scale and the diffusion threshold. Interestingly, even information that has no direct impact on the target information can affect the diffusion of the target information through indirect effects. In addition, the inhibitory effect of the competitive information and the promotion effect of the cooperative information on the target information will reach equilibrium under specific parameter space conditions. We also conduct numerical simulations on three real multiplex social networks, including two large-scale networks. Current results are beneficial for us to further understand the coupled diffusion of multiple information on multiplex social networks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we start by pointing out the problem of a negative sampling (NS) strategy, denoted as nearest-NS (NNS), used in metric learning (ML)-based recommendation methods. NNS samples the items nearer to a user with higher probability among her unrated items. This could move her preferred items far away from her, thereby making the preferred items excluded from top- K recommendation. To address the problem, we first define a concept of a cage for a user , a region that contains the items highly likely preferred by her. Based on the concept, we propose a novel NS strategy, named as cage-based NS (CNS), that makes her preferred items rarely sampled as negative items , thereby improving the accuracy of top- K recommendation. Furthermore, we propose CNS+, an improved version of CNS, that reduces the computation overhead of CNS . CNS+ strategy provides performance than CNS much higher, however, not requiring to sacrifice the accuracy. Through extensive experiments using four real-life datasets, we validate the effectiveness ( i.e. , accuracy) and efficiency ( i.e. , performance) of the proposed approach. We first demonstrate that our CNS strategy addresses successfully the problem of NNS strategy. In addition, we show that applying our CNS strategy to three existing ML-based recommendation methods ( i.e. , CML , LRML, and SML) improves their accuracy consistently and significantly in all datasets and with all metrics. Also, we confirm that CNS+ strategy significantly reduces the execution times with (almost) no loss of accuracy of CNS strategy. Finally, we show that our CNS and CNS+ strategies have a linear scalability with the increasing number of ratings.},

Given these features of LCIP, this paper presents the concept of unpredictable multistage dynamic optimization (UMDO) and establishes an LCIP model that comprehensively considers production constraints, ingredient list duration, and concentrates inventories. A multistage stochastic object coding (MSOC) that establishes a mapping relationship between the coding sequence and the feasible solution space at each scheduling stage is further proposed. A multi-agent differential evolution (DE) algorithm based on the application of sequential simulation is proposed to optimize the high-dimensional population of the MSOC, enabling a globally optimal scheme in which the feasibility of the ingredient plan at each stage is ensured. Finally, the actual inventory concentration data collected from a copper industry in China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed planning methodology.},

Current existing things recommendation methods mostly adopt machine learning or deep learning (e.g., matrix factorization or neural network) as their basic models, which continuously results in that the data sparsity has a great impact on their performance. Although they integrate different contexts to alleviate the problem, the real effect is rather limited. To the end, in the paper, we study how to achieve better recommendation results in the case of the data sparsity . Along this line, the very critical challenge is how to learn user preferences without relying too much on big data. As a solution, we first build an interaction event experience graph (IEEG) from the user interaction data. Secondly, we develop a Non-Axiomatic Logic-based learning framework for novel things correlations, named NALC, running over IEEG, to mine the user-thing relationship. We measure the user-user relationship and the thing-thing relationship from real-time contexts. Furthermore, we fuse the user-user, the thing-thing and the user-thing relationships based on a product rule, to model the recommender. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed model on the real-world dataset and demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.},

In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method for regression problem based on the sparse Gaussian process (GP). GP models are very popular in regression modeling , as they have the capability to produce uncertainty estimation , however, they cannot be used directly for transfer learning. We propose an adaptive neural kernel network (ANKN) to ensure that the GP model can effectively transfer knowledge. Additionally, although many sparse GP methods are proposed to solve the time consumption problem of the GP models in large datasets, they cannot maintain the transfer performance. We propose a transfer inducing point (TIP) algorithm for data selection in large datasets to maintain the transfer performance.

  abstract     = {Conventionally, cold-start limitations are managed by leveraging side information such as social-trust relationships. However, the relationships between users in social networks are complex, uncertain, and sparse. Therefore, it is necessary to extract beneficial social connections to make the recommendation models cold-start resistant. Towards this end, we propose a novel recommendation model called Variational Cold-start Resistant Recommendation (CORE-VAE). More concretely, we employ a social-aware similarity function and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to generate robust social-aware user representations that account for the complexities, uncertainties, and sparse nature of the social-trust network. Subsequently, these powerful social-aware representations aid us in producing cold-start resistant rating vectors for all users. To explore the rich user rating information, we propose an expressive variational autoencoder (VAE) model. Unlike earlier VAE-based CF models, CORE-VAE utilizes a novel prior distribution and a well-designed skip-generative network to alleviate the posterior collapse issue considerably. Besides, CORE-VAE can also capture the latent space’s uncertainty and ensure that observations and their accompanying latent variables have high mutual information. Overall, these novel techniques dramatically help produce better latent representations for generating more accurate recommendations. We show that CORE-VAE outperforms numerous competitive baseline models on real-world datasets through comprehensive empirical evaluation and analysis.},

Only partial observations can be monitored at discrete time epochs, which poses great challenges for fault detection and prediction. To facilitate the development of advanced approaches, this paper proposes a bi-level Bayesian control scheme for detecting faults of complex devices under partial observations. The deterioration of an operational system is modeled as a hidden three-state multivariate Markov process, in which the parameter estimates are obtained by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Based on the multivariate Markov process, a bi-level Bayesian control scheme is presented to monitor the Bayesian posterior probability of the system in a warning state and uses two levels of sampling frequency to dynamically detect impending failures. The decision variables of the bi-level fault detection scheme are optimized and solved in a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework. The particularity of this work is that two phases of system deterioration are considered into detection scheme design to avoid unnecessary false alarms. Using partially observed multivariate data from discrete monitoring, the proposed approach is validated to be capable of detecting the early fault occurrences. By comparing with other advanced methods, the superiority of the proposed model is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The application of multisource information fusion in real-world scenarios is an emerging practice because it effectively uses consistent and complementary data to optimize decision-making. Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is prevalent because it competently handles uncertainty problems by assigning basic probability assignments (BPAs) to multielement subsets. However, a counterintuitive result may be obtained when the evidence is highly conflicting. To overcome this flaw, this paper defines a new divergence measurement to quantify the differences between BPAs; we name this new metric the belief Rényi divergence. The belief Rényi divergence takes the number of possible hypotheses into consideration, which makes it a more rational and effective difference measurement in the realm of evidence theory . Additionally, some important properties of the belief Rényi divergence are extensively explored and proven, in which the belief Rényi divergence also connects to Kullback-Leibler divergence, Hellinger distance and χ 2 χ2 divergence. Moreover, a novel multisource information fusion method is devised based on the proposed belief Rényi divergence and belief entropy. Our proposed belief Rényi divergence can efficiently model the differences between evidence, and the belief entropy is used to calculate the information volume of evidence. Thus, the proposed method can sufficiently exploit the relationships among evidence and the information volume of the evidence itself. Two case studies are illustrated to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method. Also, an experiment on an iris dataset classification is presented to verify the performance of the proposed method. In addition, an EEG data analysis application demonstrates that the proposed method can be effectively used in real-world applications.},

In this paper, we propose an efficient and verifiable group public key encryption with equality test construction without bilinear pairings (GPKEET/BP). Our proposal is developed from a basic observation that two points determine a straight line, and is proven to be indistinguishable against the chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA) in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption. Theoretical analysis shows that our construction only involves several modular exponentiations in the encryption, decryption and test algorithms. The theoretical results are well supported by experimental simulations, which show that the test algorithm of GPKEET/BP performs about 92\%\% faster than that of Ling et al.’s scheme. So our GPKEET/BP scheme turns out to be better suited for group ciphertext equality test situations.},

To positively promote the efficiency of knowledge transfer, a multiobjective multifactorial evolutionary algorithm based on transfer component analysis (TCA) and differential evolution (DE) called TCADE is proposed. The TCA method is used to construct a dimensionality reduction subspace, in which the correlation between two tasks is used to find a set of solutions. Co-evolution of multiple populations is promoted after explicit transfer of the solutions. Furthermore, a DE operator is used to generate more diverse individuals. TCADE effectively utilizes the potential relationships between tasks to transfer solutions across them and promotes knowledge transfer between them.

  abstract     = {Distance education quality evaluation is extremely important in improving the quality of education under COVID-19. As traditional teaching-quality evaluation methods are no longer applicable, it is crucial to construct effective evaluation methods. In the evaluation of distance education quality, decision-makers have different linguistic expression preferences, and the evaluation information may be biased due to an improper grasp of the problem. In addition, the correlation between the criteria of distance education quality evaluation is common, and the results of existing evaluation methods are quite different. In this paper, to compensate for these deficiencies, we utilize the multi-granularity probabilistic linguistic term set (MGPLTS), which can reflect the linguistic expression preference of decision-makers and the importance of linguistic terms, and propose a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method. First, the dispersion and concentration degrees are proposed as the theoretical basis for judging the hesitancy of decision-makers’ evaluation information, and the decision-maker weight adjustment model is constructed. To reflect the importance and correlation of criteria, the SWARA method and the CRITIC method are constructed as criteria weight methods. To obtain reliable decision results, decision-makers’ psychological expectations are taken into account, the MULTIMOORA method is improved upon, and a new integration theory is proposed to improve its robustness. Finally, through an example case of distance education quality evaluation and comparison with other methods, the effectiveness, practicability and superiority of this method are verified.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose general three-way decision models on incomplete information tables. First, for an incomplete information table, we give an axiomatic definition of similarity degree functions on a single attribute. By use of extended aggregation functions, similarity degree functions on an attribute set are also proposed. Then we define a new kind of similarity class of objects and study its properties. On the basis of this similarity class, general three-way decision models based on two evaluation functions and one evaluation function on incomplete information tables are established, respectively. In addition, we study the properties of these general three-way decision models. Finally, we compare the general model based on one evaluation function and a pair of thresholds with four existing models. The results show that the four existing models can be regarded as special cases of this general model, which illustrates the rationality of the new proposed models.},

Unlike traditional adaptive dynamic programming methods , the proposed control mechanism minimizes a loss function without solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which simplifies the computational workload. In addition, a compensation strategy for actuator and sensor faults is considered and a novel fault-tolerant adaptive inverse optimal protocol incorporating the Lyapunov design is constructed. It is demonstrated that the system is input-to-state stabilizable (ISS) under the designed inverse optimal controller and the tracking errors of the MASs can converge to a predefined range.

However, health sectors of Ghana are facing a challenge in providing medical services with expected quality for an ever-increasing number of patients in response to competitive pressures. In such circumstances, the proper evaluation of hospital health-care delivery quality becomes critical. Thus, to achieve this goal, this paper proposes an integrated medical triangular fuzzy MULTIMOORA approach (IMTFMA). We firstly construct the appropriate evaluation criteria system based on the analysis of Ghana’s medical services. Then, to properly evaluate the weight of the criteria in a comprehensive manner, we determine the weight of criteria from subjective and objective perspectives. Meantime, we handle the fuzzy evaluation of experts for the criterion importance with the enhanced alpha-level sets method. According to the triangular fuzzy rating for hospitals provided by respondents, we further develop a novel evaluation method based on MULTIMOORA with the axiomatic design for accurately evaluating health-care delivery quality. The research is conducted on 8 selected hospitals, including 4 public and 4 private hospitals in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana, with 24 criteria. 15 experts with rich experience in related fields and 480 respondents assessed the above 8 selected hospitals by questionnaires. According to the outcome of the empirical analysis, even though public hospitals benefit subsidy from the government, they perform abysmally low, whereas private hospitals which are self-sponsored rather perform extremely better than expectation.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate models are widely used to model the high computational cost problems such as industrial simulation or engineering optimization when the size of sampled data for modeling is greatly limited. They can significantly improve the efficiency of complex calculations by modeling original expensive problems with simpler computation-saving functions. However, a single surrogate model cannot always perform well for various problems. On this occasion, hybrid surrogate models are created to improve the final performances on different problems by combining advantages of multiple single models. Nevertheless, existing hybrid methods work by estimating weights for all alternative single models, which limits the efficiency when more single models are adopted. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid surrogate model quite different from former methods, named the Deep Residual Surrogate model (DRS). DRS does not merge all alternative single surrogate models directly by weights, but by assembling selected ones in a multiple layers structure. We propose first derivate validation (FDV) to recurrently select the single surrogate model adopted in each layer from all candidates. Experimental results on multiple benchmark problems demonstrate that DRS has better performances than existing single and hybrid surrogate models in both prediction accuracy and stability with higher efficiency.},

Presently, the application of natural language processing (NLP) for knowledge-based search is gradually emerging. Compared with the traditional search based only on keywords of documents—symmetric searchable encryption (SSE), the knowledge-based search system transforms the latent knowledge contained in documents into a semantic network as a knowledge base, which greatly improves the accuracy and relevance of search results. In order to develop a knowledge-based search, the contents of documents are analyzed and extracted using KG techniques (e.g. multi-relational graph (MG) and property graph (PG)), and then all encrypted nodes and edges in a KG constitute the entire index table and database. This paper proposes the first STE for KGs with CQA2-security to search on protected knowledge, where KGs include MGs and PGs. In general, the latter is more complex than the former, but it can represent more abundant knowledge. Experimental results show that the index construction time of our schemes is about 1.9s and the query time is about 190 ms. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the performance of our proposed schemes is greatly influenced by the number of edges and nodes, but less by the number of properties.},

To address such issues, we design a global optimization technique for problems with black-box objective and constraints. Assuming Lipschitz continuity of the cost and constraint functions, a Set Membership framework is adopted to build a surrogate model of the optimization program, that is used for exploitation and exploration routines. The resulting algorithm, named Set Membership Global Optimization with black-box constraints (SMGO- Δ Δ ), features one tunable risk parameter, which the user can intuitively adjust to trade-off safety, exploitation, and exploration. The theoretical properties of the algorithm are derived, and the optimization performance is compared with representative techniques from the literature in several benchmarks. An extension to uncertain cost/constraint function outcomes is presented, too, as well as computational aspects. Lastly, the approach is tested and compared with constrained Bayesian optimization in a case study pertaining to model predictive control tuning for a servomechanism with disturbances and plant uncertainties, addressing practically-motivated task-level constraints.},

It should be noted that SN P systems lack the ability to express information with data, however, numerical spiking neural (NSN) P systems can process information by using numerical variables as data structures . In this work, we investigate asynchronous numerical spiking neural (ANSN) P systems by combining with the knowledge of set theory and threshold control strategy. Moreover, the function of threshold (starting conditions of repartition protocol in NSN P systems) is replaced by the threshold set, that is, the production function can be executed if all of the involved variables are within the range of the threshold set. Under the control strategy of the threshold set and in the asynchronous mode , the computing power of NSN P systems is investigated. It is proved that the superfluous uncertainty introduced by ANSN P systems does not reduce the computing power, and ANSN P systems are still Turing universal as the number generating devices. Specifically, if the traditional threshold control strategy is maintained, the universality of asynchronous NSN P systems cannot be guaranteed, which can only characterize the semilinear set of natural numbers.},

While previous rule-based methods learn closed (non-existential) rules, we introduce Open Path (OP) rules that are constrained existential rules. We present a novel algorithm, OPRL, for learning OP rules. Closed rules complete a KG by answering queries of unclear origin, usually derived from a holdback test set in experimental settings. However, OP rules can generate relevant queries for KG completion. OPRL generates queries even when there is no closed rule to answer the query, or when the correct answer is a missing entity that is not present in the KG. For OPRL to scale well, we propose a novel embedding-based fitness function to efficiently estimate rule quality. Additionally, we introduce a novel, efficient vector computation to formally assess rule quality. We evaluate OPRL using adaptations of Freebase, YAGO2, Wikidata, and a synthetic Poker KG. We find that OPRL mines hundreds of accurate rules from massive KGs with up to 8 M facts. The OP rules generate queries with precision as high as 98\% and recall of 62\% on a complete KG, demonstrating the first solution for active knowledge graph completion.},

In this paper, we propose a reliability analysis method for the multi-state deteriorating system based on belief reliability theory, which can provide more conservative estimations and avoid interval extension problems. To describe the state transition process of multi-state deteriorating systems under the effect of epistemic uncertainty, a mathematical model called uncertain state transition chain is proposed. Under the framework of uncertainty theory, a total uncertainty inequality is given to assist the calculation of belief reliability. Using the proposed model and inequality, an algorithm of belief reliability for multi-state deteriorating systems considering the uncertainty of inspection time is provided. As a numerical example, the calculating process, the evaluation result and some discussions of a specific deteriorating system are given at last.},

Deep learning has widely used in many fields. However, trajectory is simply information such as longitude and latitude. It is difficult to extract trajectory features using deep learning. Therefore, a trajectory prediction model based on deep feature representation (DeepFR) is proposed by extracting various features. The model consists of trajectory data preprocessing layer, deep feature representation layer and trajectory prediction layer. The trajectory data preprocessing layer divides a trajectory into subtrajectories by using a sliding window. The deep feature extraction layer performs feature extraction for each subtrajectory. The spatiotemporal feature and 3D dynamic feature of each subtrajectory are extracted using bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) and 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) respectively. The trajectory prediction layer first uses the self-attention to assign different weight to the feature of different subtrajectories. Then, latitude and longitude are predicted simultaneously through multitask learning . The real hurricane and typhoon data are used for simulation experiments. It is found that the DeepFR model has the best prediction effect and is more accurate and stable in long term prediction.},

Therefore, RIN can model arbitrary order explicit interactions between two different layers, leading to increased efficiency, compared with the existing methods. Furthermore, RIN was combined with a standard Deep Neural Network (DNN) creating a new composite model , called the Deep Recurrent Interaction Network (DRIN). DRIN can learn both the implicit and explicit interactions of features, which specifically has more ability to learn explicit interactions than existing models.

  abstract     = {This study examines the optimal pricing and pricing policy selection for a business-to-consumer (B2C) car-sharing platform during peak and off-peak hours, where two pricing policies are evaluated, that is, fixed pricing policy and dynamic pricing policy. First, we construct the B2C car-sharing market demand function and the sharing platform’s profit maximization model under each pricing policy, and obtain optimal outcomes by solving the model, including service price, market demand, platform’s profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Then, through analysis, we reveal the effects of the pricing policy selection on the optimal outcomes. The results show that compared with the fixed pricing policy, implementing a dynamic pricing policy can increase the sharing platform’s profit, but decrease the consumer surplus and social welfare. Additionally, implementing a dynamic pricing policy can also increase the demand during off-peak hours and decrease the demand during peak hours.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in mobile technology have facilitated location-based social networks. The location-based influence maximization problem, which aims to find top influential seed users for promoting a target location to attract the most individuals, has drawn increasing attention. However, the existing studies largely neglect the importance of user preference, which considerably hinders their practicability. In addition, time efficiency is a critical issue for handling large-scale datasets. To address the above problems, we propose a new framework named IM2Vec, which incorporates representation learning into location-based influence maximization problem. Specifically, we first propose a representation learning model, All2Vec, to capture user preferences for the target location from check-in records, which takes both user preference and geographical location influence into consideration. Then, based on the learned user preferences, we extend the reverse influence sampling (RIS) model and propose a highly efficient preference maximization algorithm, which ensures a ∊ ( 1 - 1 / e - ∊ ) (1-1/e-∊) -approximate solution with a substantially lower sample size. The experimental results of the two tasks (future visitor prediction and influence maximization) on two real geo-social networks show that the All2Vec model achieves considerably higher accuracy in future visitor prediction, and IM2Vec exhibits a higher influence spread and a lower running time than the state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, most mutation operators in conventional clonal selection algorithms have semi-blindness and lack an effective guidance mechanism, which has thus become one of the important factors restricting the performance of algorithms. To address these problems, this study develops an improved clonal selection algorithm called an adaptive clonal selection algorithm with multiple differential evolution strategies (ADECSA) with three features: (1) an adaptive mutation strategy pool based on its historical records of success is introduced to guide the immune response process effectively; (2) an adaptive population resizing method is adopted to speed up convergence; and (3) a premature convergence detection method and a stagnation detection method are proposed to alleviate premature convergence and stagnation problems in the evolution by enhancing the diversity of the population. Experimental results on a wide variety of benchmark functions demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance than both state-of-the-art clonal selection algorithms and differential evolution algorithms. Especially in the comparisons with other clonal selection algorithms, our proposed method outperforms at least 23 out of 30 benchmark functions from the CEC2014 test suite.},

Besides, users have to decrypt all search results to browse, while some of them may not be needed, which undoubtedly wastes bandwidth and computing resources. To cope with this problem, a compromise strategy is proposed that considers the tradeoff between privacy and usability of cipher images. Wherein, a thumbnail preserving encryption (TPE) based on genetic algorithm is proposed. The pixels in the sub-blocks of the plain image are scrambled and diffused at the bit-level through crossover and mutation operators of the genetic algorithm . Moreover, two new operators of Mutation Compensation and Mutation Failure are defined and incorporated into the traditional genetic algorithm to achieve an ideal TPE, that cipher image has the same thumbnail as the original image. Additionally, a color histogram-based retrieval algorithm is introduced to retrieve cipher images using the color information preserved by thumbnails; and to improve retrieval accuracy by using the Bhattacharyya distance . A series of simulations verify the security and effectiveness of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Zero-watermarking is a key technique for achieving lossless and flexible copyright protection of depth image-based rendering (DIBR) videos. Existing approaches extract features of both 2D frames and depth maps via a single mechanism to protect them simultaneously. However, it is difficult for these schemes to fully satisfy the copyright protection requirements of the two components, including the remarkable discriminative capability of 3D videos and robustness against various attacks. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple-feature-based zero-watermarking scheme to protect the copyright of DIBR 3D videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme that integrates multiple features to improve both the discriminative capability and robustness against various attacks. Specifically, dual-tree complex wavelet transform and discrete cosine transform features enhance the robustness against DIBR conversion and noise addition, respectively, while ring-partition statistical residual features ensure robustness against geometric attacks and provide sufficient discriminative capacity. In addition, we use a logistic-logistic chaotic system to encrypt these multiple features for enhanced security and design an attention-based fusion approach to offer an optimal copyright protection solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme has stronger robustness and discriminative capacity compared to state-of-the-art zero-watermarking methods.},

Therefore, it is necessary to find a secure and efficient medical data sharing scheme for the huge amount of medical data. In this paper, we first design an identity-based proxy re-encryption scheme with cryptographic reverse firewall (IBPRE-CRF), then show the application in a multiple-access telemedicine data sharing scenario. Security analysis shows that the IBPRE-CRF scheme provides chosen plaintext attack security and resists exfiltration attacks. Performance analysis shows that the IBPRE-CRF scheme has a significant communication and computational cost advantage while being resistant to exfiltration attacks in clouds.

The multi-scale information is aggregated in parallel way to take advantage of rich information representation. Then, an imitation of the human thinking pattern is employed. Utilizing entropy-based cost function, we update the parameters of the learner model in real-time. Based on the constraint of the evaluation index, adaptive depth representation for training glass insulators that are unsatisfied with the reliability evaluation is constructed to realize the self-optimizing regulation of feature space. Correspondingly, a stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) classifier is re-constructed to fit for the update multi-hierarchies knowledge space to carry out the re-recognition process. Finally, fuzzy integration is employed to ensemble multi-hierarchies network to improve the model’s generalization.

Many approaches have been formulated for supervised learning problems that require labels. However, large-scale labeled datasets are expensive to obtain, especially when the data are multimodal, thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. In this study, a novel m ulti-view g raph c ross-modal h ashing (MGCH) framework is proposed to generate hash codes in a semi-supervised manner using the outputs of multi-view graphs processed by a graph-reasoning module. In contrast to conventional graph-based hashing methods, MGCH adopts multi-view graphs as the only learning assistance to connect labeled and unlabeled data in the process of pursuing binary embeddings. Multiview graphs that filter the features of multidirectional data in multiple anchor sets are beneficial in refining features. As the core component of our MGCH, an intuitive graph reasoning network consisting of two graph convolutional layers and one graph attention layer is employed to simultaneously convolve anchor graphs and asymmetric graphs with input data. Comprehensive cross-modal hashing evaluations on the Wiki, MIRFlickr-25K, NUS-WIDE, and MSCOCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of MGCH over the latest methods for limited labeled data.},

Recently, neural network models provide new solutions for this task, and can be used to learn global representation of a review text, achieving competitive performance. We observe that a review text usually contains two types of information. Some words or sentences describe the user’s preferences, while others indicate the characteristics of the product.

  abstract     = {In the era of social networks, the scale and speed of online information dissemination have been greatly enhanced, thus leading to a large number of meme being generated, spread and popularized in the Internet. Social networks strongly promote the replication and dissemination of modalities, which are powerfully explosive and can be copied and spread in large numbers in a short period of time . Because of the typical decentralized nature of meme propagation in social networks, the development of blockchain technology provides a reliable environment for meme propagation models . However, there are various hurdles to using online user behavior data to predict meme popularity, such as the fact that there are only a few user comments and retweets beneath a meme topic, making it difficult to predict meme popularity directly by basic social data mining at this moment. In this scenario, mining the contextual information of web users can considerably increase meme prediction performance. Because social data contains a wealth of contextual and user relationship characteristics, we offer for the first time a blockchain-assisted based meme popularity prediction (BMP) mechanism based on empirical approach. To begin, we suggest a blockchain-based data storage approach to mimic a decentralized ecosystem. Following that, we assess meme popularity in terms of four contextually based web user characteristics. Finally, using a probabilistic linear model, we present a meme popularity prediction model that integrates the four contextual characteristics. By making a comparison of comprehensive tests with existing methodologies, we illustrate the usefulness and accuracy of our proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed meme prediction approach can provide a meme prediction service with high accuracy, a well-defined decentralized environment, and steady performance, making it a reliable service for recommendation systems and web-based information dissemination .},

To date, there is no work exploring backdoor attacks on deep learning models trained on satellite data. In this study, we evaluate the susceptibility of convolutional networks trained on satellite images to a common trigger-based backdoor attack. We first insert the attack into models trained on two satellite datasets and assess the susceptibility of each model to the attack. We then explore the capability of two state-of-the-art countermeasure techniques based on neuron activity to detect and repair the damage inflicted by the attack. Our results show significant and highly varied attack susceptibility ranging from 0 to 100\% with strong dependence on the combination of classes targeted and features common in satellite images. Existing defense strategies are shown to be generally ineffective for this style of attack on satellite data. Finally, we introduce a diagnostic approach for the detection of poisoning vulnerability in satellite image-based deep learning approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multidisciplinary team is beneficial to select an appropriate treatment plan for a patient with lung cancer, where the collected cognitive evaluation information may be uncertain and incomplete. This study dedicates to dealing with a treatment plan selection problem of lung cancer through the multi-criteria analysis with generalised probabilistic linguistic term sets (GPLTSs) which are powerful in describing the uncertainty and incompleteness of subjective evaluations. The existing generalised probabilistic linguistic information aggregation method is based on the Dempster-Shafer combination rule, but the combined results may be counterintuitive. In addition, the GPLTS may not meet the conditions of applying the Dempster-Shafer combination rule. To make up for these gaps, a new combination rule based on Dempster-Shafer theory is introduced. Then, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process with generalised probabilistic linguistic information based on the proposed combination rule is formed and applied to select the treatment plans of lung cancer associated with a multidisciplinary team. Through the sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, the advantages of the proposed method are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the Broad Learning System (BLS) has attracted much attention due to its efficiency in clean data regression tasks . However, the conventional BLS performs poorly in the noisy environment , because the least square regression based loss function it used for networking training is noise sensitive. To address this problem, the Cauchy Regularized BLS (CRBLS) is proposed in this paper for noisy data prediction. Specifically, the Cauchy loss function instead of the least square metric is introduced into the system to regularize the residues. Compared to the least square loss, the Cauchy loss can penalize the large noise terms owe to its nonlinearity and bounded influence function. This admits the proposed CRBLS to handle data corrupted by Gaussian noise and outliers with different noise levels. In addition, a new incremental learning algorithm is developed for fast model updating without retraining the whole network when additional training samples are added. To evaluate the feasibility of CRBLS, extensive experiments are conducted, and results show that the proposed CRBLS achieves robustness for noisy data predication.},

  abstract     = {With the advance of machine learning technology and especially the explosive growth of big data, federated learning , which allows multiple participants to jointly train a high-quality global machine learning model, has gained extensive attention. However, in federated learning , it has been proved that inference attacks could reveal sensitive information from both local updates and global model parameters, which threatens user privacy greatly. Aiming at the challenge, in this paper, a privacy-preserving and lossless federated learning scheme, named CORK, is proposed for deep neural network . With CORK, multiple participants can train a global model securely and accurately with the assistance of an aggregation server. Specifically, we first design a drop-tolerant secure aggregation algorithm FTSA, which ensures the confidentiality of local updates. Then, a lossless model perturbation mechanism PTSP is proposed to protect sensitive data in global model parameters. Furthermore, the neuron pruning operation in PTSP can reduce the scale of models, which thus improves the computation and communication efficiency significantly. Detailed security analysis shows that CORK can resist inference attacks on both local updates and global model parameters. In addition, CORK is implemented with real MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that CORK is indeed effective and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Design alternative assessment is vital in product development since it directly influences the directions of subsequent design and manufacturing activities. The alternative assessment information chiefly depends on experts’ subjective perceptions and preferences, which include several types of uncertainty, such as intrapersonal perception ambiguousness, personal judgment reliability, and interpersonal preference inconsistency. However, previous studies usually just consider one of the various uncertainties, which may affect their effectiveness. To fill this gap, we develop an integrated design alternative assessment model integrating Z-cloud rough numbers (ZCRNs), best-worst method (BWM), and multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC). First, to fully handle various uncertainties, a new concept of ZCRN is developed by combining the benefits of cloud model in addressing intrapersonal uncertainty, the merits of Z-numbers in reflecting judgmental reliability, and the strengths of rough numbers in handling interpersonal uncertainty. Some arithmetic operating rules, Minkowski-type distance, comparison measure, correlation measure, and aggregation operators for ZCRNs are also introduced. Furthermore, a ZCRN-BWM method and a ZCRN-MABAC method are developed to calculate criteria weights and rank design alternatives. Finally, a case study, sensitivity analysis on two parameters and a normalization method, and several comparisons are performed to elaborate and validate the developed model.},

The related researches led to a significant progress so far. Nevertheless, suffering from paying unique attention on the structure or neighborhoods of nodes, most of methods cannot describe the vector representations of nodes well enough. In addition, random walk plays a key role during the learning procedure in many advanced methods. The successor node is selected according t the proximity of its direct prior node in each walk step. It is easy to lead a similarity drifting in a long walk sequence and influence the sequence quality. To address these issues, a fuzzy hierarchical network embedding approach (FHNE) is put forward to learn the vector expression fusing structure and neighbor information. Firstly, a multi-granular graph is constructed by a fuzzy k -core decomposition to encode the structural and neighborhood information of nodes. Then, inspired by the epidemic method, a biased random walk is designed to solve the similarity drifting. Many numerical experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance on various tasks in some real datasets. It verifies that FHNE can learn the efficient network representations.},

The approach recursively partitions the data at multiple levels of granularity into shape-free clusters of different sizes, resembling Voronoi tessellation , and naturally aggregates the resulting cluster medoids into a multi-layered prototype-based structure according to their descriptive abilities. Different from conventional classification models , it is nonparametric and entirely data-driven, and the learned model can offer a high-level of transparency and interpretability thanks to the underlying prototype-based nature. The system identification process underpinning the approach is driven by the aim of separating data samples of different classes into nonoverlapping multi-granular clusters. Its associated decision-making process follows the “nearest prototype” principle and hence, the rationales of the subsequent decisions made can be explicitly explained. Experimental studies based on popular benchmark classification problems, as well as on a practical application to remote sensing image classification, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) aims to rank alternatives based on their attributes and evaluation information, which provides decision support for decision-makers. Most existing MADM methods can only obtain ranking results, decision-makers usually need to subjectively choose priority alternatives to make a decision based on the preset evaluation level and ranking results, which does not meet the requirements of complex decision situations and uncertain information processing. A method is urgently needed, which can objectively produce classification results and automatically provide priority objects for decisions. Three-way decisions (3WDs) offer an effective research technique to solve decision-making problems under uncertainty and risk by objectively dividing a universal set into three pairwise disjoint parts: acceptance, non-commitment and rejection, and implementing the corresponding strategy for each part. Considering that it is difficult to accurately determine the exact value of attributes in some cases, interval numbers can be a useful concept to flexibly describe uncertain information and satisfy the decision-maker’s cognition. Therefore, under an interval-valued MADM environment, this paper proposes an evaluation-based interval-valued multi-attribute three-way decision (IVMA3WD) model from an optimization viewpoint. The model achieves an effective fusion of 3WDs and MADM problems, and further expands evaluation-based 3WD models on the totally ordered set . Specifically speaking, in order to depict uncertain information in decision-making, interval numbers are used to describe the evaluation information included in the multi-attribute evaluation matrix . Then, considering a general case that there are no decision attributes in the multi-attribute evaluation matrix , we determine the evaluation function by use of the idea of the interval-valued TOPSIS method. In addition, unlike the fixed-valued loss functions in the majority of 3WD models, the relative loss function in this article is not provided straightly but computed by attribute evaluation values expressed by interval numbers. Furthermore, based on an optimization viewpoint, we construct two optimization models and attempt to find the optimal solution to obtain the threshold pair. A housing market investment decision problem is utilized as an illustrative example to find out the applicability of our built IVMA3WD model. In the end, we adopt a sensitivity analysis and a comparative analysis to demonstrate our proposed model’s characteristics and advantages.},

Although several approaches were proposed for phishing attacks detection, the URL-based Machine Learning approaches obtain better performance results, but all of them are dependent on the feature set used. Contradictorily, only a few works on selecting the best-suited feature set for improving the phishing detection process have been published. The present research explores how to obtain a feature set that substantially enhances the phishing detection rate in IoT environments. Hence, a feature selection algorithm was adopted and extended for getting the most representative feature set.

Over recent years, the maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning algorithm (ME-DIRL) has been increasingly applied to the learning of nonlinear rewards. However, under cases of limited and imbalanced expert demonstration data, complex calculations, or overfitting, the learning nonlinear rewards remains a challenging problem. A novel ME-DIRL with AdaBoost algorithm (AME-DIRL) is our proposed solution. The focus of AME-DIRL is to utilize the AdaBoost algorithm. This combines multiple ME-DIRL processes to form a strong learner and thus overcome the imbalance of the data set. Furthermore, to deal with the complex calculations in AME-DIRL, a truncated gradient (TG) method is applied for getting the sparse rewards obtained by the strong learner, thus reducing the model complexity. To prevent overfitting, a correction factor is then added to the linear combination of weak learners. AME-DIRL models the relationship between input features and output rewards. Rewards are approximated by means of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with scaled exponential linear units (SELUs). Numerical results indicate that our proposed AME-DIRL shows higher accuracy in learning rewards when compared with several classical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms.},

In the proposed KGE algorithm the gradient vector is computed using a kernel reproducing function.

  abstract     = {Large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) have drawn researchers’ increasing attention since their resemblance to real-world problems. However, due to the complex search space and massive local optima, it is challenging to simultaneously guarantee the diversity and convergence of the algorithms. As a widely used evolutionary algorithm with fast convergence, particle swarm optimization (PSO) shows competitive performances on some LSOPs. Nevertheless, it can easily get trapped into local optima. Overcoming the complexity of LSOPs and improving search efficiency have become vital issues. The reinforcement learning method has proven to be an effective technique in self-adaptive adjustment, which can help search for better results in large-scale solution space more effectively. In this paper, we propose a large-scale optimization algorithm called reinforcement learning level-based particle swarm optimization algorithm (RLLPSO). In RLLPSO, a level-based population structure is constructed to improve population diversity. A reinforcement learning strategy for level number control is employed to help improve the search efficiency of RLLPSO. To further enhance the convergence ability of RLLPSO, a level competition mechanism is introduced. The experimental results from two large-scale benchmark test suites demonstrate that, compared with five state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, RLLPSO shows superiority in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, with the increasing complexity of decision-making environment, more and more large-scale group decision making (LGDM) problems are faced. Due to the existence of social network relationships among experts, social network analysis (SNA) is proved to be an effective analysis method for LGDM problems. Meanwhile, it is crucial for LGDM issues to determine the weights of decision groups and to lessen the large-scale DMs’ dimension, which will affect the result of decision making directly. This study proposes a clustering- and maximum consensus-based resolution framework with linguistic distribution (LD) for social network large-scale group decision making (SNLGDM) problems. In the consensus framework, independent sub-groups can be obtained by the division of large-scale DMs according to trust relationship using the proposed SNA-based trust network clustering model, and the LD assessments are used to represent the preference relation of sub-groups. Following this, by considering three dependable sources: consistency, similarity, and in-centrality degree, this paper devises a maximum consensus-based method, which can generate the sub-groups’ comprehensive weight by maximizing the level of consensus between sub-groups and the collective matrix. Meanwhile, the final ranking of alternatives can be obtained based on collective preference relation. Conclusively, the availability and advantage of this research are verified through numerical example, coefficient analysis and comparative analysis.},

LightGBM is an advanced machine learning algorithm , which uses histogram algorithm and Leaf-wise strategy with depth limitation to improve the accuracy of the model. However, there are almost no cases of applying this method to corporate financing risk prediction. Therefore, the paper establishes the LightGBM model to predict the financing risk profile of 186 enterprises. In order to compare the prediction performance of LightGBM for enterprise financing risk, the paper conducted comparison experiments using k-nearest-neighbors algorithm, decision tree algorithm , and random forest algorithm on the same data set. The experiments show that LightGBM has better prediction results than the other three algorithms for several metrics in corporate financing risk prediction.

Existing studies of finding hole spanners either identified redundant hole spanners (i.e., communities bridged by different hole spanners are redundant) or found nonredundant hole spanners only by network structure. Unlike the existing studies, we not only study a problem of finding top- k hole spanners that connect nonredundant communities in the social network, but also consider the tie strengths between different pairs of users and the different information sharing rates of different users, so that after removing the found users, the number of blocked information diffusion is maximized. In addition, we devise a novel ( 1 - 1 e ) (1-1e) -approximation algorithm for the problem, where e is the base of the natural logarithm . We further propose a fast randomized algorithm with a smaller time complexity. Our experiment results demonstrate that, after removing the nodes found by the proposed two algorithms, the numbers of blocked information diffusion can be up to 80\% larger than those by existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, attributed networks are increasingly available for us. How to leverage attribute information to gain a better performance of community detection has attracted growing attention. Most established approaches focus on exploiting attribute information based on the observed homophily assumption that nodes with similar attributes are more likely to be connected. Since not all attributes are truly relevant for the formation of communities, such an assumption may not hold in real-world attributed networks. In many cases, only a subset of attributes are the key factors to make nodes connected to form communities and they may differ largely for different communities. In this paper, we propose a new community detection approach in attributed networks, called SOA, by examining the Subspaces Of Attributes. The basic idea is to regard the community detection as an optimization problem , which aims at learning a new similarity matrix to maximize the homophily. By employing an efficient optimization strategy , the high-quality communities as well as their corresponding relevant attributes (i.e., attribute subspaces) are automatically identified. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks have demonstrated the effectiveness of SOA, and shown its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.},

Applying a graph neural network (GNN) to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has attracted increasing attention. However, the available GNNs for HSIC only adopt a kind of graph filter and an aggregator , which cannot well deal with the problems of land cover discrimination, noise impaction, and spatial feature learning. To overcome these problems, a graph convolution with adaptive filters and aggregator fusion (AF2GNN) is developed for HSIC. To reduce the number of graph nodes , a superpixel segment algorithm is employed to refine the local spatial features of the HSI. A two-layer 1D CNN is proposed to transform the spectral features of superpixels. In addition, a linear function is designed to combine the different graph filters, with which the graph filter can be adaptively determined by training different weight matrices . Moreover, degree-scalers are defined to combine the multiple filters and present the graph structure. Finally, the AF2GNN is proposed to realize the adaptive filters and aggregator fusion mechanism within a single network. In the proposed network, a softMax function is utilized for graph feature interpretation and pixel-label prediction. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves superior experimental results.},

Blockchain is a transformative technology that has received significant attention recently. Blockchain technology can process various business transactions by offering a reliable and decentralized infrastructure. Supply chain management is an important application area of blockchains due to its desirable properties, including data security, extended visibility, product traceability, digitalization, and disintermediation. Since blockchain technologies are in their infancy, adopting them to supply chains requires proper design methodologies. Fuzzy AD offers valuable computational mechanisms to evaluate design options in the presence of functional requirements. However, extending AD to different fuzzy extensions is not an easy task, and area-based calculations hinder its widespread applicability. In this study, an IT2F-AD method is developed based on the concept of fuzzy subsethood. The potential of the fuzzy subsethood measure as the main computation engine within type-1 and IT2F-AD is demonstrated. Finally, an integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed by using IT2F Best-Worst Method (IT2F-BWM) and IT2F-AD. The proposed model is used to prioritize blockchain deployment projects in a real-life case study.},

There exist many instance selection algorithms , but no single algorithm, in general, dominates the others. Moreover, existing instance selection algorithms do not allow direct controlling of the instance selection rate. In this paper, we present a simple and generic cluster-oriented instance selection algorithm for classification problems. Our proposed algorithm runs an unsupervised K Means Clustering algorithm on the training instances and with a given selection rate, selects instances from the centers and the borders of the clusters. On 24 benchmark classification problems, when very similar percentages of instances are selected by various instance selection algorithms, K Nearest Neighbours classifiers achieve more than 2\%–3\% better accuracy when using instances selected by our proposed method than when using those selected by other state-of-the-art generic instance selection algorithms.},

By combining more highly-correlated indices of a to-be-predicted index into prediction, the improved linear regression method is then applied to achieve a sharper prediction-error histogram and less required additional information.

In recent years, many methods have emerged to discover the underlying community structure in the network. However, most of these methods need to take the network topology information as prior knowledge that is not feasible in practical cases. When information diffusion occurs in the network, one can observe the cascade data in which nodes participate in the propagation process, which reflects the network’s community structure to some extent. In this paper, we build a likelihood maximization model by utilizing the diffusion information and propose two different optimization algorithms to obtain community division of the network.

In detail, we propose RARIEA, a market framework for t R ading priv A te data gene R ators based on GAN under rény I diff E rential priv A cy, which involves data owners, a data broker, and data consumers. To start, the broker employs the GAN training generator to augment the data to relieve the data shortage, introducing noise into its training process to preserve the owners’ privacy. After that, the broker uses rényi differential privacy to quantify the privacy loss at the data item level during the GAN training process and compensates each owner according to their respective privacy policies. Finally, the data broker charges each of the data consumers for their queries, where the price is lower bounded by the total privacy compensation. We then evaluate the performance of RARIEA on classic data sets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA. The analysis and simulation results reveal that the generator provided by RARIEA can not only meet the data consumers’ demand for quantity and quality but also protect the owners’ privacy. In addition, RARIEA not only allows finer control over data owner compensation, but also excels at controlling the data broker’s revenue to improve market efficiency while ensuring fairness, balance, and monotonicity of pricing.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the problem of event-triggered remote state estimation for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) under malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A remote estimator with intermittent observations is derived, and a novel event-triggered communication strategy is designed by transmitting observations to the remote estimator when the predicted estimation error covariance exceeds a given threshold. By constraining the upper bound of the total attack ratio, sufficient conditions to guarantee the almost sure stability of the proposed estimator are presented. Furthermore, the event-triggering parameter is designed to balance the estimation performance and the network resource utilization. In contrast to the previous studies on remote state estimation with random packet losses , the considered DoS attack case is more challenging since the probabilistic property of the packet loss process is unavailable to describe the attacks. Finally, the efficiency of the presented method is illustrated by simulation results.},

Our approach contributes to the identification of abnormal patterns by applying real-time occupancy data from Paris. In particular, we propose a novel functional outlier detection algorithm based on a two-step approach: In the first stage, a clean dataset is obtained based on the combined effect of two extreme statistics calculated from random sampling; in the second stage, a multiple testing approach based on the clean dataset is proposed, in which the false discovery rate (FDR) control procedure is used to adaptively choose the thresholds for the hypothesis tests. Extensive numerical simulations were conducted to compare the outlier detection performance with those of other state-of-art methods. The proposed approach is then applied to the Paris Vélib’ bike sharing system dataset to identify abnormal patterns that are of particular interest to BSS operators for identifying system inefficiencies and update policies.},

For this, a necessary and sufficient condition for the IFPR to be multiplicative consistent is proposed and proved. Based on it, a ratio-based deviation identifying matrix that takes an accurate measurement of deviation of every element in the IFPR is constructed. We prove that the greater the value of the deviation matrix is, the more inconsistent is its corresponding element in the IFPR and based on it, a convergent iterative algorithm of improving the multiplicative consistency is presented. The algorithm uses the fact that all the indeterminacy degrees of the IFPR are never changed in the revising process of multiplicative inconsistency and as a result, the most inconsistent elements are uniquely determined by suitable elements in the IFPR, respectively. The proposed method makes a great difference from the previous methods that derived the underlying priority weight&#39;s vector with respect to alternatives based on the given IFPR for improving consistency.

The difference between Type-1 Fuzzy PID (T1FPID) controllers and IT2FPID controllers is the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) which occurs due to the use of IT2FSs. FOU gives an extra degree of freedom to the controller structure, which is capable of handling uncertainty in the plant. However, the effect of FOU on the analytical structures of the IT2FPID controllers is not yet explored when uniformly/non-uniformly distributed multiple IT2FSs are used on the input side and uniformly/non-uniformly distributed multiple singleton fuzzy sets are considered on the output side of the controller. In this paper, controllers with three different types of FOUs and two different defuzzification methods are considered, and their analytical structures are derived. The suitability of the controllers is examined, and the properties of the suitable controllers are explored. Effects of FOU on the nonlinearity, gain, and computational aspects of the suitable controllers are studied. The applicability of proposed IT2FPID controllers is shown through simulation and real-time studies. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is depicted by comparing their performances with that of the recently developed Integer Order Fuzzy PID (IOFPID) and Fractional Order Fuzzy PID (FOFPID) controllers.},

Adversarial samples can be crafted in white-box or black-box scenario. In the black-box scenario adversaries possess no knowledge of the detailed architecture and parameters of the model they attack, and they seek information by querying the model with multiple, slightly perturbed samples to achieve their attack purpose. The difficulty in recognizing adversarial samples arises from the fact that the perturbations are often imperceptible, yet effective in misleading machine learning models. Existing defense methods are static, and they cannot dynamically evolve to adapt to adversarial attacks , which unnecessarily disadvantages them. In this paper we propose a novel dynamic defense method called DyAdvDefender , and we show that a dynamic defense method can effectively utilize previous experience to defend against black-box attacks. Extensive experimental results suggest that DyAdvDefender outperforms existing static methods in terms of defense effectiveness while keeping the original classification accuracy with only limited extra time consumption.},

Then, a programming model is constructed to derive the priority weight vector of PFPRs. Then, an inconsistency-repairing method of PFPRs is designed. Moreover, a group consensus index to calculate the degrees of similarity among PFPRs is proposed and an iterative consensus reaching procedure with PFPRs is developed. By maximizing the group consensus level of PFPRs, a model is built to determine DMs’ weights. Furthermore, a new GDM method based on PFPRs is proposed.

In particular, the time evolution property of the stock markets have been described by temporal networks. However, these approaches fail to consider the interactions over time between assets. To overcome this drawback, financial markets can be described by multiplex networks where the different relations between nodes can be conveniently expressed structuring the network through different layers. To catch this kind of interconnections we provide new local clustering coefficients for multiplex networks, looking at the network from different perspectives depending on the node position, as well as a global clustering coefficient for the whole network. We also prove that all the well-known expressions for clustering coefficients existing in the literature, suitably extended to the multiplex framework, may be unified into our proposal. By means of an application to the multiplex temporal financial network, based on the returns of the S&amp;P100 assets, we show that the proposed measures prove to be effective in describing dependencies between assets over time.},

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art deep learning technologies are vulnerable to adversarial examples and backdoor attacks, where an adversary destroys the model’s integrity. The obstacles have urged intensive research on improving the ability of deep learning technologies to resist integrity attacks. However, existing defense methods are either incomplete (i.e., only a single attack can be detected) or expensive computing resources. It requires the defense method to have universal property, which can effectively and efficiently detect multiple integrity attacks. To this end, we propose a similarity-based integrity protection method for deep learning systems (IPDLS), which is provided with the universal property. IPDLS realizes anomaly detection by measuring the similarity between suspicious samples and samples in a preset verification set. We empirically evaluate IPDLS on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of IPDLS, which can detect adversarial examples and backdoor attacks simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most successful approach of Recommender Systems that has been applied in a wide range of applications. In this approach, historical rating data is exploited to calculate similarity between pairs of users and predict user preference over unseen items. The similarity is calculated using users&#39; global preferences estimated from their previous interactions with items. To this end, commonly rated items by a given pair of users are utilized to calculate the similarity. In a sparse dataset, there are limited co-rated items. In addition, inconsistent behaviours of users in rating items may add some noise to data, which makes the ratings more untrustworthy leading to less accuraterecommendations. In this manuscript, we introduce an individual ratings confidence measure (IRC) to calculate the confidence of a given rating to each item by the target user. IRC consists of 5 factors that help to have more information about the interest and boredom of users. User ratings are denoised by prioritizing extreme and high-confidence ratings, and finally, the denoised ratings are used to obtain similarity values. This approach leads to a more accurate neighbourhood selection and rating prediction. We show the superiority of the proposed method when compared with state-of-the-art recommender algorithms over some well-known benchmark datasets.},

Secondly, aiming at the dynamic interactive behavior among complex messages in the rumor space, the driving force of complex messages is quantified with the evolutionary game, the dynamic rumor propagation network is reconstructed, and the structure attribute prediction submodel is constructed. Finally, considering the advantages of model fusion in improving the generalization ability of the single model, the node feature prediction submodel—Submodel Based on SRC and the structure attribute prediction submodel—Submodel Based on Node2Vec are fused. Meanwhile, a dynamic group behavior prediction model under the influence of complex messages is constructed for the time-sensitive nature of rumor propagation. The experimental results show that the model not only effectively explores the interaction between complex messages but also accurately predicts the group behavior and depicts the rules of rumor propagation.},

Recommendation helps to overcome the information overload problem as the available alternatives consume a large amount of data. In some applications, a group of people are involved in the process of generating a recommendation. This paper focuses on “automatically detected groups” formation for order and flexible preferences in group recommendation using locality-sensitive hashing. The MinHash technique is applied on a characteristic matrix to generate the signature matrix. The signature matrix is the reduced representation of the characteristic matrix and preserves the Jaccard similarity to a great extent. Locality-sensitive hashing is applied on the signature matrix to determine similar users efficiently. Similar users will be the members of an automatically identified group. Therefore, the group members are maximally satisfied with recommended items. This work also studies the performance of benchmark clustering approaches in group formation. We experimented on real-world datasets and found that the proposed models to identify communities in group recommendation maximizes consensus among users in a group.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems are often challenged by the existence of cold-start items for which no previous rating is available. The standard content-based or collaborative-filtering recommendation approaches may address this problem by asking users to share their data with a central (cloud-based) server, which uses machine learning to predict appropriate ratings on such items. But users may be reluctant to have their (confidential) data shared. Federated learning has been lately capitalized on to address the privacy concerns by enabling an on-device distributed training of a single machine learning model. In this work, we propose a federated learning-based approach to address the item cold-start problem in recommendation systems. The originality of our solution compared to existing federated learning-based solutions comes from (1) applying federated learning specifically to the cold-start problem; (2) proposing a trust mechanism to derive trust scores for the potential recommenders, followed by a double deep Q learning scheduling approach that relies on the trust and energy levels of the recommenders to select the best candidates. Simulations on the MovieLens 1M and Epinions datasets suggest that our solution improves the accuracy of recommending cold-start items and reduces the RMSE, MAE and running time compared to five benchmark approaches.},

This paper proposes an approach based on adaptive online analysis to accurately determine the families of malware by analyzing traffic streams which are encrypted, drift, and imbalanced. This approach is based on Improved Adaptive Random Forests (IARF), to obtain the ability of adaptive update of parameters when processing new types of malware traffic in traffic streams and being sensitive to families of malware with few samples in imbalanced traffic. We build a prototype of this approach and evaluate the performance through experiments. The experiments are based on a mixed dataset composed of data from malware-traffic-analysis.net, Lastline Inc, MCFP dataset, and CTU-13 dataset. In addition, our approach is also compared with three state-of-the-art methods. The results of the experiments show that we have obtained a 99.66\% F1-score in the classification of malware families, and our classifier also performs better than the other classifiers.},

Formal verification sheds some light to tackle this issue, which achieves it by a rigorous mathematical reasoning. Nevertheless, such technique still suffers from the efficiency and scalability problems. In light of this, we develop a novel solution to make a pre-analysis before performing verification. Specifically, we argue that the points near the actual decision boundary of the neural network are more likely to not satisfy robustness. As such, we focus on locating unstable points in the input set, instead of point-by-point verification. Borrowing from mutation testing, we adopt the analysis of the mutation decision boundaries to evaluate the local robustness of the inputs. Also, we design a robustness metric to guide the selection of unstable points. Then, the effective adversarial examples can be generated by perturbing these unstable points. We conduct extensive experiments on two neural network verification benchmarks, demonstrating the rationality, effectiveness and efficiency improvement of our solution.},

Accurate and real-time ride-hailing demand prediction is crucial for improving supply–demand imbalance, vehicle utilization and traffic conditions. However, most existing works mainly address the region-based demand prediction whereas only a few works focus on the origin–destination (OD)-based demand prediction. To address the issue, we develop several dynamic OD graphs to character the ride-hailing demand transactions between the origin and destination. We propose a novel deep learning model , referred to as the Dynamic Multi-Graph Convolutional Network with Generative Adversarial Network structure (DMGC-GAN), to investigate the challenging problem. Different from previous studies, we develop the temporal multi-graph convolutional network (TMGCN) layer with different dynamic OD graphs to capture the spatial topologies contained in the dynamic OD graphs in terms of time, and exploit GAN structure to overcome the high sparsity of OD demand. We conduct extensive numerical experiments on the real-world ride-hailing demand dataset (from Manhattan district, New York City).

For low computational cost, an MMPC method with gradient eigenvector algorithm (MMPC-GEA) for nonlinear systems is proposed to comprehensively deal with multiple conflicting control objectives. The proposed MMPC-GEA in the framework of MMPC is composed of a fuzzy neural network (FNN) identifier and a receding optimization algorithm . For the proposed MMPC-GEA, FNN with an adaptive learning algorithm is devised to capture the nonlinear characteristic of systems. Moreover, a gradient eigenvector algorithm (GEA) is designed to gain the optimization solution of the control objectives for nonlinear systems. Specifically, GEA can reduce the computationally demanding by avoiding the determination of the objective weights. Furthermore, the stability and control performance analysis of the MMPC-GEA scheme is provided.

Active learning (AL) can be used to gather high-quality training data by producing very informative yet small training sets. Cover, a method we have previously developed, allows for unsupervised sampling of training sets as good as those created using AL. In this paper we provide an extensive analysis of how and why Cover works. We revisit the method in a more formal way, with theorems and proofs, and provide additional empirical evidence of its practicality. We answer questions related to why Cover works so well and how its properties are related to AL methods. We show how certain characteristics of Cover’s clustering step allows it to more thoroughly explore the feature space by selecting query-document pairs that are representative and diverse, allowing L2R methods to produce effective models. The main novel contribution is a detailed analysis of the method’s inner workings and information-theoretic properties, allowing us to advance the understanding of L2R fundamentals through the lens of training set building.},

Since it can provide more information than formal concept analysis, the new model has been widely used in the field of knowledge discovery. However, three-way concept analysis mainly deals with object-attribute data. If there is structure information between objects, how to remould traditional three-way concepts to describe both object-object information and object-attribute information is a topic worthy of discussion. To analyze object-object information and object-attribute information at the same time, we first propose the notion of a network formal context, and then define global network OE-concept and local network OE-concept. After that we investigate knowledge discovery based on the global network OE-concept and local network OE-concept. We further discuss the dynamic updating mechanism of global network OE-concept and local network OE-concept under the evolution of a network formal context. The corresponding algorithms are designed to update old network OE-concepts, and the time complexity is analyzed. Note that the classical formal context itself can also represent a network formal context, so in order to show the necessity of the proposed network formal context and network OE-concepts, we clarify the advantages of the network formal context and network OE-concepts from the aspects of knowledge representation, efficiency of computing network OE-concepts, dynamic updating of concepts and stability analysis of concepts. In addition, we conduct some experiments to argue that knowledge discovery of local network OE-concepts is better than that of global network OE-concepts as well as the classical OE-concepts.

  abstract     = {The selection of hyper-parameters in building neural networks is often left to end-users. However, this may lead to poor performance regardless of the amount of experience of the user. With deep implementation, this becomes even more challenging due to a large number of hyper-parameters. Deep stochastic configuration networks (DeepSCNs) have become increasingly popular over the past years because of their universal approximation property, fast learning and easy implementation. So far, understanding and setting the hyper-parameters for this type of network is still unexplored. This paper defines a suitable search space for DeepSCN, a performance estimation strategy for finding suitable hyper-parameters with search strategies Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and random search. Simulations are performed using both searches over four benchmark datasets, and results indicate some significant improvements in modelling performance. Furthermore, a case study is presented to demonstrate that an optimised model and hyper-parameters can be found using MCTS.},

  abstract     = {In granular computing, a set of attributes (features) is often selected as a view to describe objects from a particular angle. In each view, objects can be further described from different levels of granularities (abstraction), and each granularity determines a level. Multiview and multilevel are two basic principles of granular computing, which render a solution more comprehensive and reasonable. From the viewpoint of granular computing, existing three-way decisions cannot effectively combine multiview and multilevel to make decisions. As a new granular computing model, the partition order product space solves a problem from multiple views and at multiple levels in each view, which follows the principles of multiview and multilevel. In this paper, we discuss three-way decisions based on partition order product space. First, we propose two search algorithms: depth-first and breadth-first searching algorithms , to obtain a solution for problem solving in partition order product space. Second, we introduce two fusion strategies to fuse multiple one-level views: optimistic fusion method and pessimistic fusion method. Consequently, based on two search algorithms and two fusion strategies, we propose four multiview sequential three-way decisions, which can simultaneously make decisions from multiple views and multiple levels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.},

  abstract     = {The construction of an accurate train control model (TCM) is crucial to the design of automatic train operation and real-time traffic management systems in high-speed railways. Traditional physical-driven models usually fail to reflect the “true” dynamics of high-speed trains (HSTs) because of the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty due to air resistance, frequently switching working conditions, and variations in external influencing factors such as weather and temperature. Although some data-driven deep learning models have recently been proposed for environmental adaptation, they are all “black-box” models, which cannot explain how the input of the models affects the HST output. To overcome these issues, this study constructs a novel long short-term memory with lagged information (LAG-LSTM) model by combining the physical-driven HST model and an “interpretable” deep learning model. Specifically, our LAG-LSTM model contains three modules: a time-delay variable module to model the transform delay of control variables, state variable enhancement module to extract the key features among high-dimensional input data, and Pre-LSTM module to predict the future train trajectory with given control variables. We collected field data from the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway and developed a data filter method and a normalization procedure to overcome the positioning errors of HSTs and construct a standard data set. Finally, we tested the effectiveness of our LAG-LSTM by comparing it with six deep learning structures, including fully connected neural network, recursive neural network, standard LSTM, and LSTM with convolutional layers. The results show that LAG-LSTM can accurately predict the trajectories of HSTs and outperforms other deep learning models. Regarding prediction accuracy, LAG-LSTM improved the performance of the traditional LSTM by 13.5\% 13.5\% to 23.3\% 23.3\% .},

Specifically, a fuzzy description for the main nonlinearity of the PMLM system and its fuzzy dynamic model is formulated. Then, the tracking specification is modeled as a performance constraint, the RCFC algorithm following the Udwadia-Kalaba theory is designed to comply with this constraint, and possess strong robustness to uncertainties simultaneously. The resulting controller is demonstrated to be uniform bounded and uniform ultimate bounded with Lyapunov analysis. Furthermore, the optimal design issue via a fuzzy approach is investigated to achieve the optimal tradeoff between control effort and system performance.

Along with reducing the scale of abundant measurements, the proposed approach also focuses on the robust issues that arise from the large outliers. In the local phase, every agent of the DKPCR technique processes the data of the partial sections and sends the selected information to the centralized mainframe. The engineer gathers the data from the local agents and then makes a decision based on the Bayesian inference . Additionally, the corresponding weight diagnosis approach is devised to isolate the fault-relevant variables under the smear effect by virtue of the detection results and information. In the end, the Tennessee Eastman case (TEC) and the three-phase flow system (TPFS) are leveraged to demonstrate the detection and diagnosis performance of the proposed approach.},

Compared to homogeneous graphs (i.e., nodes and edges of a single relation type), heterogeneous graphs have heterogeneity and richer information (i.e., nodes and edges of different relation types). How to tackle complex non-pairwise graph-structured data and model various relation-types is a daunting challenge for heterogenous graphs. However, the existing unsupervised methods focus on node attribute learning, while node neighborhood information utilizes very limited because they only consider node propagation that is within few steps. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method, called APPTE, that models adequate node neighborhood information in local context, and captures the global neighborhood information. Meanwhile, our method considers the robustness and generalization ability . Specifically, we construct approximate personalized propagation in local context to utilize an infinite number of neighborhood aggregation layers for extending node neighborhood propagation range, and then fuse these local context to capture global neighborhood information. Additionally, we improve the robustness and generalization ability of model, employing throwedge to increase the randomness and diversity of the graph connections by randomly deleting a part of edges. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets containing heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to the available state-of-the-art methods.},

A data set will then be partitioned into multiple family trees. In order to obtain the final clustering result, instead of exploiting the error-prone allocation strategy of DPC, we first elaborately design a novel similarity measure for family trees, characterizing not only the distance between data points, but also the structure of trees. Then, we adapt graph cut for the corresponding connection graph to also take global structural information into account. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data sets show that the proposed algorithm can outperform several prominent clustering algorithms for most of the cases, including the DPC and spectral clustering algorithms and some of their latest variants.

A static complete reposition setting is adopted, i.e., the system is operated (re-balanced) when the number of users riding bicycles can be neglected as it happens in many cities, for instance during the night. The popular ‘healthy or broken’ repositioning rule is revisited and examined along with two newly proposed rules, i.e., ‘pickup or delivery’ and ‘pickup and delivery’ rules. A discussion is also provided in terms of measuring the degree of an unbalancing in such a system. A mathematical model is proposed for each repositioning rule. Depending on the rule one will be facing a multi-trip vehicle routing or a multi-trip pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem, which is a problem not much investigated in the literature. An approximate algorithm is also devised for the problem, which is adapted to the multi-trip vehicle routing, and also suitable for multi-trip pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem with some corresponding adjustment. Computational tests are reported on to assess the methodological contributions of this work. These tests consider both randomly generated instances and two instances using real data. The results shown that ‘pickup and delivery’ rule is better than others when distribution degree of repositioning scenario is less than 0.5, while if the distribution degree exceeds 0.5, the ‘pickup or delivery’ rule is the most cost-effective one.},

Then, the rate distortion function (RDF) is used to minimize the mutual information between each agent and its environment by means of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, from which, the resulting conditional probability and the parameter λ λ have the highest relevance, since, the former describes the similitude between the agent information and its environment, and the latter, due to its influence in the distortion and gathered environment information, defines the rationality measure in the learning process.

Therefore, a type of fractional-order command filter (CF) is introduced to overcome such a shortcoming, that is, by means of fractional-order CF, the virtual input signal and its fractional derivative can be estimated properly as anticipated. Fractional-order sliding mode surfaces are constructed to diminish the filtering errors such that more better performance is guaranteed. Besides, compared to the conventional backstepping control, the CF-based fuzzy backstepping SMC approach presented in the paper not only shows the superior robustness, but also facilitates to accomplish the desired tracking control objective in finite time.

  abstract     = {In most previous opinion dynamics research, the opinion evolution is usually defaulted to evolving over a single topic; however, in more general scenarios, agents often discuss several topics at the same time. This paper adopts a multidimensional opinion dynamics model in which the opinions are represented by vectors to reveal the multi-topic opinion pattern. To be more in line with reality, this paper employs a multidimensional version of the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model, where each stubborn agent has a time-evolving stubbornness level. The theoretical analysis finds that the proposed model is convergent if the interpersonal influence matrix is stochastic indecomposable and aperiodic. To achieve unified consensus, opinion leaders are introduced, after which the consensus conditions for the proposed model are given. The theoretical conclusions suggest that in the proposed model, the stubborn agents are as prominent as the opinion leaders in the opinion formation process. Simulations are then conducted in two types of artificial networks, from which it is found that compared with the scalar version of the proposed model and standard multidimensional FJ models in which agents’ stubbornness levels remain unchanged, the proposed model produce a more compact final opinion space. The results show that to generate smaller opinion distance and higher opinion correctness degree, it is necessary to ensure a lower proportion of stubborn agents and higher network connectivity. This is consistent with people’s intuition. The population size is found to have little effect on the results, but larger number of topics result in larger opinion distances. These findings are enlightening and helpful to opinion managers.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is one of the most important tasks in the field known as ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ (EDA). It explores the dependencies hidden in individual data attributes, dividing them from one set into smaller subsets. In this paper, a Parallel Complete Gradient Clustering Algorithm (PCGCA) is proposed. The Complete Gradient Clustering Algorithm (CGCA) provides a natural interpretation combined with no need for assumptions regarding the number of clusters, making it an appealing choice. Moreover, in CGCA, internal optimization procedures point out the parameters influencing the size of clusters. Algorithms based on kernel density estimation can, therefore, be applied for diverse practical scenarios. Another very useful usage is outlier detection – which is especially important in the currently fast-growing data industry. The described algorithm has been validated in terms of both the speed of calculation and the quality of the obtained solution. The quality of the solution was evaluated with the use of eleven clustering indexes calculated on six data sets. In addition, the obtained result was compared with several classical well-known methods of clustering.},

In this paper, we address the critical drawbacks of crowdsourcing moderation actions in Q&amp;A communities and demonstrate the ability to automate moderation using the latest machine learning models. From a technical point, we propose a multi-view approach that generates three distinct feature groups that examine a question from three different perspectives: 1) question-related features extracted using a BERT-based regression model; 2) context-related features extracted using a named-entity-recognition model; and 3) general lexical features derived using statistical and analytical methods. As a last step, we train a gradient boosting classifier to predict a moderation action. For evaluation purposes, we created a new dataset consisting of 60,000 Stack Overflow questions classified into three choices of moderation actions. Based on cross-validation on the novel dataset, our approach reaches 95.6\% accuracy as a multiclass task and outperforms all state-of-the-art and previously-published models. Our results clearly demonstrate the high influence of our feature generation components on the overall success of the classifier.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed unprecedented success achieved by deep learning models in the field of computer vision . However, their vulnerability towards carefully-crafted adversarial examples has also attracted the increasing attention of researchers. Motivated by the observation that adversarial examples are due to the non-robust feature learned from the original dataset by models, we propose the concepts of salient feature (SF) and trivial feature (TF). The former represents the class-related feature, while the latter is usually adopted to mislead the model. We extract these two features with coupled generative adversarial network model and put forward a novel detection and defense method named salient feature extractor (SFE) to defend against adversarial attacks . Concretely, detection is realized by separating and comparing the difference between SF and TF of the input. At the same time, correct labels are obtained by re-identifying SF. Extensive experiments are carried out on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets where SFE shows superior results in effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretable understanding of the defense and detection process. The code of SFE could be downloaded from ( https://github.com/haibinzheng/SFE ).},

First, a CN partitioning method is employed to divide the CN into multiple chunks to improve the efficiency in terms of space and time complexities. Next, the method is integrated with two optimization algorithms : (1) backpropagation (BP), which optimizes deep learning locally within each local chunk of the CN; (2) particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is used to improve the BP optimization involving all CN chunks. PSO utilizes a multi-objective function to improve the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, a distributed environment is set up to conduct parallel optimization of the proposed method so that multi-local optimizations could be performed simultaneously. A set of 16 real-world CNs in a range from small to large size are used to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the method in a benchmark study. The proposed method is implemented in multi-machines with central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) devices. The results reveal the effective role of the proposed deep learning with hybrid BP–PSO optimization in detecting communities in large CNs, which requires minimum execution time on both CPU and GPU devices.},

The majority of research on this topic has been devoted to constructing syntax-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for context feature vectors. These approaches perform poorly in terms of node representation and capturing long-distance dependency. In this paper, we focus on the ability of graph convolution and propose an aggregated graph convolutional network (AGCN) to enhance the representation ability of target nodes . To exploit the node feature information, we introduce two aggregator functions to iteratively update the representation of each node from its local neighborhood. To extract more associated node information, we also apply the subdependency of nodes to aggregate the node features, and then employ the attention mechanism to capture the sentiment dependencies between different node feature information. The proposed AGCN is evaluated on large Chinese and English datasets to prove the effect of our model in aspect-based sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that our model is valid compared with other GCN-based methods.},

The key generator center issues all users’ secret keys and can decrypt each ciphertext by calculating the corresponding secret key. Besides, applying CP-ABE in data sharing environment also brings another challenging problem which is users’ revocation . To resolve the above issues, we provide a key escrow-free CP-ABE scheme with the user revocation , which withstands collusion attack between malicious users and revoked users. In our scheme, a secret key is calculated utilizing a secure key issuing protocol between key authority (KA) and data user (DU). KA is unable to obtain DU’s secret value and generate the complete secret key independently, which solves the key escrow issue. When a user revokes from the system, the secret keys of the unrevoked users require to be updated. We introduce a group manager (GM) to update the unrevoked users’ group secret keys and generate a re-encryption key. The re-encryption technology is applied to prevent the revoked users from decrypting ciphertexts. Moreover, the decryption cloud server provider (D-CSP) executes most of decryption operations to decrease computation costs. The performance analysis indicates that our scheme is practical and efficient. The security of the presented scheme is reduced to divisible computable Diffie-Hellman (DCDH) assumption.},

In this study, we propose a field-aware attentive neural factorization machine (FAFM) model for large-scale data-driven company investment valuation. The proposed FAFM model utilizes the advantage of factorization machine (FM) to efficiently capture nonlinear feature interactions in a sparse dataset. We additionally consider field heterogeneity among features with fuzzy mutual information and develop an attention neural network to learn predictive strengths of pair-wise feature interactions. FAFM contributes to the literature by overcoming the limitation of FM that ignores field heterogeneity by factorizing pair-wise feature interactions with same weight. Further more, FAFM learns the prediction strengths in a stratified manner by using the attention deep learning mechanism, which demonstrates more structured control ability and allows for more leverage in tweaking the interactions in the feature-wise level. Experiments are conducted on a unique real dataset set consisting of 3,500 listed companies in the Chinese market with features from eight fields: demographics, annual reports, stock financial disclosure, land use, intellectual property, tax, bond financing, and certification. Results showed the superiority of FAFM on prediction accuracy and model interpretability over existing baselines. Our study provides a useful tool for company investment valuation that can not only generate accurate investment valuations but also provide interpretations of both individual features and their pair-wise interactions effects, thereby allowing investors better investment decisions.},

Shoeprints collected in real-world scenarios are normally unclear, abrasive, and lack contextual and other kinds of missing information. In this research, we apply a novel deep learning technique called restorable inpainting to repair shoeprint contours and missing parts. Existing inpainting methods aim to fill artificially occluded areas with plausible pixels, but these methods may not restore missing information for occlusions in shoeprint images. In addition, because no ground-truth shoeprints exist for training samples, inpainting occluded regions becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose DeepShoePaint, a novel deep learning approach to perform restorable in paint ing by restoring synthetic information resembling desirable shoe print images necessary for forensics. DeepShoePaint novelly adapts a probabilistic distribution borrowed from the variational autoencoder into a U-Net-like structure forming a unified architecture trained in an unsupervised fashion to restore occluded and masked regions to produce human-verifiable shoeprints. The experimental results reveal that DeepShoePaint achieves outstanding human inspection and statistical assessment results and outperforms conventional inpainting models. We believe that this study can provide valuable insights, not limited to inpainting, into restoring desirable shoeprints to automate and facilitate the forensic investigation and examination process instead of using handcrafted methods.},

In practice, the number of categories in the target domain is often less than that in the source domain. In this work, we focus on a more practical and challenging task that recognizes RGB data by learning from RGB-D data under an unequal label scenario, which suffers from three challenges: i) the addition of depth information, ii) the domain mismatch problem and iii) the negative transfer caused by unequal label numbers. Our main contribution is a novel method, referred to as unequal Distribution Visual-Depth Adaption (uDVDA), which takes advantage of depth data and handles domain mismatch problem under label inequality, simultaneously. Experiments show that uDVDA outperforms state-of-the-art models on different datasets, especially under unequal label scenario.},

How to discovery the deep relevant knowledge from the massive graph-structured data has become a hot spot of artificial intelligence. Considering that some predicates in knowledge graph express fuzzy relationships whose semantics are not certain, the basic schema of classical knowledge graph in the form of RDF triple cannot describe the fuzzy semantic information effectively. To counter above problems, in this paper, we present a new semantic representation and reasoning model for multiple associative predicates by introducing fuzzy theory. Concretely, the presented method defines a new fuzzy annotating strategy to represent the fuzzy semantics between associative predicates in different RDF triples. On this basis, some fuzzy reasoning rules are presented to realize fuzzy semantic extension for classical knowledge graph. Lastly, the experimental results show that our proposal can discover more implicit valid knowledge with fuzzy semantic and have a good consistency with the intuition of human judgments. Overall, the methods proposed in this paper constitute some effective ways of knowledge discovery of structured semantic data.},

Thus, computing depth-first search (DFS) results (i.e., depth-first order or DFS-Tree) on the semi-external memory model is important to investigate. Semi-external algorithms assume that the primary memory can at least hold a spanning tree T of a graph G and gradually restructure T into a DFS-Tree, which is nontrivial. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study for the semi-external DFS problem. Based on a theoretical analysis of this problem, we introduce a new semi-external DFS algorithm called EP-DFS with a lightweight index N + N+ - index . Unlike traditional algorithms, we focus on addressing such a complex problem efficiently with fewer I/Os, simpler CPU calculations (implementation-friendly), and less random I/O accesses (key-to-efficiency). Extensive experimental evaluations are performed on both synthetic and real graphs, and experimental results confirm that the proposed EP-DFS algorithm markedly outperforms existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Limited by the shallow structure, broad learning system (BLS) suffers from the high-dimensional data classification difficulty. To this end, the cascade of the convolutional feature mappings and enhancement mappings broad learning system (CCFEBLS) framework is proposed from the perspective of representation learning in this article. Firstly, convolution kernels are exploited to construct the convolutional feature nodes and enhancement nodes instead of using sparse auto-enocder or linear combination in the BLS. Secondly, we design a novel broad and deep architecture which cascades the feature mappings and enhancement mappings as the broad and deep representations to connect the output directly for the CCFEBLS framework. This architecture utilizes all representations thoroughly and improves the representation learning capability. Moreover, to boost the robustness of the CCFEBLS, the weighted hyper-parameters and the group regularization are developed to adjust the broad and deep representations and require the group output directly approximate the label, respectively. And the experimental results on several synthetic and real world datasets have demonstrated that CCFEBLS models outperform the baselines with better performance, less parameters and training time, which are validated to be consistent with the model design and analysis.},

  abstract     = {An effective C ommunity S coring F unction (CSF) is very important since it can properly quantify the community quality of the node groups and help us to effectively discover valuable network communities. Currently, researchers have proposed many types of CSFs. However, none of them are based on an experimental and theoretical analysis of the node groups with different scales and community qualities. This may significantly weaken their effectiveness. Besides, there are few experiments to comprehensively analyze the effectiveness of the existing CSFs. In this paper, we try to make up for these shortcomings. We analyze the node groups with different scales and community qualities in real-world networks, and find effective functions to measure internal and external connection densities of the groups. We then obtain a novel and robust CSF called ECOQUG by effectively combining two kinds of functions that we determined. We design extensive experiments to contrast the performance of ECOQUG with 13 commonly used CSFs. The final experiments show that ECOQUG performs best among them, which demonstrates its reliability. Furthermore, in order to further demonstrate the necessity and significance of an effective CSF, we optimize the TCE algorithm by applying ECOQUG and an improved expansion method, and produce a new L ocal C ommunity D etection (LCD) algorithm called Max-ECOQUG . We compare Max-ECOQUG with TCE and other better designed LCD algorithms with different CSFs. The results show that the CSF has a greater impact on the performance of LCD algorithms than the design method, and an effective CSF is necessary and significant.},

The proposed virtual function nodes added between the variable nodes of the subgraphs of the AP factor graphs (i.e., individual views), enable the core of MVCPMM to pass mutually supervised smooth messages across different views and subsequently exchange the messages within individual views in a mutually supervised manner to encourage the clustering quality of individual views. In addition to maintaining the cluster diversity of individual views, MVCPMM penalizes the changes in the cluster structures of different views by using mutually supervised smooth messages as bidirectional cross-view messages, which can effectively improve the consensus of exemplars across different views. Experimental results on both synthetic and benchmark multi-view datasets demonstrate the superiority of MVCPMM in contrast to several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods in terms of both clustering performance and clustering consistency across different views.},

In this paper, we propose a dictionarybased transfer learning with Universum data method, named U-DTL. In the proposed method, we first introduce the Universum data into the proposed model by the ∊ -insensitive loss. We then embed two dictionaries for the source and target domains into a new model, and put forward the similarity constraint for dictionaries between both domains to determine the relationship among samples of source and target domains. Further, we use the gradient-based optimization and SVD algorithm to alternately optimize and update the dictionaries, and utilize Lagrangian function to iteratively optimize the proposed U-DTL model to obtain the classifier. Finally, the statistic result of Wilcoxon-test has shown that the proposed U-DTL method has the better performance than previous methods. And we have conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed U-DTL method and baselines.

  abstract     = {This research arises from the need to predict the amount of air pollutants in meteorological stations. Air pollution depends on the location of the stations (weather conditions and activities in the surroundings). Frequently, the surrounding information is not considered in the learning process. This information is known beforehand in the absence of unobserved weather conditions and remains constant for the same station. Considering the surrounding information as side information facilitates the generalization for predicting pollutants in new stations, leading to a zero-shot regression scenario. Available methods in zero-shot typically lean towards classificat and are not easily extensible to regression. This paper proposes two zero-shot methods for regression. The first method is a similarity based approach that learns models from features and aggregates them using side information. However, potential knowledge of the feature models may be lost in the aggregation. The second method overcomes this drawback by replacing the aggregation procedure and learning the correspondence between side information and feature-induced models, instead. Both proposals are compared with a baseline procedure using artificial datasets, UCI repository communities and crime datasets, and the pollutants. Both approaches outperform the baseline method, but the parameter learning approach manifests its superiority over the similarity based method.},

  abstract     = {Short-term trajectory prediction (StTP) for individual metro passengers is of great importance in intelligent transportation systems and real-time security risk management . Existing research efforts still have shortcomings in constructing an interpretable StTP model with limited historical trajectory data for individual metro passengers. This paper thus intends to enhance the existing StTP methods in two aspects: (1) encoding the trajectory sequences with universal and personalized mobility rules to explain the mobility patterns of metro passengers, and (2) constructing an interpretable StTP model with adaptive location-awareness to improve the prediction accuracy. Along this line, this study develops a novel framework for individual metro passengers by integrating diverse mobility patterns with adaptive location-awareness (StTP-ML). Particularly, a trajectory representation approach is proposed to process the observed Wi-Fi probe data and transfer them into structured trajectories. Then, the diverse mobility patterns of individual passengers are discovered, including temporal periodicity, spatial symmetry, and sequence correlation. Finally, an adaptive location-aware model integrated with individual diverse mobility patterns-priority strategy is constructed. To evaluate the proposed StTP-ML model, this research also conducts experiments on real-world passenger trajectory data at a busy metro station in Shanghai, China. The experimental results show that the average accuracy rate of the StTP-ML-E model is improved up to 84\%, which outperforms all other baseline models in the test. It demonstrates that the proposed StTP-ML model can integrate more interpretable mobility patterns than the baseline models and provide more accurate trajectories for individual metro passengers in future time periods.},

  abstract     = {At present, some researchers have studied the decision-making methods in a fuzzy β β -covering approximation space, which not only can play the advantages of rough set theory in dealing with inaccurate data, but also inherit the ranking function of traditional decision-making methods. However, these methods merely consider the ranking problem in a single decision-maker environment and most of the decision-making problems in reality are group decision-making problems that need to consider multiple opinions. In light of this, in this paper, we propose the concept of fuzzy β β -covering group approximation spaces and establish a three-way multi-criteria group decision-making method, which can solve some ranking and classification problems of objects under a group decision-making environment. Based on a fuzzy β β -covering group approximation space, we firstly propose two fuzzy β β -fitting neighborhoods with pessimistic and optimistic attitudes to construct a fuzzy binary relation between any two objects. Secondly, we introduce an overall loss function to estimate the risk loss of all objects when they choose different behaviors in different states under a group decision-making environment. Subsequently, based on the conditional probability estimation formula and the overall loss function, we propose a three-way group decision-making idea in a fuzzy β β -covering group approximation space, which contains eight different decision-making attitudes to meet the preferences of decision-makers. Furthermore, for the ranking and classification performance of our method, we use numerical analysis , comparative analysis and Spearman analysis to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of the method, and take experimental analysis to test the stability of our method.},

Past research had the aim to improve process discovery algorithms irrespective of the characteristics of the input log. In this paper, we take a step back and investigate the connection between measures capturing characteristics of the input event log and the quality of the discovered process models. To this end, we review the state-of-the-art process complexity measures, propose a new process complexity measure based on graph entropy, and analyze this set of complexity measures on an extensive collection of event logs and corresponding automatically discovered process models. Our analysis shows that many process complexity measures correlate with the quality of the discovered process models, demonstrating the potential of using complexity measures as predictors of process model quality. This finding is important for process mining research, as it highlights that not only algorithms, but also connections between input data and output quality should be studied.},

However, a video often contains many redundant and irrelevant frames. How to reduce redundancy and complexity of the available information and extract the most relevant information to facial expression in video sequences is a challenging task. In this paper, we divide a video into several short clips for processing and propose a clip-aware emotion-rich feature learning network (CEFLNet) for robust video-based FER. Our proposed CEFLNet identifies the emotional intensity expressed in each short clip in a video and obtains clip-aware emotion-rich representations. Specifically, CEFLNet constructs a clip-based feature encoder (CFE) with two-cascaded self-attention and local–global relation learning, aiming to encode clip-based spatio-temporal features from the clips of a video. An emotional intensity activation network (EIAN) is devised to generate emotional activation maps for locating the salient emotion clips and obtaining clip-aware emotion-rich representations, which are used for expression classification. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed CEFLNet are evaluated using four public facial expression video datasets, including BU-3DFE, MMI, AFEW, and DFEW. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed CEFLNet in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Then, two types of output-feedback time-varying formation controllers are presented based on different formation feasible conditions. By theoretical analysis, the estimation error of event-triggered state compensator is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded and the event-triggered mechanisms prevent Zeno behavior, and the formation tracking errors converge to the small region of zero.

Accordingly, the high-dimensional coupling clustering of product components is performed through a two-dimensional (2D) plane mapping with a design structure matrix (DSM) that aims at the entire product life cycle (PLC). A random chance-constrained programming model for the performance balance optimization of product structures is developed, where the fuzzy expert evaluation is considered to include heterogeneous uncertainties, and an integrated multi-objective discrete cuckoo algorithm nested with Monte Carlo simulation is designed to solve the model.

This work proposes a hybrid model to overcome these issues that need to be resolved, namely EEMD-GRU-TWSVRCSSA. The proposed model utilizes twin support vector regression (TWSVR) to overcome the shortcomings of the SVR in terms of training time and fitting accuracy. A novel meta -heuristic algorithm, cloud salp swarm algorithm (CSSA), is employed to automatically select the optimal hyper parameters for the TWSVR. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) reduces the influences of hidden noise in the input data, meanwhile splitting the high-frequency and low-frequency sub-datasets and feeding them to the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and TWSVR-based model, respectively. The forecasting of the proposed algorithm and other alternative algorithms are conducted on three real-world electric load datasets from the National Electricity Market (NEM), Queensland and New South Wales regions, Australia, and the well-known National Grid UK.

  abstract     = {Network intrusion detection is one of the most important components of mobile networks security . In recent years, the application of neural networks has been very popular in network intrusion detection . However, due to limited resources of IoT devices, fast detection of the intrusion requires a high accuracy neural network with a lightweight and efficient architecture. Therefore, the conventional architectures of neural networks are not suitable for intrusion detection in IoT devices due to the use of a large number of parameters in these models concerning the limited processing resources in IoT devices. This paper presents a new and lightweight architecture based on Parallel Deep Auto-Encoder (PDAE) that uses both locally and surrounding information around individual values in the feature vector. This type of separation of features allows us to increase the accuracy of the model while greatly reducing the number of parameters, memory footprint , and the need for processing power. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using KDDCup99, CICIDS2017, and UNSW-NB15 datasets and the results shows the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both accuracy and performance.},

  abstract     = {Both regularized multi-task learning (RMTL) and direct multi-task twin support vector machine (DMTSVM) have shown good performances in dealing with multi-task problems. They all use hyperplanes to realize classification. However, the hyperplane cannot reflect the distribution of data well. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-task twin hypersphere support vector machine (MTTHSVM) to solve multi-task classification problems. It will generate two hyperspheres rather than hyperplanes for each task. So, the proposed method could better describe the distribution information of all training samples compared with the existing RMTL and DMTSVM. Based on Hierarchical Bayes theory, MTTHSVM divides the center of each hypersphere into task-specific and task-common parts to better measure the commonality and individuality of tasks. Then the shared information contained in multiple related tasks could be adaptively mined well. Therefore, the prediction accuracy will be improved to some extent. Besides, MTTHSVM is superior to RMTL and DMTSVM in terms of computational efficiency. This is because our MTTHSVM just solves two smaller-sized quadratic programming problems without any matrix inverse operations. Experimental results on one artificial data set, thirty-five benchmark data sets and a real image data set Cifar100 have verified the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Recently, visual trackers based on region proposal networks (RPN) have attracted widespread attention due to their relatively high efficiency and excellent performance. RPN-based trackers mainly combine a classification branch and a regression branch to predict a target’s state. These branches are all under the guidance of pre-defined anchor boxes . RPN-based trackers, however, first compute the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between the anchor boxes and ground truth boxes, and then use a fixed IoU threshold to separate negative and positive training samples. The limit of this design lies in the fact that these trackers lack an analysis of the actual content of the intersecting regions, which may include distractor objects or few meaningful regions of the tracked target. In this research, we propose a probabilistic anchor assignment with region proposal network (PaaRPN) that can adaptively separate anchors into negative samples and positive samples according to the model’s current learning status. To this end, we first calculate the classification scores of the anchor boxes conditioned on the current model and fit a probability distribution to the classification scores. The whole tracking model is then trained with anchor boxes separated into negative and positive samples in a probabilistic manner. Moreover, we introduce an online learning method in the PaaRPN framework that enables the model to have powerful discriminative abilities by exploiting both background and target appearance information. We tested the PaaRPN tracker on six tracking benchmarks to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, our model outperforms a strong RPN tracker, SiamRPN++, with AUC scores improvements of 0.613 → → 0.657 and 0.496 → → 0.565 on UAV123 and LaSOT, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The theory of three-way decisions, as a powerful methodology of granular computing, has been widely used in making decision under uncertainty environments. Decision tasks in incomplete hybrid data including heterogeneous and missing features are of abundance in realistic situations. To deal with these tasks, some work based on three-way decisions has been investigated. However, the losses used for evaluating objects are precise real numbers, which makes these decision models have some limitations in applications when there exist missing values in incomplete hybrid data. Thus, this paper constructs a generalized three-way neighborhood decision model by assigning the interval-valued loss function to each object and further adopting an average strategy to integrate the interval-valued loss functions of objects in each data-driven neighborhood class. Moreover, considering that the objects and attributes of incomplete hybrid data will simultaneously change over time, this paper also provides an efficient framework to dynamically maintain three-way regions of the proposed model. An approach based on matrix to compute the three-way regions is first presented by introducing the matrix operations and the matrix forms of related concepts. Then, with the simultaneous variation of objects and attributes, the matrix-based incremental mechanism and algorithm are proposed for updating the three-way regions, respectively. Experimental results on nine datasets indicate that the proposed incremental algorithm can effectively improve the computational performance for evolving data in comparison with the static algorithm.},

In this paper, we use the sentiment (polarity) score to improve the stocks forecasting. We apply the BERT model to determine the score associated to various events (both positive and negative) that have affected some stocks in the market. The sentences used to determine the scores are newspaper articles published on MilanoFinanza. We compute both the average sentiment score and the polarity, and we use a Monte Carlo method to generate (starting from the day the article was released) a series of possible paths for the next trading days, exploiting the Bayesian inference to determine a new series of bounded drift and volatility values on the basis of the score; thus, returning an exact “directed” price as a result.},

To address this issue, this work proposes a fuzzy constraint handling technique, which uses the fuzzy set theory to accurately characterize the difference between solutions on objective function values and constraint violation degrees. On this basis, a new concept, called “fuzzy advantage”, is introduced to comprehensively quantify the degree to which one solution is better than others, allowing the infeasible solutions with promising fitness to survive. The proposed method is integrated with a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to verify its effectiveness. Compared with nine state-of-the-art MOEAs on a number of test problems and a real-world optimization problem , the proposed algorithm shows high competitiveness in solving a variety of CMOPs.},

However, a systematic understanding and process of leveraging SNPs to address control issues in discrete event systems are still lacking. This paper extends a type of SNP formalization, called vector-SNP, to explore the system’s intrinsic stability properties without configuration attention by introducing two classes of structural feature vectors: N -invariants and R -invariants. Then, a typical style of specifications, namely neuron mutual exclusion inequality constraints (NMEICS), is advanced for supervisory control using SNPs. An NMEIC is enforced by explicitly adding a supervisor (group of observation and control monitors represented by SNPs) to an SNP system. On top of that, the supervisor construct algorithm that utilizes the linear algebraic calculations is established to obtain the supervisors for pre-designed control constraints. Finally, we evaluate the proposed supervisory control theory using SNPs on an automated manufacturing system. Experimental results achieve maximally permissive controlled behaviors that reserve all feasible legal states.},

In social networks, while considering user content interests, first, a fusion user embedding method was developed by incorporating external knowledge semantics. Second, for a user pair, we calculate their direct similar relationship using fusion user embeddings. Additionally, based on intermediate neighbors, we compute their indirect similar relationship by using an attention mechanism , which explains neighbors’ bootable and transitive influences for learning the social relationship of user pairs. Then, a hybrid personalized and neighbor attention model for friend link prediction was proposed by considering direct and indirect factors. Finally, experiments were conducted on the Sina Weibo datasets, which indicates that the proposed method effectively predicts the friends of users and provides a good interpretation for link prediction recommendation results.},

  abstract     = {During the past decades, semi-supervised learning in classification has been regarded as one of the most active research area due to the increasing physical demand. Generally, the semi-supervised learning model believes the unlabeled data could potential be helpful to achieve higher performance as long as scare labeled samples under either cluster assumption or manifold assumption. However, most of the semi-supervised classifiers directly incorporate all the unlabeled data without any selective admission, which contains unfavorable features and noise diminishing performance while resulting in inability to large-scale data. In this paper, we propose a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm named GSB 2 LS within Bayesian framework for classification. The algorithm can explore unlabeled data effectively by adopting the compound prior that consists of unlabeled manifold information and sparse Bayesian inference to the broad structure. In particular, GSB 2 LS takes advantage of the broad structure to search for more potential associations of features, the manifold regularization to capture beneficial interdependence of unlabeled samples, the Bayesian framework to maintain the universal sparsity, the fast marginal likelihood maximization to update the relevance set based on the defined contribution, which leads to the feasibility to process large-scale data in the inductive way. Moreover, the algorithm is capable of outputting the probabilistic estimation of prediction for further decision analysis. Extensive empirical results verifies the excellent performance of our algorithm with clearly superior efficiency and generalization compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised classifiers.},

This study develops a powerful classifier algorithm that provides an alternative solution to kernel experiments with the choice of a general-purpose, fast, automatic linear kernel. Principally based on SVM , k-means clustering in partitions is used, and logistic regression is integrated into the ensemble system. To increase the success rate and deal with the maximum convergence problem , the soft margin value of the standard SVM is changed in an adaptive structure. In the experiments, it has been observed that accuracy performance showed an improvement of (1–8)\%, even when the optimal k value in the k-means clustering stage of the proposed ensemble methodology has been compared to the best in other kernels measurements.

A bounded linear ETC is firstly designed, where the time-varying control gain is only scheduled on a specified time determined by an event-triggered mechanism, such that the FTS of the closed-loop system is achieved and the communication resources are saved. Moreover, the corresponding STC, in which the updates of control law are determined by a self-triggered mechanism that only needs to monitor the previous triggered states, is designed. Specially, by exploring the properties of the parametric Lyapunov equation , the designable minimal inter-event time of the established ETC and STC is obtained, such that the Zeno phenomenon is avoided. In addition, the finite-time semi-global stabilization and the fixed-time (prescribed finite-time) stabilization of linear systems are achieved by bounded ETC and STC. What needs to be emphasized is that the finite-time stabilization in this paper can be called as the practical finite-time stabilization since the state converges to zero exponentially with a fast convergence rate after a designable time. Finally, the established algorithms are used to the design of the spacecraft rendezvous control system and their effectiveness is verified by simulations.},

In this regard, Deep Learning (DL) based gait recognition has emerged as an unobtrusive subfield of cyborg intelligence for the purpose of human identification and authentication. Real-world gait data are usually aggregated freely without knowing the time, place, or style of human walks implying many uncertainties that negatively impact the performance of DL models. This study presents a new fuzzy-based temporal convolutional autoencoder framework (termed FTCAE), which is created for gait recognition from inertial gait time series. The former part is introduced to bring together the capability of an autoencoder and temporal convolutions to automatically extract valuable information from the inertial data representing complex and dynamic gait patterns. Besides, a novel interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) dense layer is introduced to handle uncertainties, imprecisions, and noises of feature maps, hence enabling the learning of curious representations in fuzzy latent space. The IT2FS introduces a local feedback mechanism to empower the network capabilities for modeling uncertainty in temporal dependencies in human gait data. Proof of concept experimentation on public gait sensory datasets validates the efficiency of the proposed FTCAE with accuracies of 98.48\% and 95.11\% for authentication and identification, respectively.},

Typically, regularization is needed to address issues such as overfitting and interpretability, especially for collaborative filtering where the rating matrices are sparse. However, the existing regularizers are typically constructed from the factorization results instead of the rating matrices. Intuitively, we regard these existing regularizers as representing either user factors or item factors and anticipate that a more holistic regularizer could improve the effectiveness of NMF. To this end, we propose a graph regularizer based on a linear projection of the rating matrix, and call the resulting method: Linear Projection and Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LPGNMF). We develop two iterative methods to minimize the cost function and derive two update rules named LPGNMF and F-LPGNMF. Additionally, we prove the value of the objective function decreases with LPGNMF and converges to a fixed point with F-LPGNMF. Finally, we test these methods against a number of NMF algorithms on different data sets and show both LPGNMF and F-LPGNMF always achieve smaller errors based on two different error measures.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the memory mechanism has been widely implemented in target tracking. However, these trackers hardly balance the stability of long-term memory with the plasticity of short-term memory through an elegant and efficient mechanism. A residual memory inference network (RMIT) is proposed to exploit the history of target states and last visual features. Specifically, RMIT consists of a base layer and a residual memory layer by synergizing short-and long-term memories. The base layer can be regarded as Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) reformulation that maintains the short-term memory to accommodate rapid appearance changes. The residual memory layer can extend residual learning from the spatial domain to the Spatio-temporal domain via ConvLSTM to obtain long-term memory of the target appearance. To avoid model degradation due to sample imbalance, we introduce a weighted gradient harmonized loss to improve the discrimination of the tracker. Then, response scores can be served as a basis of the adaptive learning strategy to ensure the reliability of memory updates. The proposed method performs favorably and has been extensively validated on six benchmark datasets, including OTB-50/100, TC-128, UAV-123, and VOT-2016/2018 against several advanced methods.},

Their uses include eliminating redundant information when describing an object contained in this information and inducing different types of fuzzy β β -neighborhoods. Currently, various operators (such as approximation operators, positive domain operators, and dependency functions) induced by fuzzy β β -neighborhoods are commonly used to deal with attribute reduction problems. Essentially, β β -FMiD and β β -FMaD are the basis of the existing methods. Hence, it is necessary to use β β -FMiD and β β -FMaD directly to solve attribute reduction , which will simplify the calculations and improve the redundancy rate. However, it is time-consuming and error-prone when employing the existing methods to calculate β β -FMiD and β β -FMaD. To solve this problem, novel matrix approaches of β β -FMiD and β β -FMaD are proposed, which are applied to two categories of reductions and to the issue of multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) in this research. One approach is the correction and improvement of the existing method; the other is a novel method by using the matrix representation of fuzzy β β -covering directly and the binary relation of inclusion between elements in the fuzzy β β -covering. In addition, four classifications of fuzzy β β -neighborhood operators are calculated by the matrix representations of β β -FMiD and β β -FMaD. Two new categories of reductions of fuzzy β β -covering information systems ( β β -FcISs) are also proposed via β β -FMiD and β β -FMaD, respectively. These two types of reductions are calculated via matrices and applied to the problem of MCGDM to eliminate fuzzy granular structures, which are not needed to reach a decision in MCGDM. Finally, several experimental comparisons are posited to show the computational efficiency of the proposed approaches on nine UCI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested methods are promising and comparable to other designs.},

In this paper, we present an efficient and effective approach to find a global optimal value of MARS models that incorporate two-way interaction terms which are products of truncated linear univariate functions (TITL-MARS). Specifically, with a MARS model consisting of linear and quadratic structures, we can reformulate the optimization problem on TITL-MARS into a mixed integer quadratic programming problem (TITL-MARS-OPT), which can be further solved in a more principled way. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach TITL-MARS-OPT, we come up with a genetic algorithm and a gradient descent algorithm to solve the original version of TITL-MARS, and we compared the performance of the proposed approach with the benchmark algorithms. Numerical experiments are conducted on a spectrum of examples with different levels of complexity, including 6 existing models and a real world application in the wind farm optimization. Our proposed approach can find a global optimal successfully and efficiently while the comparison algorithms fail to find a global optimal solution.

Simultaneously, a target attention mechanism (TAM) is applied into a context layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which increases the effect of the relationship matrix weights of two entities in the sentence, while ignoring the calculation of irrelevant terms. And the TACNN is essentially to modify the weight of the relationship matrix of entities in the sentence at the context layer and connect the relationship feature composed of the lexical layer feature with the target attention layer feature. Therefore, the TACNN simplifies the structure of the CNN and improves the computational efficiency. On SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset and Conll04 dataset, the TACNN obtains 85.3\% and 71.4\% of the F1-score, respectively.

  abstract     = {Multi-label classification has attracted much attention in the machine learning community to address the problem of assigning single samples to more than one (not necessarily non-overlapping) class at the same time. We propose an evolving multi-label fuzzy classifier (EFC-ML) which is able to self-adapt and self-evolve its structure with new incoming multi-label samples in an incremental, single-pass manner. It is based on a multi-output Takagi–Sugeno type architecture, where for each class a separate consequent hyper-plane is defined, which yields flexibility for partially approximating the respective classes in a binary [0,1] -regression context. The learning procedure embeds a locally weighted incremental correlation-based algorithm combined with (conventional) recursive fuzzily weighted least squares and Lasso-based regularization . Locality is important to avoid the out-masking effect of single class labels in one or more rules; the correlation-based part ensures that the interrelations between class labels, a specific well-known property in multi-label classification for improved performance, are preserved properly; the Lasso-based regularization reduces the curse of dimensionality effects in the case of a higher number of inputs. Antecedent learning is achieved by product-space clustering and conducted for all class labels together, which yields a single rule base (opposed to related techniques such as one-versus-rest or classifier chaining, achieving multiple different rule bases, one per class), allowing a compact knowledge view and thus enabling better interpretable insights. Furthermore, our approach comes with an online active learning (AL) strategy for updating the classifier on just a (smaller) number of selected samples, which in turn makes the approach applicable for scarcely labelled streams in applications, where the annotation effort is typically expensive. It is based on three essential concepts: novelty content in the antecedent space, uncertainty due to ambiguity in the consequent (output) space and parameter instability reduction , and these in combination with an upper-allowed selection budget (which could be predefined by a user). Our approach was evaluated on several data sets from the MULAN repository and showed significantly improved classification accuracy and average precision trend lines compared to (evolving) one-versus-rest or classifier chaining concepts. A significant result was that, due to the online AL method, a 90\% reduction in the number of samples used for classifier updates had little effect on the accumulated accuracy trend lines compared to a full update in most data set cases.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) has become an increasingly relevant problem in intelligent education services, which estimates and traces the degree of learner’s mastery of concepts based on students’ responses to learning resources. The existing mainstream KT models, only attribute learners’ feedback to the degree of knowledge mastery and leave the influence of mental ability factors out of consideration. Although ability is an essential component of the problem-solving process, these knowledge-centered models cause a contradiction between data fitting and rationalization of the model decision-making process, making it difficult to achieve high precision and readability simultaneously. In this paper, an innovative KT model, a bility b oosted k nowledge t racing (ABKT) 1 is proposed, which introduces the ability factor into learning feedback attribution to enable the model to analyze the learning process from two perspectives, knowledge and ability, simultaneously. Based on constructive learning theory, continuous matrix factorization (CMF) model is proposed to simulate the knowledge internalization process, following the initiative growth and stationarity principles. In addition, the linear graph latent ability (LGLA) model is proposed to construct learner and item latent ability features, from graph-structured learner interaction data. Then, the knowledge and ability dual-tracing framework is constructed to integrate the knowledge and ability modules. Experimental results on four public databases indicate that the proposed methods perform better than state-of-the-art knowledge tracing algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy in quantitative assessments , displaying some advantages in model interpretability and intelligibility.},

Based on multi-granularity computing with pertinent data and parameters, this study conducted a temporal-spatial three-way multi-granularity learning framework for dynamic text sentiment classification to continually address dynamic data uncertainty. It dynamically updated the proposed model with the evolving text using a sequential three-way sentiment classification. Under a temporal-spatial multi-granularity structure, this model gradually tackled uncertain samples in the boundary region according to the monotonous variation of coarser-to-finer granularity . Subsequently, this study combined a novel dynamic sentiment classification model with balancing the performances and costs by considering four benchmark models : fastText, TextCNN, TextRNN, and TextRCNN.

The outputs of followers are required to form two antagonistic prescribed time-varying subformations, one of which tracks the convex combination of the outputs of multiple leaders and the other tracks the symmetric convex combination . An independent asynchronous fully distributed event-triggered control protocol is formulated by using relative information between neighboring agents. It is shown that, with the formulated protocol, the bipartite time-varying output formation tracking can be achieved if the feasible formation condition is satisfied. The Zeno behavior is proved to be excluded. Then, we further construct a novel self-triggered control protocol to avoid continuous monitoring of estimate error. Since the protocol incorporates both event-triggered control and adaptive control , it efficiently avoids continuous communication among agents and can be implemented in a fully distributed manner. Moreover, it is noteworthy that in the case where relative information is available while absolute information is not, the protocol is applicable. Finally, the feasibility of the constructed protocols is verified by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-attacks can tamper with measurement data from physical systems via communication networks of smart grids, which could potentially lead circuit breakers to trip creating a false fault in the absence of any faulty section. Accordingly, a fault diagnosis method should first determine whether a fault is actually present; however, current diagnosis methods of power systems struggle to achieve this goal. This paper proposes a novel method for fault diagnosis based on memory spiking neural P systems , which can distinguish false faults caused by measurement tampering attacks. The proposed method consists of three modules with the functions of suspicious fault section detection, measurement tamper attack identification and fault diagnosis, respectively. The suspicious fault section detection module is used to find candidate sections to reduce the fault diagnosis scope. The attack identification module is designed to identify whether a possibly faulty section is under the measurement tampering attack or not. The fault diagnosis module is devised to diagnose true faults, detecting both the fault sections and their corresponding fault types. To achieve the above goals, inspired by the memory recall mechanism of human brains, a memory spiking neural P system and a corresponding general matrix reasoning algorithm are proposed, which can synthetically utilize the remote measurements and remote signals via a new modeling mechanism. Finally, case studies based on the IEEE 14 and IEEE 118 bus systems verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, it is challenging to build an accurate online estimation model for product quality because of complex process dynamics, multiple working conditions, and multi-rate characteristics. Therefore, a multimode mechanism-guided product quality variable estimation model is proposed in this study. First, representative features are extracted from high-dimensional and redundant process variables via both feature engineering and deep learning to describe the internal reaction state. Then, the representative features are used to partition the data samples which are used to train the multi-mode long short-term memory (LSTM) network to increase the adaptability of the estimation model. Finally, the LSTM units are cascaded to learn the variation in the quality variable against time to handle the multi-rate problem. The mechanism models are placed in parallel with the LSTM units to guide the learning process. The estimation model utilizes production data, mechanism knowledge and working condition information, which increases model interpretability and adaptability. A zinc fluidized bed roaster is used to illustrate the proposed estimation approach. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed multi-rate estimation approach.},

  abstract     = {DeepFakes are widespread on social networks, and they result in severe information concerns. Although various detection methods have been proposed, there are still practical limitations. Previous specific artifact-based methods were insufficient to capture fine-grained features, which limited their effectiveness against advanced DeepFakes. Current DNN-based detectors tend to trade high costs for performance improvement, and are not efficient enough, given that DeepFakes can be created easily by mobile apps, and DNN-based models require expensive computational resources. Furthermore, most methods lack generalizability under the cross-dataset scenario. In this work, we instead mine the more subtle and generalized defects of DeepFakes and propose the fused facial region _ feature descriptor (FFR _ FD) , which is only a vector of the discriminative feature description, for effective and fast DeepFake detection. We show that DeepFake faces have fewer feature points than real ones, especially in facial regions. FFR_FD capitalizes on such key observations, and thus has strong generalizability. We train a random forest classifier with FFR_FD to achieve efficient detection. Extensive experiments on six large-scale DeepFake datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our lightweight method. Our model generalizes well on the challenging Celeb-DF (v2) dataset, with 0.706 AUC, which is superior to most state-of-the-art methods.},

As a result, most existing level set methods yield poor performance when applied to these images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust variational level set method (RVLSM) based on adaptive diffusion mechanism and local cluster criterion, which can not only correct the severe inhomogeneous intensity but also denoise in segmentation. Specifically, we first define an adaptive-scale representation term using the proposed adaptive diffusion mechanism to transform the image data towards diffusion-induced space, which successfully restrains different types/levels of noise while enhancing image details. Then, a new bias field correction term is constructed via estimating the bias in transformed domain to better correct the severe inhomogeneous intensity while segmentation. Finally, an enhanced fourth-order piecewise polynomial penalty term is designed to eradicate numerical calculation instability and tedious re-initialization during the evolution of the level set. The experimental results on synthetic and real images with severe intensity inhomogeneity and high noise demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over most existing methods in both accuracy and robustness.},

Secondly, its clustering results are significantly influenced by human factors (controlling the cut-off distance parameter d c dc and selecting the clustering center manually). Finally, the local density ρ ρ is affected by parameter d c dc and cannot reflect the sparseness of the data distribution. To overcome these deficiencies, a novel density clustering algorithm , called NAPC , is proposed. First, a Divergence distance is defined to evaluate the similarity of points under the refined Euclidean distance space. Second, the specific value of d c dc is obtained based on the theory of Adjusted Boxplot. Then, the local density ρ ρ is reinterpreted based on the above Divergence distance and newly assigned d c dc . Finally, a judgement index is given to determine which points can be regarded as the center points in the Divergence distance space. The performance of our proposal is evaluated by comparing with several existing clustering methods on various datasets. Experimental results prove that NAPC performs much better than several comparison algorithms. It can identify clusters of various shapes and spatial dimensions with minimal human intervention.},

Firstly, HQExpert considers different semantic granularities by employing two models, a coarse-grained topic model LC-LDA and a fine-grained model (BERT), to capture the domain information of questions and users more accurately. Secondly, to address the diverse interests of the users, a user interest drift model in HQExpert is developed to dynamically represent the changes in the interests of the users at different periods. In addition, a user quality model is developed to further optimize the professional level of the user, finding experts who can provide high-quality answers and are interested in the current question.

Then, a corresponding multi-view deep neural network (MV-DNN) was developed to obtain knowledge in a multi-view way. Here, we firstly designed different view learning layers to obtain knowledge in corresponding views. Subsequently, to interact with the knowledge in different views, an information fusion layer was developed to fuse the acquired information. To face the challenge from imbalanced data distribution, the KS was set as evaluation metric to assist in training MV-DNN to improve the distinguishing ability for two classes of samples. The experimental results show compared with the MV-DNNs based on random and k-means multi-view strategies, and other advanced models, our method could provide optimal comprehensive performance and the most stable multi-view organizing results.

  abstract     = {For data analysis, learning treatment rules in stratified medicine require the optimization of multiple responses. A common approach is to use a multi-objective function to find the optimal setting of the controllable factors. For patients, the optimal setting is a treatment regimen that yields the optimal value of potential responses. However, subclasses of patients are often stratified by their covariates . Thus, this paper proposes a new model called constrained optimization for stratified treatment rules (COSTAR) with multiple responses. This model incorporates covariates to build separate models for optimal responses and stratifies the patients with the balancing score from covariates. The optimal solution enables us to choose the optimal treatment for each subclass of patients. Theoretical results guarantee the identifiability of the solutions with conditional optimal values of multiple responses from survival probabilities. Examples of experiments with factorial designs and survival data validate the efficacy of the proposed method. The results suggest that this method improves the significance of the parameters and the adjusted R 2 R2 in fitting on the primary response, while the unsupervised clustering method (i.e., k -means) does not. This method, with the fitting model, is more interpretable than the conventional method and provides optimal treatment rules for stratified patients.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a T wo-stage D ifferential E volution (TDE) with novel parameter control for real parameter single objective global optimization. In the TDE algorithm, the whole evolution is divided into two stages and each stage employs a unique mutation strategy. The mutation strategy in the first stage is a novel historical-solution based mutation strategy, which can get better perception of the landscape of the objective; the mutation strategy in the second stage is an inferior-solution based mutation strategy, which can maintain better diversity of trial vector candidates while keeping better convergence speed. Furthermore, the parameter control of our TDE is novel, which means that these adaptations of control parameters are different from those in the literature: First, the adaptation schemes both for scale factor F and crossover rate CR are fitness-independent. Second, different from the fixed population size and the gradually reduced population size, the population adaptation in TDE has two different stages. Third, a stagnation indicator is proposed and a population enhancement technique can be launched if necessary when a certain individual is in the stagnation status. We examine the TDE algorithm under a relative large number of benchmarks from CEC2013, CEC2014 and CEC2017 test suites for real-parameter single objective global optimization, and the experiment results show the competitiveness of our TDE algorithm with several recently proposed state-of-the-art DE variants, e.g. it obtained 20 similar or better performance improvements out of the total 30 benchmarks in comparison with the winner algorithm, the LSHADE algorithm, of the CEC2014 competition and it also obtained 19 similar or better performance improvements out of the total 30 benchmarks in comparison with the winner DE variant, the jSO algorithm, of the CEC2017 competition.},

  abstract     = {Information security and image encryption have rapidly developed in recent years. This study presents an iterative method for vectors with fractal characteristics. Based on the idea of combining fractal and algebraic theories, the double parameters fractal sorting vector (DPFSV) was originally proposed, which incorporates features such as complexity, self-similarity, and iteration. Based on the practical application requirements, the DPFSV has a good regulatory vector length and increases the diversity of information location change laws. Hence, this study uses the DPFSV to control iterative node relationships in spatiotemporal chaotic systems. The new spatiotemporal chaotic system proposed based on DPFSV exhibits better dynamics than that of the coupled map lattice (CML) system, verified by comparing their Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy, bifurcation diagram, information entropy, and mutual information. Therefore, DPFSV–CML is more suitable in cryptography than CML. Combining the DPFSV and spatiotemporal chaotic system, this study constructs a new cryptographic system to implement permutation–diffusion synchronous encryption. This new encryption method has a good encryption effect and is resistant to various attacks. The security of this proposed cryptographic system is verified through various security analyses and simulated attack validations.},

However, in traditional deep learning methods, the guidance of quality information on feature extraction is insufficient and easily reduces as data dimension increases. In this paper, a stacked maximal quality-driven autoencoder (SMQAE) is proposed to extract maximal quality-relevant features for soft analyzers. In each maximal quality-driven autoencoder , quality variables are reconstructed together with the input variables in the output layer. The SMQAE ensures that the influence of the quality part and input part on the reconstruction are the same. And the maximal information coefficient (MIC), which is not limited to any specific function type, is exploited to enhance the importance of quality-related variables in the input part. With the constraint of the quality equivalence strategy and variable importance evaluation based on MIC, the SMQAE maximizes the guidance of the quality variables during feature learning without the interference of the data dimensions. Therefore, the SMQAE can extract quality-relevant features for complex high-dimensional data. The rationality, superiority and robustness of SMQAE based soft analyzers are validated on four simulated scenarios and two industrial processes.},

In previous session-based recommender systems, users&#39; historical interactive behavior is utilized to train and update users&#39; preferences, but users&#39; responses to the current recommendation results (immediate feedback) are not effectively exploited to optimize the recommendation strategy. This leads to the decrease of subsequent recommendation accuracy. Aiming at this problem, based on the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), this paper combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We fully exploit the users’ immediate feedback with RL, and simultaneously take advantage of GAN to satisfy the requirement of training data brought by RL. Furthermore, we optimize the negative sampling method and propose Deep Generative Adversarial Networks-based Collaborative Filtering (DCFGAN).

In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of enumerating K dissimilar minimum cost bipartite matchings. We formalize this problem, prove that it is NP NP -hard, and present heuristics based on greedy dynamic programming . The presented enumeration techniques are not only interesting in themselves, but also mitigate an often overlooked shortcoming of bipartite data matching, namely, that it is sensitive w. r. t. the storage order of the input data. Extensive experiments show that our enumeration heuristics clearly outperform existing algorithms in terms of dissimilarity of the obtained matchings, that they are effective at rendering bipartite data matching approaches more robust w. r. t. random storage order, and that they significantly improve the upper bounds of state-of-the art algorithms for graph edit distance computation that are based on bipartite data matching.},

In this paper we propose neural logic rule layers ( NLRL ), which are able to represent arbitrary logic rules in terms of their conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms . Stacking various layers, we are theoretically able to represent arbitrary complex rules by the resulting neural network architecture. The NLRL are end-to-end trainable allowing to learn logic rules directly on the given data without needing any background information about the origin. We show in experiments, that NLRL -enhanced neural networks can model arithmetic and logical operations over the input values. Furthermore, we apply NLRL to image classification tasks and show that interpretability is provided without sacrificing classification performance by exchanging the fully-connected head of the network. We also apply NLRL to a real world industrial control problem where the task is to model the discrete control behaviour of a programmable logic controller ( PLC ), following a basic step sequence.},

Determined by two event-triggered conditions, the control and rest intervals of APETC are based on the present state of the system rather than being predetermined. In contrast to the conventional event-triggered control (ETC), the event-triggered conditions of APETC can not only judge the updates of control signals, but also dominate the actuation and close of the controller. Moreover, by introducing the sampling period into ETC, the number of event triggers can be decreased and the Zeno phenomenon is completely avoided. Subsequently, synchronization criteria for MNNs under APETC are established on the basis of Lyapunov method and graph theory. Finally, several numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.},

However, we find their system model is not applicable. A third authority generates the public key and secret key, which are used to encrypt and decrypt all the data sets. Then the privacy of data sets is in the risk of leakage even if the third authority is assumed to have no access to encrypted data sets. In this paper, we improve the system model in order to design a more practical linear regression algorithm over the rational numbers from the view of security. Concretely, every data owner generates his own public key and secret key, independent on a third authority. An improved multi-key fully homomorphic encryption over complex numbers is utilized to construct our linear regression algorithm with a preprocessing phase , which can directly encrypt rational numbers, support computations over ciphertexts under multi keys and obviate the rational reconstruction technique as Giacomelli et al..

  abstract     = {This study is mainly concerned with fuzzy integral sliding mode control (FISMC) design for double-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy system (WES) under membership function-dependent H ∞ H∞ approach. To do this, a nonlinear DFIG based WES is considered with exogenous load torque variation. Then, by utilizing Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy approach, the proposed nonlinear system can be expressed as a sum of local sub-models with the help of IF-THEN rules. A suitable FISMC is designed with a reaching law condition for the proposed DFIG-based WES with the disturbances. A new fuzzy-based Lyapunov function is constructed, and the H ∞ H∞ performance index is calculated for external disturbances under membership function-dependent H ∞ H∞ approach. The obtained performance index of membership function-dependent H ∞ H∞ approach can be improved 10\% than the conventional H ∞ H∞ approach. Finally, the simulation results are given the better stable performance of the DFIG-based WES under the designed FISMC, and the comparison results verify the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label datasets often contain label information with missing values and recovering them is a non-trivial challenge. Several methods augment the observed label matrix by constructing auxiliary labels and learning high order label correlations. Some other techniques exploit the low rank of the label matrix to capture a mix of label correlations. Both these approaches rely on label correlations, however in different ways. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that captures the label correlations utilizing both auxiliary label matrix and the low rank constraints on estimated labels. Our model also enforces maximal separation among different label subspaces for better label differentiation. The proposed method captures local and global correlations using L ow R ank label subspace transformation for M ulti-label learning with M issing L abels (LRMML). The model considers an auxiliary label matrix which facilitates the missing label information recovery. Low rank on predictions ensures that local label structures are captured and the maximal inter-label subspace separation helps identify discriminatory label correlations. The proposed method builds a multi-label classification model by solving a multivariate difference of convex objective function using surrogate optimization technique and alternating minimization. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art multi-label learning approaches.},

  abstract     = {Evolving classifiers and especially evolving fuzzy classifiers have been established as a prominent technique for addressing the recent demands in building classifiers in an incremental open-loop manner, e.g. for the purpose of processing data streams online. So far, the focus lies on classifiers which are obtained based on the input and/or feedback in the form of target labels provided by a single user/expert. In this paper, we propose three variants of evolving multi-user fuzzy classifier systems (EFCS-MU) , where multiple users may provide their label feedback: i) ensembled single-user classifiers system , which allows a separate classifier training per user and embeds an advanced aggregation strategy ( → → ensembling on a model level), ii) consensus all-user classifier system , where a joint classifier is established for all users based on consensus labelings ( → → ensembling on a label level), iii) shift-work all-user classifier system , where a joint classifier is established for all users based on the classical shift-work concept. The classifiers are incrementally evolved by a single-pass learning approach embedding the autonomous evolution of new rules on demand; it integrates an unsupervised evolving clustering technique for rule partitioning, thus the same partition is established in all single-user classifiers, only the consequents in the form of class confidence vectors typically differ among the users due to their different labelings. This offers direct explainability of the varying users’ annotation behaviors. The possible different experience levels of the users in relation to the process behind and possible ambiguities among the provided users’ labels are handled by the proper integration of uncertainty levels into the update of the classifier(s). Furthermore, a concept is presented as to how to adequately integrate possibly available expert rules for a particular newly (on-the-fly) arising class (or in advance for several classes). Finally, an on-line active learning (oAL) strategy is demonstrated, to select only the most important samples to be labelled and thus reduce users’ labeling costs, ensuring economically practicable applicability. The approach was successfully evaluated on two real-world application scenarios, one stemming for a visual inspection scenario, where four users check the quality of the imprint of compact discs and are affected by different experience levels, and one from a nursery school employment ranking application, where a new class was introduced later. The results provide insights into the performance behavior of the three different multi-user classifier variants under different circumstances (with and without expert rules, uncertainty integration, different labelling budgets etc.), including comparisons based on on-line accuracy trends versus the economy of the labeling effort.},

Cloud computing environment has high maintenance costs, therefore, the resources are limited; due to rapid progress and the highly demanded volume of utilization of resources, ascertaining an appropriate approach for controlling and managing resources has become essential in this area. Therefore, an algorithm must be designed to perform better in all QoS. A significant factor in current exploratory methods is that each method owns distinctive features and perhaps does not estimate all QoSes. For example, one specific method has low energy consumption but does not consider SLA violation. Concerning the aims of the present study, the granular model is designed which uses various criteria involved in computations; in practice, by entering the values given in the past and discovering the relationships among them, the most desirable classification is produced. The membership function and the inference rule are derived from the data provided by the actual workload.

The trade-off parameter λ in the optimization problem of YALL1 allows the recovery probability to be optimally tuned than the special case. Experimental results also show that the optimization problem of YALL1 (the Eq.

Unlike most existing fusion methods, the proposed method guarantees the consistency of fusion results without requiring system model parameters or adopting conservative strategies. First, a universal bijection is used to quantify the uncertainty in the estimates to be fused based on the entropy of the independent scalars. Second, the correlated errors caused by unknown mutual information and common process noise are treated as avoidable uncertainties. The avoidable uncertainty is then estimated by using a similarity function based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Finally, the avoidable uncertainty is separated from the fusion results by employing a conditional probability model to avoid correlated errors. This method is proven to be unbiased, consistent, and more accurate than the well-known covariance intersection method and the inverse covariance intersection method. The simulation results further verify the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the consistency, accuracy, and ability to limit cumulative errors in sequential fusion processes.},

These systems take advantage of various features, such as the ability of neurons to forget, the ability of neurons to create and remove synapses, and many others. Some variants of SN P systems are (1) SN P systems with Structural Plasticity, which include the ability to create and delete synapses, and (2) SN P systems with Rules on Synapses, which associates rules with synapses instead of with neurons. The main results of this work show that for SN P systems, having only one type of regular expression in the entire system is sufficient for universality. Moreover, for the two variants of SN P systems mentioned above, having a maximum of one rule per neuron and one regular expression in the system is sufficient for universality. For normal forms with such parameters, e.g. number of rules per neuron, types of regular expressions in the system, our universality results are optimal. We also show some optimisations on the types of neurons in a system, involving the removal of some unbounded neurons in favour of simpler and bounded neurons.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, tremendous information technology industries resort to cloud servers to store data with an outsourcing approach to extend their storage and computation power. This, however, also leads to privacy and security issues of unprotected data against curious cloud servers. The most common solution currently is to encrypt the data before uploading it. The problem is that encrypted data is out of control and users also cannot transfer the searching job to cloud serves anymore. Specifically, the order preserving encryption (OPE) provides an efficient solution to the order of plaintexts. Existing OPE schemes focus on single-dimensional data, and fail to effectively process multi-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional data order preserving encryption scheme MDOPE allowing fine-grained multi-dimensional range queries. Our scheme constructs query indexes for each dimension of the data based on the order preserving encryption network. In particular, the proposed scheme ensures that no external entity, including the cloud server, can obtain additional information other than the order of ciphertexts during the whole query process.},

Despite the good results of ensemble learning , their results are not interpretable. In some domains, such as medicine, banking, and telecommunications, the interpretability of the final model results is very important. For this purpose, rule-based learning algorithms and decision trees are two appropriate approaches. Therefore, an interPretable Ensemble Rule Learning (PERL) model is proposed in this paper. PERL has three main phases: sampling, rule learning, and rule processing. We reduce the negative effects of data intrinsic difficulties in each phase by an appropriate solution. PERL is compared with several interpretable ensemble models on ten imbalanced real-world datasets. According to the obtained results, PERL outperforms significantly the other models based on the f1-score measure.},

Recently, deep learning has become the most powerful type of machine learning techniques, which can be used for discovering the hidden knowledge that exists in a large dataset to make accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose an imputation method that involves using a convolutional neural network to impute the missing values. The missing value of each instance is imputed essentially by using a trained kernel. The weights of the kernel are determined by learning from the given data that are arranged spatially in the data matrix. The kernel carries out a weighted sum of neighboring elements in an array for imputing the missing values. In addition, in the absence of the true values with which the missing values are expected to be replaced, a loss function is designed without the need to know the true value. Our method is evaluated on UCI datasets in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs closely to or better than other methods.},

  abstract     = {A three-way decision framework based on fuzzy concepts can better understand uncertain decision boundaries by automatically dividing opinions into three decision regions : positive, negative, and boundary regions. However, when the fuzzy values of the opinions are very close, the boundary regions tend to be large. The difficult problem is how to significantly reduce the boundary regions while maintaining high classification accuracy . The most useful opinion features include fuzzy concepts and semantic features (or patterns). Unlike fuzzy concepts, semantic features are represented by using semantic patterns that frequently appear in opinions. We also observe a low statistical correlation between semantic patterns and fuzzy concepts. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel opinion classification method that integrates semantic patterns with fuzzy concepts in a three-way decision framework. The new method can increase the discriminative power of classifying opinions using features. Experimental results verify that the integration of fuzzy concepts and semantic patterns has better classification performance than using fuzzy concepts alone. This also shows that fusing multiple features is an effective solution to represent opinions more meaningfully, thereby effectively improving classification accuracy and reducing uncertain boundaries in three-way opinion classification.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decision (3WD) theory has been widely used in solving multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems, however the calculation method for semantic interpretations of loss functions and conditional probabilities has not been reasonably addressed. Thus, by virtue of existing studies on 3WD and MADM, a novel 3WD method to MADM is explored in the current paper, which is titled the 3W-MADM method. First, a pair of novel pre-order relations are designed by virtue of the classic TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method, and a new scheme for calculating conditional probabilities is further established. Then, the calculation scheme of loss functions and thresholds is put forward via attribute evaluation values and ideal solutions. In particular, several primary steps and the algorithm of the 3W-MADM method are summed up. Finally, the practicality and validity of the proposed method are demonstrated by a realistic case of lymphography from the UCI database. Moreover, the stability and superiority of the presented method are shown by several experimental analyses.},

  abstract     = {The recommender system is the key approach to alleviate the data explosion problem. Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning , there are several researches of employing deep neural networks (DNNs) on recommender systems. Most of these methods tend to capture the complex mapping relations between user-item representation and matching score via DNNs. These methods are mainly a pyramid structure which maps relations into low-dimensional space and then predicts the result by logistic regression . However, partial relations may be linearly indivisible in low-dimensional space. As we know, data that are hard to be separated in low-dimensional space can become much easier after being mapped into a high-dimensional space. Hence, motivated by the ladder network, we propose a Symmetric Deep Neural Networks (SDNN) with lateral connections, which can learn relations in both high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces simultaneously. Moreover, considering that deep neural network is very inefficient in catching low-rank relations between users and items, we further combine SDNN with an improved deep matrix factorization model into a unified framework, and name this new model DualCF. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets are conducted and the results verify the effectiveness of SDNN and DualCF over state-of-the-art models for implicit feedback prediction.},

  abstract     = {The Linear time-invariant dynamic models are widely adopted in the industry. In the machine learning domain, such models are known as time-invariant continuous-state hidden Gauss–Markov models. Their super-class, the linear time-varying dynamic models, have relatively sparse applications as predictive models and classifiers of time series. This is typically due to the model complexity and the need for a significantly larger training set than time-invariant models. Without a large training set, a better modeling performance is counteracted by a less robust model. In this paper, we propose the continuity preference of the time-varying parameters of the model, which significantly reduces the required amount of training data while maintaining the modeling performance. We also derive a simple modification of the Expectation–Maximization algorithm incorporating continuity in parameters. The modified algorithm shows robust learning performance. The model performance is demonstrated by experiments on real 6-axis robotic manipulators in a laboratory, the Skoda Auto car producer body shop, and also on a public benchmark data set.},

Regardless of the numerous types of user/item representation approaches used in knowledge graph-based recommendation scenarios, they all have problems. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph-based multi-context-aware recommendation algorithm for learning user/item representations that combines the advantages of path-based and propagation-based methods. A new concept (i.e., rule) is proposed first, which can be a useful way to characterize the user’s preferences. Next, based on user-item interactions, an automatic rule discovery algorithm is proposed that can automatically select the most representative user preferences templates in a given recommendation scenario based on the knowledge graph and user behaviors. Then, the learning of high-order connectivity between long-distance user-item pairs is realized according to these templates. After that, a feature representation method of the local neighborhood characteristics of users and items is introduced to compensate for the defect that the path-based method can only catch the high-order connectivity. The experimental results demonstrate MANN’s superiority over eight state-of-the-art baselines.},

The problem of how to acquire/learn knowledge from adaptive control for SDNSs with uncertain affine terms is studied. To be specific, an appropriate neural network-based (NNB) control strategy is first presented to ensure tracking performance. To further realize learning, the exponential stability (ES) of the integrated closed-loop system coupled with the estimation error of the NN weights is considered. As the uncertain affine term prevents learning from occurring, the integrated system is converted into a discrete linear time-varying (DLTV) perturbed system by employing the state conversion technique. Tracking convergence allows the persistent excitation condition (PEC) of the NNs to be established, which guarantees the ES of the integrated DLTV system. Thus, accurate modeling of closed-loop sampled dynamics is obtained. By reutilizing the experiential knowledge obtained, a knowledge-based controller is constructed for high-performance control. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the presented strategy.},

To address the problem, we design a new RDH scheme by minimizing the additive distortion in JPEG images. Our method firstly designs different additive functions to calculate DCT block cost and DCT frequency cost, and then combines these two cost functions to minimize the additive distortion for a given embedding capacity. After obtaining the optimal embedding positions for each DCT block, we employ an improved two-dimensional histogram shifting strategy for data embedding, which significantly reduces the number of invalid DCT coefficient modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing JPEG RDH methods with better visual quality and smaller file size increment of the marked image.},

Community detection in multilayer networks is an important issue in various fields; hence, stochastic block models have emerged as a popular probabilistic framework over the past decades. However, stochastic block models are suited to binary networks rather than weighted networks. A generalised stochastic block model is proposed herein to address multilayer sparse or dense weighted networks. A variational expectation-maximisation algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of interest. In addition, an upper bound is derived for the probability of misclassification , which is governed by the Rényi divergence of order 1 2 12 .

The three-way decision (3WD) theory further supplements a classification scheme . In addition, a DM’s own limited rationality and personality traits have a strong impact on decision-making results. By using a dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), a new 3WD method based on the regret theory (RT) with optimistic, neutral and pessimistic strategies (3WD-RT-OEP) is constructed in a fuzzy environment, so as to prevent diseases in advance and improve the survival rate of patients. First, attribute weights are calculated based on the similarity between the defined attributes of dominance classes, and a new method for calculating conditional probabilities is proposed to enhance the objectivity of the method by the similarity between object dominance classes and decision classes. Second, the score functions of three strategies are proposed by considering regret and rejoicing values in RT, and specific steps and algorithms of the 3WD-RT-OEP method are given as well. Finally, the validity and rationality of the constructed method are proved by experimental analysis with the support of case studies and supplementary data sets.},

The Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is considered to be a benchmark algorithm among CIL techniques. Although the SMOTE algorithm performs well on the vast majority of class-imbalance tasks, it also has the inherent drawback of noise propagation. Many SMOTE-variants have been proposed to address this problem. Generally, the improved solutions conduct a hybrid sampling procedure, i.e., carrying out an undersampling process after SMOTE to remove noises. However, owing to the complexity of data distribution, it is sometimes difficult to accurately identify real instances of noise, resulting in low modeling quality . In this paper, we propose a more robust and universal SMOTE hybrid variant algorithm named SMOTE-reverse k -nearest neighbors (SMOTE-R k NN). The proposed algorithm identifies noise based on probability density but not local neighborhood information. Specifically, the probability density information of each instance is provided by R k NN, a well-known KNN variant. Noisy instances are found and deleted according to their relevant probability density. In experiments on 46 class-imbalanced data sets, SMOTE-R k NN showed promising results in comparison with several popular SMOTE hybrid variant algorithms.},

An SS scheme for a general access structure (GSS) has drawn more and more attention since it allows flexible access control. However, previous solutions to GSS need to either assign multiple shares to each participant or to solve a complex nonlinear integer programming . In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to address the two problems simultaneously based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for a polynomial ring over a finite field. We classify general access structures satisfying the monotone property into the two families of maximum forbidden subsets and minimum qualified subsets conforming to the security condition and the revealing condition. The moduli used in the scheme are pairwise coprime polynomials and can take the irreducible polynomials . To find the degrees of these polynomials, we only need to solve an integer linear programming (ILP) by minimizing the sum of the degrees of all the moduli. The proposed scheme is inherently a weighted SS scheme and may have no solution which commonly exists in all GSS schemes. To ensure a solution, we put forth a preprocessing algorithm which separates the original access structure into several subaccess structures based on graph theory. The proposed scheme only assigns a share for each participant and achieves perfect security. It has good generalization and provides a universal approach to program the scheme construction for SS schemes with general access structures, threshold access structures and weighted access structures.},

Firstly, we transform the N -mode DSIT2FS with intermittent control inputs into a new one with N controller-busy modes and N controller-free modes. Then, by constructing a class of non-increasing virtual-clock-dependent multiple quadratic Lyapunov functions (VMQLFs), sufficient conditions on the existence of the H ∞ H∞ intermittent IT2 fuzzy controllers are obtained for DSIT2FSs with dwell time constraints. The controller gains can be gotten by solving a set of strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The obtained results are also applicable to non-switched IT2 fuzzy systems. It is shown that the designed IT2 fuzzy controllers work intermittently but still can guarantee stability and H ∞ H∞ performance of the close-loop systems. Finally, a tunnel diode circuit system model and a single link robot arm model are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the results.},

This modelling includes actions that are part of an individual’s routine, as well as less frequent events. Although infrequent actions may provide relevant information, it is routine behaviors that characterize users. However, the extraction of this knowledge is not simple. Current process mining techniques face problems when analyzing large amounts of traces generated by many users. When very different behavioral patterns are integrated, the resulting social workflow does not clearly depict their behavior, either individually or as a group. Proposals based on frequent pattern mining aim to distinguish traces that characterize frequent behaviors from the rest. However, tools that allow grouping/filtering of users with a common behavior pattern are needed beforehand, to analyze each of these groups separately. This study presents the so-called federated process mining and an associated tool, SOWCompact, based on this concept. Its potential is validated through the case study called activities of daily living (ADL). Using federated process mining, along with current process mining techniques, more compact processes using only the social workflow’s most relevant information are obtained, while allowing (event enabling) the analysis of these social workflows.},

Such situations are conceivable, for instance, when a group of individuals want to watch a movie together. It is well known that people influence each other’s decisions, the more assertive a person is, the more influence they will have on the final decision. In order to obtain a more realistic group recommendation system (GRS), we need to accommodate the assertiveness of the different group members’ personalities. Although pairwise preferences are long-established in group decision-making (GDM), they have received very little attention in the recommendation systems community. Driven by the advantages of pairwise preferences on ratings in the recommendation systems domain, we have further pursued this approach in this paper, however we have done so for GRS. We have devised a three-stage approach to GRS in which we 1) resort to three binary matrix factorization methods, 2) develop an influence graph that includes assertiveness and cooperativeness as personality traits, and 3) apply an opinion dynamics model in order to reach consensus. We have shown that the final opinion is related to the stationary distribution of a Markov chain associated with the influence graph. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach results in high precision and fairness.},

  abstract     = {Predictive models are increasingly being used to optimize decision-making and minimize costs. A conventional approach is predict-then-optimize : first, a predictive model is built; then, this model is used to optimize decision-making. A drawback of this approach, however, is that it only incorporates costs in the second stage. Conversely, the predict-and-optimize approach proposes learning a predictive model by directly minimizing the cost of the downstream decision-making task. This is achieved by using a task-specific loss function incorporating the costs of different outcomes in the first stage, with the eventual aim of obtaining more cost-effective decisions in the second stage. This work compares both approaches in the context of cost-sensitive classification. Conceptually, we use the two-stage framework to categorize existing cost-sensitive learning methodologies by differentiating between methodologies for cost-sensitive model training and decision-making. Empirically, we compare and evaluate both approaches using different cost-sensitive training and decision-making methodologies, as well as both class-dependent and instance-dependent cost-sensitive methods. This is achieved using real-world data from a range of application areas and a combination of cost-sensitive and cost-insensitive performance measures. The key finding is that the decision-making strategy is generally found to be more effective than training with a task-specific loss or their combination.},

The proposed research incorporates input from all four phases of the supply chain (supplying raw materials, manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing of finished goods, and selling them to customers). Three conflicting objective functions have been developed: cost minimization , emission minimization, and social benefit maximization. A multi-objective optimization model has been formulated subject to the usual supply and demand constraints, balancing constraints, capacity constraints, and many more. The weighted sum approach has been used to solve the multi-objective optimization model. Finally, two real-life case studies to validate the proposed model have been presented: the lead-acid battery supply chain and the disposable syringe supply chain.},

  abstract     = {Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function . A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance + 1 +1 and conflict - 1 -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.},

  abstract     = {In the scenario of attack-defense involved with unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), it is often envisioned that a large group of UCAVs is deployed to complete some complex tasks which could be specifically modeled as large-scale matrix games . Solving such matrix games by the traditional linear programming approaches, however, could be quite time-consuming and thus cannot be implemented in real-time which is, in fact, a key requirement for real air combat. On this account, an algorithm, termed as dimensionality reduction based matrix game solving algorithm (DR-MG), is proposed in this paper to solve large-scale matrix games in a timely manner. Our algorithm builds on the technique of dimensionality reduction which inherently finds the convex hull vertices of a vector set. Through establishing the connection between Nash equilibria of the matrix games before and after dimensionality reduction, the proposed algorithm is capable of finding the solutions while only dealing with the matrix game with reduced dimensions. As a consequence, it is expected the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly decreased, and thus the algorithm could be applicable in real air combat. Finally, numerical results are provided to show the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Meanwhile, it remains a challenging topic due to the complexities of contextual effects and the highly dynamic nature of demand. Many works based on graph neural network (GNN) have recently been proposed to cope with this task. However, most previous studies treat the spatial dependence as a static graph, and their inference mechanism lacks interpretability . To address the issues, a D ynamical S patial- T emporal G raph N eural N etwork model (DSTGNN) is proposed in this paper. DSTGNN has two critical phases: (1) Creating a spatial dependence graph . To capture the dynamical relationship, we propose building a spatial graph based on the stability of node’s spatial dependence. (2) Inferring intensity. We model the changing demand process using the inhomogeneous Poisson process , which addresses the interpretability issue, and build a spatial-temporal embedding network to infer the intensity. Specifically, the spatial-temporal embedding network integrates the diffusion convolution neural network (DCNN) and a modified transformer. Extensive experiments are carried out on two real data sets , and the experimental results demonstrate that the performance of DSTGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art models on traffic demand prediction.},

  abstract     = {In multi-objective optimization, the direction vectors in the objective space that improve the current non-dominated set are named improvement directions. The Improvement Direction Mapping (IDM) methods apply a spatial transformation to map improvement directions in the objective space to search for directions in the variable space. Jacobian based transformations can perform the mapping, however, they require the analytic expressions of the objectives and their derivatives. Hence, they serve as a reference in academic problems but are impractical in real-world applications. Furthermore, they are commonly ill-conditioned and under-determined; consequently, they deviate the search as the current non-dominated set approaches to the Pareto set. This work proposes a solution via an iterative updating based on the Broyden method. The proposal promotes parallelism between the displacement of the non-dominated solutions in the objective space and improvement directions delivered by Chebyshev scalarizing functions. Compared to other transformations reported in the specialized literature, the proposed method demonstrates a better conditioning that provokes to err at a lesser extent in providing successful search directions. This impacts the algorithm performance, mainly in locations close to the Pareto set. These advantages are demonstrated using benchmark functions and metrics.},

Although several revocable identity-based fully homomorphic signature (RIBFHS) schemes have been proposed, these schemes are vulnerable to signing key exposure. With this study, we are the first to consider a realistic threat signing key exposure in RIBFHS systems. In addition, we introduce a new security definition of RIBFHS with signing key exposure resistance. Then, we employ Agrawal’s left–right lattices and delegation technology in fixed dimensions to construct a new RIBFHS scheme over the lattice with regularly broadcasted update keys, which not only resists signing key exposure, but also meets scalability and context hiding properties. Finally, we prove that our construction is existentially unforgeable against chosen message attacks under the standard short integer solution (SIS) assumption in the random oracle model .},

  abstract     = {Machine learning offers automatic and objective approaches for disease detection based on biomedical data. However, 1) the percentage of patients in the real world is smaller than that of healthy people; 2) the annotations by medical experts are costly. Therefore, medical datasets are often imbalanced and partially labeled. To address this problem, we propose balanced evolutionary semi-stacking (BESS) for disease detection using partially labeled imbalanced (PLI) data. BESS aims to detect illnesses by considering the input of the color, texture, and geometry features extracted from tongue images. Specifically, the proposed method first mitigates the class imbalance problem and leverages the unlabeled data through the so-called balanced evolutionary co-training approach. Then BESS exploits both the data and classifier diversity obtained by balanced evolutionary co-training to improve the performance of the stacking ensemble. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed algorithm based on the PLI tongue image database. BESS achieves the best performance in detecting diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer, and chronic gastritis, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The results of the experiments substantiate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The approach is characterized by its relatively low computational complexity due to the use of fuzzy rule base instead of intensive simulations of a fuzzy chaotic system. Complexity of this hybrid fuzzy-chaotic approach assures an increased level of security.

It is still an evident challenge to estimate the ground-truth label matrix and to generate a prediction function, especially on the multi-label data with a large number of missing labels. In this paper, we propose a multi-label learning framework within which feature structure and label manifold are both utilized to recover the incomplete label matrix and to train the classification model simultaneously. To mitigate the imbalanced risks brought by the sparse label issue, a self-adaptive penalty factor is imposed on the deviated predictions of different labels. Moreover, instance granular discrimination is incorporated in the framework to characterize the approximate distribution structure of data. Matrix vectorization , cave-convex programming (CCCP), and block coordinate descent techniques are employed to solve the proposed optimization problem .

The existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution to both primal and dual problems are also addressed. It should be pointed out that our model is nonlinear and kernel-free, so it does not need to select kernel function and corresponding parameters. At the same time, it is highly interpretable. In addition, our model is still a quadratic convex programming problem similar to the standard SVR. To visualize the effectiveness of our ∊ -SQSSVR, 6 artificial datasets and 15 benchmark datasets are implemented in numerical experiments.

Motivated by the excellent performance of Grassmann manifolds representation in video recognition tasks, we propose an optimal transport based video domain adaptation model on Grassmann manifolds. The proposed model reduces the discrepancy between different domains for the frame and video level features. First, the frame level discrepancy is reduced by extracting domain consistency features. At the video level, a fixed number of frame features are formed and represented as points on Grassmann manifolds. These points are fused with predicted labels to form fusion features . Finally, the video level discrepancy is reduced by minimizing the distribution discrepancy of the fusion features between two domains.

  abstract     = {Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is an important medical-assisted diagnostic technique widely used by clinicians to assess fetal well-being. However, one challenge is that the capabilities of such diagnostic algorithms often rely on an enormous quantity of labeled clinical data to train a model, which do not preserve patient privacy. The high performance of such diagnostic algorithms is further hindered by category imbalance problems. Therefore, the general objective of this study is to develop a small-sample generation method that generates FHR signals of different physiological/pathological categories and arbitrary lengths. This study focuses on two significant impediments to the existing generation methods: the instability of generative adversarial networks (GAN) during model training, the mode collapse problem and the subsequent training of different specific models for different data categories, which contributes to high model training costs. To address these problems, we propose a novel generative adversarial architecture, referred to as CCWGAN-GP, based on a deep neural network optimized by the Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty, and incorporate an auxiliary classifier as a category constraint to enrich the diversity of generated data. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated using 200 real FHR recordings from four aspects: training performance, the fidelity and diversity of generated data, and the potential improvement in the classification model . Compared with training on small-sample datasets and category-imbalanced datasets, training on augmented datasets improves the accuracy by approximately 12\% and 8\%, respectively. The developed architecture provides a reference value for a practical solution to the FHR data imbalance and insufficient sample problems.},

Emotional choices, meaning that individuals attempting to spread information are not only influenced by the objective emotions embedded in the influential information spread by influencers but also by subjective emotional tendencies, is an essential human behavior for information propagation. Hence, we seek to link the negative emotional contagion in the network at the macroscopic level to the emotional choices of individuals, and model parameters are used at the microcosmic level to measure the “copying” and “mutation” probabilities of negative sentiments in an event. Our results illustrate the emotional choices of users play essential roles in methods for mitigating harmful emotion spread and promoting meaningful emotion diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Echo state network (ESN) is an effective tool for nonlinear systems modeling. To handle irregular noises or outliers in practical systems and alleviate the overfitting issue, the robust echo state network with sparse online learning (RESN-SOL) is proposed. Firstly, the ε ε -insensitive loss function is introduced to replace the commonly used quadratic loss function , which is theoretically optimal for Gaussian noise distribution. Secondly, the online gradient descent algorithm is used to calculate the network readout. Notably, the better learning performance can be achieved by the constant learning rate rather than the decreasing step size. Based on this observation, the sparse online learning algorithm (SOL) is proposed, in which the constant step size is used. Particularly, the SOL is able to truncate the small weights in network readout to zero for achieving sparsity . Furthermore, the convergence of RESN-SOL is theoretically analyzed, which implies the tradeoff between learning performance and readout sparsity can be controlled by a predefined sparsity parameter. Finally, the proposed method is verified in two simulated benchmarks and an actual dynamical wastewater treatment system. Experimental results demonstrate that the RESN-SOL exhibits better robustness against outliers, network compactness and modeling accuracy than other existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the surge of the large volume of data availability, Machine Learning and mainly Deep Learning techniques are the leading solutions in classification and predictive tasks, targeted at data-efficient learning. These models learn by training on many diversified samples in a process that is computationally expensive or time-consuming. Moreover, in many real-world scenarios, the amount of available data for training is unsuitable, because it is unlabeled or covers only portions of the whole reference domain cases. This paper proposes an alternative approach for document classification that leverages the distribution of the data projected in the multi-dimensional feature space to assess the weight of features in the final classification. The approach does not rely on traditional iterative methods for classification but builds a relevance measure to assess the relevance/importance of the features describing the domain of interest. The idea is to harness this metric to select relevant features and then express the values calculated by these metrics in natural language by exploiting fuzzy variables and linguistic labels to make human comprehension more immediate. The approach has been employed for emotion extraction from social media messages. The novelty of this approach is twofold: first, the well-known TF-IDF measure was reinterpreted as a relevance measure of emotions discovered in text content. Then, the discovered emotion relevance was described by fuzzy linguistic labels, defined on an ad-hoc-designed fuzzy partition , to express the data classification in natural language, more suitable to human understanding.},

A stochastic sequence is introduced for modelling the time of occurrence of cyber-attacks within an insecure communication environment. By taking the dynamic event-triggered protocol, signal quantization and randomly occurring deception attacks into account, an integrated dynamic output feedback controller and fault detection filter module is developed. With the proposed design, stochastic stability is obtained, while the expected levels of security control performance and detection performance are also guaranteed.

In this paper, we introduce an attention mechanism to jointly exploit label and instance information in order to improve the quality of the recovered labels. Firstly, the attention mechanism is used to encode the label and the instance information for label space reconstruction. Secondly, attention computations are performed on the reconstructed label space to obtain the label completion matrix. Finally, global and local features of label correlation are used to improve the model robustness, and label prediction is completed. Through the analysis of the experimental results of multiple benchmark multi-label datasets, it is demonstrated that the proposed method has certain advantages over other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {For several years the modeling as well as forecasting of the prices of stocks have been extremely challenging for the business community and researchers as a result of the existence of noise in samples and also the non-stationary behaviour of information samples. Notwithstanding these drawbacks with improved deep learning , it is now possible to design schemes that will efficiently perform the feature learning task. For this work, we proposed a brand-new end to end algorithm labeled EHTS EHTS toward solving the stock price forecasting problem. The AB - CNN AB-CNN and CB - LSTM CB-LSTM modules extract features from the stock price dataset and soon after amalgamating the results. Thus, the output of the concatenation stage was feed into the concluding stage which is a stand-alone MLP MLP module. The inclusion of the LSTM LSTM and Attention Mechanism in our architecture is to extract long-range and exceptionally long-term stock price information. We experiment the proposed algorithm on two popular stocks both from the NYSE stock market namely “Johnson &amp; Johnson” code-named, “ JNJ JNJ ” and the Bank of America (BAC). In terms of the rMSE , MAE and MAPE error metrics, our proposed scheme gives the lowest error value in all for all datasets. Also, five percentage training window sizes are experimented and EHTS outperforms all the baseline schemes for the different window sizes in all the two datasets with the 70\% window size having the highest performance. In terms of number of epochs, EHTS uses the lowest number of epochs for training than the other schemes in all the datasets. Finally, we as well study our stock’s information to point out short-range trading opportunities by performing simulations on our stock price data. The metrics considered in the simulation are as follows: Moving Average (MA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD MACD ) curve, MACD MACD histogram, Signal line, Relative Strength Index ( RSI RSI ), Returns (R), Annual Returns (AR), Sharpe Ratio (SR), Annual Volatility (V), Maximum DrawDown (MDD) and Daily WinningRate (DWR). For all the aforementioned metrics, EHTS performs better than the baselines. Experimental results revealed that our proposed scheme outperformed the stand-alone deep learning schemes, statistical algorithms, and machine learning models from the beginning to the end.},

This event has encouraged many studies of information diffusion in online social networks, especially in the mechanism and dynamics of the information diffusion process over such networks. Many previous studies of information diffusion in social networks have been based on experimental analyses or differential equations with temporal dimensions. Some recent studies have developed the information diffusion process using the heat transfer equations, the reaction–diffusion equations, or the hydrodynamic equations . This paper proposes a model called Ordinary Differential Information Diffusion or ODID to study both temporal and spatial patterns of the information diffusion process in online social networks. By using the formulation of ordinary differential equations , this model is constructed with friendship, relationships, and interactions between network users without quite relying on geometric linkages of the underlying network. The model is validated by the Digg data set whereby it is confirmed that with 95\% confidence the ODID computations are not significantly different from the actual data and the average prediction accuracy of the model is about 98.78\%.},

  abstract     = {Most existing imbalanced data classification models mainly focus on the classification performance of majority class samples, and many clustering algorithms need to manually specify the initial cluster centers and the number of clusters. To solve these drawbacks, this study presents a novel feature reduction method for imbalanced data classification using similarity-based feature clustering with adaptive weighted k -nearest neighbors (AWKNN). First, the similarity between samples is evaluated by the difference and smaller value between samples on each dimension, a similarity measure matrix is then developed to measure the similarity between clusters, after which a new hierarchical clustering model is constructed. By combining the cluster center of each sample cluster with its nearest neighbor, new samples are generated. Then, a hybrid sampling model based on similarity measure is presented by putting the generated samples into imbalanced data and removing samples from majority classes. Thus, a balanced decision system is constructed based on generated samples and minority class samples. Second, to address the issues that the traditional symmetric uncertainty only considers the correlation between features, and mutual information ignores the added information after classification, the normalized information gain is introduced to design new symmetric uncertainty between each feature and the other features; then, the ordered sequence and the average of the symmetric uncertainty difference of each feature are provided to adaptively select the k -nearest neighbors of features. Moreover, the weight of the k -th nearest neighbor of features is defined to present the AWKNN density of features and their ordered sequence for clustering features. Finally, by combining the weighted average redundancy with the symmetric uncertainty between features and decision classes, the maximum relevance between each feature and decision classes, and the minimum redundancy among features in the same cluster is presented to select the optimal feature subset from the feature clusters. Experiments applied to 29 imbalanced datasets show that the developed algorithm is effective and can select the optimal feature subset with high classification accuracy for imbalanced data.},

  abstract     = {Reasoning about uncertainty is one of the main cornerstones of Knowledge Representation. More recently, combining logic with probability has been of major interest. Rough set methods have been proposed for modeling incompleteness and imprecision based on indiscernibility and its generalizations and there is a large body of work in this direction. More recently, the classical theory has been generalized to include probabilistic rough set methods of which there are also a great variety of proposals. Pragmatic, easily accessible, and easy to use tools for specification and reasoning with this wide variety of methods is lacking. It is the purpose of this paper to fill in that gap where the focus will be on probabilistic rough set methods. A landscape of (probabilistic) rough set reasoning methods and the variety of choices involved in specifying them is surveyed first. While doing this, an abstract generalization of all the considered approaches is derived which subsumes each of the methods. One then shows how, via this generalization, one can specify and reason about any of these methods using ProbLog , a popular and widely used probabilistic logic programming language based on Prolog . The paper also considers new techniques in this context such as the use of probabilistic target sets when defining rough sets and the use of partially specified base relations that are also probabilistic. Additionally, probabilistic approaches using tolerance spaces are proposed. The paper includes a rich set of examples and provides a framework based on a library of generic ProbLog relations that make specification of any of these methods, straightforward, efficient and compact.

  abstract     = {User identity linkage (UIL) across social networks has recently attracted an increasing amount of attention due to its significant research challenges and practical value. Most of the existing methods use a single method to express different types of attribute features. However, the simplex pattern can neither cover the entire set of different attribute features nor capture the higher-level semantic features in the attribute text. This paper establishes a novel semisupervised model, namely the multilevel attribute embedding for semisupervised user identity linkage (MAUIL), to seek the common user identity across social networks. MAUIL includes two components: multilevel attribute embedding and regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA)-based linear projection. Specifically, the text attributes for each network are first divided into three types: character-level, word-level, and topic-level attributes. Second, unsupervised approaches are employed to extract the corresponding three types of text attribute features, and user relationships are embedded as a complimentary feature. All the resultant features are combined to form the final representation of each user. Finally, target social networks are projected into a common correlated space by RCCA with the help of a small number of prematched user pairs. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. All the datasets and codes are publicly available online. 1},

We propose the concept of keyword hot value which is usually the value of textual attribute, such as popularity and price, and design a novel similarity function to evaluate the similarity between spatial textual objects and the query. A hierarchical index GI-tree is proposed to handle the TASK query with a best-first strategy. To improve the query efficiency, a novel hybrid index, termed SGI, is designed for pruning unqualified objects by utilizing their spatial, textual and temporal information simultaneously. Furthermore, a tight upper bound score, as well as the heuristic searches is presented to get further optimization, and a search framework is designed to obtain the top- k results in an efficient way. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed solution.},

This paper proposes a new approach for the classification of face images based on multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP). In MOGP, image descriptors that extract effective features are automatically evolved by optimising two different objectives at the same time: the accuracy and the distance measure. The distance measure is a new measure intended to enhance generalisation of learned features and/or classifiers. The performance of MOGP is evaluated on eight face datasets. The results show that MOGP significantly outperforms 17 competitive methods.},

  abstract     = {As many data in practical applications occur or can be arranged in multiview forms, multiview clustering utilizing certain complementary and heterogeneous information in various views to promote the clustering performance, has received much attention recently. Among varieties of methods, graph-based unsupervised learning methods are an essential approach for learning intrinsic structure relations of multiview data for clustering. Most of them firstly integrate information from each view into a consensus graph, which is then fed into the classic spectral clustering to achieve clustering. Such a two-step clustering paradigm is difficult to obtain the optimal clustering results even though every step performs individual optimization. This paper integrates multi-graph construction, consensus graph construction , and clustering in a unified learning framework, which can simultaneously consider the consistency and complementarity of multiview data to provide the clustering results directly. Moreover, we treat each view differently by automatic weight learning. Specifically, multi-graph learning, consensus graph learning, and weight learning are seamlessly integrated so that the related variables can be iteratively updated in the unified optimization framework–the clustering results towards an overall optimum. Comprehensive experiments on real multiview datasets verify the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art baselines in terms of three clustering evaluation metrics .},

Feature relevance terms are often constructed depending on the amount of information contributed by selected features or candidate features to the label set in previous multi-label feature selection approaches based on information theory . Although it is important to consider the amount of information, they ignore both the changed ratio for the undetermined amount of information and the changed ratio for the established amount of information, two types of changed ratios regarding feature relevance evaluation cannot be underestimated. To this end, we devise a new feature relevance term, Relevance based on Weight ( RW RW ), which is based on two types of changed ratios. Both two types of changed ratios have positive or negative impacts regarding feature relevance evaluation. A novel multi-label feature selection approach, Relevance based on Weight Feature Selection (RWFS), is proposed based on RW RW . To verify the effectiveness, the proposed approach is compared to eight state-of-the-art multi-label approaches on thirteen real-world data sets.

Traditional methods usually suffer from high computational complexity and insufficient use of available information. In this paper, we propose solving the multiframe detection problem through two sequential steps: Doppler-aided track formation (DTF) and data-driven track detection (DTD). By using the DTF, which considers the coupling relationship between the location measurements and Doppler measurements, the potential tracks can be extracted without introducing too many false tracks. Using DTD, which fuses multiple features along the extracted tracks through a deep neural network, the detection can be sequentially declared. Simulation results show that the detection performance of the proposed method is better than that of the traditional methods for weak targets, and that false alarms can be handled well. Both theoretical analysis and experimental studies corroborate the computational efficiency of the proposed method in real-time implementation.},

We point out that previous bivariate polynomial-based ( t , n ) (t,n) -SSR schemes, such as those of Harn et al. (Information Sciences 2020), are insecure , which is because the outside adversary may obtain the secret by solving a system of t ( t + 1 ) 2 t(t+1)2 -ary linear equations . We revise Harn et al. scheme and get a secure ( t , n ) (t,n) -SSR scheme based on a symmetric bivariate polynomial for the first time, where t ⩽ n ⩽ 2 t - 1 t⩽n⩽2t-1 . To increase the range of n for a given t , we construct a secure ( t , n ) (t,n) -SSR scheme based on an asymmetric bivariate polynomial for the first time, where n ⩾ t n⩾t . We find that the share sizes of our schemes are the same or almost the same as other existing insecure ( t , n ) (t,n) -SSR schemes based on bivariate polynomials. Moreover, our asymmetric bivariate polynomial-based ( t , n ) (t,n) -SSR scheme is more easy to be constructed compared to the Chinese Remainder Theorem-based ( t , n ) (t,n) -SSR scheme with the stringent condition on moduli, and their share sizes are almost the same.},

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FTAP not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ESC-50 dataset with multi-class audio classification but also has good performance in distant domain transfer learning.

  abstract     = {Multi-step ahead long term forecasting remains a pertinent challenge in time series literature due to non-stationary behaviour of real-world data. Predominantly most traditional time series models are parametric in nature and they use the predicted values to generate forecast for future time steps. This leads to error accumulation in each step of the forecasting horizon which causes increasingly poorer forecast in long-term. Other than the problem of error accumulation, most parametric algorithms also require significant pre-processing, hyper-parameter tuning, training and post-processing which can often put high computational burden on the system. Therefore, this paper proposes, Model Less Time-series Forecasting (MLTF), a non-parametric approach for forecasting which does not require any pre-processing or traditional training (i.e. Backpropagation). MLTF is a non-parametric method which uses statistical representations such as trend, linearity, entropy etc. to cluster series from a pre-defined repository and the series from same cluster are tagged as similar series. The trajectory of the target series is extracted from these similar series after applying an adaptive re-sampling technique. There is minimal training involved in MLTF, therefore this framework is computationally very efficient. The model-less nature also enables it to not suffer from error accumulation in long-horizon forecast. MLTF is validated empirically with a rich set of experiments involving M1, M3 competition dataset, Electricity, Volatility and COVID-19 data (over 4500 independent uni-variate series of different frequencies i.e. Hourly, Daily, Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly). The experiments demonstrate that, MLTF is significantly faster while being similar (or better) in terms of forecasting accuracy than the state-of-the-art DL methods and other non-parametric time series model.},

Firstly, a med-point-example learning strategy and a random learning strategy are proposed to replace the imitation component and social influence component of SL-PSO to enhance the exploitation and exploration, respectively. Secondly, the two learning strategies are combined cleverly into an updating equation to balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, a worst-best example learning strategy is merged skillfully to construct TLS-PSO with hybrid learning mechanism and further enhance the search ability. The experimental results on the complex functions from CEC2013 and CEC2017 test sets indicate that TLS-PSO has better performance compared with state-of-the-art PSO variants and other algorithms. For example, TLS-PSO has an advantage over SL-PSO on 50 of the 56 functions from CEC2013, its running time is less than SL-PSO’s and it has higher search efficiency.

  abstract     = {Privacy-preserving data consolidation is one of the prominent research topics in the big data era, mostly because of the need of consolidating data from various database communities, which are highly sensitive or competitive in nature. This leads to a new emerging problem namely how to accomplish data consolidation among different organization data sets or databases appropriately without revealing any competitive or sensitive information to non-owners. To address this issue, we first introduce a new encryption notion called “complementary set encryption” (CSE) to apply to privacy-preserving data consolidation. In this notion, to provide privacy protection, the data in one database will be encrypted under a set W prior to being sent to the other database, and a decryption key will be generated with another set Q . The data will be decrypted and consolidated into the other database, if and only if both sets W and Q are complementary. Here, the “complementary” means that the intersection of set W and set Q is empty and meanwhile the union of both is to be completed into a universal set exactly. We then describe two constructions of CSE under the public-key setting. Our first construction is designed under a weaker security notion – “payload hiding”, which only preserves the data privacy but achieves a higher performance. The second construction is a stronger security notion, which we refer to as an “attribute hiding”, which preserves both the privacy of the data and its associated set W . Finally, we provide a formal analysis to prove the security of our two constructions, followed by a theoretical performance comparison and an experimental evaluation. In particular, the first construction is of an independent interest in the context of cryptography since it was able to stand out for its efficiency as a predicate encryption scheme in the sense that it features both low communication overhead and computational costs simultaneously, and only requires a private key size of O ( 1 ) O(1) , a ciphertext size of O ( 1 ) O(1) , and only O ( 1 ) O(1) pairing computations.},

  abstract     = {Currently, more and more researchers use the idea and strategy of three-way decision to guide scientific research. In this paper, we propose two comprehensive fuzzy concepts and apply them to construct a new three-way decision model. Firstly, with the TOPSIS method, this paper regards the optimal distance and the worst distance as the cost fuzzy concept and the benefit fuzzy concept, respectively. Then, based on the fuzzy concepts with opposite characteristics, two comprehensive fuzzy concepts (i.e., the comprehensive benefit fuzzy concept and the comprehensive cost fuzzy concept) are proposed, and the relationship between the decision-making regions corresponding to the two comprehensive fuzzy concepts is discussed. Further, four fuzzy neighborhood operators are used to describe the relationship between any two schemes and the relative loss function is used to compute the loss value of each scheme with different behaviors in different states. Afterwards, we introduce a new three-way decision model to solve the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Comparing analysis, Kendall analysis and Spearman analysis show that our method is feasible and stable.},

In this paper, we propose a new AdaBoost-based Transfer Learning with Privileged Information (AdaTLPI) method to solve the transfer learning problem with privileged information, in which AdaBoost is taken into account to combine the weak classifiers into a strong classifier. In the model, we utilize shared parameter to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. We then incorporate privileged information about the source and target domains into a unified model and AdaBoost is used to learn a strong classifier by combining the obtained weak classifiers . Finally, we present an effective optimization algorithm to solve the proposed objective model and present the boundary of training error of the proposed method. The experimental results manifest that the proposed method can outperform the previous methods.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of link prediction is to predict missing edges of the knowledge graph, or edges that may appear in the future. An abundance of data-driven methods exist, which rely on many labels and only consider the structural information about the graph. To address these problems, we have developed a logical-default attention graph convolution neural network model (DA-GCN). The model consists of three parts. First, the confidence of first-order logic inference with Default (DFLIN) was calculated by defining rules. Second, a local relational attention model was defined to represent self information , which includes first order, second order neighbor node information, and to train a graph convolution neural network based on iterative attention (IAGCN) by using centralized training distributed execution model. Third, iteratively update DFLIN and IAGCN using the Wasserstein distance to express the relation between entities. Finally, we conduct comparative experiments between the DA-GCN model and other models on a self-built dataset and three public datasets. The results show that the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) value is about 36.48\% higher than that of the R-GCN model. Our results show that DA-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other specific or general integrated methods, especially on small-scale organized knowledge graphs.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GAN) training is subject to problems including mode collapse, gradient vanishing, and instability. Although many different losses have been proposed to alleviate these shortcomings, they heavily rely on a fixed-value function with limited expressive power in terms of robustness, whereby failing to perform consistently over multiple data sets. To solve this problem, we propose a parametric and robust α β αβ -loss function that can improve the performances of GAN on different data sets. Specifically, unlike standard GAN loss function it exploits the α β αβ -divergence (AB-divergence) to weigh the likelihood ratio associated with each data point. This weighing mechanism makes the model robust to noises and yields better models in terms of FID score. To reduce the cost of searching for the optimal α α and β β , we further propose an adaptive version to systematically update these parameters according to statistics of the discriminator’s output. Moreover, α β αβ -loss can be reduced to Least Square GAN (LS-GAN) and standard GAN (SGAN) loss function as special cases. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. Experimental results over the synthetic data sets (2D Gaussian ring and grid) demonstrate that our approach can significantly alleviate the issue of mode collapse. Additionally, by constraining the gradient of the discriminator that is fed back to the generator via finely adjusting the hyper-parameters α α and β β , our approach can improve the quality of synthetic images, as can be seen from the decrease of FID from 40 to 23.71 on the data set CIFAR10 using the SN-DCGAN architecture.},

The proposed method supports the same rationale for feature importance and interaction. It also supports the decomposition of feature importance to feature power and feature interactions.

Centroid type reduction is one of the major component of GT2 FLSs, it is currently one of the key factors restricting GT2 FLSs efficiency. This paper proposes a novel and efficient method for centroid type reduction. The method is based on α α -plane representation, where a general type-2 fuzzy set is decomposing into a series of α α planes. The centroid for each plane is the calculated, layer by layer, from the top down, until the α = 0 α=0 plane is reached. In each α α plane, a centroid type reduction calculation is performed using an improved enhanced opposite direction searching algorithm (IEODS). Finally, the centroids obtained for each plane are aggregated to obtain a type-1 fuzzy set, which form the centroid of general type-2 fuzzy set. Experiments show that this method results in less calculation time and fewer iterations than other α α -plane representation-based reduction methods. By providing more efficient type reduction, the method improves the applicability of general type-2 fuzzy systems in more complex environments and embedded platforms, thereby enhancing their scope for future development.},

Semantic mapping helps to obtain semantic locations of static objects, and the probabilistic relationship between dynamic and static objects can obtain semantic locations of dynamic objects through probabilistic reasoning . Probabilistic planning domain definition language (PPDDL) can generate offline action sequences, while partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) can generate online action sequences. Therefore, a hybrid task planner that can receive semantic location information is constructed to generate offline and online action sequences, and realizes the dynamic switching of the two kinds of sequences through the designed planner switching mechanism. In order to improve the robustness and intelligence of robot task planning, a task replanning mechanism considering the position relationship between robot and candidate static objects is designed. Experimental results in real environment and simulation environment show that this approach can effectively increase the intelligence of task planning and improve the robustness and efficiency of robot task execution.},

Therefore, they are rarely used on devices with limited computational resources in the newly-emerged technology of the Internet of medical things (IoMT). Knowledge distillation was utilized in this paper to propose a method for bridging the gap between the arrhythmia classification model with multi-lead ECG signals and the arrhythmia classification model with single-lead ECG signals by minimizing the performance decline. The proposed method consists of a teacher model with advanced architecture and a student model with simple architecture. The teacher model was already developed through multi-lead ECG signals, whereas the student model was developed through single-lead signals under the supervision of the teacher. Despite its simplicity, the student model receives the dark knowledge of multi-lead ECG signals from the teacher by imitating the teacher’s behavior in the development process. According to the results, the student model was nearly 262.18 times more compressed than its teacher. Moreover, the student experienced approximately 0.81\% of accuracy decline in Chapman ECG with 10646 patients.},

Models of such evolving processes can easily become analytically intractable. In this paper, we consider a simple yet mathematically rich setting, in which all agents initially share an initial opinion representing the status quo. The system evolves in steps. In each step, one agent selected uniformly at random follows an underlying update rule to revise its opinion on the basis of those held by its neighbors, but with a probabilistic bias towards the superior alternative. We analyze convergence of the resulting process under well-known update rules. The framework we propose is simple and modular, but at the same time complex enough to highlight a nonobvious interplay between topology and underlying update rule.},

Unlike the existing asynchronous premise strategies that are designed based on inequality constraints between the MFs in the systems and those in the residual generators, an improved matching MF method is proposed, and the equality constraints are established under the proposed technical framework, such that the MFs of the residual generator can be obtained directly without calculation.

To alleviate this problem, a Relationship-Aligned Transfer Learning (aRATL) algorithm is proposed in this paper, in which the transfer learning process is implemented across different datasets. Whereas in some real scenarios, relevance between alternative source datasets and the target dataset may be ambiguous. For addressing this challenge, instead of calculating similarities at the data level, RATL tends to select the source model whose parameters facilitate the completion of the target task. The knowledge transfer in RATL contains representation relationship-aligned and regression relationship-aligned stages. The former one aims to enhance the representation ability of the target model by aligning relationships, in the form of triplets, between source and target models. The latter one aims to borrow regression experiences from the source model. Since predictions obtained by the source regression model are not always precise, RATL stresses the good results, but ignores the bad ones. Effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is underpinned by extensive experiments on five benchmark time series datasets, compared with several other state-of-the-art methods.},

First of all, a novel Explanation Generation Model (EGM) is proposed to automatically boost textual information for the sparse and incomplete tags based on an extra lexical database with human knowledge. Then, a novel clustering algorithm called Group Constrained Information Maximization (GCIM) is proposed to learn image categories. In this algorithm, a new type of constraint named group level side information is unprecedentedly defined to bridge the well-known heterogeneity gap between visual and textual modalities. Finally, an interactive draw-and-merge optimization method is proposed to ensure an optimal solution.

  abstract     = {Rumor detection is increasingly important in we-media. Most existing rumor detection models focus on mining features of text content, user profiles and propagation patterns. However, these models lack an efficient way to integrate information from multiple resources and have poor performance or low generalization on unseen data because they tend to capture event-specific features contained in visible data. In this study, we propose an end-to-end M ulti-channel G raph AT tention network with E vent- S haring M odule named MGAT-ESM. First, we parallelly build three subgraphs to model the propagation structures of source tweets and their responses, the relationships of source tweets and their words, and those of source tweets and their related users, respectively. We then design a path embedding method to learn the semantic information of propagation structures, and use graph attention neural network as a backbone to learn the representations of the other two subgraphs, and then aggregate the embedding representations of these three-channel subgraphs with attention mechanism. Moreover, for learning event-invariant features in different rumors, we add an event-sharing module to the backbone network . Finally, we combine the learnt event-invariant features with the aggregated representations to get the final predictions. Experiments on two real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MGAT-ESM achieves the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a low-cost, easy-to-use imaging alternative that can be used to diagnose/screen pulmonary abnormalities due to infectious diseaseX: Covid-19, Pneumonia and Tuberculosis (TB). Not limited to binary decisions (with respect to healthy cases) that are reported in the state-of-the-art literature, we also consider non–healthy CXR screening using a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) with a reduced number of epochs and parameters. On three diverse publicly accessible and fully categorized datasets, for non–healthy versus healthy CXR screening, the proposed DNN produced the following accuracies: 99.87\% on Covid-19 versus healthy, 99.55\% on Pneumonia versus healthy, and 99.76\% on TB versus healthy datasets. On the other hand, when considering non–healthy CXR screening, we received the following accuracies: 98.89\% on Covid-19 versus Pneumonia, 98.99\% on Covid-19 versus TB, and 100\% on Pneumonia versus TB. To further precisely analyze how well the proposed DNN worked, we considered well-known DNNs such as ResNet50, ResNet152V2, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. Our results are comparable with the current state-of-the-art, and as the proposed CNN is light, it could potentially be used for mass screening in resource-constraint regions.},

  abstract     = {Spatial co-location pattern (SCP) mining discovers subsets of spatial feature types whose objects frequently co-locate in a geographic space. Many existing methods treat the space as homogeneous, use absolute Euclidean distance to measure the neighbor relationship between objects and use a participation index to measure the prevalence of SCPs. Several issues arise: (1) it may be that the distance between objects cannot be accurately defined since it is a relative and fuzzy concept; (2) the degree of neighborliness and sharing relationships between objects are neglected; (3) current methods for collecting participating objects by generating candidate table instances utilizing combined search techniques are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method based on fuzzy grid cliques to find all prevalent SCPs. Specifically, fuzzy theory is introduced to define the proximity between objects. The fuzzy participating contribution index (FPCI) is defined to measure the prevalence of SCPs, and it considers both the neighbor degree and sharing relationship between objects. Based on the defined proximity, a basic mining framework based on fuzzy grid cliques is proposed. We first design a naive algorithm based on the participating objects’ filtering and verification called POFV, which uses a fuzzy grid clique search technology instead of combination search to collect participating objects and avoids enumerating all table instances. To solve a dilemma within POFV, we develop a maximal fuzzy grid cliques search based algorithm called MFGC, which can effectively reuse information. Experiments on both real and synthetic data sets verify the superiority of our proposed approaches, by showing that MFGC greatly outperforms the baseline algorithm and more efficiently captures SCPs.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a state estimation-based robust optimal control strategy for influenza epidemics in an interactive human society in the presence of modeling uncertainties. Interactive society is influenced by random entrance of individuals from other human societies whose effects can be modeled as a non-Gaussian noise. Since only the number of exposed and infected humans can be measured, the states of the influenza epidemics are first estimated by an extended maximum correntropy Kalman filter (EMCKF) to provide a robust state estimation in the presence of the non-Gaussian noise. An online quadratic program (QP) optimization is then synthesized subject to a robust control Lyapunov function (RCLF) to minimize susceptible and infected humans, while minimizing and bounding the rates of vaccination and antiviral treatment. The main contribution of this work is twofold. First, the joint QP-RCLF-EMCKF strategy meets multiple design specifications such as state estimation, tracking, pointwise control optimality , and robustness to parameter uncertainty and state estimation errors that have not been achieved simultaneously in previous studies. Second, the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB)/convergence of all error trajectories is guaranteed by using a Lyapunov stability argument. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves appropriate tracking and state estimation performance with good robustness.},

However, the pre-training of the teacher network is unnecessary if the training process is not complicated so that it is meaningful to joint optimize the teacher-student network. In our application, the teacher-student framework is used to extract quality-related representation information for soft sensors. The objective is to maximize the mutual information of representation information and supervision information, in which the inconsistency of distributions between observed information and supervisory information is modeled as isotropic Gaussian noise . The objective is decoupled through analysis under some approximate assumptions so that the alternative iteration method can be used to update the parameters of the model. The proposed quality-related feature extraction method is applied to soft sensors combined with a traditional just-in-time learning method.

While various imputation methods are available for metrically scaled variables, methods for categorical data are scarce. An imputation method that has been shown to work well for high dimensional metrically scaled variables is the imputation by nearest neighbor methods . In this paper, we propose a weighted nearest neighbors approach to impute missing values in categorical variables in high dimensional datasets. The proposed method explicitly uses the information on the association among attributes. Using different simulation settings, the performance is compared with available imputation methods . A variety of real data sets , containing heart, DNA, and lymphatic cancer, is also used to support the results obtained by simulations.

Firstly, we give the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix based on additive consistency. Then, based on this matrix, we construct the concept of ξ ξ -similarity class, and define a new relative loss function. Subsequently, we describe the detailed decision-making processes of the newly proposed three-way MCDM method. Further, through the trainer selection problem, we verify the feasibility of the method. Comparative analyses show that our method has stronger decision-making function than some existing methods. Experimental analyses show that our method is stable in ranking the considered objects and selecting the optimal object. Moreover, the proposed method can not only provide reasonable ranking decision suggestion for decision-makers, but also can meet the decision-makers’ preference in the classification decision.},

This limitation adversely affects subspace embedding, particularly when significant variances in view-specific feature characteristics are present. In this paper, a unified subspace-based self-weighted multiview learning framework (SSMVL) is proposed for instance retrieval. In contrast to the previous methods in which the variances in multiview features are ignored, the self-weighted learning mechanism is integrated into the multiview subspace learning framework such that the weights of different views are adaptively learned instead of empirically assigned. In addition, the proposed SSMVL approach falls into the unsupervised learning category and is thus independent of massive amounts of labeled data resulting from labor-intensive annotation. In this study, the extension of SSMVL to the Hamming subspace learning paradigm is also explored for efficient retrieval. Experiments on five public benchmarks reveal that the self-weighted learning strategy plays a beneficial role in multiview fusion, and our method achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.},

Although previous models have achieved considerable results, their capabilities have been limited by the basic paradigm of characterizing each user’s profile with only his/her sequential behaviors. This paper considers collaborative information over users to solve the problem. Specifically, we first reorganize all interactions as a multiplex directed heterogeneous graph (named sequential graph) to depict each user’s sequential behaviors and all users’ collaborative interactions. Second, we propose a generic vectorization algorithm to address the challenge of multiplex edges. The algorithm can implement arbitrary graph attention networks on complex graphs without graph simplification. Finally, we propose a novel sequential graph attention network (SGAT) that controls information to attentively propagate through directed heterogeneous edges. Based on the sequential graph and the vectorization algorithm, SGAT infers each user’s dynamic preference by capturing high-order sequential information among items and exploiting both latitudinally and longitudinally collaborative information over users. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of SGAT. The sequential graph provides an alternative way to organize users’ sequential behaviors and the vectorization algorithm can promote the development of graph mining by retaining topological structures of complex graphs.},

This paper firstly regards the above-mentioned factors as forces acting on particles of PSO: interaction, damping, randomness and external forces. Based on this mechanical analogy, a novel stochastic composite dynamic model (SCDM) for PSO is proposed which can be classified into two parts: diffusion process and drift process. The diffusion process can not be easily obtained by analytical analysis, but its approximate distribution can be experimentally justified to obey Gaussian model, and the drift process is partly determined by its optimization function.To analyze the influence on PSO from the external environment, linear and quadratic optimization functions are chose to simplify the analysis. And the SCMD’s stability is discussed via constructing the responding Lyapunov functions . We conclude that the gradient of linear function only decides the uniform ultimate bound while the gradient of quadratic function affects the stable conditions besides the uniform ultimate bound. Furthermore, the stable point of PSO is proved to be the optimum of quadratic function. The convergence time is also discussed to measure PSO’s performance.},

To overcome this problem, the Type-1 fuzzy regression functions approach uses fuzzy functions instead of relations, unlike many fuzzy inference systems that operate on a rule base and establish a compound relation between the input and output of the system. One of the most important success criteria of Type-1 fuzzy regression functions is the type of clustering method . The Gustafson Kessel clustering algorithm has no limitations unlike the fuzzy clustering algorithm and can recognize ellipsoidal clusters. In this study, the Gustafson Kessel clustering algorithm is used instead of the fuzzy clustering algorithm and thus the membership values of the input set are obtained with the Gustafson Kessel clustering algorithm in the structure of the fuzzy regression functions approach.

  abstract     = {Pairwise comparison matrices are often used in multicriteria decision making (MCDM). The most critical part of this technique is the inconsistency, which emerges for logical reasons but can cause significant problems during the decision making process. Hence it is necessary to keep inconsistency below an acceptable threshold. In order to support the decision maker (DM) in making a rational decision, we must keep in mind the following: Our suggestion should be as close to the DM’s original result as possible, moreover it should have as low inconsistency as possible. We have studied various linear programming (LP) models that are used for reducing the inconsistency of pairwise comparison matrices (PCM) (Bozóki et al., 2011, 2015). These models, however aim at fulfilling only one of the previously mentioned two goals at a time. Therefore, the optimal solutions given may differ from each in the other respect, which is not taken as an objective but as a constraint in the model. So, they cannot be considered as equally good optimal solutions from a wider perspective. Based on our experiences concerning these models, we have developed a mixed-integer linear-fractional programming (MILFP) model that takes both mentioned goals as objectives by combining them into a linear-fractional objective function. We also provide the linear analogue (LA) of our MILFP model using an appropriate adaptation and combination of the Charnes-Cooper transformation and Glover’s linearization scheme.},

This paper proposes a multiple surrogates and offspring-assisted differential evolution (MSODE) algorithm for high-dimensional expensive problems. Ensemble models consisting of multiple base models are built based on bagging. The ensemble models contribute toward reducing the variations of predictions and the uncertainty of base models. The algorithm proposes a multiple-offspring evolution strategy in which it generates multiple offspring for each parent individual to enhance the search ability of the population. The appropriate number of offspring was investigated, considering the tradeoff between optimization results and efficiency. MSODE consists of a global prescreening search, local search, and uncertainty prescreening search. The global prescreening search adopts a global ensemble to prescreen promising offspring. The local search accelerates the convergence by searching for the optimum of a local ensemble. The uncertainty prescreening search requires a number of fitness evaluations that slightly deteriorate the results. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to determine the optimal parameter settings. MSODE was compared with meta -heuristic algorithms and SAEAs on a series of benchmark problems. The results show that MSODE behaves better than most algorithms and is competitive against the best ones.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are used in many tasks because they provide a probabilistic representation of deep learning models by placing a distribution over the model parameters. Although BNNs are a more robust deep learning paradigm than vanilla deep neural networks , their ability to handle adversarial attacks in practice remains limited. In this study, we propose a novel multi-task adversarial training approach for improving the adversarial robustness of BNNs. Specifically, we first generate diverse and stronger adversarial examples for adversarial training by maximising a multi-task loss. This multi-task loss is a combination of the unsupervised feature scattering loss and supervised margin loss. Then, we find the model parameters by minimising another multi-task loss composed of the feature loss and variational inference loss. The feature loss is defined based on distance ℓ p , which measures the difference between the two feature representations extracted from the clean and adversarial examples . Minimising the feature loss improves the feature similarity and helps the model learn more robust features, resulting in enhanced robustness. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets in white-box and black-box attack scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the adversarial robustness compared with several state-of-the-art defence methods.},

  abstract     = {The nuclear norm-based convex surrogate of the rank function has been widely used in compressive sensing (CS) to exploit the sparsity of nonlocal similar patches in an image. However, this method treats different singular values equally and thus may produce a result far from the optimum one. In order to alleviate the limitations of the nuclear norm, different singular values should be treated differently. The reason is that large singular values can be used to retrieve substantial contents of an image, while small ones may contain noisy information. In this paper, we propose a model via non-convex weighted Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) prior. Our motivation is that SCAD shrinkage behaves like a soft shrinkage operator for small enough inputs, whereas for large enough ones, it leaves the input intact and behaves like hard shrinkage. For moderate input values, SCAD makes a good balance between soft shrinkage and hard shrinkage. Numerically, the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is adopted to split the original problem into several sub-problems with closed-form solutions. We further analyze the convergence of the proposed method under mild conditions. Various experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms many existing state-of-the-art CS methods.},

The recommender system supports the users’ decision making by recommending items that are more likely to be preferred. Many studies in the field of deep learning-based recommender systems have attempted to capture the complex interactions between users’ and items’ features for accurate recommendation. In this paper, we propose a recommender system based on the convolutional neural network using the outer product matrix of features and cross convolutional filters . The proposed method can deal with the various types of features and capture the meaningful higher-order interactions between users and items, giving greater weight to important features. Moreover, it can alleviate the overfitting problem since the proposed method includes the global average or max pooling instead of the fully connected layers in the structure. Experiments showed that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods, by capturing important interactions and alleviating the overfitting issue.},

  abstract     = {Recently, one-step clustering methods have shown good performance. However, very few one-step approaches have addressed the multi-view case, where an instance may have multiple representations. Data can be represented with multiple heterogeneous views. Clustering with multiple views faces the challenge of how to combine all the different views. A general scheme is to represent the views by view-based graphs and/or a consensus graph. Graphs can be well suited for clustering problems since they can capture the local and global structure of the data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to one-step graph-based multi-view clustering. In contrast to existing graph-based one-step clustering methods, our proposed method introduces two key innovations. First, we build an additional graph by using the cluster label correlation to the graphs associated with the data space. Second, a smoothing constraint is exploited to constrain the cluster-label matrix and make it more consistent with the original data graphs as well as with and label graphs. Experimental results on several public datasets show the efficiency of the proposed approach. All cluster evaluation metrics show significant improvement by applying our method to different types and sizes of datasets. The average improvement (across all datasets) is the difference between the indicator obtained by our approach and the indicator obtained by the most competitive method. The average improvement is approximately 4\%, 2\%, 3\%, and 2\% for the Accuracy indicator, the Normalized Mutual Information indicator, the Purity indicator, and the Adjusted Rand index , respectively.},

The focus of representation learning on graphs has focused mainly on shallow (node-centric) or deep (graph-based) learning approaches. While there have been approaches that work on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks with multi-typed nodes and edges, there is a gap in learning edge representations. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised inductive method called AttrE2Vec , which learns a low-dimensional vector representation for edges in attributed networks. It systematically captures the topological proximity, attributes affinity, and feature similarity of edges. Contrary to current advances in edge embedding research, our proposal extends the body of methods providing representations for edges, capturing graph attributes in an inductive and unsupervised manner. Experimental results show that, compared to contemporary approaches, our method builds more powerful edge vector representations, reflected by higher quality measures (AUC, accuracy) in downstream tasks as edge classification and edge clustering. It is also confirmed by analyzing low-dimensional embedding projections.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many graph-based tasks. Much work is dedicated to empowering GNNs with adaptive locality ability, which enables the measurement of the importance of neighboring nodes to the target node by a node-specific mechanism. However, the current node-specific mechanisms are deficient in distinguishing the importance of nodes in the topology structure. We believe that the structural importance of neighboring nodes is closely related to their importance in aggregation. In this paper, we introduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the strength of the structural connection of pairwise nodes. We propose a curvature graph neural network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality ability of GNNs by leveraging the structural properties of graph curvature. To improve the adaptability of curvature on various datasets, we explicitly transform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary negative curvature processing module and curvature normalization module. Then, we conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that CGNN effectively exploits the topology structure information and that the performance is significantly improved. CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node classification benchmark datasets. This study provides a deepened understanding of how to utilize advanced topology information and assign the importance of neighboring nodes from the perspective of graph curvature and encourages bridging the gap between graph theory and neural networks .

  abstract     = {Hierarchical secret sharing is an important key management technique since it is specially customized for hierarchical organizations with different departments allocated with different privileges, such as the government agencies or companies. Hierarchical access structures have been widely adopted in secret sharing schemes , where efficiency is the primary consideration for various applications. How to design an efficient hierarchical secret sharing scheme is an important issue. A famous hierarchical secret sharing (HSS) scheme was proposed by Tassa based on Birkhoff interpolation. Later, based on the same method, many other HSS schemes were proposed. However, these schemes all depend on Polya’s condition, which is a necessary condition, not a sufficient condition. It cannot guarantee that Tassa’s HSS scheme always exists. Furthermore, this condition needs to check the non-singularity of many matrices. We propose a hierarchical multi-secret sharing scheme based on the linear homogeneous recurrence (LHR) relations and the one-way function. In our scheme, we select m linearly independent homogeneous recurrence relations . The participants in the highly-ranked subsets γ 1 , γ 2 , ⋯ , γ j - 1 γ1,γ2,⋯,γj-1 join in the j th subset to construct the j th LHR relation. In addition, the proposed hierarchical multi-secret sharing scheme just requires one share for each participant. Besides, our scheme is both perfect and ideal. Furthermore, our scheme avoids many checks of the non-singularity of many matrices in the presented hierarchical secret sharing schemes . Although we need to publish more public values, our scheme reduces the computational complexity of the hierarchical secret sharing schemes from exponential time to polynomial time , i.e., O ( n k m - 1 log n ) O(nkm-1logn) , which is relatively more efficient than schemes in the literature.},

Since RS requires tremendous user data to provide personalized information services, the issue of data privacy has gained prominence. Although the differential privacy (DP) technique has been widely applied to RS, the requirement of nonnegativity makes it difficult to successfully incorporate DP into NMF. In this paper, a differentially private NMF (DPNMF) method is proposed by perturbing the coefficients of the polynomial expression of the objective function, which achieves a good trade-off between privacy protection and recommendation quality. Moreover, to alleviate the influence of the noises added by DP on the items with sparse ratings, an imputation-based DPNMF (IDPNMF) method is proposed. Theoretic analyses and experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed schemes have good performance and can achieve better recommendation quality on large-scale datasets.

  abstract     = {The design and utilization of suitable fractal structures is one of the prominent areas of security for the protection of digital data. This paper proposes a generalized fusion fractal structure by combining two one-dimensional fractals as seed functions from a larger spectrum of fractal functions. A fusion fractal termed as PLFF is formulated by combining traditional Phoenix and Lambda fractals. Improved randomized phase space, self-similar structure on various magnification scales, and fractional dimension are found in the resultant PLFF fractal. The capacity of PLFF to create a pseudo-random number (PRN) sequence in both integer and binary format is validated by its increased complexity and enhanced chaotic range. The generated PRN sequences feature a significant degree of uncorrelation and randomness. A novel image encryption algorithm based on the new PLFF fractal function is proposed which utilizes a generated PRN sequence as secret key. Standard security evaluations such as histogram variance, NPCR and UACI tests for plain-image sensitivity, key sensitivity, information entropy, pixel correlation, and noise and data loss, etc. are used to analyze the performance of the proposed encryption algorithm. The simulation results revealed performance indicators such as entropies &gt; 7.997, NPCR &gt; 96.6, UACI &gt; 33.5, high throughput of ∼ 6MBps, and highly uncorrelated neighboring pixels in encrypted images. The findings are also compared with some current image encryption schemes, demonstrating that the proposed digital image encryption algorithm performs well.},

  abstract     = {The interactions among the gauged data in most exiting real-life cases are correlative inevitably given the complicated behavior of process systems, that is the observed input data should better be interpreted as generating from joint interaction of static and dynamic feature sources. Therefore, the traditional single static-based or dynamic-based methods will inevitably lose some of the important information features, which will result in unsatisfactory monitoring results. Motivated by this, we expect to divide the data into static and dynamic features to perform separate modeling. Hence, the kernel slow feature analysis method is proposed to achieve this purpose. The output from the KSFA model can be divided into static and dynamic sources according to the dynamic characteristics. Then, in order to extract the unsupervised dynamic features, a novel deep RNN-LSTM autoencoder model is developed, which includes three components: data conversion, deep model construction, and feature removal. Moreover, we use a stacked autoencoder for static sources to learn static features and construct high-order models for fault detection . Based on the well-built detection system formed by the joint deep models, dual-scale decision-making is integrated by the Bayesian inference method. Finally, the superiority of the proposal can be shown in two processes.},

  abstract     = {The control of Variable-Speed Wind-Turbines (VSWT) extracting electrical power from the wind kinetic energy are composed of subsystems that need to be controlled jointly, namely the blade pitch and the generator torque controllers. Previous state of the art approaches decompose the joint control problem into independent control subproblems , each with its own control subgoal, carrying out separately the design and tuning of a parameterized controller for each subproblem. Such approaches neglect interactions among subsystems which can introduce significant effects. This paper applies Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (ACRL) for the joint control problem as a whole, carrying out the simultaneous control parameter optimization of both subsystems without neglecting their interactions, aiming for a globally optimal control of the whole system. The innovative control architecture uses an augmented input space so that the parameters can be fine-tuned for each working condition. Validation results conducted on simulation experiments using the state-of-the-art OpenFAST simulator show a significant efficiency improvement relative to the best state of the art controllers used as benchmarks, up to a 22\% improvement in the average power error performance after ACRL training.},

To apply machine learning to new tasks, suitable algorithm and hyperparameters selection techniques, which is known as Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization problem , are in demand. In the field of data analysis, how to automate the algorithm selection process has become a hot research topic in recent years. Most of the existing approaches are developed under the background of Automated Machine Learning with high time or space complexity. To alleviate the issue, an approach extracts and learns from prior experience based on meta-learning theory named Auto-CASH is proposed in this paper. One of the major drawbacks of existing meta-learning methods is that they rely too much on human expertise to extract and filter knowledge that guides subsequent training. Auto-CASH can automatically select features of tasks by introducing a reinforcement learning strategy. Thus Auto-CASH becomes less dependent on human expertise. Besides, two pruning strategies when processing Hyperparameter Optimization to improve efficiency are firstly proposed. Extensive experiments on classification tasks are conducted and results demonstrate that Auto-CASH outperforms state-of-the-art CASH approaches and popular AutoML systems with less time cost.},

However, these approaches deal with these two problems separately. In this paper, we propose a hybrid attention network (HAN) by employing progressive embedding scale-context (PES) information, which enables the network to simultaneously suppress noise and adapt head scale variation. We build the hybrid attention mechanism through two parallel spatial attention and channel attention modules, which makes the network focus more on the human head area and reduce the interference of background objects. In addition, we embed certain scale-context to the hybrid attention along the spatial and channel dimensions to alleviate the counting errors caused by the variation of perspective and head scale. Finally, we propose a progressive learning strategy through cascading multiple hybrid attention modules with embedding different scale contexts, which can gradually integrate different scale-context information into the current feature map from global to local. Ablation experiments show that the network architecture can gradually learn multiscale features and suppress background noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HANet obtains state-of-the-art counting performance on five mainstream datasets.},

In this paper, we present a novel continual learning model to solve the challenging problem of real-world images classification . The proposed model is capable of learning continuously by utilizing the previously learned knowledge. It can handle both multi-task and single incremental task scenarios as opposed to various existing models that cover only the multi-task scenarios.

The proposed classifier avoids the undesired structural redundancy issue in previous work. Applying this classifier in standard training on clean data is sufficient to ensure the high accuracy and good robustness of the model. Moreover, when extra adversarial samples are used, better robustness can be further obtained with the help of a special worst-case loss.

The proposed framework learns a task-specific ensemble of sub-networks in different depths, and is able to adapt the model architecture for the given data. The task-specific ensemble parameters are learned simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing a single loss function defined with respect to the end task. The hierarchical model structure is able to share both general and specific distributed representations to capture the inherent relationships between tasks.

In the outlier detection phase, we design four deviation indices to accurately measure the deviation degree of each transaction, and then the transactions in the top k ranked are identified as potential outliers.

This study proposes the annealing combinable Gaussian process , an integrated solution for identifying key variables and constructing the high-precision surrogate model. Firstly, to identify redundant variables, this study optimises variables selection with a modified simulated annealing algorithm over the complete model space. This process is called the outer loop. Secondly, to improve the model accuracy and structure, this study constructs a non-parametric Gaussian process model with additive or multiplicative kernel, effectively extracting high-order interactions. Simultaneously, a Markov chain is proposed to sample the model space. The conditional entropy is used as the scoring rule for the simulated annealing algorithm of the outer loop. It is named the inner loop. This study also discusses the rationality of conditional entropy as a criterion. The annealing combinable Gaussian process performs well in various application scenarios, including regression and classification problems.

This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization-based dynamic ensemble (BODE) that overcomes the single model-based methods limitation and provides a dynamic ensemble forecast combination for TS with time-varying underlying patterns. The proposed BODE method combines ten disparate model candidates, including statistical methods, machine learning (ML)-based models, and the latest deep neural networks (DNN). We take into consideration their prediction performance for the recent past to adjust their weights for combination and apply the model-based Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) for the combination hyperparameter (HP) tuning to endow our method with higher adaptability and better generalization performance. Besides, the frequency impact of TS data on the ensemble forecast methods is under-researched in the current literature. Therefore, four groups of distinct seasonal TS datasets are investigated in this paper. The empirical result demonstrates that our method performs robustly better performance with the main reasons analyzed in a detailed ablation study.},

The performance of SML is further boosted by the successful introduction of graph convolutional network (GCN) for learning discriminant node representations. However, there remains much space to improve the GCN-based SML technique, particularly on how to adaptively learn optimal graph structures for multi-view graph convolutional representation learning and make full use of the label and structure information in labeled and unlabeled multi-view samples. In this paper, we propose a novel SML approach named semi-supervised multi-view graph convolutional networks (SMGCN) for webpage classification. It contains a multi-view graph construction module and a semi-supervised multi-view graph convolutional representation learning module, which are integrated into a unified network architecture . The former aims to obtain optimal graph structure for each view. And the latter performs graph convolutional representation learning for each view, and provides an inter-view attention scheme to fuse multi-view representations. Network training is guided by the losses defined on both label and feature spaces, such that the label and structure information in labeled and unlabeled data is fully explored. Experiments on two widely used webpage datasets demonstrate that SMGCN can achieve state-of-the-art classification performance.},

  abstract     = {For intelligent transportation research, the detection of companion vehicle patterns aids in excavating behavioral relation between vehicles. This paper builds a dynamic license plate corpus based on streaming automatic number plate recognition data and combines the monitoring cameras character division to mine companion vehicle groups in real time. First, we establish the traffic flow graph based on vehicle trajectory data , and the improved PageRank algorithm is used to obtain the influence of the monitoring cameras. Second, the time-sliding window mechanism in Spark Streaming is applied to the streaming data , and the creation and updating of vehicle dynamic license plate corpus are completed according to the driving trajectory data . Finally, the plate-number dynamic graph computing algorithm is proposed to establish the dynamic relation graph between vehicles based on dynamic corpus and character identification of monitoring cameras. The camera characters are used as the influencing factor to correlate with the graph formed by vehicle nodes. The companion groups are obtained by real-time calculation of the trim and weight in the graph. Experimental analysis on the real license plate recognition dataset shows that the proposed model can effectively reduce the complexity of data processing and can detect companion vehicle groups in real time.},

It was confronted with five strong competitors that combine the state-of-the-art attribute selection proposal with three classical single-way clustering proposals, a recent quantum-inspired one, and a recent deep-learning one. The evaluation focused on exploring their ability to find compact and isolated clusterings as well as the extent to which such clusterings can be considered good classifications. The statistical analyses conducted on the experimental results prove that it ranks the first regarding effectiveness using six standard coefficients and it is very efficient in terms of CPU time, not to mention that it did not result in any degraded clusterings or timeouts .

Hence, there are many key issues (such as reductions, neighborhoods and approximations) have to do with them in CbRSs. However, it is complicated and time-consuming to use set approaches to compute them in a large cardinal covering approximation space. So the matrix approaches have been used to calculate them by which computers can implement the corresponding calculations easily. Based on the previous research work and inspired by the demand of knowledge discovery under large scale covering information systems, we propose two new matrix methods to calculate MinD and MaxD in CbRSs in this paper. Firstly, a note on the existing methods (matrix approach-1 and approach-2) is presented. Secondly, a new matrix, called grained matrix, is presented. After combining grained matrices and the mean of “sum”, the new matrix approach-1 is presented to calculate MinD and MaxD. Thirdly, three new matrix operations and the notion of complementary matrix are given which can simplify the calculation of computers. Based on new operations, we present the new matrix approach-2 to compute MinD and MaxD. Finally, the computational efficiency of the presented approaches are shown and compared with other methods by experiments on several UCI data sets.},

It’s well known that a classical fuzzy relational system usually consists of two composed operations. The most commonly used composed operations consists of max–min and max-product. But in our introduced fuzzy relational system , there exist three composed operations, i.e., addition-Łukasiewicz-product. Due to the specific composed operations, the construction for the corresponding solution set is much different. For a consistent fuzzy relation inequality system, composed by addition-Łukasiewicz-product, there exist some maximal solutions and a unique minimum solution. Especially, the number of the maximal solutions might be infinite. In fact, the solution set can be constructed by means of these maximal solutions and the sole minimum solution. Properties of the solutions to an addition-Łukasiewicz-product system is investigated. Following the presented properties, we further study the corresponding single-level and bilevel optimization problems . Two effective resolution approaches are developed and demonstrated by some numerical experiments.},

Instead of working with 3D structures, we process 2D image sequences in the sagittal plane . First, we divide images into different groups such that, in each group, shapes and structures of brain boundaries have similar appearances. Second, a modified version of ASM is used to detect brain boundaries by utilizing prior knowledge of each group. Finally, CNN and post-processing methods, including Conditional Random Field (CRF), Gaussian processes , and several special rules are applied to refine the segmentation contours. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms by a significant margin in all experiments.},

  abstract     = {Shadowed set approximation form a cornerstone for the explainable decision advice provided by shadowed C means (SCM) clustering in unsupervised learning . Due to its advantage of managing uncertainty in fuzzy clustering , it has been used in data classification . Existing SCM clustering method requires the overall amount of uncertainty associated with a fuzzy cluster c k ck to be preserved in its boundary region. This requirement may suffer serious risk of having high number of unclassified patterns, especially when the uncertainty in c k ck is very high. Consequently, the ensuing clustering may not adequately maximize the inter-cluster separation necessary for achieving optimum cluster validity results. To tackle this problem, this paper considers new SCM clustering methods arising from (i) trade-off between uncertain and certain regions, which is necessary for refraining from making uncertain classification as much as possible, (ii) measure of sharpness balance, which helps to leverage on the location of a pattern from borderline and identify included or excluded patterns by means of their location from borderline, (iii) measure of gradualness balance, which exploits the degree of transition of a pattern out of or into c k ck . Each method comes with some advantages. For instance, the first and third methods may minimize the overall amount of unclassified patterns. To provide an overall evaluation of the performance of the proposed methods, a comparative study with some other shadowed set-based optimization methods are involved by considering some data sets from UCI Machine Learning repository. Friedman testing followed by Holm-Bonferroni testing are also exploited to provide statistical analysis on the performance significance of the compared methods.},

This paper presents a scenario-based approach for characterizing sixty-one commonly used measures and revealing their relationships in three steps. The first step generates a set of 969 three-probability scenarios, S = { s | s = ( p ( A ) , p ( B ) , p ( A , B ) ) ∧ p ( A ) , p ( B ) , p ( A | B ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] ∧ p ( A , B ) ⩽ min ( p ( A ) , p ( B ) ) } S={s|s=(p(A),p(B),p(A,B))∧p(A),p(B),p(A|B)∈[0,1]∧p(A,B)⩽min(p(A),p(B))} , in consideration of all possible situations in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 with a step of 0.05, excluding infinity and not-a-number cases. In the second step, 937,992 pairs of scenarios are enumerated, and for each scenario pair s 1 s1 and s 2 s2 , the values of a measure ( M M ) of s 1 s1 and s 2 s2 , i.e., M ( s 1 ) M(s1) and M ( s 2 ) M(s2) , are compared with the result of greater-than ( M ( s 1 ) M(s1) &gt; M ( s 2 ) M(s2) ), smaller-than ( M ( s 1 ) M(s1) M(s2) ), or equal-to ( M ( s 1 ) M(s1) = M ( s 2 ) M(s2) ) for characterizing the measure. The final step is based on three types of relations: (1) behavior-based, (2) correlation-based, and (3) association-based similarity relations. The behavior of measures is depicted using nine common algebraic/statistical properties and four special condition properties, i.e., zero, min–max, infinity, and not-a-number of the measures. Similarities among the measures can be examined by grouping measures based on their properties. With three correlation functions, i.e., correlation coefficient , joint entropy , and mutual information, a correlation analysis was performed to discover relations among interestingness measures in the form of dendrograms and clusters with thresholding . Finally, the details of the relations among these interestingness measures are explored with association rule mining. Besides support, confidence, and lift, we propose five types of rules, i.e. same-directionrule (S-rule), opposite-direction rule (O-rule), equal-both rule (E-rule), equal-left rule (EL-rule),and equal-right rule (ER-rule) for a five-gradient comparison of any two measures to outline their similarities and dissimilarities in five directions.},

The proposed methodology is based on axiomatic distances rooted in social choice theory . Moreover, it adequately deals with highly incomplete evaluations, tied values, and other complicating aspects of group decision-making contexts. We illustrate the practicality of the proposed methodology in a case study involving an academic student paper competition. The methodology’s advantages and computational aspects are further explored via synthetic instances sampled from distributions parametrized by ground truths and varying noise levels. These results show that multimodal aggregation effectively extracts a collective truth from noisy information sources and successfully captures the distinctive evaluation qualities of rating and ranking preference data.},

Then, the properties of the ratio of the sum of elements to the constraint within its cut were demonstrated, and to this cut (the abstraction class) an interval on the real number axis was assigned. To illustrate the obtained results, a mutation tree is used as an image of a unit hypercube .

  abstract     = {Multi-source streaming feature selection in an online manner has attracted considerable attention, from researchers because it can reduce the dimensionality of heterogeneous big data. However, traditional online algorithms such as Alpha-investing , Online Streaming Feature Selection ( OSFS ), Online Group Feature Selection ( OGFS ) and Scalable and Accurate OnLine Approach ( SAOLA ) consider only a single data source with fixed instances, and are not directly applicable to multi-source data. Multi-source Causal Feature Selection ( MCFS ) can search for an invariant set in multiple interventional datasets. However, fixed feature spaces are restrained, and exactly these same features are required among multi-source data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method known as Multi-source Streaming Feature Selection ( MSFS ) to tackle the feature selection problem for multi-source streaming features. The MSFS algorithm addresses a new feature from a random source in three phases: relevance, intra-source redundancy, and inter-source redundancy analyses. That is, MSFS attempts to mine the potential relationships among different data sources rather than only independently consider each data source. In particular, each new feature is analyzed online using the overlapping instances from all data sources, and the Markov blanket (MB) of the target variable is dynamically adjusted. To evaluate the performance of the MSFS algorithm, we compare it with that of the abovementioned algorithms on 14 datasets and two real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that MSFS outperforms the existing algorithms in classification accuracy and number of selected features.},

  abstract     = {The Likert scale is an extensively used psychometric scale in questionnaire-based research. It is the most widely used approach for measuring responses in survey research. The data collected using the Likert scale is somewhat ambiguous in terms of data quality and latent variable assessment. Besides, there are numerous debates about the Likert scale regarding the accuracy of the data collected, the ranking order and distance between the scale options, the use of multiple scales for different questionnaires, the ability to combine scale options, the possibility of performing mathematical operations on the data collected using the Likert scale, and quantification of respondents’ negation choices. How to extract useful information from the Likert scale and resolve the aforementioned debates has been an interesting and open topic of discussion in recent years. To address this open issue, we deploy the Z-number in conjunction with the Likert scale since the former is a useful tool for generating information from objective and subjective data. A case study with numerical examples is provided to demonstrate the proposed technique. Additionally, the case study illustrates how Z-numbers might be used to resolve protracted disagreements on the usage of the Likert scale. One critical component of the proposed study is that it does not offer a new variety of scale but rather attempts to resolve long-standing controversies and issues using the conventional, regular Likert scale with Z-numbers.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been extensively studied over the last decade. Among the most successful methods, neural-based methods have changed the research landscape by bringing cutting-edge artificial neural networks (ANN) and big data to offer the best personalization users have ever experienced. However, a significant issue arose from these neural-based methods is that the increase of the model complexity directly impacts the computational cost. In general, this drawback is a consequence of the high dimensionality and sparsity of the input feature space. We believe that reducing sparsity and dimensionality of the input features is essencial to enhance accuracy while keeping computational costs low. This paper investigates an alternative modeling for the CF setting to represent users or items by using landmarks. This modeling drastically decreases the input feature space and eliminate sparsity while maintaining the underlying information needed to achieve great accuracy. Based on that, we propose a novel neural-based CF method via landmark modeling. Experiments on six real-world benchmark CF datasets were conducted by comparing the proposed method to well-known and widely-used CF methods of the state-of-the-art. The results show that the Neural Landmark method outperforms the other methods in both accuracy and computational performance.},

  abstract     = {Latent variables (LVs), representing the unobservable abstract concepts, such as patient disease and customer credit, play an important role in the simplification of network structure and improving the interpretability of Bayesian network (BN). However, LVs incorporated into BN lead to missing probability parameters due to the missing observation. As the classic method for parameter estimation for the situation with LVs, the expectation–maximization (EM) suffers high complexity and slow convergence. To this end, we propose dynamic embeddings for parameter learning of BN with LVs. Firstly, we reconstruct the E-step of EM and propose to use the dynamic embeddings to calculate the weights of fractional samples that could reduce the computational complexity of parameter learning. Secondly, we propose to construct the point mutual information (PMI) matrix to represent directed weighted graphs (DWGs) transformed from the updated parameters. Thirdly, the incremental singular value decomposition (SVD) is adopted to generate dynamic embeddings while capturing the updated parameters and preserving BN’s graphical structure. Experimental results show that our proposed methods are efficient and effective. On real-world BNs, the efficiency, convergence and accuracy of our method outperform those of the state-of-the-art methods for parameter learning of BN with multiple LVs.},

First, we draw attention to the case of nominal edit rules in particular. We point out that in many cases, starting with a set of edit rules that is as small as possible is important to improve the performance. This could be achieved by folding edit rules together. Besides that, an enhanced nominal edit rule implication algorithm is proposed, exploiting the properties of nominal edit rules. Second, we introduce ordinal edit rules as a generalization of nominal edit rules, used to capture data inconsistencies for data measured on an ordinal scale and we propose an ordinal edit rule implication algorithm. Evaluation of our methods shows promising results for both implication algorithms, with the ordinal algorithm as best performing in general. On average, our techniques improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for edit rule implication with more than 50\% 50\% .},

Recent studies have shown that the shared information from global components can enhance the forecasting performance of time series. However, existing global–local approaches treat the global factors as additional hidden states inside the model without providing global series for downstream analysis. In this study, we propose DeepGate, a novel time series forecasting framework based on the explicit global–local decomposition. To retain the global and local series property, we have built decomposition and prediction modules separately. In this way, DeepGate can produce interpretable global series for further tasks while improving forecasting performance with the aid of global and local series. In addition, to alleviate the discrepancy between the training and testing steps, we employ a denoising training technique for multi-step forecasting problems. In numerous experiments on real-world benchmarks for time series forecasting, DeepGate outperforms the baselines including existing global–local models. In particular, the experimental results on synthetic tasks demonstrate that our model can effectively extract underlying global series.},

Then, an interval observer and a state-estimate stabilizing feedback controller are jointly designed.

It overcomes the drawback of existing methods that seriously damage the spatial information of the data by converting 2D data to vectors in a preprocessing step . In particular, projection matrices are sought under the guidance of building new data representations, such that the spatial information is retained and projections are enhanced by the goal of clustering, which helps construct optimal projection directions. Moreover, to exploit nonlinear structures of the data, manifold is constructed in the projected subspace, which is adaptively updated according to the projections and less afflicted with noise and outliers of the data and thus more representative in the projected space. Hence, seeking projections, building new data representations, and learning manifold are seamlessly integrated in a single model, which mutually enhance other and lead to a powerful data representation. Comprehensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of TS-NMF in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms, which suggests high potential of the proposed method for real world applications .},

In real-world applications, predicting regression data is a common and valuable issue in decision making, especially in regard to those rare samples with extremely high or low values, such as those encountered in the fields of signal processing, finance, or meteorology. This study therefore divided its regression data into rare samples and normal samples, with self-defined relevance functions and, in addition, proposed a boosting resampling method based on a conditional variational autoencoder. The experimental results showed that when using the proposed resampling method was employed, the prediction performance of the whole testing data set was slightly increased, while the performance for the rare samples was significantly improved.},

In this article, we propose to leverage the data augmentation technique to improve the performance of multi-label learning. Specifically, we first propose a novel data augmentation approach that performs clustering on the real examples and treats the cluster centers as virtual examples, and these virtual examples naturally embody the local label correlations and label importances. Then, motivated by the cluster assumption that examples in the same cluster should have the same label, we propose a novel regularization term to bridge the gap between the real examples and virtual examples, which can promote the local smoothness of the learning function. Extensive experimental results on a number of real-world multi-label datasets clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.},

While a data set may contain several features, not all of them may be equally informative or helpful towards cluster detection. Therefore, sparse center-based clustering methods offer a way to select only those features that may be useful in identifying the clusters present in a data set. However, to automatically determine the degree to which features should be selected, these methods use the Permutation Method which involves generating and clustering multiple randomly permuted data sets, leading to much higher computation costs. In this paper, we propose an improved approach towards model selection for sparse clustering by using expressions of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) derived for the center-based clustering methods of k -Means and Fuzzy c -Means. The derived expressions of BIC require significantly lower computation costs, yet allow us to compare and select a suitable sparse clustering among several possible sparse partitions that may have selected different subsets of features. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that using BIC for model selection leads to remarkable improvements in the identification of sparse clusterings for both Sparse k -Means and Sparse Fuzzy c -Means.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems play an indispensable role in today’s online businesses. In these systems, memory-based (neighborhood-based) collaborative filtering is an important strategy to predict items as expected by users. It consists of two phases: computing the preference similarity between each pair of users in the offline phase and predicting the rating of an active user for a target item in the online phase by aggregating ratings of his/her neighbors for the target item. Previous studies on memory-based collaborative filtering have heavily concentrated on proposing methods for the computation of user preference similarity. To further improve the performance of memory-based collaborative filtering, this paper is aimed at the rating prediction phase . By optimizing a proposed objective function, the method we used in the rating prediction phase helps more accurately estimate the weight between the active user and each of his/her neighbors. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms others, especially in the case of a small and medium number of selected neighbors.},

  abstract     = {Causal feature selection has attracted much attention in recent years, since it has better robustness than the traditional feature selection. Existing causal feature selection algorithms aim to identify a Markov blanket (MB) of the class variable. The MB of the class variable implies potential local causal relations around the class variable and has been proven to be the optimal feature subset for feature selection. Since almost all existing causal feature selection methods employ conditional independence (CI) tests to learn MBs, in practical settings, existing causal feature selection algorithms encounter the problem of CI test errors, which seriously deteriorates the performance of those existing methods. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose an E rror- A ware M arkov B lanket learning (EAMB) algorithm with two novel subroutines to tackle the CI test error problem. Specifically, EAMB first identifies the MB of the class variable using one subroutine, and then utilizes the other subroutine to selectively recover the missed true MB features from the discarded features. The extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of EAMB against fourteen state-of-the-art causal feature selection algorithms and four well-established traditional feature selection methods.},

To remedy this issue, we propose a novel bi-partition assisted environmental selection strategy to settle many-objective optimization. The main idea is that the candidate set is constantly separated into two levels via the selected exemplar, in accordance with the diversity degree. Then, a predominant individual falling within the superior level is admitted to the new population. Such procedure is repeated until forming the whole population of next generation. In particular, the exemplar selection for bi-partition is self-regulated via the evolving population itself, a new adaptive scalarizing function is devised. The preselection of superior level affords diversified candidates while the survival of predominant individual strengthens convergence. Extensive experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art counterparts are conducted on a wide range of benchmark instances, numerical results confirm the competence and versatility of our design.},

  abstract     = {Learning discriminative representation is essential in many machine learning tasks. Each category has intrinsic and particular features related to the label. However, objects from different categories often share some common patterns that are independent of the label. Therefore, separating the particular and shared features will facilitate representation learning and other downstream tasks. In this study, we attempt to improve clustering accuracy by disentangling these two types of features. We introduce a generative model based on a neural network to explain observations according to the assumed underlying structures and to perform clustering simultaneously. Specifically, our proposed model, named the disentangling generative model for clustering (DGC), assumes that the observed data are generated from the concatenation of latent particular and common features that are subject to a Gaussian mixture distribution and standard Gaussian distribution , respectively. For the inference in DGC, each observation is encoded into two parts with different networks, which correspond to the approximate posterior over the particular and common features. The former is fed into a classifier, and the result serves as the clustering assignment of the observation. The DGC is optimized within the variational autoencoder framework. The empirical results show that the proposed method exhibits performance comparable with those of state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the DGC can generate class-specific samples without any label information.},

Then, a novel DET-MFAC framework under aperiodic DoS attacks is established, in which the DET mechanism is applied to save network resources. Based on the established DET-MFAC framework, a novel DET-MFAC scheme is proposed to track the reference trajectory under aperiodic DoS attacks. The main advantage of the designed control scheme is that only the input and output data of the system are used and the structure of the system is unknown for the designer, which makes the result with good robustness.

Moreover, a diffusion operation referred to as “bit reversion” in which the bits of the pixels are symmetrically reverted is proposed for manipulating the pixel value. eπ -map is exhaustively examined through bifurcation and trajectory diagrams, Lyapunov exponent (LE), sample entropy (SE), permutation entropy (PE) and 0-1 test. The encryption performance of the IEA is then investigated across various cryptanalysis such as key-space, key sensitivity, histogram, information entropy, correlation coefficient , differential attack, cropping attack, noise attack and encryption execution time. Furthermore, the results are compared with the most recent literature. It is demonstrated that eπ -map has superior hyperchaotic performance in views of ergodicity , complexity and randomness.

If there were more than t honest shareholders, the unauthenticated adversary without valid share can obtain the secret. To deal with this type of attacks, a model of ( t , m , n ) (t,m,n) group oriented secret sharing (GOSS) scheme was proposed by Miao et al. in 2015. Here the group oriented property means that if m &gt; t m&amp;gt;t parties try to reconstruct the secret, they should all have the authentic shares in advance. It was claimed by Miao et al. that the group oriented property in their GOSS schemes holds in the information-theoretic sense. In this paper, we revisit two instantiations of ( t , m , n ) (t,m,n) group oriented secret sharing schemes and show that these constructions cannot provide the so-called “group oriented property”.

  abstract     = {Electrocardiography (ECG) is a sophisticated tool for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Deep learning approaches can support MI diagnosis based on ECG data. However, due to privacy issues and the sensitive nature of ECG data, the use of deep learning methods to access large amounts of ECG data for training remains challenging. Insufficient data will lead to a decrease in diagnosis performance. In addition, most deep learning approaches are trained with multiple-lead ECG data, thereby limiting the extension to portable single-lead ECG monitoring devices. Investigating automated single-lead ECG interpretation is a continuing concern in the development of mobile and wearable ECG monitoring devices. This paper proposes an automated myocardial infarction detection model — SLC-GAN — that synthesizes single-lead ECG data with high morphological similarity through generative adversarial networks (GANs). It automatically detects MI using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with real ECG data and synthetic ECGs from the GAN. The empirical results indicate that our new SLC-GAN method performs impressively compared with other MI classification methodologies on single-lead ECG from the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The MI classification accuracy of SLC-GAN reaches 99.06\% with 5-fold cross-validation.},

To better capture the dynamic variations of user’s preference and reduce the recommendation cost, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommendation strategy from the temporal-spatial perspective. Firstly, in view of the temporality of user-item interactions, we design a granulation method based on recurrent neural network (RNN) to construct the multilevel RI.

Extensive experiments on three Movielens datasets verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed methods, and demonstrate the advantage of our recommendation strategy in both recommendation cost and recommendation quality.},

However, on the one hand, the existing review-based recommendations normally ignore the importance of sentiment words regarding the corresponding aspect words, which reflect user preference for the item aspect. On the other hand, when modeling interaction, both user-user and user-item interactions should be considered. To solve these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel sentiment-enhanced neural graph recommender by incorporating the information derived from both textual reviews and bipartite graph . Specifically, we first design a hierarchically structured attention mechanism with a sentiment auxiliary task to help the recommendation task learn user preference for different aspects of items from reviews, where the co-attention mechanism is used to select important item/user reviews for the current user/item. Second, we construct a user-item interaction graph to capture preference-based user-item interaction with social-based user-user interaction, where the graph convolutional network is used to simulate the diffusion of information. Finally, we adopt a Factorization Machine model to accomplish the recommendation task. The experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the related approaches w.r.t. rating prediction accuracy on Yelp and Amazon datasets.},

Recently, increasing metaheuristic optimization algorithms have been applied to solve wrapper FS problems. Nevertheless, the algorithms that improve existing optimizers inevitably bring higher complexity and require higher computational cost in wrapper mode. In this work, we present recursive elimination current (REC) algorithms, a novel set of algorithms for wrapper FS, which consists of the simplest feature subset representation, an ingenious structure enlightened by the recursion technique in computer science and necessary components. To some extent, the proposed algorithms, recurrent REC (REC 2 ) and distributed REC (DiREC), dispose of the issues, including but not limited to keeping diversity of population and scalability for high-dimensionality, which are often discussed in metaheuristics-based FS research. Thereinto, DiREC is a distributed computing scheme proposed to accelerate the FS process by distributing the tasks to different computing units in a cluster of computers. A series of experiments were carried out on several representative benchmark datasets, such as Madelon from UCI machine learning repository, using REC 2 and DiREC with various numbers of logical processors. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms perform efficiently in wrapper mode, and the distributed computing scheme is effective and yields computational time savings.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the solutions of fuzzy linear systems have been considered by many researchers. Most of these studies use the same extension method as Friedman et al. (1998). The standard fuzzy arithmetic based on the extension principle does not take into account all the available information, and the obtained results are more imprecise or in some cases, even incorrect. Although the obtained solutions by these methods seem to be reasonable, however sometimes the method requires lengthy procedures and is computationally not efficient. These highlighted problematic points could be our motivation for achieving a new approach to solve fully fuzzy linear systems. To this end, we are going to solve the fully fuzzy linear systems, by using the transmission-average-based fuzzy operations that have been introduced by Abbasi et al. (2015). To this purpose, a computational procedure is going to be proposed to solve these types of equations that meet the defects of previous techniques, especially the embedding method that causes a high dimensional real (non-fuzzy) system to solve. In addition, the necessary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the fuzzy solution are also going to be presented. For more illustration and investigation, it is shown that the solution of the proposed method is more realistic in comparison to other methods of solving such fuzzy linear systems.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks have been applied in recommender systems to learn the representation of users and items from a user-item graph. In the state-of-the-art, there are two major challenges in applying Graph Neural Networks to social recommendation: (i) how to accurately learn the representation of users and items from the user-item interaction graph and social graph, and (ii) based on the fact that each user is represented simultaneously by the two graphs, how to integrate the user representations learned from these two graphs. Aiming at addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a new social recommendation system called SocialLGN. In SocialLGN, the representation of each user and item is propagated in the user-item interaction graph with light graph convolutional layers; in the meantime, the user’s representation is propagated in the social graph. Based on this, a graph fusion operation is designed to aggregate user representations during propagation. The weighted sum is applied to combine the representations learned by each layer. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, and the result shows that the proposed SocialLGN outperforms the SOTA method, especially in handling the cold-start problem. Our PyTorch implemented model is available via https://github.com/leo0481/SocialLGN.},

An important question of the area concerns the possibility that certain population structures can facilitate the spreading of more cooperative behaviours associated to the sustainability and resilience of many different systems ranging from ecological to socio-economic systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to study the spreading of behaviours in structured populations by combining Evolutionary Game Theory and membrane computing. We show that there is a general way to encode Evolutionary Game Theory into membrane computing, leading to a novel computational framework which can be used to study, analyze and simulate the spreading of behaviours in structured populations organized in communicating compartments. The proposed approach allows to extend the works on membrane systems, population and ecological dynamics, and, at the same time, suggests a novel bio-inspired framework, based on formal languages theory, to investigate the dynamics of evolving structured populations.},

Many ranking approaches have been designed and extensively studied. In this paper we study two kernel ranking algorithms, the regularized least square ranking and its bias corrected version, which learn scoring functions from reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). We say a kernel is perfect for ranking if an optimal scoring function lies in the associated RKHS. It is imperfect if an optimal scoring function can be approximated by the RKHS. The two regularized kernel ranking algorithms have been shown theoretically justified and empirically effective when the kernel is perfectly chosen. In practice, however, kernels are usually selected via cross validation process. It is more common than not that the kernel is imperfectly chosen. We develop a novel leave-two-out analysis technique to evaluate the generalization performance of the two regularized ranking algorithms in this situation. We show that they are still effective and can achieve the capacity independent optimal convergence rates.},

  abstract     = {Within the past decade, social media has become a primary platform for consumption of information and current events. Unlike with traditional news sources, however, social media posts do not have to go through a rigorous validation process prior to publication. The 2019 Mueller Report illustrates how malicious actors have taken advantage of these lax requirements to sway public opinion on topics from the #blacklivesmatter movement to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Currently, social media companies rely primarily on communal-policing of misinformation; it is unlikely that this will happen with regularity. To counteract this, other literature on the topic is focused on using deep learning models to separate accurate from misleading content; however, the rapidly evolving nature of misinformation means that they will have to be retrained and redeployed on an iterative and time-consuming basis. This work, therefore, proposes a novel approach to the problem: treating misinformation as a virus. Specifically, we propose a ranking system that third-party fact checkers can utilize to prioritize posts for checking. This algorithm is then tested against multiple data sets with strong positive results, decreasing viral spread in a matter of minutes.},

After the population is converged, the diversity will be emphasized by applying the decision variable clustering method at the second stage.

In this paper, we put forward a novel approach, called multi-view support vector ordinal regression with uncertain data (MORU), which can improve the OR classifier by incorporating the multi-view information and handling the data uncertainty. In our method, a series of parallel hyperplanes are applied to separate the multi-view ordered data, and the uncertain information is considered in the input data.

This study proposes a cluster output synchronization model for MNNs, which considers the combination output behavior of the nodes in NNs clusters. Accordingly, two specific control schemes are designed: one based on feedback control involves designing a small number of controllers to reduce control costs, and the other based on adaptive control involves designing multiple adjustable controllers to increase the anti-interference capacity of the control system. Meanwhile, to facilitate synchronization in MNNs, a model relationship between MNNs and traditional NNs is investigated. By utilizing the control schemes, model relationship, and Lyapunov stability theory , sufficient conditions are obtained for validating the cluster output synchronization.

However, the CPIR protocol scans the entire data space, which causes high costs and limits the scale of CPIR-based applications. To address this problem, we propose a performance tunable Computational Private Information Retrieval (PTCPIR) model. We divide data space into subspaces and scan a subset of subspaces to achieve better performance while sacrificing some privacy. By tuning the percentage of scanned subspaces, we can achieve a tradeoff between performance and privacy. We design a hierarchical encrypted secure index to support data users to retrieve subspace information safely and efficiently, which facilitates privacy-preserving subspace information retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a novel subspace information retrieval method where the confused query keyword sequence makes servers unable to count query probability. Hence access pattern privacy is protected. Experiments on Sequoia and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our PTCPIR model provides a tunable tradeoff between performance and privacy with high efficiency and good scalability.},

However, previous GCN-based methods often experience one of the following limitations. First, GCNs usually use edges with binary weights. However, binary weights are not helpful in many tasks. Second, these GCNs only focus on extracting node features from some single words or phrases and ignore their context in the entire sentence or paragraph or only consider the information of independent phrases when determining the relation between two graph edges overlooking the semantic relation among these phrases. Finally, no studies simultaneously use the information on the context, the semantic relation, and the sentiment knowledge among words or phrases to build GCNs for aspect-level sentiment analysis. Therefore, to resolve these limitations, in this study, we propose a new method, the CANN-SSCG model, as follows. First, we built three separate heterogeneous graphs, namely, syntax-based, semantic-based, and context-based graphs. Second, we constructed a general heterogeneous graph (SSC graph) by combining the three constructed graphs. We then converted the nodes of the SSC graph into sentence vectors using a GCN with two layers (creating an SSC-GCN). Finally, we used a convolutional neural network algorithm with attention to position embeddings (CANN) on the output of the SSC-GCN model for aspect-level sentiment analysis. The experiments, which used three different datasets, including reviews and tweets, showed that the proposed method yields promising results based on the F 1 score F1score .},

Thus, the main challenge of multi-source CNNC is to select the most transferable source networks and identify network-invariant patterns between networks to promote cross-network learning. Therefore, targeting the problem of CNNC, in this study, we introduce a multi-source knowledge transfer method, which aims to use a large number of transferable graph patterns in multiple source networks to assist the target network’s unlabeled nodes to be correctly classified. Specifically, we propose to select the most transferable source networks to learn network-invariant common sub-graph patterns and utilize such patterns to build new structural features for the target network. In addition, we devise an iterative classification algorithm , MTGK, which jointly classifies the nodes of the target network based on the attribute features and the transferable structural features of the nodes in multiple source networks.

  abstract     = {In large dynamic graphs, it is often impractical to store and process the entire graph. To contend with such graphs, lossless graph summarization is a compression technique that can provide a succinct graph representation without losing information. However, given a fully dynamic graph stream, the problem of lossless summarization is computationally and technically challenging. Although the state-of-the-art method performs well with respect to efficiency, its compression quality is usually unstable. This outcome occurs because it is a randomized algorithm and depends heavily on the pretuned parameters. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free approach to lossless summarization of a fully dynamic graph stream. In response to edge insertions and deletions, we first develop an incremental algorithm to maintain the summarization result by carefully exploring the influenced subgraph. Furthermore, we present a similarity-based algorithm to control the movement of vertices on the subgraph and thus guarantee the optimal result at each summarization update.

  abstract     = {Width deviation is an important metric for evaluating the quality of a hot-rolled strip in steel production systems. This paper considers a width deviation prediction problem and proposes a Machine-learning and Genetic-algorithm-based Hybrid method named MGH to obtain a prediction model. Existing work mainly focuses on high prediction accuracy, while ignoring interpretability . This work aims to build a prediction model that can make a good trade-off between two industry-required criteria, i.e., prediction accuracy and interpretability . It first collects some process variables in a hot rolling process and includes them as well as some constructed variables in a feature pool. Then we propose MGH to find representative variables from it and build a prediction model. MGH results from the integration of hierarchical clustering , genetic algorithm, and generalized linear regression. In detail, hierarchical clustering is applied to divide variables into clusters. Genetic algorithm and generalized linear regression are innovatively combined to select a representative variable from each cluster and develop a prediction model. The computational experiments conducted on both industrial and public datasets show that the proposed method can effectively balance prediction accuracy and interpretability of its resulting model. It has better overall performance than the compared state-of-the-art models.},

In the proposed framework, the feature space of different training sample subsets is exploited to generate diverse positive group and negative group pairs by the divide-and-conquer strategy. Then, the training sample label space is exploited to deal with the partial label overlap in every group pair. A set of experiments are conducted on nine controlled UCI datasets and five real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that PL-FALE can improve the classification performance by utilizing the information embedded in the feature space and label space in most cases. Also, the proposed algorithm achieves more stable performance than other ECOC-based PLL algorithms.

  abstract     = {One of the main obstacles in applying machine learning to a new domain is the limited availability of labeled data. A common approach for overcoming this challenge is using semi-supervised learning, where labeled and unlabeled data are used together to label additional samples. One of the most common automatic labeling approaches is co-training , which trains two learners on different views of the data, and then proceeds to collaboratively and iteratively label additional samples. Despite their effectiveness in multiple domains, existing co-training approaches for tabular data are either heuristic, and therefore error-prone, or use a greedy approach that leads to sub-optimal performance. We present ReCom, a deep reinforcement learning-based co-training approach. Our approach models multiple aspects of both the dataset and the two learners and develops advanced labeling strategies that achieve state-of-the-art performance. ReCom overcomes the challenge of limited data availability by simultaneously training on multiple datasets, thus producing a generic and robust labeling policy that can be applied to new datasets without the need for any additional training. Our experiments, conducted on a diverse group of 32 datasets, demonstrate the merits of our approach.},

Existing SNA methods can be categorized as supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised. However, for supervised and semi-supervised methods, obtaining supervisions is expensive and time-consuming; for unsupervised methods , their performances will reach to a bottleneck due to the lack of supervisions. In the real world, there exist many social networks which have already been aligned spending money and time, and many social networks to be aligned. To bridge this gap, we study the SNA problem from the transfer learning perspective, and propose to leverage the knowledge of two aligned social networks (source domain) to facilitate the alignment of two unaligned social networks (target domain). Specifically, we first propose Ego-Transformer to align two social networks in the same domain. Then, we propose WWGAN to eliminate the shift between different domains. Finally, we propose REBORN which tactfully incorporates Ego-Transformer and WWGAN together. We conduct extensive experiments on the datasets of Facebook-Twitter and Weibo-Douban, and compare REBORN with 8 state-of-the-art SNA methods including SNNA, MSUIL, BRIGHT, DeepLink, IONE, PALE, WAlign, and UUILgan. The results demonstrate that REBORN can averagely achieve 20.02\% higher Precision@ k and 23.23\% higher MAP@ k compared with these methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph generation is widely used in various fields, such as social science, chemistry, and physics. Although the deep graph generative models have achieved considerable success in recent years, some problems still need to be addressed. First, some models learn only the structural information and cannot capture the semantic information. Second, many existing models cannot be applied to large-scale datasets owing to a complex training process and a large number of parameters to be learned. Third, most of the existing models require domain-specific rules to be set up, resulting in poor generalization. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a domain-agnostic model with hierarchical recurrent neural networks , named GHRNN, which learns the distribution of graph data for generating new graphs. First, we utilize the minimum depth-first-search code to convert a graph into a unique edge sequence that naturally generalizes to various graphs. Then, we adopt the edge-level recurrent neural network (RNN) module to learn the global structure of a graph and the element-level RNN module to obtain semantic information, such as node labels, edge labels, and the timestamp of nodes. The element-level RNN module with a fixed and small number of time steps in GHRNN can efficiently scale to large datasets. Finally, we generate a large number of graphs and evaluate the effectiveness of our model by using 11 different metrics on diverse datasets ranging from molecules to citation networks. Extensive experimental results indicate that GHRNN can capture complex dependencies and generate the most realistic and diverse graphs, in contrast to several state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep hashing methods have been widely used in image retrieval task. Most existing deep hashing approaches adopt one-to-one quantization to reduce information loss. However, such class-unrelated quantization cannot give discriminative feedback for network training. In addition, these methods only utilize single label to integrate supervision information of data for hashing function learning, which may result in inferior network generalization performance and relatively low-quality hash codes since the inter-class information of data is totally ignored. In this paper, we propose a dual semantic asymmetric hashing (DSAH) method, which generates discriminative hash codes under threefold constraints. Firstly, DSAH utilizes class prior to conduct class structure quantization so as to transmit class information during the quantization process. Secondly, a simple yet effective label mechanism is designed to characterize both the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of data, thereby achieving semantic-sensitive binary code learning. Finally, a meaningful pairwise similarity preserving loss is devised to minimize the distances between class-related network outputs based on an affinity graph. With these three main components, high-quality hash codes can be generated through network. Extensive experiments conducted on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of DSAH in comparison with state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.},

The IT-2F model depicts uncertain nonlinear systems where the lower and upper membership functions characterize the uncertain parameters. Unlike the previous works that relied on average dwell time (ADT), this work employs the concepts of slow switching and fast switching based on the AEDADT property for both stable and unstable modes. The main reason behind the integration is that fast switching has a great feature in restricting the unstable subsystems. Furthermore, in most nonlinear systems , the feedback control rate is realized by memoryless state feedback control . However, a time lag occurs between system state and control response. Therefore, a non-fragile memory state feedback controller is chosen to ensure the globally uniformly exponential stability condition for proposed nonlinear systems through the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) approach. A mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) switching scheme is compared with the described switching rule and derived the superiority of obtained results. The results demonstrate that the AEDADT switching rule is more flexible and achieves tighter bounds than the MDADT property. Finally, numerical simulations and comparisons are provided to illustrate the capability of proposed theoretical results.},

This algorithm allows to calculate the sequence of node decisions given a prediction. Theoretical proofs and multiple experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the performance of our method which is not only a local explicability model for the GBDT algorithm but also a unique option that reflects GBDTs internal behavior.

This paper proposes an algorithm to achieve more fairness and accuracy in horizontal federated learning (FedFa). It introduces an optimization scheme that employs a double momentum gradient, thereby accelerating the convergence rate of the model. An appropriate weight selection algorithm that combines the information quantity of training accuracy and training frequency to measure the weights is proposed. This process assists clients in aggregating at the server with a more fair weighting.

Evaluating and selecting suitable renewable energy sources for a city is vitally essential for its long-term sustainable development. Identifying the key factors that influence the evaluation system is another crucial process. Therefore, we address the evaluation problem using two steps: (1) applying a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to analyze the relevant factors and (2) ranking the factors by the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE). As a result, we introduce a new DEMATEL method based on grey relation analysis (GRA) via objective data in a decision matrix . The new method not only avoids the instability of the traditional DEMATEL method by applying experts&#39; subjective opinions to compare two factors but also addresses the challenges faced by decision-makers when making pairwise comparisons when the number of factors is too large. Moreover, because the PROMETHEE method effectively solves complex decision problems, we also propose a new PROMETHEE method concerning probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) to rank and select suitable renewable energies. To analyze the stability of the decision result, we present a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method that investigates the ranking results for all the factors simultaneously, rather than using only one as in traditional methods. Finally, we implement our method to evaluate renewable energy options in a western Chinese city, and the results show that our method is effective and reasonable in solving complex decision problems.},

  abstract     = {Why is a team greater than the sum of its members’ capabilities? Forging a team depends upon solid collaborations among the team members amalgamated with each member’s abilities. These two aspects bring a challenge in finding the right mix of members with a novel notion of Synergy (Sy) from graph G . This paper has three main goals: (i) introducing the notion of Team Synergy Problem (TSP) and proposing a novel Sy Sy function, (ii) identifying the intrinsic structure of G G for predicting potential Sy Sy s, and (iii) developing a top- k k Team Synergy Algorithm (TSA). Specifically, we formulate the TSP by embedding three essential elements (C3); Communication , Cooperativeness , and Complementarity , into the Sy Sy function to quantify the Synergy between adjacent experts and construct a Synergy graph, G S GS . We prove that the TSP is NP-hard and propose TSA to form top- k k teams from G S GS within a budget B B . TSA uses Pseudo-Star configurations to prune instances efficiently. Moreover, it uses a tensor decomposition method, RESCAL, to exploit the tensored Synergy graph, G S GS , to predict the potential Synergies on the unknown edges and recommend new teammates to a given team. The experimental results on four real datasets have shown that TSA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is an extension of conventional principal component analysis (PCA) that allows the processing of functional data. Besides the reduction in dimensionality that is inherent to PCA, FPCA relies on fewer assumptions and offers a greater ability to visualize the functional data. Thus, FPCA can be used in, for example, social, economic, and medical research. However, the existing FPCA methods are sensitive to outliers, and underperform when extracting features from interval-valued functional data. At the same time, the existing PCA methods for interval-valued functional data suffer from inconsistency in the interpretation of the principal components, and substantial information loss. Therefore, this paper proposes an interval-valued functional principal component analysis (IFPCA) method based on the time-varying distance function. The time-varying distance function containing information on the midpoint and radius is constructed to mitigate information loss. The novel IFPCA method is also able to solve the problem of the inconsistent interpretation of the principal components. The effectiveness of the method is verified by considering the case of the consumer price index.},

  abstract     = {This work develops a novel variant of spiking neural P systems (SN P systems), called self-adapting SN P systems with refractory period and propagation delay (SARPPD-SN P systems). Using the refractory period and propagation delay, spikes transmitted from a neuron arrives at the postsynaptic neurons at different times to simulate the complicated mutual conversion between electrical signals, i.e., spikes, and neurotransmitters in the transmission process. Furthermore, a neuron dissolution rule as a new self-adapting feature is used to remove the redundant neurons and synapses. These two characteristics make SARPPD-SN P systems closer to biological neurons. As examples, SARPPD-SN P systems are employed to generate even natural numbers, all natural numbers, and arithmetic progression using fewer neurons than other variants of SN P systems. The Turing universality of SARPPD-SN P systems is studied by using them as number generating and number accepting devices. As an application, a deterministic SARPPD-SN P system is constructed to find uniform solutions to Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems in linear time. The refractory period and propagation delay can control the flow of the execution of the rules, and the neuron dissolution rule can eliminate invalid solutions. Solutions to SAT problems are encoded as labels of the output neurons.},

This paper proposes an approach of detecting individual fare evasion behaviours. The method first estimates human pose by the algorithm of OpenPose to obtain human skeleton information and conducts multi-target tracking by the algorithm of Pose Flow to obtain human skeleton sequence. It then extracts features from the human pose, followed by the adoption of the relative distance, the angle and Random Forests to establish a fare evasion behaviour detection model. Since missing problems and false detections occur in detections in a single frame, time series are used to increase the accuracy. The output of the time series curve is processed by One-Hot Coding, Kalman Filtering and optimum threshold to obtain the final prediction of human status. Extensive experiments are conducted, and results show that our method can effectively recognize the human status and detect individual fare evasion behaviours, including jumps and squats.},

  abstract     = {Prediction-error expansion (PEE) has been extensively investigated among different approaches of reversible data hiding (RDH). Most PEE-based RDH approaches, e.g., various extensions of adaptive embedding and optimal expansion-bins selection, utilize local complexity of pixels to manage the expansion manner of prediction errors aiming to decrease the number of shifted pixels. However, this fact is not taken into account that prediction errors are not necessarily proportionate to the local complexity of the pixels. In this paper, we focus on forming a prediction-error histogram in the prediction step that causes fewer invalid modifications and results in the reduction of embedding distortion. Hence, an RDH algorithm based on the PEE is presented that provides a general framework for reducing the number of invalid modifications (NIM). To this mean, a high fidelity prediction scheme is proposed using weibull generalized exponential distribution (WGED) to generate two asymmetric prediction-error histograms (APEH). Then, a two-layer embedding procedure is performed through PEE using each APEH. By utilizing WGED, the proposed predictor changes adaptively based on the desired payload and the given cover image to reduce NIM and embedding distortion. The results of comprehensive experiments using three databases confirm the superiority of the presented approach over some existing methods.},

For instance, New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission regularly releases over 165 million taxi trip records containing the end-point information of each trip every year. Such big datasets provide us potential new perspectives to tackle traditional issues in traffic modeling . In this paper, we propose to use such vehicle trip data, which do not contain information on the intermediate vehicle positions other than the end points, to study the link (road segment) travel time estimation problem. A method named PR-LTTE is developed to estimate the mean travel time for interested links in a road network based on path recovery, jointly modeling trip distance and trip travel time. The key idea is to iteratively alternate between 1) inferring the most likely path for a given trip by minimizing a loss function that considers both trip distance and trip travel time, and 2) computing the link travel time via the least-squares estimation with the inferred path. Our experiments on two large-scale trip datasets (including New York City taxi trip data and Chengdu DiDi trip data) show very promising results. PR-LTTE improves the accuracy of travel time estimation by more than 50\% in most cases over state-of-the-art methods.},

This study captures the notion of simultaneity of competition and collaboration among different species/ communities/ individuals using coopetition bunch graphs. We also introduce two measures for assessing coopetition in a network: a) coopetition number and b) coopetition degree of a node in a bunch graph to capture the competition and collaboration of the node in the network. We identify two types of coopetitions from practice: strong-form coopetition and weak-form coopetition, and corresponding coopetition indices to measure each form of coopetition. We find real-world examples to illustrate our approach and computations for strong-form and weak-form coopetition. The current world is witnessing a global pandemic due to COVID19. The scientists from different research institutes are engaged in overcoming the situation. This study demonstrates that countries and institutes pursue pure competition, collaboration, and coopetition for a variety of reasons (innovation, costs, strategic, and tactical reasons). We compare our approach with that based on existing techniques of semidirected graphs and find that the results of the two approaches are significantly different, largely due to bunch effects.

Then the resulting estimator can be obtained on the master, and the communication cost is greatly reduced, since the pilot sample and local gradients can be transferred conveniently.

  abstract     = {For the short-term crude oil scheduling problem, it is difficult to guarantee the feasibility of a schedule due to complicated constraints. Meanwhile, uncertainty is a very important concern in refineries, such as unexpected breakdown of charging tanks. Therefore, it is a great challenge to make a schedule feasible. Most existing works on multi-objective optimization of short-term crude oil scheduling are developed for refineries processing low-fusion-point oil (L-oil) only and little is done for the case with dual pipelines for processing both L-oil and high-fusion-point oil (H-oil). With five objectives and many constraints, it is challenging for a metaheuristic algorithm to find a feasible schedule. To solve this problem, in this work, constraint violation is used to describe the degree of constraint violation. Thus, an adaptive enhanced selection pressure algorithm based on NSGA-II-CDP (NSGA-II-APE) is proposed to efficiently solve the problem for processing both L-oil and H-oil. This algorithm can effectively enhance the selection pressure in the later iterations. Industrial case problems are used to test the proposed method and compare its performance with 11 state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolution algorithms (CMOEAs). Results show its superiority over the existing ones in terms of convergence, solution diversity, and time efficiency.},

First, we define a novel measure for ranking LIFNs, verify its properties, analyze the relationships between loss functions with LIFNs and establish linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets with a novel measure for LIFNs. Second, we investigate linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy, three-way decision methods from three perspectives, especially from the third perspective. We construct a single optimization model for capturing the thresholds that can overcome the shortcomings of the methods from two other perspectives, and the uniqueness of the optimal solution of this model is proven with the aid of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. Third, a single model-based perspective method and its corresponding algorithm are designed to determine the thresholds for linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy information.

  abstract     = {Spatial–temporal event prediction is a particular task for multivariate time series forecasting. Therefore, the complex entangled dynamics of space and time need to be considered. This task is an essential but crucial loop in future smart cities construction, which can be widely applied in urban traffic management, disaster monitoring and mobility analysis. In recent years, video-like spatial–temporal modelling has been the most common approach in many deep learning models. However, the video-like modelling approach cannot consider some latent region-wise correlations other than geographic spatial distance information. To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel neural network framework, Adaptive Dual-View WaveNet (ADVW-Net), for the urban spatial–temporal event prediction. By integrating the spatial representations from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and that from adaptive Graph convolutional neural network (GCN), our proposed model can capture not only the geographic correlations but also some latent region-wise dependencies from the input data. In addition, the effective architecture, WaveNet, can be transferred to region-wise spatial–temporal prediction scenarios for long-range temporal dependencies learning. Experimental results on three urban datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model.},

Among them, since hesitant fuzzy decision information systems can well depict the hesitancy of individuals, hesitant fuzzy three-way decisions serve as a significant research topic nowadays. However, the conditional probability still remains as a challenging issue in the above field. In order to reasonably evaluate the conditional probability of each object in hesitant fuzzy decision information systems without class labels, an ( α , β ) (α,β) -probability dominance-similarity relation is put forward to calculate an ( α , β ) (α,β) -probability dominance-similarity class. First, a relative loss function is proposed in hesitant fuzzy decision information systems. Then, a hesitant fuzzy three-way decision approach with three strategies is constructed via considering realistic decision-making features. At last, the rationality and validity of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparative and experimental analyses. The decision-making results with three strategies show that the presented hesitant fuzzy three-way decision approach with neutral strategies is more accurate than other counterparts.},

The measurements obtained by the sensors need to be transmitted to the remote estimator over a shared network with packet dropouts , where only a part of sensors can access the network due to its limited bandwidth . To improve the estimation performance, a scheduler is adopted to determine which systems to be observed and which sensors to access the network based on the real-time information of each system. For this issue, the co-scheduling protocol is formulated as an associated Markov decision process (MDP) and the existence of an optimal deterministic and stationary policy (DSP) is proved. Then a Deep Q -Network (DQN) is developed to solve the MDP in a scalable and model-free manner. A practical example of vehicle moving is presented to compare the DQN method with some other existing scheduling protocols, and the results show that the developed approach significantly outperforms other protocols in all kinds of situations.},

Here, we propose a model that simulates communication in an online social network , in which randomly created posts represent external information. We consider users and friendship relations to be encoded as nodes and edges of a network. The dynamic of information diffusion is divided into two processes, referred to as post transmission and post distribution , representing the users’ behavior and the social network algorithm, respectively. Individuals also interact with the post content by slightly adjusting their own opinion and sometimes redefining friendships. Our results show that the dynamic converge to various scenarios, which go from consensus formation to polarization. Importantly, friendship rewiring helps promote echo chamber formation, which can also arise for particular networks with well-defined community structures. Altogether, our results indicate that the social network algorithm is crucial to mitigate or promote polarization.},

To that end we propose a novel unsupervised method for extracting the relevant concepts from a collection of unstructured textual documents assuming that the documents are related to a certain topic. Our two-step method first identifies candidate concepts from the textual documents, then infers the context information for the input documents and finally ranks them with respect to the inferred context. In the second step this context information is enriched with more abstract information to improve the ranking process. In the experiments we demonstrate that our method outperforms seven supervised and unsupervised approaches on five datasets and is competitive on the other two.

Since current methods for ranking expertise are based mainly on user submitted posts, their results are limited to that minority. We introduce ProficiencyRank, a wrapping method on top of PageRank that leverages voting information to determine user expertise for both contributors and lurkers. We validated our method to measure the proficiency of English Language Learners in the Yask social network. The new data set is naturally annotated with self-assessments of proficiency given by the users themselves, providing ground truth for all users. Experimental validation showed that ProficiencyRank produces a meaningful ranking of users that overcame various baselines based on intrinsic and extrinsic information .

  abstract     = {Recently, a pair of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) cameras is applied to stereo vision systems for all-day vision applications. The images captured by the RGB-NIR stereo vision system have spectral ranges that differ significantly. Hence, the NIR image displays richer image information during nighttime. By contrast, during daytime, the RGB image generally provides abundant information. Therefore, these images can complement each other’s disadvantages in all-day environments. However, from the perspective of image matching, it is difficult to search for correspondences between two images because of their different spectral ranges . Although various methods for translating RGB images into NIR images have been proposed to solve this problem, hight-quality conversion results have not been achieved. Incomplete conversion results cause the inaccurate estimation of disparity during stereo matching . Therefore, we propose a warping-based spectral translation network (WASTNet) to enhance the training performance of a disparity estimation network by improving the performance of image translation. The WASTNet involves the following three steps: (1) initial disparity estimation for warping an NIR image to the viewpoint of RGB image; (2) post-processing for enhancing the initial disparity map ; (3) image warping and spectral translation. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based smoothness term that is applied to a loss function to mitigate disparity errors in the disparity map . The WASTNet and the proposed smoothness term are used concurrently with a conventional spectral translation network, which improves the performance of an unsupervised stereo matching network.},

Despite its computational tractability and scalability, when solving a bilinear problem such as LFA, the regular SGD algorithm tends to be stuck in a local optimum. To address this issue, the paper innovatively proposes an Adjusted Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) for Latent Factor Analysis, where the adjustment mechanism is implemented by considering the bi-polar gradient directions during optimization, such mechanism is theoretically proved for its efficiency in overstepping local saddle points and avoiding premature convergence. Also, the hyper-parameters of the model are implemented in a self-adaptive manner using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, for higher practicality. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on six different HDI matrices from industrial applications, especially in prediction accuracy for missing data.},

  abstract     = {Smartphones enable to collect large data streams about phone calls that, once combined with Computational Intelligence techniques, bring great potential for improving the monitoring of patients with mental illnesses. However, the acoustic data streams recorded in uncontrolled environments are dynamically changing due to various sources of uncertainty. In addition, such acoustic data are usually difficult to interpret by psychiatrists. Within this study, we propose an approach based on Linguistic Summaries with Fuzzy Clustering (LS-FC) aiming at the development of human-consistent and easily interpretable summaries about relations between acoustic data and mental state of a patient affected by Bipolar Disorder, e.g., Most calls in the state of hypomania have low loudness compared to the state of euthymia [T = 1]. To capture the dynamics of acoustic data streams, we apply a dynamic incremental semi-supervised fuzzy clustering that synthesizes data into clusters. These clusters are represented by prototypes which are used for the construction of the membership functions describing linguistic terms e.g., low loudness, and then, linguistic summaries. The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of information about clusters’ prototypes in the generation of linguistic summaries. The primary goal of this research is explainability. The semi-supervised learning algorithm is used mainly for deriving clusters and building improved linguistic summaries. Numerical results indicate that linguistic summaries provide intuitive and clear information about voice features in a patient’s affective state and they are consistent with clinical observation. In particular, during most calls in hypomania/mania both the quality of the patient’s voice and the dynamics of change in the spectrum signal reflected in spectral flux are low compared to euthymia. The proposed approach enables to summarize large data streams into meaningful descriptions that, although relatively simple, offer information granules that are very intuitive for clinicians and are promising to support the smartphone-based monitoring of bipolar disorder patients to inform about the potential change of mental state.},

Training the DTCRAE for TSC includes two phases, an unsupervised pre-training phase based on a DTCRAE and a supervised training phase for developing a TCN classifier. Computational studies are conducted to prove the effectiveness of DTCRAEs for TSC based on three datasets, the Sequential MNIST, Permuted MNIST, and Sequential CIFAR-10. Computational results demonstrate that the pre-trained DTCRAE provides a better initial structure for a TCN classifier, in terms of its higher precisions, recalls, F1-scores, and accuracies. The sensitivity analysis on the validation set shows that the pre-trained DTCRAE is robust to changes of the batch size, noisy rate, and dropout rate. DTCRAEs offer best TSC accuracies on two of three datasets and an accuracy comparable to the best one on another dataset by benchmarking against a number of state-of-the-art algorithms.

The traditional approach usually obtains the relationships between single-domain features. Analysis and forecasting in the problem domain alone can quickly achieve good accuracy, but due to the limitations of the analysis domain, it becomes increasingly difficult to further improve the prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a novel data analysis approach compatible with small sample sets called multidomain data depth analysis (MODE). In contrast to traditional approaches, MODE emphasizes multidomain data and considers the relationships among feature domains in the original data. The features in each domain are orthogonally extracted, and feature dimensions are expanded in accordance with the characteristics of small data sets. A better prediction model can be obtained by using the expanded and strengthened features. We apply this approach to real big data from the field of sociology to predict annual income based on census data in experiments. The experimental results show that MODE offers a better prediction effect based on small multidomain samples.},

  abstract     = {Nonoverlapping sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a type of SPM with gap constraints that can mine valuable information in sequences. One of the disadvantages of nonoverlapping SPM is that any characters can match with gap constraints. Hence, there can be a significant difference between the trend of a pattern and those of its occurrences. To tackle this issue, we propose nonoverlapping weak-gap sequential pattern (NWP) mining, where characters are divided into two types: weak and strong. This allows discovering frequent patterns more accurately by limiting the gap constraints to match only weak characters. To discover NWPs, we propose NMP-Miner which involves two key steps: support calculation and candidate pattern generation. To efficiently calculate the support of candidate patterns, depth-first search and backtracking strategies based on a simplified Nettree structure are adopted, which effectively reduce the time and space complexities of the algorithm. Moreover, a pattern join approach is applied to effectively reduce the number of candidate patterns. The experimental results show that NWP-Miner is more efficient than other competitive algorithms. More importantly, the case study of time series shows that NWP-Miner can effectively filter out noise patterns and discover more meaningful patterns.

  abstract     = {In color image processing, the objective of image completion is to restore missing entries from the incomplete observation image. Recent improvements have assisted in resolving the rank minimization issue, thereby promoting the realization of completion. This paper adopts the new quaternion matrix logarithmic norm to approximate rank in accordance with the quaternion matrix framework . Unlike the traditional matrix completion method, which handles RGB channels separately, the quaternion-based method avoids the destruction of the structure of images by placing the color image in a pure quaternion matrix. Furthermore, the logarithmic norm induces a more accurate rank surrogate. Based on the logarithmic norm, it is possible to exploit not only the factorization strategy but also the truncated technique, thus achieving successful image restoration. The alternating minimization framework renders it possible to optimize the two strategies, and mathematically detailed validation of the convergence analysis is provided. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of logarithmic surrogates in the quaternion domain is a superior strategy for solving the problem of color image completion.},

  abstract     = {The localization of hazardous sources (e.g. poisonous gas sources) is an important task regarding the security of human society. To find the unknown source in time, various autonomous source searching methods have mushroomed and been employed over the past decade. This paper designs a fresh source searching approach, namely particle clustering-deep Q-network, PC-DQN, which applies the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques as a source searching approach for the first time. Specifically, the search process is formulated as the partially observable Markov decision process, then converted into the Markov decision process based on the belief state (represented by the particle filter). PC-DQN leverages the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to extract the feature of belief state, and employ the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to find the optimal policy for the source searching task. Through the comparison with two baseline methods (i.e. RANDOM and Entrotaxis algorithm) under various experimental conditions, the viability of our proposed PC-DQN is testified. Results explicitly reveal that the success rate of the PC-DQN maintains at a high level (beyond 99.6\%) in all scenarios in this paper, and the mean search step shows evident superiority over baseline methods in most scenarios. Significantly, we also introduce the transfer learning concept to reuse the well-trained Q-network into new scenarios. These findings show important implications of the DRL-based approach as an alternative and more effective source searching approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an all state constrained decentralized adaptive implicit inversion control scheme for a class of large scale nonlinear systems with unknown time delays and asymmetric saturated hysteresis . First, to address the states constrained problem, the asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function is introduced to keep the error surface within an appropriate range from the view of engineering practice to ensure the performance and safety, such as for attitude tracking of rigid spacecraft, for spacecraft approach and intersection. Second, the transmission delays between different subsystems are considered and approximated through the incorporation of the neural-network approximators and the finite coverage lemma. Third, a new hysteresis implicit inverse algorithm is designed to effectively mitigate asymmetric and saturated hysteresis nonlinearities . It should be noted that the implicit inverse implies that the analytical inverse of the asymmetric and saturated hysteresis is not required. Instead, the decoupling algorithms are designed to extract the actual control signal from the temporarily hysteretic control signal , which reduces the preliminary work of the control algorithm. Finally, all of the signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be semi-globally ultimately uniformly bounded and the tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small residual set . The experimental results on two-machine excitation power systems in the hardware-in-loop system are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Imbalanced dataset classification issue poses a major challenge on machine learning domain. Traditional supervised learning algorithms usually bias towards the majority class when handling imbalanced datasets, thus leading to poor classification results on the minority class. The learning task would become crucially difficult when there are overlapping and within-imbalance issues in imbalanced datasets, which are often the case and have been proven to severely deteriorate the classification performance relative to between-class imbalance. In this paper, we propose a novel SVDD boundary-based weighted oversampling approach (SVDDWSMOTE) for handling imbalanced and overlapped data. The proposed approach first applies support vector data description (SVDD) model with greater penalty constant for the minority class than the majority class to generate the class boundary, and then identifies those misclassified majority or few minority instances by the generated class boundary as potential overlapped or noisy ones and eliminates them. To address the within-balance issues, we propose a weight assignment strategy based on densities and the distances to the SVDD class boundary, which facilitates simultaneously combating between-class and within-class imbalance issues caused by complicated distribution. In addition, such a strategy also favors generating more synthetic minority instances for borderline and sparser instances which are usually informative to the later learning tasks. Finally, oversampling is performed by the weighed SMOTE scheme based on SVDD boundary to not only counteract the within imbalance but also avoid the generation of any noisy or overlapped synthetic instance. Extensive comparison results on various datasets show that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant improvements in terms of different classification performance metrics relative to state-of-the-art ones.},

It remains an open problem whether AsynSN P systems using standard spiking rules (the execution of the rule only produces a spike) are equivalent in power to Turing machines. In this work, the control mechanism of local synchronization at the rule level is introduced into AsynSN P systems. Namely, there are some given locally synchronous sets of rules; if a rule in such set is executed, then all applicable rules residing in the same set should be executed simultaneously. The computational power of AsynSN P systems with local synchronization of rules is examined. It is demonstrated that with local synchronization of rules, both general and unbounded AsynSN P systems are Turing universal, whereas bounded AsynSN P systems can only characterize the family of semilinear sets of numbers, using standard spiking rules. These results demonstrate the great potential for the local synchronization of rules to improve the computational capability of AsynSN P systems.},

  abstract     = {Time-series data are widespread in real-world industrial scenarios. To recover and infer missing information in real-world applications, the problem of time-series prediction has been widely studied as a classical research topic in data mining . Deep learning architectures have been viewed as next-generation time-series prediction models. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks . In this study, we prospectively examine the problem of time-series prediction adversarial attacks and propose an attack strategy for generating an adversarial time series by adding malicious perturbations to the original time series to deteriorate the performance of time-series prediction models. Specifically, a perturbation-based adversarial example generation algorithm is proposed using the gradient information of the prediction model. In practice, unlike the imperceptibility to humans in the field of image processing , time-series data are more sensitive to abnormal perturbations and there are more stringent requirements regarding the amount of perturbations. To address this challenge, we craft an adversarial time series based on the importance measurement to slightly perturb the original data. Based on comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world time-series datasets, we verify that the proposed adversarial attack methods not only effectively fool the target time-series prediction model LSTNet, they also attack state-of-the-art CNN-, RNN-, and MHANET-based models. Meanwhile, the results show that the proposed methods achieve a good transferability. That is, the adversarial examples generated for a specific prediction model can significantly affect the performance of the other methods. Moreover, through a comparison with existing adversarial attack approaches, we can see that much smaller perturbations are sufficient for the proposed importance-measurement based adversarial attack method. The methods described in this paper are significant in understanding the impact of adversarial attacks on a time-series prediction and promoting the robustness of such prediction technologies .},

Based on the theories, a new method is proposed for constructing the hash function family. Then, a volume-balancing locality-sensitive hashing (VBLSH) algorithm is implemented. In this algorithm, the problem of constructing the hash function family is transformed into an optimization problem under a fixed number of hypercubes . By solving the optimization problem , different hyperplane intervals are set for each dimension to ensure that the hash functions can evenly segment the data space, where each segmented hypercube has a close volume and close side lengths. Finally, the analysis of the algorithm shows that the VBLSH algorithm has a high index coding efficiency and hash code calculation efficiency. The experimental results show that the VBLSH algorithm can simultaneously take into account the efficiency, precision and recall rate, and avoid the F1-trap; it shows excellent effectiveness on 4 datasets.},

  abstract     = {The elastic motion estimation is an efficient temporal predictive coding tool for predicting complex motions including zooming, shearing and twisting. However, its optimization solution still suffers from high computational complexity and unstable convergence yet. We thus present a novel optimization framework to improve the elastic motion estimation efficiency. By introducing a diagonal matrix into the Gauss-Newton’s Hessian matrix, we employ the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to compute the elastic motion vectors. It obtains superior convergence to the conventional Gauss-Newton’s method, especially when the starting point is far away from the globally/locally optimum. Furthermore, we prove that the Gauss-Newton’s Hessian matrix for elastic motion estimation is positive semi-definite by discussing the convexity of the motion-compensated error function. Such a finding allows us to adopt a sign-alternating factor, instead of a positive constant used in the traditional L-M method, to update iteratively the diagonal matrix coefficient. And a bound is determined for the diagonal matrix coefficient to guarantee the non-singularity of the Hessian matrix, with whose constraints we propose an adaptive method to compute the sign-alternating factor to restrict the iterative process into a reasonable motion vector space. Finally, a novel elastic motion estimation algorithm is presented based on the modified Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm gains higher motion-compensated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) than several benchmark methods. Moreover, our algorithm converges fast which needs only 1–2 iterations before it achieves higher PSNR than conventional elastic motion estimation.},

Multiple top- k HUIs mining algorithms have been introduced with interesting results. However, these algorithms focus mainly on mining patterns from positive profit datasets, while few preliminary studies can handle datasets with negative profits. Moreover, conventional top- k HUI mining algorithms, that are meant for exploring positive profit datasets, perform poorly when mining top- k HUIs on highly dense and large datasets. In this paper, we propose TKN (efficiently mining T op- K HUIs with positive or N egative profits) which employs generalized and adaptive techniques to mine both positive and negative profit datasets effectively. The proposed approach adopts transactional projection and merging mechanisms to decrease the dataset traversing cost. Furthermore, several pruning and threshold elevating ideas are utilized to significantly narrow the exploration space. To highlight the reliability of the devised TKN, a series of extensive comparisons were conducted using two versions of six real datasets. The obtained results reveal that TKN is clearly superior in finding the required number of patterns, whether on positive or negative profit datasets, compared to the current cutting-edge competitors.},

  abstract     = {P-Systems are abstract machines inspired to the behaviour of cells which we can see like simple biological processing units. Many types of P-Systems have been developed considering different aspects of the cells working principles, obtaining different computational models . In this paper we introduce Active P-Colonies (APC), a variant of the model P-Colony systems . P-Colony systems are a model of computation based on the collaboration among different agents placed in a shared passive environment (i.e. a space where no computing operations take place). First of all, we show that using the P-Colony system basic model it is not possible to solve problems in the computational class NP NP (unless P = NP P=NP ). Inspired by what has been done for the basic variant of P-Systems, we extend the original model by including new types of rules and new biological behaviours like duplication and membrane dissolution. In fact, in APC the agents are able to duplicate themselves obtaining new processing units having the same computational power as the original unit. The cells can also dissolve their membrane, releasing the contents into the environment. The obtained systems are able to solve in polynomial time (and exponential space) computationally hard problems. In particular, we focus on the development of systems able to solve problems in the classes NP NP ( SAT ), coNP coNP ( UNSAT ) and # P #P ( #SAT ).},

  abstract     = {C larification Q uestion G eneration (CQG) aims to automatically generate clarification questions to avoid misunderstanding. In this paper, we focus on generating clarification questions in the scenario of ambiguous multi-turn conversation, which can be well applied to the interactive systems, e.g., dialogue systems and conversational recommendation systems. As a novel direction, limited manual-annotated samples are available for CQG . Moreover, existing approaches mainly ignore the representation of ambiguous semantics and cannot deal with the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem in a good manner. To address the above issues, we propose a S elf-supervised Hi erarchical P ointer-generator model (SHiP) for this task. In detail, similar to the backbone Coarse-to-fine process of CQG , we first formulate two self-supervised learning pretext tasks, i.e., Dialogue History Prediction and Entity Name Prediction . Then, we incorporate a hierarchical Transformer mechanism and a pointer-generator mechanism to understand the ambiguous multi-turn conversations and solve the OOV problem. Finally, we propose an end-to-end co-training paradigm to train the pretext tasks and downstream tasks. We quantify the improvements of SHiP against the competitive baselines on a publicly available dataset CLAQUA, showing a general improvement of 6.75\% and 3.91\% over state-of-the-art baseline in terms of BLEU and ROUGE-L, respectively.},

First, a new sequence is defined to unify the sampling instants of the sensors and filters. Based on this new sequence and the detectability decomposition, distributed multi-rate sampled-data H ∞ H∞ consensus filters are designed, and the resilience of the proposed filters to the denial-of-service attacks is analyzed. It is shown that the attacks on the measurement channels will degrade the performance of the state estimations of both detectable part and undetectable part of the system state, while the attacks on the communication links only affect the performance of the state estimations of the undetectable part of the system state.

The considered control input undergoes the loss of effectiveness (LE) and FDIA in a unified framework. Furthermore, in order to cater the engineering reality, the event-triggered mechanism is introduced in the sensor to observer (S-O) channel and observer to controller (O-C) channel with hope to reduce the communication load. By introducing a novel scheme, sufficient conditions are provided to ensure the asymptotic stability of resultant sliding mode dynamics with prescribed H ∞ H∞ performance. Subsequently, to reduce the communication burden, an optimal strategy is proposed which can guarantee the stability simultaneously through choosing suitable weighting matrices. Moreover, a projection-based adaptive SMC law is designed to compensate the effects caused by the LE and FDIA, which can force the system state to be attracted into the pre-defined sliding manifold. Finally, some comparison simulations are presented to illustrate the validity of the provided control method.},

However, accurate forecasting is very challenging, because it is difficult to extract the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies from high-dimensional nonlinear data. This paper proposes a regional traffic demand forecasting framework (RTDFF) to predict the boarding and alighting demand of online car-hailing. The RTDFF can learn robust representations of traffic patterns with multi-resolution spatial dependencies. It uses a 3D deconvolution component to enhance the spatial resolution of intra-regions and a 2D residual component to connect the large-scale spatial dependence. This model investigates the effect of the 3D convolution in capturing the long-term temporal dependence . Hybrid modeling is conducted with multi-granularity temporal segmentation and fusion. The experiments were carried out using real-world datasets. The results verify that RTDFF is accurate and stable, and that it has slower deterioration than baseline models , with the raise of prediction steps.},

By applying the dynamic delay partition method , the delay interval is divided into several variable subintervals , which takes full advantage of time-varying delay information. In addition, the randomly occurring asynchronous or synchronous controllers are put forward to enhance the design flexibility and control performance. On the basis of the new augmented LKF and improved boundary techniques, the sufficient asymptotic stability condition is derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

The received wireless data is modeled as a three-way tensor according to its time, space, and sensing information dimensions , which allows the proposed approach to fully capture the hidden space correlation and multi-attribute information of the received data. Furthermore, the wireless data recovery problem can be formulated as a simple core nuclear norm tensor completion problem based on Tucker decomposition, so that the computational complexity can be reduced. Furthermore, a Hankel transformation is introduced to enrich the structure of the core tensor, so that the new core tensor structure can exploit the underlying structure of tensor data to capture multiple correlations for data recovery. Hence, the recovery performance can be further improved. The proposed method offers significant advantages over the Tucker-based tensor completion methods. For example, (1) theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method has a lower computational complexity ; (2) compared with the existing methods, it has better recovery performance even with a larger missing ratio or lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario, etc. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Relevant three-way decisions on agreement, disagreement, and neutrality attitude subsets are valuable, but the initial model has a complex definition and ambiguous semantics. This paper conducts in-depth three-way decision modeling on attitude subsets by using rough sets and three-way decisions, and it establishes both an improved qualitative model and an extended quantitative model. The two novel models are formed by an intuitionistic attitude function and a complete three-way structure, so they acquire effective connotations, optimal calculations, and thorough mechanisms. Aiming at the attitude subsets of conflict analysis, first, a qualitative three-way decision model is proposed by remedying the limitations of the existing model, and the qualitative model obtains the perfect semantics, computational algorithm, qualitative monotonicity, and equivalent characterization. Then, a quantitative three-way decision model is constructed by considering probability measures and tolerance thresholds, and the quantitative model achieves the statistical measurement, computational algorithm, and quantitative nonmonotonicity. Finally, all results are effectively verified by conflict examples and data experiments. For conflict analysis, the initial, qualitative, and quantitative three-way models constitute the three levels of attitude subsets, and the latter two offer improvements and extensions. The obtained results uncover rough set interpretations and enrich three-way decision making, mainly in terms of certainty and uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {To achieve sustainable management of municipal solid waste , selecting an appropriate waste to energy (WTE) technology is pivotal. The WTE technology selection is a complicated issue because it involves a range of conflicting criteria and a rich diversity of stakeholders. Moreover, the complexity will be multiplied when considering that the preference information provided by different people with respect to different criteria takes different forms and granularities . To tackle the WTE technology selection problems with multi-granular hybrid information, this paper proposes a new group decision-making framework. The proposed framework provides a reasonable solution to the WTE technology selection problems through four stages. In the first stage, three information transformation mechanisms are established to transform information in different forms and granularities into unified belief structures. In the second stage, a symmetrical cross-entropy measure-based weight determination model is developed to calculate the criteria weights. In the third stage, by combining information transformation mechanisms and criteria weights, the analytical evidential reasoning algorithm is extended to generate group opinions. Finally, according to the generated group opinions, the expected utilities of alternatives are calculated to compare and rank the alternatives. To illustrate the implementation process of the proposed decision-making framework, an application about the WTE technology selection in China is performed. Besides, a comparative experiment is conducted to show the flexibility and reliability of our proposal.},

Due to the input saturation and smooth switching function, it is challenging to design the tracking-containment controller with nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances . To overcome these difficulties, we design the tracking-containment control based on the adaptive backstepping method, which includes n command filters and one adaptive neural network to improve the control performance.

  abstract     = {A fuzzy extension of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method implies a choice of an approach to estimating corresponding functions of fuzzy variables and a method for ordering alternatives based on ranking of fuzzy quantities. The objective of this paper is the development and comparison of Fuzzy MCDA (FMCDA) models, which represent different approaches to fuzzy extensions of an ordinary MCDA method. To do so, different approaches to assessing functions of fuzzy numbers are considered along with several methods for ranking of fuzzy numbers. Distinctions in ranking alternatives, including the number and significance of distinctions based on a granulation of the output information, are explored for different FMCDA models by using Monte Carlo simulating input scenarios of fuzzy multi-criteria problems. In addition, both intra-distinctions and inter-distinctions are explored. According to the results, distinctions in ranking alternatives by different FMCDA models may be considered as significant both for ranking and choice multi-criteria problematiques. This research is of fundamental and applied importance and has no analogues.},

  abstract     = {In the fields of rough set and machine learning , attribute reduction has been demonstrated to be effective in removing redundant attributes with clear explanations. Therefore, not only the generalization performances of the derived reducts, but also the efficiencies of searching reducts have drawn much attention. Immediately, various accelerators for quickly deriving reducts have been designed. However, most of the existing solutions merely speed up the procedure of searching reduct from one and only one perspective, it follows that the efficiencies of those accelerators may be further improved with a fusion view. For such a reason, a framework called Fusing Attribute Reduction Accelerators (FARA) is developed. Our framework is specifically characterized by the following three aspects: (1) sample based accelerator, which is realized by gradually reducing the volume of samples based on the mechanism of positive approximation ; (2) attribute based accelerator, which is realized by adding multiple qualified attributes into the potential reduct for each iteration; (3) granularity based accelerator, which is realized by ignoring the candidate attributes within coarser granularity . By examining both the efficiencies of the searchings and the effectiveness of the searched reducts, comprehensive experiments over 20 public datasets fairly validated the superiorities of our framework against 5 popular accelerators.},

This can actually facilitate the separation of communication between cells from the cells’ state transitions in an ACCA. The effect of asynchronous communication on dynamical behavior will be analyzed on the well-studied elementary class of cellular automata, especially on their robustness. Despite the unpredictable randomness in both communication and state transitions, computational equivalence between ACCAs and conventional CAs can be achieved, based on effective methods for transforming every synchronous CA into an equivalent ACCA.},

This paper proposes a novel GPR algorithm, which is based on presorting and reuse principle, to compute G-Skyline groups on massive data efficiently. The execution of GPR consists of two phases: acquisition of the candidate tuples and computation of G-Skyline groups. The sublinear-I/O method is proposed in phase 1 to scan the presorted table, which is proved to hold early termination property. This paper devises the basic framework of phase 2 and analyzes its execution cost. The SR strategy is utilized to reuse the subset computation results effectively and reduce the execution cost of phase 2 considerably. The extensive experimental results, conducted on synthetic and real-life data sets, show that GPR outperforms the existing algorithms significantly.},

In order to utilize BPA to practical decision-making, pignistic probability transformation of BPA is a significant method. In the paper, we simulate the pignistic probability transformation (PPT) process based on the fractal idea, which describes PPT process in detail and shows the process of information volume changes during transformation intuitively.

  abstract     = {Least Squares Regression (LSR) is a powerful method for learning the transform from high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional label subspace. Due to the excellent performance of low-rank matrix decomposition based methods in exploring low-dimensional subspace structure, many extended algorithms of LSR impose low-rank constraints to make intra-class regression targets more comparative and similar. However, the low-rank constraints imposed on the original space may destroy the data structure and adversely affect the model of capturing the manifold structure. In this paper, a Denoising Low-Rank Discrimination based Least Squares Regression (DLRDLSR) model is proposed to eliminate noise in label space. Firstly, we decompose the data into a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix in label subspace. Secondly, some constraints are imposed onto the low-rank matrix and sparse matrix to preserve the details, and then we use the low-rank matrix for classification. Moreover, ∊ ∊ ∊ -dragging technique is introduced to enlarge the distance between different classes to enhance discrimination, and l 2 l2 -norm constraint is also introduced to avoid overfitting. The experiments on a variety of image databases demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.},

Most of these systems are not immune to the dynamical degradation of digital chaos and many have been shown to suffer from a lack of security. In this paper, a stream cipher system based on an analog–digital hybrid chaotic system is presented. The hybrid model can construct digital chaotic maps without degeneration and guarantee synchronization of analog chaotic systems for successful decryption. Moreover, focusing on the characteristics of low-dimensional chaotic maps, a modified three-dimensional Logistic map is proposed to improve the weaknesses of uneven distribution, low complexity and limited parameter space. Combining the three-dimensional Logistic map and the hybrid model, the proposed stream cipher has advantages of huge key space, virtually infinite cycle length and tight security. In particular, it is not affected by the dynamical degradation. Performance and security analyses indicate that the proposed stream cipher is highly resistant to various chaos-based attacks and cryptanalytic attacks.},

The proposed SGStKAF utilizes the kernel mean p -power error criterion (KMPE) with the L 1 L1 -norm penalty. The proposed SGStKAF has three significant features. Firstly, the generalized Student’s t kernel can suppress the abrupt noise effectively. Secondly, the L 1 L1 -norm penalty guarantees that the fixed-point sub-iteration is available so that the more precise solution can be obtained in a few iterations. At last, a sparse structure of neural networks for the implementation of the proposed method can also be obtained via the L 1 L1 constraint.

Instead of fixing sensing locations, we propose a semi-binarized variational autoencoder to simultaneously optimize the sampling strategy and evaluate the signal estimated from the sampled sensing locations. The proposed framework is composed of a backpropagatable binarized encoding layer to optimize sensing locations and a generative model to estimate the complete signal from these sparse samples. Moreover, a feature-level discrepancy was proposed to further optimize the sampling locations with respect to the estimation error. The experiments were conducted using four publicly available datasets with three evaluation metrics (mean square error, standard deviation, and peak signal-to-noise ratio). The 10-fold cross-validation and two-sample t-test were utilized to analyze the experimental results, which demonstrate the significant improvement achieved by the proposed method.},

Thus, traditional ensemble techniques that use the class labels cannot be used for this task. We use Item Response Theory (IRT) – a class of models used in educational psychometrics – to construct an unsupervised anomaly detection ensemble. IRT’s latent trait computation lends itself to anomaly detection because the latent trait can be used to uncover the hidden ground truth. Using a novel IRT mapping to the anomaly detection problem, we construct an ensemble that can downplay noisy, non-discriminatory methods and accentuate sharper methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the IRT ensemble using two real data repositories and show that it outperforms other ensemble techniques.

  abstract     = {The main steam temperature (MST) in power plants suffers from nonlinearity and large time delay, which cause large overshoot and long settling time under widely used cascade proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller. In order to cope with the negative effects, we propose a stochastic configuration network (SCN) based cascade generalized predictive control (GPC) scheme to improve the performance of the MST. A three-layer SCN is employed to model the MST process. The SCN is constructed by two phases, i.e., initial phase and real-time phase. The initial phase determines the structure and primary parameters of the learner model using the stochastic configuration algorithm. The real-time phase employs weighted recursive least squares (WRLS) for building the real-time MST process model for GPC design. Taking into account some constraints of the MST process, Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions are applied for solving the constrained receding-horizon optimization problem. The derived explicit solutions of GPC avoid the implicit form which usually has to be solved iteratively. Comparative simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SCN based cascade GPC (SCN-CGPC). Finally, the proposed SCN-CGPC is implemented via a standalone external MST control system in a power plant. The effectiveness and practicability are validated with the real-world application.},

Addressing the problem, we propose a generic evaluation metric ROBY, a novel attack-independent robustness measurement based on the model’s feature distribution. Without prior knowledge of adversarial samples, ROBY uses inter-class and intra-class statistics to capture the features in the latent space. Models with stronger robustness always have larger distances between classes and smaller distances in the same class. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on ten state-of-the-art deep models and different datasets to verify ROBY’s effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with other evaluation metrics, ROBY better matches the robustness golden standard attack success rate (ASR), with significantly less computation cost. To the best of our knowledge, ROBY is the first light-weighted attack-independent robustness evaluation metric general to a wide range of deep models.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have surpassed humans in many computer vision areas. However, the redundancy of CNNs inhibits its application in the embedded device. In this paper, a simple shared channel weight convolution (SCWC) approach is proposed to reduce the number of parameters. Multiplication is much more complex than accumulation, so reducing multiplication is more significant than reducing accumulation in CNNs. The proposed SCWC can reduce the number of multiplications by the distributive property due to the structured channel parameter sharing. Furthermore, the fully trained CNN can be directly compressed without tedious training from scratch. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SCWC, five competitive benchmark datasets for image classification and object detection, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, CUB-200–2011 and PASCAL VOC are adopted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SCWC can reduce about 50\% of parameters and multiplications for ResNet50 with only 0.13\% accuracy loss, and reduce about 70\% of parameters and multiplications for VGG16 with 1.64\% accuracy loss on ImageNet, which is better than many other pruning methods for CNNs. The accuracy loss is very small because of the soft parameter sharing. Moreover, the proposed SCWC is also effective for object detection and fine-grained image classification tasks.},

We aim to achieve content-preserving style transfer via an appropriate trade-off between detail preservation and style transfer. To this end, we utilize wavelet transformation with a deep neural network for decoupled style and detail synthesis. Additionally, style transfer should involve a one-to-one correspondence of semantic structures of scenes and avoid noticeable unnatural-looking style transitions around them. To address the above issue, we leverage an attention mechanism and semantic segmentation for matching and design a novel content loss with local one-to-one correspondence for producing content-preserving stylized results. Finally, we employ wavelet transform to perform feature optimization (FO) to repair some imperfect results. We perform various experiments with Qabf evaluation and a user study to validate our proposed method and show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for ensemble and texture preservation.},

Several algorithms were proposed to perform the task efficiently. Nevertheless, most of them ignore the item categorizations. This useful information is provided in many real-world transaction databases. Previous works, such as CLH-Miner and ML-HUI Miner were proposed to solve this limitation to discover cross-level and multi-level HUIs. However, the CLH-Miner has a long runtime and high memory usage. To address these drawbacks, this study extends tight upper bounds to propose effective pruning strategies. A novel algorithm named FEACP (Fast and Efficient Algorithm for Cross-level high-utility Pattern mining) is introduced, which adopts the proposed strategies to efficiently identify cross-level HUIs in taxonomy-based databases. It can be seen from a thorough performance evaluation that FEACP can identify useful itemsets of different abstraction levels in transaction databases with high efficiency, that is up to 8 times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm on the tested sparse databases and up to 177 times on the tested dense databases. FEACP reduces memory usage by up to half over the CLH-Miner algorithm.},

Genetic algorithms (GA) frequently allow finding better solutions than classical methods in many areas. This is also true for the instance selection task. The main difficulties and challenges in GA-based instance selection are high computational complexity and decreasing performance with the dataset size growth. This is caused by the fact that each instance is encoded in one chromosome position. Hence bigger datasets result in longer chromosomes. The main contribution of this paper addresses the above problems in a three-step process. In the first step the dataset is divided into several consistent regions by fuzzy clustering . Then GA-based instance selection is performed independently within each cluster. Finally ensemble voting provides seamless aggregation of the partial results from the overlapping clusters. This improves dataset exploitation by more localized search and also takes the advantage of ensemble methods . This method significantly improves the predictive model performance and data reduction in comparison to instance selection performed on the whole training dataset.},

Validating and testing such models is a challenge which is being overcome by developing simulators. Regardless of their heterogeneity, such simulators require to read and interpret the models to be simulated. To this end, P-Lingua is a high-level P system definition language which has been widely used in the last decade. The P-Lingua ecosystem includes not only the language, but also libraries and software tools for parsing and simulating membrane computing models. Each version of P-Lingua supported new types or variants of P systems. This leads to a shortcoming: Only a predefined list of variants can be used, thus making it difficult for researchers to study custom ones. Moreover, derivation modes cannot be user-defined, i.e, the way in which P system computations should be generated is determined by the simulation algorithm in the source code. The main contribution of this paper is a completely new design of the P-Lingua language, called P-Lingua 5, in which the user can define custom variants and derivation modes, among other improvements such as including procedural programming and simulation directives. It is worth mentioning that it has backward-compatibility with previous versions of the language. A completely new set of command-line tools is provided for parsing and simulating P-Lingua 5 files. Finally, several examples are included in this paper covering the most common P system types.},

To address this problem we present the exact calculation of the Fisher information matrix (EFIM) for the generalized Dirichlet multinomial (GDM) mixture that has proven its efficiency when modeling count data. We present a parametrization of GDM mixture model that allows the determination of the Fisher matrix’s elements by means of the Beta-binomial probability function. We also propose a novel count data modeling approach with the benefit of EFIM. In particular, we tackle the problem of mixture model estimation and selection using the Fisher scoring algorithm and minimum message length within the Deterministic Annealing Expectation-Maximization learning framework. Experiments on detecting depression in tweets, dialogue-based emotion recognition, and image-based sentiment analysis confirm the capability of the proposed approach and the merits of using the EFIM as compared with existing state-of-the-art methods and techniques that ignore the full determination of the Fisher information matrix’s elements.},

In this paper, we present a novel robust unsupervised feature selection method for unlabeled dimensionality reduction, which obtains feature importance information by predicting cluster labels of data with matrix factorization . The orthogonal constraints on two decomposing matrices facilitate achieving more accurate class labels of clusters so as to select features with highly discrimination power. Then, the local preserving term is integrated into the projected data for selecting features with local retention ability.

It is often difficult to perform leaf-node prediction owing to ambiguous or incomplete information In such scenarios, a multi-granularity decision needs to be designed to stop the sample at a coarse-grained node rather than going rashly to a wrong leaf node. Conventionally, the probabilities of assigning the sample to its child nodes are regarded as evidence to decide whether to let the sample stop or go. However, the fact that the output of an unreliable classifier cannot be used to appropriately form the basis of decision making, especially with the existence of data uncertainties, is overlooked by existing methods. Therefore, we model the multi-granularity decision problem from an uncertainty perspective and consider that the uncertainties of multi-granularity decision emanate from the prediction of the classifier and the intrinsic information of the data. Inspired by the theory of fuzzy rough sets , a new measure is proposed to describe the intrinsic uncertainty in data. Integrating with the prediction uncertainty of the classifier, the hierarchical structure is used to design an effective optimization method that ensures proper multi-granularity decisions.

To evaluate RSAE-BA, we presented a new BA validation method using the RS, which is applicable to both unlabeled and labeled data. We compared the results of RSAE-BA with existing methods, and demonstrated the accuracy of RSAE-BA and its applicability to predict disease incidence.

As an important method in graph clustering , structural clustering can not only discover the densely connected core vertices, but also the hub vertices and the outliers. We propose a new clustering model named stable structural clustering, to solve the problem existing in previous models that the mined core vertex is a ‘real’ core one in only a small amount of possible worlds of the uncertain graph. Specifically, we first propose the concept of probability core reliability which measures the probability of a vertex being a core vertex in the uncertain graph. On the basis of probability core reliability, we propose the definition of stable core vertex and formulate the stable structural clustering problem . Comparing with other structural clustering models, the proposed stable structural clustering performs better in crucial indicators that reflect the quality of clustering. We develop two algorithms to calculate stable core vertex, a precise dynamic programming based algorithm and a sampling based algorithm with some effective pruning techniques, based on which we give our structural clustering algorithm . Extensive experiments show that comparing with other structural clustering algorithms in uncertain graphs, the stable structural clustering algorithms proposed can get better clustering to a certain extent.},

  abstract     = {The studies on modeling and analysis of time series based on fuzzy granulation have shown that fuzzy granulation is an effective approach in data mining of time series. However, the investigation of fuzzy granulation of interval-valued time series (ITS) and its applications has just begun in recent years with appearance of few research results. Different from the existing studies, this paper carried out the investigation of fuzzy granulation of ITS in interval number space instead of real number space. Two distinguished concepts, namely static fuzzy information granules and dynamic fuzzy information granules of ITS, are proposed firstly. Then the approaches for constructing a static fuzzy information granule and a dynamic fuzzy information granule are designed respectively. After that, two fuzzy granulation methods for ITS based on the above two approaches are presented in the framework of interval analysis under the guidance of the principle of justifiable granularity. Based on the specific proposed fuzzy granule which is called linear dynamic fuzzy granule, a long-term forecasting model for ITS was developed with the aid of artificial neural network. Experiments conducted on several ITS from stock markets with different dynamic characteristics showed the outperformance of the proposed long-term forecasting model.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning is an important research topic in machine learning and recently has been introduced into evolutionary computation to form evolutionary multi-task optimization (EMTO). EMTO focuses on tackling multiple optimization tasks simultaneously based on knowledge transfer and reuse. Many EMTO algorithms have been proposed mainly for single-objective optimization problems and achieved success in various fields, yet multi-objective EMTO remains a big challenge. The existing multi-objective EMTO algorithms tend to suffer from issues like slow convergence and degraded performance on less correlated tasks. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a new multi-objective EMTO algorithm by introducing cross-dimensional variable search and prediction-based individual search for efficient knowledge transfer. The cross-dimensional variable search optimizes a decision variable using information collected from other variables. The prediction-based individual search performs individual mapping where the offspring solutions and the corresponding parent solutions are symmetrized about the predicted population center to maintain the population diversity. The proposed algorithm is tested on benchmark problems and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.},

Moreover, three new spatial rough set-based geographical detectors are proposed. With the help of the uncertainty indices, these detectors measure the spatial explanatory power of different factors, compare their importance, and detect feature interactions. Experiments are conducted using two publicly accessible datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed geographical detectors and evaluate their performance against that of geographical detectors based on q q -statistics.

Current approaches to parallelization of CbO-type algorithms such as PCbO (Parallel CbO) usually enter the parallel stage after a serial stage which could be a possible bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new parallel algorithm for computing formal concepts, which is composed of two parallel phases. The new algorithm parallelizes both the computations of the top L recursion levels and the workload distribution , which decouples worker threads from the main thread. We describe the algorithm and present an experimental evaluation of its performance and comparison with PCbO on various datasets.

In this paper, we give Deng entropy a new explanation based on the fractal idea, and propose its generalization called time fractal-based belief (TFB) entropy.

However, creating these models in sensitive domains like healthcare typically requires addressing certain privacy challenges that bring unique concerns. One effective way to handle such private data concerns is to generate realistic synthetic data that can provide practically acceptable data quality as well as be used to improve model performance. To tackle this challenge, we develop a differentially private framework for synthetic data generation using Rényi differential privacy . Our approach builds on convolutional autoencoders and convolutional generative adversarial networks to preserve critical characteristics of the generated synthetic data. In addition, our model can capture the temporal information and feature correlations present in the original data. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models under the same privacy budget using several publicly available benchmark medical datasets in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

  abstract     = {Most of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models are designed for static KGs where entity and relation sets are fixed. These approaches are inherently transductive because they simply predict the plausibility of facts whose entities and relations had to previously appear in the training phase. However, since entities and relations are constantly added, removed, or changed over time, KGC models should be able to generalize to out-of-KG entities and relations in evolving KGs, which are more suited to real-world scenarios. Moreover, incorporating global graph-structured information into KGC models is another challenging issue. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel Inductive KG Embedding (IKGE) model for open-world KGC, which accommodates out-of-KG entities and relations. Unlike training individual unique embeddings, the proposed model fundamentally learns an embedding generator function to elaborately generate fact embeddings in an inductive manner. Specifically, the feature information of each fact is extracted as a vector from its entity-related and relation-related side information via an attention mechanism . Then, to score a given fact, our neighborhood feature aggregator hierarchically accumulates the feature information of multi-hop neighbors. Experimental results show that IKGE outperforms existing approaches in both transductive and inductive setups by successfully aggregating neighborhood features.},

To verify the CAC or WAC of HFPRs, some linear programming models and 0–1 mixed programming models are developed. The methods consider all the information given by the decision maker without changing the length of hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs). Accordingly, a method of modifying an inconsistent HFPR into an additively consistent HFPR is proposed. The deviation between the original complementary matrix and the modified one is minimal. Then, several linear programming models are developed to obtain priority weights from an HFPR. From these, an integrated algorithm is designed to illustrate the process of consistency test, inconsistency modification and weights derivation for HFPRs. The proposed methods are also extended to deal with WAC and CAC of incomplete HFPRs. Finally, three numerical examples and comparative analysis are presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an integrated optimization algorithm (IOA) designed for solving complicated optimization problems that are non-convex, non-differentiable, non-continuous, or computationally intensive. IOA is synthesized from 5 sub-algorithms: follower search, leader search, wanderer search, crossover search, and role learning. The follower search finds better solutions by tracing the leaders. The leader search refines current optimal solutions by approaching or deviating from the central point of the population and then executes a single-round coordinate descent. The wanderer search carries out comprehensive search space expansion. The crossover search generates offspring using solutions from superior parents. Role learning automates the process in which a search agent decides whether to become a follower or a wanderer. A global optima estimation framework (GOEF) is proposed to offer guidelines for designing an efficient optimization algorithm , and IOA is proved to attain global optima. A differentiable integrated optimization algorithm (DIOA) that extends gradient descent is put forward to train deep learning models. Empirical case studies conclude that IOA shows a much faster convergence speed and finds better solutions than the other 8 comparative algorithms based on 27 benchmark functions . IOA has also been applied to solve unit commitment problems in the power system and shows satisfactory results. A power line sub-image classification model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is optimized by DIOA. Compared with the pure gradient descent approach, DIOA converges significantly faster and obtains a high test set accuracy with much fewer training epochs.},

It uses the 2D image matrices directly instead of extracting 1D features from them, leading to a considerable reduction in the size of the data to be processed. We compare the proposed method with 1D Multi-view Discriminant Analysis (MvDA) and single-view 2D Linear Discriminant Analysis (2DLDA). We experimentally show that the proposed method requires less than 0.1\% training time and memory than MvDA. Also, though it needs the same memory, it requires 30–70\% less training time than 2DLDA. Using less time and memory, 2DMvDA achieves a classification accuracy that is at par or better than both of these methods.},

This study fosters an adaptive feature selection approach with the Shapley value and hypothetical testing (abbrev. ShapHT+) via adaptive relevance evaluation. The tree SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method first can be used to quantify the importance of each candidate feature. An adaptive threshold is then derived to evaluate the feature’s relevance to a priori information , and all relevant features are then selected through the hypothesis testing for binomial distribution . The benchmarks indicate that ShapHT+ significantly outperforms its mainstream counterparts in ruling out interferences and the efficiency and accuracy in selecting all relevant features.

This paper presents a statistically principled methodology that focuses not only on proposing a computationally efficient imputation approach, but also on assessing the uncertainty associated with imputed values . The proposed methodology quantifies the accuracy of imputation and estimation of uncertainty for a range of challenging patterns of missing loop detector data, and compares them with existing methods. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the performance of the proposed approach remains unaffected by the presence of a large number of missing patterns and reflects the true statistical properties of the principal data. The proposed approach is also comparatively less computationally complex than the existing methods. Further, the comparative analysis of the proposed estimator shows that the generated prediction intervals are reasonably accurate and conform to the desired confidence levels with relatively small interval width.},

  abstract     = {Stencil computation patterns are the backbone of many scientific and engineering simulations. The stencil computation is known to be constrained by its high demand of memory bandwidth , which limits performance on accelerators such as GPUs . Prior GPU-based approaches concentrated on stencils with only axis-aligned grid points with 2D caching schemes. However, for stencils with non-axis grid points, prior approaches use 3D caching or multi-pass 2D caching schemes. These methods suffer from either large number of global memory accesses or required large size of the shared memory. In this work, we present an efficient GPU implementation scheme “Scatter Without Write Conflict” (SWiC) for large advanced 3D stencil patterns involving non-axis-aligned grid points. Unlike other 3D caching schemes, SWiC only needs 2D caching and a single pass over the stencil per iteration. SWiC achieves, significant reductions in the global memory accesses , without increasing the size of shared memory. SWiC can also be applied to simple axis-aligned stencils without any performance loss. Moreover, we propose a scalable implementation for the halo region exchange of 3D stencils on multi-GPU nodes. For evaluation, we test SWiC on three Nvidia GPU generations and show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art GPU implementations with a speedup ranging from 1.6× to 5.75×.

Second, given that DoS attacks could block the transmission of information, a predictor is used to compensate for the lost signals of CPSs. Then, a control strategy is proposed by combining the ETM and predictor, which can reduce the times of data transmission and control updates.

Multiscale analysis is considered vital for characterising the features of physiological signals . In this research, we propose a novel multiscale analysis method called multiscale increment entropy (MIE), which integrates incremental entropy (IncrEn) and multiscale analysis. MIE inherits the nature of IncrEn, which considers the fluctuation directions and amplitude of a time series. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world signals indicate that MIE performs better than popular approaches as a complexity index. On each temporal scale, MIE corroborates the complexity-loss theory of ageing and disease well. Furthermore, it reliably discriminates either between the EEG time series and heartbeat intervals of healthy subjects and patients or between the oxygen saturation variability of young and elderly, while commonly used algorithms do not perform well in the above cases. MIE requires less computational time compared to several popular approaches. It also has lower variations and is always defined across scales, even for short time series. These merits make it suitable for analysing unknown physiological time series.},

To get structures and concrete forms of contradictions, this paper examines two types of standard contradictions, i.e., the regular standard contradictions and the standard contradictions for non-unit clauses sets. The concepts of the regular standard contradiction and its extended form are presented. Some properties of them are discussed. In order to get simpler contradiction separation clauses in every deductive step, four types of structures for standard contradictions obtained by adding related literals in the regular standard contradiction and its extended form are gotten.

First, by introducing feature word extraction and probability distribution correction into GSDMM, we present a model called TE-GSDMM (topic enhanced Gibbs sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model). Then, a service collaboration graph is put forward to model cooperation relationships and generate service collaboration vectors. Collaboration similarity is assessed by the similarity of service collaboration vectors. Finally, the K-means++ algorithm is employed to cluster Web services by evaluating service function similarity and collaboration similarity. Experiments show that TE-GSDMM outperforms other topic models in generating high-quality service representation vectors for service clustering. Moreover, service clustering performance is further improved by integrating collaboration similarity.

It has been capturing growing research attention due to its wide utilization in the areas of data mining and computer vision. However, the full use of complementarity and consistency from multi-view data is still a challenging task. Here, we propose a novel multi-view fuzzy clustering, which adopts the joint learning of deep random walk and sparse low-rank embedding. First, a deep random walk is employed to acquire a robust similarity matrix of data points and convert fuzzy membership matrix learning to adaptive graph learning. Second, the adaptive graph is restricted with sparse low-rank constraints, which ensures its strong discriminative ability and effective cluster assignments. Third, by exploiting the sparse low-rank property, the multi-view fuzzy clustering problem is formulated as optimizing a regularized graph adjacency matrix with distance metric learning and spectral norm minimization simultaneously. The distance metric learning is embedded to scatter all data points so that any two samples are projected onto a low-dimensional subspace with a large margin. Finally, an efficient algorithm is developed for the formulated problem and its convergence is also guaranteed. In order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted by comparing state-of-the-arts on real-world databases.},

RMN generates aspect representations through graph convolution networks with a semantic dependency graph and utilizes the bi-attention mechanism to capture the relevance between the aspect and the context. Unlike conventional multi-task learning methods that need extra datasets, we construct an auxiliary relation-level classification task that extracts aspect relations from the original dataset with shared parameters. Extensive experiments on five public datasets from SemEval 14, 15, 16 and MAMS show that our RMN improves about 0.09\% to 0.8\% on accuracy and about 0.04\% to 1.19\% on F1 score, compared to several comparative baselines.},

As part of C3SF, we use conjunctive screening to scrutinize cloud services. We also propose a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach called the modified Best-Worst Method (MBWM), which computes the weights of criteria using early-stage consensus among decision-makers. In addition, we introduce an innovative two-step consensus process for ranking services using leading MCDM methods followed by an aggregation of ranks using a Markov chain-based approach. Moreover, to develop a broader consensus, we propose another two-stage novel mechanism comprising multi-aggregation and synthesis/fusion of rank information using a partially ordered set . We validate the performance and effectiveness of C3SF through a CSS case study using real-world data followed by a comprehensive analysis. The results show that C3SF is robust, practical, and suitable for well-informed decision-making.},

In the proposed method, networks with either identical or different structures are trained cooperatively to learn distinct text features from each other. To this end, in addition to the supervised learning loss function, we construct three mimicry loss functions at different feature extraction stages, which can integrate steganalytic features from various levels. Finally, we illustrate how the steganalysis framework can be extended from two networks to multiple networks. Four representative steganalysis networks with different structures are employed to verify the effectiveness of our framework. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively assist networks with fewer resources to perform better in model size, inference time, and detection accuracy than state-of-the-art steganalysis algorithms.},

Task assignment is a crucial issue in SC and has attracted much attention. Most prior studies on task assignment ignore the importance of dependency among tasks, resulting in some ineffective matching pairs and wasting workers’ time. To this end, we formulate a new problem in SC, abbreviated as multi-stage complex task assignment (MSCTA), which aims to assign workers to multi-stage complex tasks to maximize the total profit. Compared with existing studies, MSCTA can obtain more effective assignments by considering the dependency constraints among tasks. We prove that the MSCTA problem is NP-hard and propose a greedy algorithm and a game algorithm. Specifically, both algorithms iteratively utilize a filtering module to obtain a set of executable tasks (ET) for assignment. The greedy algorithm can quickly assign the most profitable workers to the subtasks in each round of ET, and obtain a provable approximate result. The game algorithm is proved to be convergent and can win a Nash equilibrium when processing the subtasks in each round of ET. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.},

In this study, we propose a systematic loan evaluation framework called COst Sensitive Loan Evaluation (COSLE). Specifically, we first develop an instance-aware misclassification cost (IMCO) matrix, which specifies personalized cost for each loan. Then, we present a differential labelling algorithm called DILA cost for assigning node labels and assessing the corresponding cost. By integrating these enhancements into the tree-induction process, we construct a node splitting measurement called COG index . It exploits the relationship between the return information and the final payoff outcome. Additionally, we design the LER evaluation metric to measure the ability of a loan evaluation model to increase the lender’s return. Finally, the COSLE is used to improve popular tree models.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose adversarial predictive coding (APC), a novel method for detecting abnormal events. Abnormal event detection (AED) is to identify unobserved events from a given training dataset consisting of normal events, and it is considered as one of the most important objectives in developing intelligent surveillance systems. Given videos and motion flows of normal events, the APC derives a normal event model by applying an adversarial prediction approach on the jointly learnt latent feature space from the videos and motion flows. Since latent space requires more abstracted and noise-free information than the raw data space, the APC can derive a more discriminative model for normal events compared with other deep learning-based AED methods which directly apply uni-modal losses such as mean square error and cross-entropy to low-level data such as video frames. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting abnormal events using UCSD-Ped, Avenue, and UCF-Crime datasets. The experimental results show that the APC surpass the existing state-of-the-art AED methods by deriving a more discriminative model for normal events.},

  abstract     = {As a concept put forward by Prof Zadeh, Z-numbers have become a research hotspot in fuzzy theory. Different from the previous fuzzy sets, Z-numbers possess a stronger ability in expressing uncertainty because of the unique structure. The chief purpose of this paper is to research linguistic uncertain Z-numbers with a rectangular coordinate system . Taking into account the shortcomings of previous studies, the rectangular coordinate system is firstly adopted to address linguistic Z-numbers. Based on the new expression, arithmetic operations are defined. After summarizing the drawbacks of the previous aggregation operators, a novel approach named linguistic uncertain Z-numbers weighted averaging aggregation operator based on the rectangular coordinate system (LUZWAAORCS) is defined. Subsequently, the Minkowski distance measure of linguistic uncertain Z-numbers is proposed and the rationality is proven by a theorem. Follow that, a score function considering the Minkowski distance measure and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is suggested to quantify the information in different Z-numbers. Besides, an innovative Cosine similarity is defined to measure the similarity. Simultaneously, several examples are used to describe the proposed innovations. As far as our latest knowledge is concerned, Z-numbers have never been researched with a rectangular coordinate system, so this may be another door to process Z-number-based information.},

  abstract     = {Cross-validation (CV), while being extensively used for model selection, may have three major weaknesses. The regular 10-fold CV, for instance, is often unstable in its choice of the best model among the candidates. Secondly, the CV outcome of singling out one candidate based on the total prediction errors over the different folds does not convey any sensible information on how much one can trust the apparent winner. Lastly, when only one data splitting ratio is considered, regardless of its choice, it may work very poorly for some situations. In this work, to address these shortcomings, we propose a new averaging-voting based version of cross-validation for better comparison results. Simulations and real data are used to illustrate the superiority of the new approach over traditional CV methods.},

  abstract     = {It is widely acknowledged that the initial spreaders play an important role in the spread of information in complex networks. Thus, a variety of centrality-based methods have been proposed for identifying the most influential spreaders. However, most existing studies overlook the fact that, in real social networks, it is more costly and difficult to convince influential individuals to act as initial spreaders, resulting in a high risk to maximal spreading. In this paper, we address this problem on the basis of the assumption that the activation of large-degree nodes carries a higher risk than that of small-degree nodes. We aim to identify the initial spreaders that most effectively maximize the spreading when considering both the activation risk and the outbreak size of the initial spreaders. Analysis of random networks reveals that the degree of the optimal initial spreaders does not correspond to the largest node degree in the network, but is instead determined by the infection probability and difference in activation risk among nodes with different degrees. We propose a risk-aware metric to identify the most effective spreaders in real networks. Numerical simulations show that this risk-aware metric outperforms the existing benchmark centralities in terms of maximizing the spreading.},

A density function, named the Approximate Root Normal Distribution (ARND), was developed to approximate the distribution of a square root of a normal random variable . This enabled approximating the distribution of the RMSE estimator. The theoretical derivations and the demonstrations on common distributions, a benchmark time series, and a real world data set (with prediction errors generated from ANN and ARIMA models) lead to the following practically useful findings. When comparing errors having the same distribution type, RMSE was shown to be preferred for platykurtic distributions, MAE for leptokurtic distributions, and either RMSE or MAE for mesokurtic distributions. For different distribution types, however, using the two estimators alone was shown to lead to erroneous conclusions. The revelation that the estimated RMSE/MSE ratio could identify whether the errors came from platykurtic/mesokurtic/leptokurtic distributions was a useful complementary result. Comparison of errors based on, error distributions, sample size and the standard errors of the estimators, was discussed. The proposed procedure for deriving the statistical properties of the two estimators has scope for extension for other distribution types.},

Firstly, the sensor fault is defined as a new state, and then an adaptive observer is developed to estimate the actuator fault and the newly defined state with the aid of the descriptor system approach. By using the obtained fault estimation, a novel fault accommodation scheme is proposed based on the sample point controller design approach to satisfy the stochastic stability requirement of the closed-loop system with a prescribed H ∞ H∞ performance bound. Moreover, for the convenience of design, the presented sample point controller design is successfully transformed into resolving a class of input-delay control issues.

A new semi-supervised NMF method, called dual semi-supervised convex nonnegative matrix factorization (DCNMF), is proposed in this paper for fully using the limited label information. Specifically, DCNMF simultaneously incorporates the pointwise and pairwise constraints of labeled samples as dual supervisory information into convex NMF, which results in a better low-dimensional data representation. Moreover, DCNMF imposes the nonnegative constraint only on the coefficient matrix but not on the base matrix . Consequently, DCNMF can process mixed-sign data, and hence enlarge the range of applications. We derive an efficient alternating iterative algorithm for DCNMF to solve the optimization, and analyze the proposed DCNMF method in terms of the convergence and computational complexity . We also discuss the relationships between DCNMF and several typical NMF based methods. Experimental results illustrate that DCNMF outperforms the related state-of-the-art NMF methods on nonnegative and mixed-sign datasets for clustering applications.},

  abstract     = {The pattern recognition of surface electromyography (sEMG) signal is an important application in the realization of human-machine interface. However, due to the disturbance of human body, sensors and environment, sEMG signal usually contains lots of noise, which brings great challenges to the high-accuracy sEMG pattern recognition. In addition, embedded human wearable devices are becoming more and more popular nowadays. How to realize the sEMG recognition method with low power consumption and high noise immunity has also become a difficult and very meaningful research topic. In this paper, a spiking neural network (SNN) classification method based on second-order information bottleneck training is proposed. Firstly, the training loss function for classification neural networks is constructed based on the proposed second-order information bottleneck. The method is used to train the conventional continuous-valued neural network and convert it into an SNN model with equivalent structure and connection weights. Then, the converted SNN is used to classify the sEMG signal patterns. Through a series of theoretical analysis and experimental results, it is proved that this method has significant advantages in terms of generalization of network determination and computational efficiency.

Second, we introduce a visual taxonomy of deep learning approaches that provides a systematic structure to the many diverse models introduced until now.

First, a new update method is proposed for policy networks that promotes learning efficiency. Second, the utilization of samples is improved, at the same time reflecting the ability of perspective-taking among groups. Finally, the “deceptive signal” in training is eliminated and the learning degree among agents is more uniform than in the existing methods. Multiple experiments were conducted in two typical scenarios of a multi-agent particle environment.

  abstract     = {Multi-modal multi-objective optimization problem (MMOPs) has attracted more and more attention in evolutionary computing recently. It is not easy to solve these problems using the existing evolutionary algorithms . The non-dominated solution sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) has poor PS distribution and convergence. In this paper, an enhanced fast NSGA-II based on a special congestion strategy and adaptive crossover strategy, namely ASDNSGA-II is proposed. In the ASDNSGA-II, the strategy with a special congestion degree is used to improve the selection strategy. Then a new adaptive crossover strategy is designed by evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of the SBX crossover strategy with the ability to solve high dimensions and the BLX-α with the ability of Pareto solution to produce offspring solutions. These can ensure the generation of offspring solutions around individuals with large crowding degrees and balance the convergence and diversity of decision space and object space. It can improve PS distribution and convergence and maintain PF precision. Eight functions of MMF1-MMF8 from the CEC2020 are selected to prove the effectiveness of the ASDNSGA-II. By comparing several latest multi-modal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms , the results show that the ASDNSGA-II can effectively find the global Pareto solution set and improve the distribution and convergence of PS.},

  abstract     = {Since multimodal imaging technology is able to provide multiple perspectives on the lesion, it has become increasingly important in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. In this paper, a novel medical image fusion using gradient domain-guided filter random walk (GDGFRW) and side window filtering (SWF) in the framelet transform (FT) domain is presented. Firstly, FT is performed on the original multimodal source images to obtain the corresponding approximate and residual representations. Secondly, a novel model—GDGFRW, which combines the superiorities of both gradient domain guided filtering and random walks—is constructed to interpret the approximate sub-bands, while the residual sub-bands are fused by SWF. Finally, the fused approximate sub-bands and residual sub-bands undergo inverse FT to generate the final fused image. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed method was tested on different categories of multimodal medical image fusion issues, in more than 40 pairs of source images. The proposed method outperforms the current representative ones in terms of both subjective visual performance and objective assessment.},

The scalability and efficiency of the existing algorithms on multi-core task scheduling need to be improved. To schedule real-time tasks on a multi-core processor, any pair of inter-dependent tasks must be executed following their original execution order. The directed acyclic graph (DAG) is commonly used to study the internal structure of a program. In this work, we investigated the property of the data dependency to eliminate the unnecessary execution constraints, and improved the DAG model by incorporating the temporal property of these dependencies. Based on such a model, we proposed a dynamic decomposed scheduling (DDS) strategy. With DDS, the dependent tasks could be released and executed earlier before the completion of their precedent tasks without producing any data hazards. The experiments were conducted on both synthesized tasks and real industrial embedded applications, the results show that DDS has a good performance in multi-core task scheduling , and it outperforms the state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms including the decomposed scheduling, the global scheduling, and the federated scheduling.},

  abstract     = {The current study has systematically presented a strategy of designing the fixed-time high-order sliding mode (HOSM) controller with asymmetric output constraints. This constructive method is accomplished by three crucial mechanisms. First of all, some nonlinear terms satisfying homogeneous growth conditions are implanted into the mismatched channels of the traditional HOSM system. Based on this, a HOSM system with mismatched terms is built to weaken the uncertainties in control input channels. Secondly, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is developed to resolve the constraints. Thirdly, by integrating the BLF with a backstepping-like method, a fixed-time HOSM controller is explicitly proposed to handle the HOSM dynamics with mismatched terms and asymmetric output constraints. It is shown via the strict Lyapunov analysis that under the constructed controller, the closed-loop system is fixed-time stabilized and the realization of prescribed constraints is insured. The investigations of two cases are provided to validate the established theoretical results.},

In this paper, a constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed based on a hybrid driven strategy to enhance both the feasibility and diversity performance of the approximate Pareto solutions . The proposed algorithm contains two archives, that one is driven by feasibility information and the other is driven by diversity information. A self-adaptive archive selection mechanism and a conditional tournament selection strategy are proposed to provide mating parent solutions according to the evolutionary stage. Moreover, in the update of the feasibility archive, an evolutionary direction prediction mechanism is proposed and adopted to improve the evolutionary efficiency. Compared to four other multi-objective algorithms on three benchmark suits of different types, the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the peer algorithms, especially in large-infeasible-regions multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In many practical applications, the data are class imbalanced. Accordingly, it is very meaningful and valuable to investigate the classification of imbalanced data . In the framework of binary imbalanced data classification, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is the best-known oversampling method. However, for each positive sample, SMOTE generates only k k synthetic samples on the lines between the positive sample and its k k -nearest neighbors, resulting in three drawbacks: (1) SMOTE cannot effectively extend the training field of positive samples; (2) the generated positive samples lack diversity; (3) SMOTE does not accurately approximate the probability distribution of the positive samples. Therefore, two binary imbalanced data classification methods named BIDC1 and BIDC2 based on diversity oversampling by generative models are proposed. The BIDC1 and BIDC2 conduct diversity oversampling using extreme learning machine autoencoder and generative adversarial network , respectively. Extensive experiments on 26 data sets are conducted to compare the two methods with 14 state-of-the-art methods using five metrics: F-measure, G-means, AUC-area, MMD-score, and Silhouette-score. The experimental results demonstrate that the two methods outperform the other 14 methods.},

In the hierarchical social networks, the relation and opinion exchange between decision makers and participants can influence the consensus reaching of three-way group decision. In this paper, we deeply explore the three-way group decision consensus reaching by constructing adjustment mechanism based on the hierarchical social networks. In the hierarchical social network, we firstly learn the attitudes of participants for the opinions of decision makers . Inspired by the thought of three-way decision, we successfully identify the valid followers, hesitant followers and invalid follower of decision makers from the participants with the aid of the trust and consensus information. According to the character of followers, we compute the real influence of decision makers. Then, we discuss the consensus model. In the adjustment process of GDM of social network, the inconsistent decision makers tend to adjust evaluation based on the evaluation of the most influential decision makers. Thus, we introduce the maximum closeness degree between the inconsistent decision maker and the most influential decision maker to construct the minimum adjustment consensus model. Besides, we extend the minimum adjustment consensus model by considering the various unit cost and limited adjustment budget. In light of the consensual loss information and Bayesian decision theory , we determine the classification rules of three-way group decision. Finally, we use an example of the medical equipment selection of purchasing department to elaborate and validate our proposed method.},

Since the information of communication quantization and state observation is coupled to each other, it is necessary to jointly design uniform quantizer with scaling function and the observer. Based on this, a distributed control protocol is proposed, which leads to a distributed asymptotic consensus of overall nonlinear systems with either known or unknown Lipschitz constant through ⌈ log 2 ( 2 R ) ⌉ ⌈log2(2R)⌉ -bit information exchange between each pair of agents.

In this algorithm, a polynomial regression equation is taken as the center of each cluster instead of the cluster prototype used in conventional FCM, and the difference between a sample and a cluster prototype is defined as the distance between the actual value of one attribute and the corresponding predicted value provided by its own polynomial regression equation. An alternating optimization method is designed to optimize the new clustering objective function of the proposed algorithm. A series of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the PR-FCM algorithm, which exhibits higher effectiveness and possesses more advantages than the original FCM algorithm.

Unfortunately, pHDP loses the non-parametric feature of HDP, i.e., the number of topics in pHDP is predetermined and fixed. Furthermore, under the bootstrap structure of pHDP, the topic-indiscriminate words are of high probabilities to be assigned to different topics, resulting in poor qualities of the extracted topics. To achieve parallelism without sacrificing the non-parametric feature of HDP, in addition to improve the quality of extracted topics, we propose a parallel dynamic topic model by developing an adjustment mechanism of evolving topics and reducing the sampling probabilities of topic-indiscriminate words.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based control approach that uses the Policy Iteration (PI) and a metaheuristic Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm to train the Neural Networks (NNs). Due to an efficient tradeoff to exploration and exploitation, the GWO algorithm shows good results in NN training and solving complex optimization problems. The proposed approach is compared to the classical PI RL-based control approach using the Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm, and with the RL-based control approach which uses the metaheuristic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The experiments are conducted using a nonlinear servo system laboratory equipment. Each approach evaluated on how well it solves the optimal reference tracking control for an experimental servo system position control system. The policy NNs specific to all three approaches are implemented as state feedback with integrator controllers to remove the steady-state control errors and thus ensure the convergence of the objective function. Because of the random nature of metaheuristic algorithms, the experiments for GWO and PSO algorithms are run multiple times and the results are averaged before the conclusions are presented. The experimental results shows that for the control objective considered in this paper, the GWO algorithm represents a better solution compared to GD and PSO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The main objective of the study is to investigate the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy-model-based networked control system under the fuzzy event-triggered H ∞ H∞ control scheme. Instead of considering the conventional network transmission delay, the paper introduces the probability distribution based network transmission delay, which is more compatible with real time-simulations. Due to distributed transmission delay, the closed-loop network control system has become distributed delay system. To make use of full information about the membership function, the Lyapunov function candidate is designed as fuzzy-membership-dependent Lyapunov function . A switching concept with respect to the rate of changes in membership functions is introduced to design the optimal control gain matrices for the considered system. The main advantage of the fuzzy-membership-dependent Lyapunov function is that it can ensure the less conservatism of the result without increasing the number of decision variables. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, two kinds are real-time systems are taken into account, one is nonlinear mass-spring-damper model, followed by an industrial example, say, surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor model. The corresponding simulation results show the superiority of the proposed results over the existing works.},

  abstract     = {Recently, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have received a high level of attention as a physiological signal in the field of biometrics. It has presented great possibilities for its strength against counterfeit. However, the ECG feature templates are irreplaceable, and a compromised template implies a permanent loss of identity. Therefore, several studies have been introduced biometric template protection techniques such as cancelable techniques to protect the original template in case it is stolen or lost. In this research, a cancelable ECG approach is proposed to protect the ECG feature template for human authentication. In our system, we first employed some image processing techniques for preprocessing the input ECG signals. Then, a deep transfer learning approach is employed to extract the deep ECG features. Later, the proposed cancelable approach based on DNA and amino acid is applied to protect the deep feature templates. Lastly, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for authentication. Extensive experiments on two commonly used datasets coupled with comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrate the highest accuracy of the proposed system and the strong resilience of the system to various security and privacy attacks. Results show that the proposed cancelable method meets all requirements of cancelable biometrics such as irreversibility , revocability, and unlinkability .},

In two-player iterated games, memory in terms of the outcome of previous interactions and the strategy choices of co-players are of great referential significance for subsequent strategy actions. It is generally recognized that there is no single simple and overarching strategy whereby one player X can unilaterally achieve a higher payoff than his opponent Y, irrespective of Y’s strategy and response. In this paper, we demonstrate that such strategies do exist in diverse networked populations. More precisely, (i) such strategies can obtain a low payoff for the focal player, however, they also lead to an even lower payoff for that player’s partner, in turn lowering benefits of the overall populations; (ii) they are capable of winning with a high probability against opponents with an unknown strategy; and (iii) they have a survival advantage and robust fitness in terms of evolutionary processes. We refer to these as the “self-bad, partner-worse” (SBPW) strategies. Results presented here add to previous studies on strategy evolution in the context of social dilemmas and hint at some insights concerning cooperation promotion mechanisms among networked populations.},

  abstract     = {Traditional topic classification usually adopts the closed-world assumption that all the test topics have been seen in training. However, in open dynamic environments, the potential new topics may appear in testing due to the evolution of text data over time. Considering the uncertainty and multi-granularity of dynamic text data, such open topic classification needs to detect unseen topics by mining the boundary region continually, and incrementally update the previous models by knowledge accumulation. To address these challenge issues, this paper introduces a unified framework of three-way multi-granularity learning to open topic classification based on the fusion of three-way decision and granular computing . First, we propose the multilevel granular structure of tasks from the temporal-spatial multi-granularity perspective. Then, we construct an adaptive decision boundary and use the centroids and the corresponding radius to discover unknowns by the reject option. Subsequently, we further explore the unknown topics by three-way enhanced clustering and the uncertain instances will be re-investigated in the next stage. Besides, we design a built-in knowledge base represented as the centroid of each topic to store the topic knowledge. Finally, the experiments are conducted to compare the performances of proposed models and the efficiency of knowledge accumulation with classic models.},

The leader is active, implying that it has a bounded but unknown control input to modify the behavior of followers in response to changes or threats and consequently avoid unexpected circumstances. A resilient observer with a cyber-attack compensation signal is first performed to estimate the leader’s state and output for the followers, while ensuring that the impact of cyber-attacks in the communication network is compensated. A compensation signal, along with a feasibility condition, then acts on the followers to complete the specified time-varying formation offset. The transformation of the output leader-follower formation problem to the conventional tracking problem is then further realized by a state-space transformation method. Next, inhomogeneous algebraic Riccati equations are derived by learning the solution to the conventional tracking problem for which its optimization is guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness and availability of the proposed method are demonstrated through a simulation example.},

To solve these problems, a concept drift type identification method is proposed based on multi-sliding windows (CDT_MSW). This method consists of three processes. During the first detection process, the drift position is detected by sliding the basic window forward. Then, in the growth process, the drift length is detected using the growth of the adjoint window, and the drift category is identified according to the drift length. Finally, during tracking process, the drift subcategory can be accurately identified according to the different tracking flow ratio curves generated during window tracking. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively identify the type of concept drift, accurately analyze the key information during online learning and improve the efficiency and generalization performance of streaming data analysis and mining.},

  abstract     = {A Flexible Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (FTNU) represents temporal constraints between time-points . Time-points are variables that must be set ( executed ) satisfying all the constraints. Some time-points are contingent . It means that they are set by the environment and only observed by the system executing the network. The ranges representing temporal constraints associated with contingent time-points ( guarded ranges) can be shrunk during execution only to some extent to have more flexibility in the execution of the network. Subsets of time-points/constraints may be executed/considered in different contexts according to some observed conditions. The main issue here consists of determining whether all the time-points, under the control of the system, are executable in a way that all the specified constraints are satisfied for any possible occurrence of contingent time-points and any possible context. Such property is called controllability . Even though an algorithm was proposed for checking the controllability of such networks, we show that such an algorithm has a limit. Indeed, it does not determine the right bounds for guarded links, and, therefore, it doesn’t permit the system to exploit the potential flexibility of the network. We then propose a new constraint-propagation algorithm for checking controllability, prove that such a new algorithm determines the right guarded ranges, and it is sound-and-complete. Thus, it can be used also for executing the network, by leveraging its flexibility.},

Our solution uses two complementary representations: T-Matrices which excels at querying the aggregated network load, and TTCTR which represents all passenger trips and aims at counting the trips following a given pattern (i.e., how many passengers started/ended a trip at a given location or moved from a given location to another). In addition, we propose XCTR, a variant of TTCTR, which efficiently answers a wider range of queries at the cost of a moderate performance loss for some queries and some space overhead. Overall, our representation can handle a dataset of ten million trips within approximately 65\% of its original size while supporting a wide range of queries in the order of microseconds.},

Algorithms for calculating these two types of constraints are established through thorough theoretical proof. Comparative experiments have been undertaken with state-of-the-art algorithms. It has been demonstrated that an algorithm improved with the proposed ancestral partition or combined ancestral and heuristic partition outperforms the algorithm in its original form, and it can have lower running time, fewer expanded states, and higher accuracy, as well as the ability to search larger networks within 100 nodes.},

With the explosive proliferation of Web 2.0, the volume of online textual reviews has been sharply increasing. However, how to use this type of unstructured data and utilize the valuable information hidden behind are still problems to be solved. This study aims to provide a multi-attributes decision analysis (MADA) framework based on incomplete online textual reviews to aid in decision making. First, online textual reviews are obtained by data crawling. Attributes information is determined by textual analysis and the attitudes of assessors toward each attribute is discriminated by the sentiment analysis . Then, some new rules are developed in encoding incomplete online textual reviews into interval-valued linguistic distribution assessment (ILDA) to better characterize the evaluators’ attitudes. Next, evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm is extended to the ILDA environment to combine the information with multiple attributes, and the utility interval of each alternative is constructed by solving a pair of nonlinear optimization models. Given that the interval data cannot be directly compared, an enhanced minimax regret approach is proposed to compare and rank them. Finally, a real case study about online commodity evaluation is examined to show the implementation process of the proposed framework, and a discussion is also conducted to systematically analyze its superiority.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an adaptive neural consensus tracking control approach for a class of leader–follower uncertain multiagent systems with sensor faults. Based on backstepping technique, a new direct adaptive neural control scheme is proposed to adaptively approximate the sensor faults. In order to improve the stability of the system and transient performance, a series of smooth functions are incorporated into control design and Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a class of reduced-order smooth functions is introduced to achieve a simpler virtual controller implementation. It is proved that the closed-loop signals are bounded and the synchronization errors can converge to a preset interval. Besides the asymptotic performance, a tunable L 2 L2 -norm transient performance is achieved. Finally, numerical and physical example are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Choosing the most suitable algorithm to perform a machine learning task for a new problem is a recurrent and complex task. In multi-target regression tasks , when problem transformation methods are applied, this choice is even harder. The reason is the need to simultaneously choose the problem transformation method and the base learning algorithm. This work investigates how to bridge the gap of method/base learner recommendation for problems with multiple outputs. In meta-learning experiments, we use a large number of multi-target regression datasets to investigate whether using meta-learning can provide good recommendations. To do this, we compared the meta-models induced by 3 3 different ML algorithms , including three variations for each of them, and selected 58 58 meta-features that we believe are relevant for extracting good dataset descriptions for the meta-learning process. In the experimental results, the meta-models outperformed the baselines (Majority and Random) by recommending the most suitable solution for multi-target regression (for the transformation method and base-learner) with high predictive performance , including real-world applications. The meta-features and the relation between the transformation method and base-learner provided important insights regarding the optimal problem transformation method. Furthermore, when comparing the application of algorithm adaptation and problem transformation methods, our meta-learning proposal was capable of statistically overcoming all competitors, which resulted in a predictive performance using the best choice per problem.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays often multiple sensors provide real-time data about the same process. However, most data stream analysis algorithms work over a single feature vector. A common approach to overcome this issue is to combine the features extracted from each sensor into a single vector. The more sensors monitor a process, the more likely there is a malfunction or delay in data transmission. Hence the interest in developing algorithms capable of handling missing data or incorporating delayed data when it becomes available. This work presents a dynamic ensemble clustering algorithm based on evidence accumulation that can process multiple data streams . Each algorithm of the ensemble only processes one data stream, and obtaining the final partition does not require that data from all the streams is available. Therefore, final results can be provided even when there are sensor malfunctions or network delays. Furthermore, if delayed data arrives it can be used to extract evidence from the moment of arrival onwards. The algorithm was applied to identify arrhythmias over 71 standard 12-lead electrocardiogram recordings, achieving a 0.314\% ± 0.010 error rate. The strategies of combining all the leads in a single feature vector or working with each lead independently were compared, obtaining better results in the second case.},

To this end, a novel multi-directional binary pattern named Cross Lattice Pattern (CLP) has been proposed. CLP is applied to the previously extracted invariant phase congruency feature maps to generate the CLPPC images. Finally, weighted alpha-blending has been performed on the CLPPC maps to generate the Fused CLPPC (FCLPPC) feature map. Recognition results on Extended Yale-B, TUFTS, CMU-PIE, and CASIA NIR-VIS datasets have been presented to depict the superiority of the proposed scheme over other state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Graph clustering (also referred to as community detection) is an important topic in network analysis . Although a large amount of literature has been published on the problem, most of them are designed at the level of lower-order structure of networks, e.g., individual vertices and edges, and fail to capture higher-order information of networks. Recently, higher-order units (under the name of motifs) are introduced to graph clustering. These methods typically focus on constructing a motif-based hypergraph where higher-order information is preserved, and communities abstracted from the hypergraph usually achieve better accuracy. However, the hypergraph is often fragmented for a sparse network and contains a large number of isolated vertices that will be outliers of the identified community cover. To address the fragmentation problem, we propose an asymmetric triangle enhancement approach for graph clustering, in which a mixture of edges and asymmetric triangles is taken into consideration for cluster measures. We also design an approximation model to speed up the algorithm by estimating the measures. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we take into account this research topic for quasi-overlap functions. First of all, we give the concept of quasi-overlap functions on a finite chain L L with n + 2 n+2 elements and its arbitrary subchains together with three generalized forms of quasi-overlap functions on any subchain of L L . And then, we show some examples of quasi-overlap functions on L L along with some of its specific subchains and study the idempotent property, Archimedean property and cancellation law of quasi-overlap functions on L L . Finally, we obtain two construction methods of quasi-overlap functions on L L , one of them is the ordinal sum construction.},

  abstract     = {One of the most widely adopted approaches to define weights for Ordered Weighting Averaging (OWA) operators consists of using biparametric linear increasing fuzzy linguistic quantifiers. However, several shortcomings appear when using these quantifiers because depending on the values of these parameters, the aggregations could be biased or the extreme values might be completely ignored. In this contribution, the use of Extreme Values Reductions (EVRs) as fuzzy linguistic quantifiers is proposed to define weights for OWA operators in order to provide more realistic aggregations. First, the impact of the parameters of these linear fuzzy linguistic quantifiers in the OWA aggregations is studied. After that, EVR-OWA operators are introduced as those OWA operators whose weights are computed by using an EVR as fuzzy linguistic quantifier. It will be shown that when using EVR-OWA operators to fuse information, the aggregations are non-biased, take into account more information and the intermediate values are prioritized before the extreme ones. After proposing several families of EVRs, the generalising potential of the EVR-OWA operators is shown by proving that every family of symmetric weights for OWA operators that prioritize the intermediate information are the weights obtained from a certain EVR. Finally, an illustrative example is provided.},

We demonstrate that semiparametric Bayesian networks generalize two well-known types of Bayesian networks: Gaussian Bayesian networks and kernel density estimation Bayesian networks. For this purpose, we consider two different conditional probability distributions required in a semiparametric Bayesian network. In addition, we present modifications of two well-known algorithms (greedy hill-climbing and PC) to learn the structure of a semiparametric Bayesian network from data. To realize this, we employ a score function based on cross-validation. In addition, using a validation dataset, we apply an early-stopping criterion to avoid overfitting. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, we conduct an exhaustive experiment on synthetic data sampled by mixing linear and nonlinear functions, multivariate normal data sampled from Gaussian Bayesian networks, real data from the UCI repository, and bearings degradation data. As a result of this experiment, we conclude that the proposed algorithm accurately learns the combination of parametric and nonparametric components, while achieving a performance comparable with those provided by state-of-the-art methods.},

To this end, we propose a ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption method with verifiable outsourced decryption; this requires a user to complete decryption with the help of a server, but the results of the outsourced decryption can be verified independently. With this new encryption scheme and the technique of k-times anonymous authentication, a new fine-grained data access control system was constructed; this system allows a server to provide users with outsourced decryption services, and users’ computation cost is independent of the size of the underlying access control policy. Moreover, the number of outsourced decryption requests is limited. In addition, the new system supports user revocation and attribute updates and it is provably secure under formal proofs. An efficiency analysis shows that it can be compared with other similar systems in terms of performance, despite the addition of several practical properties.},

First, a novel event-triggered algorithm is developed for DT multi-player NZSGs based on the time-triggered optimal value functions. Therefore, the developed event-triggered algorithm only needs to solve the time-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Then, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved. Additionally, we show that an upper bound for the sum of the actual performance indices of all the players can be determined in advance. A key step in the implementation of the developed event-triggered algorithm is to obtain the next state of the actual system, which is difficult to implement on the actual system. Thus, a parallel control method is utilized to predict the next state by constructing the parallel system for the actual system and obtain the optimal value functions. The method that combines the developed event-triggered algorithm and parallel control is called the event-triggered optimal parallel control (ETOPC) method. The neural network (NN) technique and the iterative adaptive dynamic programming (IADP) technique are employed in parallel control. Moreover, the control stability is shown further in the consideration of the NN weight approximation errors. Finally, two simulations justify the theoretical conjectures.},

  abstract     = {The K-means algorithm is among the most commonly used data clustering methods . However, the regular K-means can only be applied in the input space, and it is applicable when clusters are linearly separable. The kernel K-means, which extends K-means into the kernel space, is able to capture nonlinear structures and identify arbitrarily shaped clusters. However, kernel methods often operate on the kernel matrix of the data, which scale poorly with the size of the matrix, or suffer from the high clustering cost due to the repetitive calculations of kernel values. Another issue is that algorithms access the data only through evaluation of K ( x i , x j ) K(xi,xj) , which limits many processes that can be done on data through the clustering task . This paper proposes a method to combine the advantages of the linear and nonlinear approaches by using derived corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on spectral analysis. Applying approximate finite-dimensional feature maps have been discussed before only in the context of Support Vector Machines (SVM) problems. We suggest using this method in the kernel K-means context as it does not require storing a huge kernel matrix in memory, calculates cluster centers more efficiently, and accesses the data explicitly in the feature space; thus taking advantage of K-means extensions in that space. We demonstrate that our Explicit Kernel Minkowski Weighted K-means (Explicit KMWK-means) method is able to achieve high accuracy in terms of cluster recovery in the new space by applying additional Minkowski exponent and feature weights. The proposed method is evaluated by four benchmark data sets, and its performance is compared with the commonly used kernel clustering approaches . Experiments show the proposed method consistently achieves superior clustering performances while reducing the memory consumption.},

In this paper, we focus on researching dynamic approaches to efficiently update three-way regions based on the simultaneous variations of the object set and the attribute set in an incomplete neighborhood decision system (INDS). First, considering the complexity of data, we utilize matrix approaches to calculate three-way regions of the INDS based on a proposed neighborhood tolerance relation . Then, under the simultaneous addition of the object set and the attribute set in the INDS, we research incremental mechanisms based on the matrix to obtain three-way regions from previous knowledge. Subsequently, an incremental algorithm for updating three-way regions is proposed when the object set and the attribute set are simultaneously added to the INDS. Finally, the results of a series of experiments and comparisons based on UCI data sets show that the performance of the proposed incremental algorithm is much better than that of the traditional static algorithm, the integrated single-dimensional incremental algorithm and the single-level combined incremental algorithm.},

In this paper, we present a revisited scheme for the new method called ”GCNs with Manifold Regularization” (GCNMR). While manifold regularization can add additional information, the GCN-based semi-supervised classification process cannot consider the full layer-wise structured information. Inspired by graph-based label propagation approaches, we will integrate high-order feature propagation into each GCN layer. High-order feature propagation over the graph can fully exploit the structured information provided by the latter at all the GCN’s layers. It fully exploits the clustering assumption, which is valid for structured data but not well exploited in GCNs. Our proposed scheme would lead to more informative GCNs. Using the revisited model, we will conduct several semi-supervised classification experiments on public image datasets containing objects, faces and digits: Extended Yale, PF01, Caltech101 and MNIST. We will also consider three citation networks. The proposed scheme performs well compared to several semi-supervised methods. With respect to the recent GCNMR approach, the average improvements were 2.2\%, 4.5\%, 1.0\% and 10.6\% on Extended Yale, PF01, Caltech101 and MNIST, respectively.},

Moreover, most of the existing results about RSJD are considered in real-valued cases, which is extended to complex-valued cases in this paper. Combining the Lyapunov method with the graph theory, some sufficient conditions can be obtained, which reflect that the realization of stability is related to stochastic disturbance strength, coupling strength and control rate. Additionally, the theoretical results are applied to complex-valued stochastic coupled oscillators with multiple time delays and RSJD. In the end, some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity and availability of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The problem of finding anomalies and outliers in datasets is one of the most important challenges of modern data analysis. Among the commonly dedicated tools to solve this task one can find Isolation Forest (IF) that is an efficient, conceptually simple, and fast method. In this study, we propose the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) that is an intuitively appealing and efficient enhancement of the original approach. The proposed generalization is based on nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment. Introduction of the generalization allows to achieve more effective splits that are rather performed between the clusters, i.e. regions where datapoints constitute dense formations and not through them. In a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that the proposed method allows us to detect anomalies hidden between clusters more effectively. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our approach favorably affects the quality of anomaly detection in both artificial and real datasets. In terms of time complexity our method is close to the original one since the generalization is related only to the building of the trees while the scoring procedure (which takes the main time) is kept unchanged.},

  abstract     = {Data classification is an important computer task in data analysis, which suffers seriously unknown features, imbalanced class, and incomplete data. However, despite their vital yet practical significance, few results have been made on such three distinct issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel feature selection method for the data subject to incomplete data and imbalanced class, namely, improved fuzzy information decomposition (IFID) incorporated and weighted Relief-F (WRelief-F) feature selection. The main idea of the proposed feature selection method is threefold. (1) The proposed IFID algorithm can deal with the imbalanced class and incomplete data at the same time. (2) In IFID, a new membership function is provided to reflect the influence of the observed data on the missing values appropriately. Based on this establishment, a more delicate information decomposition is adopted to make a better recovery than the traditional FID. (3) After using IFID, WRelief-F is put forward to take the relationship of the target instance to inter-class instances and the intra-class instances into consideration in a proper manner. Finally, experiments on the seven public data sets are utilized to show the effectiveness and universal applicability of the proposed feature selection algorithm .},

A two-branch attention-based context relation modeling structure is designed by considering global context-aware information based on foreground/background cues and global feature representations. A pixel-wise self-attention mechanism is then incorporated for both branches to propagate global context information to local feature representations. As a result, a coarse-to-fine salient object detection model is formulated. The whole framework can be trained in an end-to-end manner under a deeply supervised framework. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of key components proposed in our LGCNet .

The generated networks are statistically similar to themselves and to the original network. The higher-level organizational structures are modeled as a multi-layer network while the lowest level uses the Stochastic Block Model. Such synthetic networks provide alternative structures for data about the original network. Using them, analysts can find structures that are frequent, therefore stable under perturbations. Another application is to anonymize generated networks and use them for testing new software developed in open research facilities. The results indicate that modeling edge structure and the hierarchy together is essential for generating networks that are statistically similar but not identical to each other or the original network. In experiments, we generate many synthetic networks from two covert networks. Only a few structures of synthetics networks repeat, with the most stable ones shared by 18\% of all synthetic networks making them strong candidates for the ground truth structure.},

Such algorithms can then be implemented as is or can be parallelized, up to a certain point, to run on parallel computers. However, this is not as efficient as a dedicated parallel hardware implementation. There have been ad hoc implementations of particular P systems for parallel hardware, but they lack to be problem-generic or they are not scalable enough to implement large P systems. In this paper, a first intrinsically parallel hardware architecture to implement generic P system models is introduced.

Rough set models based on k k -nearest-neighbor relations have a strong ability to approximate decisions, but the calculation is very time-consuming. In this paper, we model the overlap degree of objects from different categories in advance to accelerate the attribute reduction and improve the classification performance of the selected attributes. Firstly, we define the coincidence degree ( CD CD ) and distance ( DIS DIS ) of objects from different categories to measure the coverage and distance of between-class objects. Secondly, we combine CD CD and DIS DIS to define the overlap degree ( OD OD ) to pre-sort attributes, then use k k -nearest-neighbor rough sets to filter inconsistent and redundant attributes. The pre-sort operation based on OD OD can greatly reduce the number of searches for attributes and ensure that the attributes with high separability should be selected first. Furthermore, we design a fast reduction algorithm ( OD &amp; KNN OD&amp;#x26;KNN ) to obtain a reduct with the ability to approximate decisions as well as the original attributes but with lower OD OD . Comparing experimental results and time complexity of OD &amp; KNN OD&amp;#x26;KNN with state-of-the-art algorithms, OD &amp; KNN OD&amp;#x26;KNN is more efficient for high-dimensional data while ensuring classification accuracy .},

  abstract     = {Quality of Service (QoS) is one of the key indicators to measure the overall performance of cloud services. The quantitative measurement of the QoS enables the service provider to manage its Service Level Agreement (SLA) in a viable way. It also supports a consumer in service selection and allows measuring the received services to comply with agreed services. There is much existing literature that tries to predict the QoS and assist stakeholders in their decision-making process. However, it is tricky to deal with multidimensional data in time series prediction methods. The computational complexity increases with an increase in data dimension, and it is a challenging task to give precise weights to each time interval . Existing prediction methods could not deal with the intricate reordering of input weights. To address this problem, we propose a novel C lustered I nduced Ordered Weighted Averaging (IOWA) A daptive N euro- F uzzy I nference S ystem (ANFIS), (CI-ANFIS) model. This fuzzy time series prediction model reduces data dimension and handles the nonlinear relationship of the cloud QoS dataset. The proposed method uses an intelligent sorting mechanism that regulates uncertainty in prediction while incorporating a fuzzy neural network structure for optimal prediction results. The proposed method employs the IOWA operator to sort input arguments based on associated order-inducing variables and assign customised weights accordingly. The inputs are further classified using three fuzzy clustering methods - fuzzy c-means (FCM), subtractive clustering and grid partitioning. The inputs further pass to the ANFIS structure that takes the benefits of both the fuzzy and neural networks. The fuzzy structure in ANFIS builds understandable rules for cloud stakeholders and deals with uncertain occurrences of data. The model uses a real cloud QoS dataset extracted from the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) US-West instance and predict its behaviour every five minutes for the next 24 h. The proposed method is further compared with the existing twelve methods. The comparative results show that the proposed CI-ANFIS model outperforms all current techniques. The proposed approach opens a new area of research in various complex prediction problems such as stock trading, big data, complex IoT sensors, and other social computing problems.},

  abstract     = {Distant supervised relation extraction is an efficient strategy of finding relational facts from unstructured text without labeled training data. A recent paradigm to develop relation extractors is using pre-trained Transformer language models to produce high-quality sentence representations. However, due to the original Transformer is weak at capturing local dependencies and phrasal structures, existing Transformer-based methods cannot identify various relational patterns in sentences. To address this issue, we propose a novel distant supervised relation extraction model, which employs a specific-designed pattern-aware self-attention network to automatically discover relational patterns for pre-trained Transformers in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the proposed method assumes that the correlation between two adjacent tokens reflects the probability that they belong to the same pattern. Based on this assumption, a novel self-attention network is designed to generate the probability distribution of all patterns in a sentence. Then, the probability distribution is applied as a constraint in the first Transformer layer to encourage its attention heads to follow the relational pattern structures. As a result, fine-grained pattern information is enhanced in the pre-trained Transformer without losing global dependencies. Extensive experimental results on two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Due to the development of microprocessor technology, there are more than 20 billion sensor-based devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor physical phenomena and events. To reduce the energy used by idle listening, a low-duty cycle is often used in an event-sparse wireless sensor network . However, low-duty cycles bring large end-to-end delays. In this paper, a listen interval adaptive adjustment (LIAA) scheme is proposed to adjust the listen interval (LI) of a node to reduce end-to-end delays while maintaining the long lifetime of a network. The key idea is to make full use of the energy consumption imbalance in a network, to allow nodes away from the sink to use the residual energy to add listen intervals. The LIAA scheme has 3 sub-strategies. One is the basic add listen interval (BALI) strategy, in which the parent node adds listen intervals in the fixed active slots of its child nodes. Another strategy is the consecutive listen (CL) scheme, which is based on BALI, and listen intervals are added consecutively. The third strategy is the random add listen interval (RALI) scheme, which uses the idea of randomness to add listen intervals. The extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the LIAA scheme proposed in this paper has better performance. Compared with the traditional scheme, the delays in the BALI scheme, CL scheme and RALI scheme were reduced by 24.03\%, 23.45\% and 39.41\%, respectively, while the lifetime of the network was maintained.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we focus on semi-supervised data stream classification tasks. With the advent of applications that generate vast streams of data, data stream mining algorithms are required to handle the intrinsic issues of learning patterns from this type of non-stationary data. The main challenges are fast arriving, infinite length, limited labeled data , concept drift, and concept evolution. Although many algorithms have been used to overcome these issues, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed and discussed in practical domains. This paper mainly focuses on the limited labeled data and concept drift detection issues. Therefore, a semi-supervised framework called CPSSDS is proposed, which uses an incremental classifier as a base learner and a self-training framework to handle the scarcity of labeled samples. The proposed approach utilizes a form of Conformal Predictors to discover a set of informative unlabeled data instances to add to the original training set in each training procedure which is the main challenge in the standard self-training approach. In terms of this framework, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is adopted to detect concept drift by comparing the outputs of conformal prediction for two sequences of data chunks. Finally, experimental results on several synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed learning framework is comparable to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms for data streams.

  abstract     = {We propose a new interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) programming method for risky multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems with IT2F truth degrees, where the criteria exhibit a heterogeneous relationship and decision-makers behave according to bounded rationality. First, we develop a technique to calculate the Banzhaf-based overall perceived utility values of alternatives based on 2-additive fuzzy measures and regret theory. Subsequently, considering pairwise comparisons of alternatives with IT2F truth degrees, we define the Banzhaf-based IT2F risky consistency index (BIT2FRCI) and the Banzhaf-based IT2F risky inconsistency index (BIT2FRII). Next, to identify the optimal weights, an IT2F programming model is established based on the concept that BIT2FRII must be minimized and must not exceed the BIT2FRCI using a fixed IT2F set. Furthermore, we design an effective algorithm using an external archive-based constrained state transition algorithm to solve the established model. Accordingly, the ranking order of alternatives is derived using the Banzhaf-based overall perceived utility values. Experimental studies pertaining to investment selection problems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, that is, its strong capability in addressing risky MCDM problems.},

  abstract     = {Food recommendation has attracted increasing attentions to various food-related applications and services. The food recommender models aim to match users’ preferences with recipes, where the key lies in the representation learning of users and recipes. However, ranging from early content-based filtering and collaborative filtering methods to recent hybrid methods , the existing work overlooks the various food-related relations, especially the ingredient-ingredient relations, leading to incomprehensive representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel model Food recommendation with Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN), which exploits ingredient-ingredient, ingredient-recipe, and recipe-user relations deeply. FGCN employs the information propagation mechanism and adopts multiple embedding propagation layers to model high-order connectivity across different food-related relations and enhance the representations. Specifically, we develop three types of information propagation: (1) ingredient-ingredient information propagation, (2) ingredient-recipe information propagation, and (3) recipe-user information propagation. To validate the effectiveness and rationality of FGCN, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset. The results show that the proposed FGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Further in-depth analyses reveal that FGCN could alleviate the sparsity issue in food recommendation.},

In order to deal with a network resource constraint, a novel two-event-generator scheme over both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels is proposed to reduce the transmission frequency of system states and control commands, while maintaining desired system performance. More specifically, one of the event-generators is a time-varying memory-based event-triggered scheme (METS), and the other is the traditional event-triggered scheme (ETS). On the other hand, in order to incorporate network security , a new model of memory-based NCSs is established under random deception attacks. Then, sufficient conditions for preserving the asymptotic stability of uncertain NCSs are proposed by using the Lyapunov functional method. Furthermore, co-design criteria are derived for determining both the memory-based state feedback controller gains and event-triggering parameter matrices. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by a quarter-car suspension system.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy concept has been an important methodology for data analysis, especially in the classification research . Particularly, fuzzy concept could directly process the continuous data through contrasting the numerical data into the membership degree of object to attribute. However, the classical fuzzy concept only focuses on the positive information, that is, the information about membership degree, while ignoring non-membership degree. Meanwhile, since the limitations of individual cognition and cognitive environment, the concept learning is progressive. Inspired by these thoughts, we design an incremental learning mechanism based on progressive fuzzy three-way concept for object classification in dynamic environment. In this paper, the object and attribute learning operators are first defined to obtain fuzzy three-way concept. Then, a progressive fuzzy three-way concept and its corresponding concept space are learned considering the progressive process of concept learning. Moreover, the object classify mechanism and dynamic update mechanism based on the progressive concept space are proposed, and their effectiveness is verified by numerical experiments. Finally, an incremental learning mechanism is further designed for dynamic increased data and compared with other fuzzy classify methods. All the experimental results carried on ten datasets from UCI and KEEL illustrate the proposed learning mechanism is an excellent object classify algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Vacating room after encryption (VRAE) is a popular framework of reversible data hiding for encrypted images (RDHEI). Most VRAE based RDHEI methods do not make a desirable payload. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel data hiding technique using adaptive difference recovery (ADR) and exploits this novel technique to design an efficient VRAE based RDHEI method. Specifically, the proposed ADR-based data hiding technique adaptively determines the range of original difference between a cover pixel and a reference pixel with correlation according to the marked difference generated by bit substitution technique. The cover pixel can be recovered losslessly with the range of original difference and the reference pixel. In the proposed RDHEI method, the encrypted image is generated by block permutation and block-based modulation so that spatial redundancy within encrypted image blocks is preserved. Then the ADR-based data hiding technique is applied to the encrypted blocks. Experiment results show that the proposed RDHEI method outperforms some state-of-the-art RDHEI methods in payload. The average embedding rates of the proposed RDHEI method on the BOSSbase, BOWS-2 and UCID datasets are 3.2045, 3.1145 and 2.4633 bpp, respectively.},

Firstly, we define a novel conflict distance and conflict function with Pythagorean fuzzy information from the perspective of absolute and relative conflict. We examine respectively a trisection of the conflict relation between a pair of agents, that among agents, that among disputes, and that among alliances. We also introduce the concepts of maximal strong alliances and maximal weak alliances. All of these efforts are then used to explain the reason for the emergence of conflicts. Secondly, to find an optimal feasible strategy for a given conflict situation, we propose a Pythagorean fuzzy decision-theoretic rough set model based on conflict functions and define the score function for each feasible strategy.

Existing studies mainly focus on fusion models and algorithms of data sets in the same domain, but few studies consider imbalanced data sets from different domains. Furthermore, studies on imbalanced data sets mostly focus on classification and less on clustering problems . Therefore, we propose a novel clustering algorithm for mining fused location data. This algorithm can deal with imbalanced data sets with large density differences, find clusters generated by the minority class data, and reduce the time complexity of the clustering process . Since current evaluation indices are not suitable for evaluating clustering results of imbalanced data sets, we present a new comprehensive evaluation metric used in the clustering validity judgment. Urban hotspots mining is used as an example, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using GPS trajectory data from the transport domain and check-in data from the social network. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms that of the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, and it can simultaneously discover urban hotspots formed by the majority and minority class data.},

Then, a 3WD model is explored in decision information systems to address the related issues in the proposed fuzzy probabilistic rough set model. In light of the above works, we establish a novel approach to classify and rank applicants for enterprise talent recruitment problems. Instead of the rule of tie-breaking, a way is given to separate applicants into three parts by combining decision attributes , and the feasibility of the approach is confirmed as well.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous defect prediction (HDP) aims to transfer informative knowledge, namely the defect-proneness tendency of software metrics, from a source project to predict potential defects in a target project by matching metrics with similar distributions between different software projects. Nevertheless, the complex internal intrinsic structure hidden behind the defect data makes it difficult for the prior heterogeneous defect models to capture and migrate the most informative software metrics, and severely hinders HDP performance. To address these issues, we propose a robust data-driven HDP model called IVKMP in this study. We firstly adopt an advanced deep generation network – InfoGAN (Information maximizing GANs) for data augmentation , namely simultaneously achieving class balance and generating sufficient defect instances. Secondly, the multi-objective VaEA (Vector angle-based Evolutionary Algorithm) optimization is employed to select the fewest representative metric subsets while achieving the minimum error. Finally, a deep defect predictor for HDP based on the lightweight but effective deep network – PCANet (Principal Component Analysis Network) with the binary hashing and block-wise histogram is built to essentially capture more semantically related robust representations. We compare the IVKMP model with multiple state-of-the-art baseline models across 542 heterogeneous project pairs of 26 software projects. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our IVKMP model.},

The integration suggests the use of interval type-2 fuzzy MFs and wavelet functions with self-recurrent and ENN&#39;s cross-coupled feedback loops to handle system uncertainties while accurately representing the intrinsic cross-coupled interferences of real dynamic nonlinear systems .

  abstract     = {The idea of computable aggregation operators was introduced as a generalization of aggregation operators, allowing the replacement of the mathematical function usually considered for aggregation, by a program that performs the aggregation process. There are different reasons to justify this extension. One of them is the interest in exploring some computational properties not directly related to the aggregation itself but to its implementation (complexity, recursivity, parallelisation , etc). Another reason, the one driving to the present paper, is the need to define a framework where the quite common process of first sampling (over a large data set) and then aggregating the sample, could be analysed as a formal aggregation process. This process does not match with the idea of an aggregation function, due to its non-deterministic nature, but could easily be adapted to that of a (non-deterministic) computable aggregation. The idea of non-deterministic aggregation requires the extension of the concept of monotonicity (a key aspect of aggregation operators) to this new framework. The present paper will explore this kind of non-deterministic aggregation processes, first from an empirical point of view and then in terms of populations, adapting the idea of monotonicity to both of them and finally defining a common framework for its analysis.},

  abstract     = {Following two decades of sustained studies, metaheuristic algorithms have made considerable achievements in the field of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, under most existing metaheuristic frameworks, an improved scheme introduced to address specific defects usually leads to additional problems that need to be solved further. Emerging optimization mechanisms should be considered to break the bottleneck, and an adaptive multi-objective competitive swarm optimization (AMOCSO) algorithm, a promising option for solving MOPs, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the competitive mechanism is modified so that it can perform well on MOPs, and an improved learning scheme is designed for the winners and the losers, which can greatly enhance the optimization efficiency and balance the convergence and the diversity of the proposed algorithm. Then, an external archive and its maintenance schemes are introduced to prevent the population from degenerating and make the algorithm framework more comprehensive. Moreover, a practical adaptive strategy is proposed to fill the blank of parameter research, and no human factors exist in AMOCSO, which means that an amazing promotion can be achieved in generalization. Finally, abundant experimental studies are carried out, and the results of comparative experiments show that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Clustering of cell types from a large number of high-dimensional heterogeneous cells is a vital step in analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data. Although several computational methods have been proposed to evolve such data, most of them suffer from some limitations such as high-level noise, high dimensionality , and low generalization. To address these challenges, a multiobjective robust continuous clustering algorithm (MORCC) is presented to discriminate the different cell types in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset. Stepwise, first a dimensionality reduction method is applied to map the high-dimensional heterogeneous cells into a desired low-dimensional space while preserving the features of the original space. Then, to overcome the instability of trial-and-error connectivity weights in the robust continuous clustering, MORCC proposes applying evolutionary operators to optimize the connectivity weights dynamically, and to select the suitable parameters with two cluster validity indices. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MORCC, we compare it to several state-of-the-art methods on six single-cell RNA-seq datasets, revealing its superior clustering ability from several perspectives. In addition, we carry out a parameter analysis , a case study, and visualization and biological interpretability analyses to validate MORCC’s cell identification capability on single-cell RNA-seq data.},

  abstract     = {The use of decision trees considerably improves the discriminating capacity of ensemble classifiers. However, this process results in the classifiers no longer being interpretable, although comprehensibility is a desired trait of decision trees. Consolidation (consolidated tree construction algorithm, CTC) was introduced to improve the discriminating capacity of decision trees, whereby a set of samples is used to build the consolidated tree without sacrificing transparency. In this work, PCTBagging is presented as a hybrid approach between bagging and a consolidated tree such that part of the comprehensibility of the consolidated tree is maintained while also improving the discriminating capacity. The consolidated tree is first developed up to a certain point and then typical bagging is performed for each sample. The part of the consolidated tree to be initially developed is configured by setting a consolidation percentage. In this work, 11 different consolidation percentages are considered for PCTBagging to effectively analyse the trade-off between comprehensibility and discriminating capacity. The results of PCTBagging are compared to those of bagging, CTC and C4.5, which serves as the base for all other algorithms. PCTBagging, with a low consolidation percentage, achieves a discriminating capacity similar to that of bagging while maintaining part of the interpretable structure of the consolidated tree. PCTBagging with a consolidation percentage of 100\% offers the same comprehensibility as CTC, but achieves a significantly greater discriminating capacity.},

This paper proposes a tracking control method for the DEA based on the inverse dynamic compensation method. Firstly, a dynamical model of the DEA is established to depict its asymmetric hysteresis , rate dependent hysteresis and creep nonlinear behaviors simultaneously. Next, according to the inverse of the dynamical model , an inverse dynamic feedforward compensator (IDFC) is devised to compensate the hysteresis nonlinearity and creep nonlinearity of the DEA. Then, a PI feedback controller is designed to collaborate with the IDFC, which can enhance the robust performance of the whole control system. Finally, the tracking control experiments with different target trajectories are carried out. The root-mean-square errors of all control results are less than 1\% 1\% and the maximum value of the relative tracking errors is less than 8\% 8\% , which illustrates that the proposed tracking control method is effective and excellent.},

In this study, a simple and generic scheme named granular cabin is proposed for drastically speeding up the algorithmic implementation of NL. Specifically, this scheme is deployed to Neighborhood Rough Set (NRS) which is a typical NL methodology. And three major applications of NRS are concerned including approximation computation, neighborhood classification and feature selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NRS methodology enhanced by granular cabin consumes much less time. This study offers a promising solution that ensures the great potential of NL in big data.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing makes it much faster and cheaper to obtain labels for a large amount of data used in supervised learning. In the crowdsourcing scenario, an integrated label is inferred from a multiple noisy label set for each instance using ground truth inference algorithms, which is called label integration. However, a certain level of label noise remains in the integrated dataset, which degrades the performance of the models trained on it. To the best of our knowledge, existing label noise correction algorithms only use the original attribute space and do not use the information contained in the multiple noisy label sets for building models. To solve these problems, we propose a novel integrated label noise correction algorithm called co-training-based noise correction (CTNC). In CTNC, the weight is first calculated from the information provided by the multiple noisy label set for each instance. Subsequently, a label noise filter is used to identify noisy instances; a clean set and a noisy set are thus obtained. Another attribute view of each instance in both the clean and noisy sets is then generated by the classifiers trained on the original attribute view of the clean set. Finally, a co-training framework is used to train two classifiers to relabel the integrated instances. The performance on 34 simulated datasets and 2 real-world datasets demonstrates that our proposed CTNC outperforms all state-of-the-art label noise correction algorithms used for comparison.},

Vaguely labeled data is one of the common problems caused by limited domain knowledge or partial data observation. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to classify vaguely labeled data based on evidential fusion. Vaguely labeled data are divided into several small data groups by the proposed valid label-set cover assignment algorithm. Evidence theory is applied to vaguely labeled data classification by regarding each base classifier on a small data group as one piece of evidence. This gives the chance of classifying unseen precise labeled data from related vague labels. Note that our approach is not restricted to any specific classifiers. It can be generalized to any off-the-shelf classification methods with probabilistic outputs. Finally, experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and real-world data with different base classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance against compared methods.},

A crowd consists of groups of different number of people with different attributes such as gender, age, position, velocity, and energy. Each group has its own intention used to generate a trajectory for each pedestrian navigating in the virtual environment. Additionally, an agent - based agent-based model is introduced to simulate pedestrian behaviours in the groups, where various steering behaviours are introduced and combined into a single steering force to allow pedestrians in each group to walk toward their destination point. Based on the proposed method, every single pedestrian in each group can continuously adjust their attributes. Moreover, pedestrians optimize their path independently toward the desired goals, while avoiding obstacles and other pedestrians in the scene. This method takes into account the safety-space around each pedestrian to avoid collisions among pedestrians. The proposed method was implemented for several simulation scenarios under various conditions for a wide range of different parameters. Statistical analysis is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for simulating the crowd movement in the virtual environment. Results indicate that our method can generate each pedestrian’s trajectories in each group independently to reach several goal points within a reasonable computational time. Moreover, the obtained results reveal that the mean value of the computational time is not increased significantly with the increasing of the number of pedestrians in the crowd.},

A subpopulation is then dynamically sampled from the resulting niches such that supporting a diverse search at the early stage of evolution while an intensive search towards the end of evolution. The above strategy will be further coupled with a neighborhood crossover, which is devised to encourage high potential solutions for exploitation while low potential solutions for exploration, thus appropriately searching the solution space. Additionally, an adaptive local search (ALS) scheme along with an adaptive elimination operation (AEO) have been designed. The ALS aims to appropriately fine-tune promising solutions in the sampled subpopulation while the AEO tends to adaptively eliminate unpromising individuals in the population during evolution. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on CEC’2015 benchmark functions and compared with related methods. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve a superior performance and outperform related methods.

The quality of a particular set of weights and biases is measured at each iteration of the GSA-based initialization using a fitness function aiming to achieve the predefined optimal control or learning objective. The data generated during the RL process is used in training a NN-based controller that will be able to autonomously achieve the optimal reference tracking control objective. The proposed approach is compared with other similar techniques which use different algorithms in the initialization step, namely the traditional random algorithm, the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The NN-based controllers based on each of these techniques are compared using performance indices specific to optimal control as settling time, rise time, peak time, overshoot, and minimum cost function value. Real-time experiments are conducted in order to validate and test the proposed new approach in the framework of the optimal reference tracking control of a nonlinear position servo system .

The current research on task scheduling considers mainly the design of scheduling strategies and algorithms and rarely gives attention to the influences of uncertain factors, such as the network bandwidth and millions of instructions per second (MIPS), on the scheduling process. The network bandwidth and MIPS directly affect the performance of a virtual machine (VM), which further influences the scheduling performance. In this paper, uncertain factors are transformed into interval parameters. The make-span, scheduling cost, load balance, and task completion rate are simultaneously considered in the scheduling process. Then, an interval many-objective cloud task scheduling optimization (I-MCTSO) model is designed to simulate real cloud computing task scheduling. To implement this model, an interval many-objective evolutionary algorithm (InMaOEA) is proposed. An interval credibility strategy is employed to improve the convergence performance. The hyper-volume and degree of overlap based on the interval congestion distance strategy are used to increase the population diversity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of InMaOEA in comparision with other algorithms.

The criteria of selecting feasible strategies is illustrated by an NBA labor negotiation. Finally, the performance of proposed models is compared with other advanced models.},

  abstract     = {Morphological perceptrons (MPs) can be characterized as feedforward morphological neural networks (MNNs) with applications in classification and regression. The neuronal aggregation functions of current MP versions are drawn from gray-scale mathematical morphology (MM) that can be described in terms of matrix products in a lattice algebra called minimax algebra. Specifically, MPs have components each of which computes a pair-wise infimum of an erosion and an anti-dilation that can be expressed in terms of products of matrices with entries in a complete l-group extension. In this paper, we use the novel concept of an interval descriptor and an n -ary aggregation function on a bounded poset in order to generalize existing gray-scale and fuzzy morphological components (MCs) of morphological and hybrid morphological/linear perceptrons (HMLPs). In addition, we present several other examples of generalized morphological components (GMCs) that can and will be incorporated as computational units into shallow and deep artificial neural networks .},

  abstract     = {Knowledge distillation is a highly effective method for transferring knowledge from a cumbersome teacher network to a lightweight student network. However, teacher networks are not always available. An alternative method called online knowledge distillation, which applies a group of peer networks to learn collaboratively with each other, has been proposed previously. In this study, we revisit online knowledge distillation and find that the existing training strategy limits the diversity among peer networks. Thus, online knowledge distillation cannot achieve its full potential. To address this, a novel online knowledge distillation with elastic peer (KDEP) strategy is introduced here. The entire training process is divided into two phases by KDEP. In each phase, a specific training strategy is applied to adjust the diversity to an appropriate degree. Extensive experiments have been conducted on individual benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, Tiny ImageNet, and Caltech-UCSD Birds. The results demonstrate the superiority of KDEP. For example, when the peer networks are ShuffleNetV2-1.0 and ShuffleNetV2-0.5, the target peer network ShuffleNetV2-0.5 achieves 57.00\% 57.00\% top-1 accuracy on Tiny ImageNet via KDEP.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid development of science and technology, the importance of imprecise, noisy, and uncertain data is increasing at an exponential rate . Thus, mining patterns in uncertain databases have drawn the attention of researchers. Moreover, frequent sequences of items from these databases need to be discovered for meaningful knowledge with great impact. In many real cases, weights of items and patterns are introduced to find interesting sequences as a measure of importance. Hence, a constraint of weight needs to be handled while mining sequential patterns . Besides, due to the dynamic nature of databases, mining important information has become more challenging. Instead of mining patterns from scratch after each increment, incremental mining algorithms utilize previously mined information to update the result immediately. Several algorithms exist to mine frequent patterns and weighted sequences from incremental databases. However, these algorithms are confined to mine the precise ones. Therefore, in this work, we develop an algorithm to mine frequent sequences in an uncertain database in this work. Furthermore, we propose two new techniques for mining when the database is incremental. Extensive experiments have been conducted for performance evaluation. The analysis showed the efficiency of our proposed framework.},

The classical models often focus on the imitation of biological phenomena with the given position and velocity, but ignore the modeling of individual perception during the emergence of collective behaviors. Based on the mechanism of visual perception, we present a model named visual perception-decision-propulsion (VPDP) and clearly define several evaluation indicators to explore the emergence of collective obstacle avoidance in flocks. Within this model, there is no centralized control and no information exchange among individuals. Instead, individuals interacting with others merely rely on the perceptual information represented by whether the visual field is occupied by neighbors. We demonstrate that our model effectively achieves collective obstacle avoidance, preserving a safe distance between individuals and obstacles while maintaining relatively good coherence. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of the parameters indicates the robustness of our VPDP model. Hence, this paper provides a novel model for collective obstacle avoidance based on visual perception as well as a detailed analysis.},

However, the consensus thresholds are usually given directly and lack of objectivity in existing related research. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of the lowest consensus threshold as a reference to determine the consensus threshold. Then, a new two-stage CRP method is developed for MCGDM with linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy variables (LIFVs) considering DMs’ willingness of modifying preference information. In the first stage, LIFVs evaluation values with high linguistic indeterminacy degrees are modified. In the second stage, evaluation elements with high deviation elements are then modified. Simulation experiments I are designed to analyze the lowest consensus threshold whose results reveal that the more the number of DMs , the lower the value of this threshold. Simulation experiments II demonstrate that the first stage in CRP can improve the value of the lowest consensus threshold. To show the applicability of the proposed CRP method, a real-life decision example is presented. Finally, Simulation experiments III verify that the proposed method can decrease the adjustment cost and the number of adjustment elements. Simulation experiments IV further demonstrate the first stage in CRP plays an important role.},

Over the past years, researchers have spent more time optimizing hardware components to reduce their energy consumption. However, it has not been so clear which sorting algorithm is more energy efficient. In this study, we conduct a meta-analytical comparison of the energy consumed by the two most common sorting algorithms namely quick sort and merge sort . Our study mainly focused on energy consumption for mobile devices and embedded systems . For our meta-analysis and literature review, we took into consideration studies published not more than 20 years ago.

Evolutionary game theory is introduced to control the population state. In evolutionary game theory, through the interaction between players, better strategies will eventually dominate among the players. By extending this idea to PSO, a selection mechanism and a mutation mechanism are proposed. By using the selection mechanism, the adoption probability of the high payoff strategies will increase. The mutation mechanism can examine the stability of the incumbent strategy to evolutionary pressures. The performance of SDPSO is compared with 14 algorithms on the CEC 2014 test suite. The results show that SDPSO has the highest rank. SDPSO is applied to solve a real-world problem. SDPSO can find the best mean results comparing with 4 algorithms. The findings show that the proposed evolutionary game theory-based framework can adaptively control the population state. This study proposes a new application of evolutionary game theory to the design of swarm intelligence and contributes to a better understanding of the usefulness of the evolutionary game theory in the optimization method.

Finally, we use the GAE-V method to correct the bias caused by off-policy learning. We also achieve better performance by adopting a mechanism that combines off-policy learning and on-policy learning to update the network.

  abstract     = {Path planning on grid graphs has been studied for decades in several applications such as robotics and computer games. However, the process for determining short paths can still be inefficient on large grid graphs. The SPS (Surrounding Point Set) method has made it efficient by considering only a few unblocked cells. Since eight-neighbor grid graphs do not provide sufficient connectivity for SPS, it found a path on a graph where two cells are connected with an edge within a given density bound. However, verifying whether the resulting edges are blocked is time-consuming; further, it is unclear which density bound to use and restrictive to allow only edges within the bound. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-SPS with Theta* that uses eight-neighbor grid graphs, allows distant connectivity by Theta*, and improves the SPS by considering more obstacles between the start and goal cells. Our experimental results demonstrate that compared with the existing path planning algorithms, multi-SPS with Theta* and variants of Theta* can run faster and obtain similar path lengths. The results also demonstrate the beneficial effect for Theta* in that the expensive runtime of Theta* can be reduced by the SPS approach.},

For this purpose, a total of 51 papers were analyzed over the literature totaling 94 distinct methods, collected from well-established scientific databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and Scopus), whose works were categorized according to its main construction concept. From the analyzed works, it was possible to categorize them into two main trends: classical and those approaches specifically designed by the use of neural networks . The obtained statistical analysis demonstrated a marginally better recognition precision for the classical approaches when faced to neural networks counterpart, but with a reduced capacity of generalization. Additionally, the present study verified the most popular datasets for facial expression and emotion recognition showing the pros and cons each and, thereby, demonstrating a real demand for reliable data-sources regarding artificial and natural experimental environments.},

  abstract     = {Cancer survivability prediction has been of great interest to health professionals and researchers. The task refers to the procedure of estimating the potential survivability according to an individual’s medical history. The difficulty is that raw data is usually subject to some noise, such as missing values. To address this issue, we propose a novel low-rank and sparse representation-based learning algorithm, which consists of two main stages of data self expressiveness and classification. Firstly, in the data self expressiveness stage, raw inputs have been decomposed into one dictionary (which is enforced with a low-rank constraint) and one coefficient matrix (which is sparsely coded), respectively. Secondly, this sparse coefficient matrix is paired with sample labels for training during the classification stage. We further integrate these two stages and formulate them into an optimization problem, which is then solved using an iterative computational strategy. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm. The relationship between the proposed algorithm and existing approaches are also discussed. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified using several benchmarking classification problems and a public longitudinal dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of affordable computational complexity and high prediction accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

The probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR) is an effective tool to describe the preference of each stakeholder. The probability distribution of linguistic preference can be available from statistics analysis on the questionnaires. In GDM process, the essential step is to execute the consensus reaching process (CRP) that is a dynamic iterative process by utilizing the feedback mechanism to update the preference of identified stakeholders. However, the existing feedback mechanisms with the fixed boundary parameter neglect the individual psychological behavior, leading to false CRP. For which, the personalized feedback mechanism based on self-confidence and leadership is developed to generate recommendation advice for the identified stakeholders, which is the three-step procedure: (1) construct trust relationship network and obtain trust degree among stakeholders; (2) assess individual self-confidence level from professional ability and sociability that are captured by entropy and trust degree, respectively, and (3) identify the opinion leader as reference preference. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and consistency of identified stakeholders after adopting the feedback recommendation. Then, an example of hydropower development project assessments is illustrated to show the feasibility of the proposed method.

However, in most CP-ABE schemes, attackers may obtain user privacy information from policy plaintext. More likely, partial policy hiding programme neither satisfies full policy hiding nor applies to the needs of the large universe. In this paper,we hide both attribute values and names in policy by using private set intersection (PSI). The CP-ABE programme not only supports a complete hiding policy, but also can calculate the authorization relationship and mapping relationship between user passwords and keys. We use a polynomial-based PSI and a recursive algorithm to calculate the authorization relationship. And with the help of the algorithm and the label vector, the mapping is determined under communication restrictions. Through the outsourcing index, we achieve an efficient hiding strategy and effectively reduce the user&#39;s computing overhead. Finally, theoretical analysis and experiments show that our model has better performance while effectively protecting sensitive attributes.},

  abstract     = {An electrocardiogram (ECG) consists of complex P-QRS-T waves. Detecting long-term ECG recordings is time-consuming and error-prone for cardiologists . Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn deep representations and empower automatic arrhythmia detection. However, when applying DNNs in practice, they usually suffer from domain shift that exits between the training data and testing data. Such shift can be caused by the high variability contained in ECG signals between patients and internal-variability of heartbeats for same patients, leading to degrading performance and impeding generalization of DNNs. To tackle this problem, we propose an unsupervised semantic-aware adaptive feature fusion network (USAFFN) to reduce such shift by alleviating the semantic distribution discrepancy between the feature spaces of two domains. Furthermore, an ECG contains rich information from different angles (beat, rhythm, and frequency levels), which is essential for arrhythmia detection. Therefore, a multi-perspective adaptive feature fusion (MPAFF) module is introduced to extract informative ECG representations. The experimental results show that the detection performance of our approach is highly competitive with the upper bound of alternative methods on the ARDB, and the generalization is confirmed on the INCART and LTDB.},

  abstract     = {Modelling other agents is one of the fundamental research challenges in multiagent decision making under uncertainty. A subject agent expects to optimise its own decisions by correctly modelling what other agents are going to act when they share a common environment and their actions have a joint impact in the transition of environmental states and their individual rewards. However, a true model of the other agent is often unknown due to limited prior knowledge, which particularly occurs to a competitive agent setting. Consequently, the subject agent needs to consider a large number of potential models (the number is infinite in theory) for the other agent, which turns to be computationally hard in its decision making process. A feasible solution is to select a subset of potential models that are representative of all the models for the other agent. In this article, we investigate such a model selection given some known behavioral stereotypes ascribed to the other agents. We propose a new measurement to diversify the selected models under the constraint of the number of models ( K models). We formulate the top- K model selection as a sub-modular function optimisation problem and develop a greedy algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions. We develop the proposed model selection techniques in a well-recognised multiagent decision model, namely interactive dynamic influence diagrams, that represents individual agents’ decision making process with the consideration of other agents. By doing this, we can test the performance of the new model selection techniques over two problem domains and provide experimental results in support. Hence, our research in this article contributes to a new model selection technique for modelling other agents therefore improving decision quality of a subject agent interacting with the other agents. It also inspires a creative usage of sub-modular function optimisation in multiagent decision making.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer across several streaming processes remain challenging problem not only because of different distributions of each stream but also because of rapidly changing and never-ending environments of data streams. Albeit growing research achievements in this area, most of existing works are developed for a single source domain which limits its resilience to exploit multi-source domains being beneficial to recover from concept drifts quickly and to avoid the negative transfer problem. An online domain adaptation technique under multi-source streaming processes, namely automatic online multi-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online domain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative and discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central moment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the existence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary information sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different time periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node re-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable of outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation study depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is general for any number of source streams. The source code of AOMSDA is shared publicly in https://github.com/Renchunzi-Xie/AOMSDA.git .},

The interval parametric integral equation system (interval PIES) was developed for solving boundary problems with input data defined in this way. The motivation for conducting this research was that this topic (simultaneous consideration of uncertainties of all input data) has appeared sporadically in the literature (mainly with uncertainly defined boundary conditions or other parameters). In this paper, the uncertainty was defined using interval numbers and modeled using interval arithmetic. The direct application of both classical and directed interval arithmetic caused the overestimation and obtained solutions were useless in practice. Therefore, modification of the directed interval arithmetic was developed. The reliability of the interval PIES solutions obtained using such arithmetic was verified on 2D problems described by Laplace’s equation. The solutions were compared with the interval analytical solutions (differently obtained), as well as with the solutions of exactly defined (without the uncertainty) numerical methods. All performed tests indicated the high potential of the method. Obtained interval solutions occurred to be less overestimated and not as time-consuming as presented alternative methods.},

In addition, these methods have no clear explanation for how to improve the non-optimal alternatives. Considering this, this paper constructs the returns and risks of alternatives in an identical measurement system by extending DEA model, thereby selecting the optimal alternative more comprehensively and improving the non-optimal alternatives. First, considering the bounded rationality of experts, the prospect theory is introduced into the information evaluation using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets to fully characterize the experts&#39; psychological behavior under uncertainty. Then, by constructing the return-risk ratio as the efficiency evaluation index, two prospect theory-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic superefficiency models, namely the risk-oriented (RIHFLS) and return-oriented (REHFLS) models, are proposed to fully rank the alternatives. Furthermore, these two models are extended to RIHFLPS and REHFLPS models considering different importance of attributes. By adjusting the returns and risks to the target values, the non-optimal alternatives can be enhanced to efficient state.

  abstract     = {Elastic net support vector machine (ENSVM) is an effective and popular classification technique. It has been widely used in many practical applications. However, solving large-scale problems still remains challenging. Inspired by its sparsity, a safe double screening rule (DSR) is proposed for accelerating ENSVM . Its main idea is to reduce the scale of the model by discarding the inactive features and samples simultaneously. In this way, the computational speed can be accelerated. Another superiority of DSR is safety, i.e., the discarded features and samples must be inactive. Its key strategy is to estimate the region containing optimal solution based on the feasible solution and duality gap. Thus, the DSR can be embedded into the process of solving the model until the algorithm converges. In addition, the safe keeping rule is constructed to identify the active features and samples. So, the DSR only needs to work on the remaining set after safe keeping. In this way, the screening process of DSR can be accelerated. Moreover, the Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) method is employed as an efficient solver. Numerical experiments on an artificial dataset and eighteen benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our proposed method.},

Although feature selection methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) are effective for solving high-dimensional imbalanced data problems, they can be computationally expensive. Hence, an effortless approach for identifying meaningful features that are indicative of anomalous behaviour between humans and malicious bots is presented herein. The most recent Twitter dataset that encompasses the behaviour of various types of malicious bots (including fake followers, retweet spam , fake advertisements, and traditional spambots) is used to understand the behavioural traits of such bots. The approach is based on Benford’s law for predicting the frequency distribution of significant leading digits. This study demonstrates that features closely obey Benford’s law on a human dataset, whereas the same features violate Benford’s law on a malicious bot dataset. Finally, it is demonstrated that the features identified by Benford’s law are consistent with those identified via PCA and the ensemble random forest method on the same datasets.

  abstract     = {In the Internet age, analyzing the behavior of online users can help webstore owners understand customers’ interests. Insights from such analysis can be used to improve both user experience and website design. A prominent task for online behavior analysis is clickstream mining, which consists of identifying customer browsing patterns that reveal how users interact with websites. Recently, this task was extended to consider weights to find more impactful patterns. However, most algorithms for mining weighted clickstream patterns are serial algorithms, which are sequentially executed from the start to the end on one running thread. In real life, data is often very large, and serial algorithms can have long runtimes as they do not fully take advantage of the parallelism capabilities of modern multi-core CPUs. To address this limitation, this paper presents two parallel algorithms named DPCompact-SPADE ( D epth load balancing P arallel Compact-SPADE) and APCompact-SPADE ( A daptive P arallel Compact-SPADE) for weighted clickstream pattern mining. Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed parallel algorithm is efficient, and outperforms state-of-the-art serial algorithms in terms of runtime, memory consumption, and scalability.},

Given its simplicity and visibility, the QFD has been broadly utilized in a variety of industries for product or service planning. However, traditional QFD method assumes that the behavior of domain experts is completely rational, and is only suitable for product development problems with a small number of experts. In this paper, we aim to develop a new large group QFD approach based on an extended TODIM (Portuguese acronym for interactive multi-criteria decision making) method under interval type-2 fuzzy context. The interval type-2 fuzzy sets are utilized to describe the imprecise and uncertain correlation assessment information between customer requirements and engineering characteristics. The normal TODIM is modified and used to derive the priority of engineering characteristics considering the psychological factors of experts. Also, an entropy weighting method was adopted to derive the weights of customer requirements objectively. Finally, we provide an electric vehicle product development case and perform a comparison analysis with previous methods to reveal the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed large group QFD approach.},

In practice, it is difficult to obtain all the modalities of each subject due to high cost or equipment limitation. Therefore, it is highly essential to fuse incomplete multi-modality data to improve the diagnostic accuracy . The traditional methods need to perform data cleansing and discard incomplete subjects from the data, which leads to inefficient training and poor robustness. For addressing this problem, this paper proposes an incomplete multi-modality data fusion method based on low-rank representation for the diagnosis of epilepsy and its subtypes. Specifically, we designed an objective function that simultaneously learns the low-rank representation of the complete modality part, and recovers the incomplete modality by the correlation between different modalities. The proposed model can be optimized by using alternating direction method of multipliers . Extensive evaluation of the proposed method on epilepsy classification task with incomplete DTI and fMRI data showed that our method can achieve promising classification results in identifying epilepsy and its subtypes.},

  abstract     = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a significant part in several biological processes in the living cell, such as gene regulation and mRNA localization . The research indicates that the mutation of RBPs will lead to some serious diseases. Several deep learning methods, especially the model based on convolutional neural network (CNN), have been used to predict the binding sites. However, these methods only use single-scale filters to extract a fixed length of motifs features, which restricts the performance of prediction. For the sequence data, different sizes of filters may learn different biological information of the RNA sequence. Therefore, a deep multi-scale attention network (DeepMSA) based on convolutional neural network is proposed to predict the sequence-binding preferences of RBPs. DeepMSA extracts features by multi-scale CNNs and integrates these features with an attention model to predict the RBPs and binding motifs. Experiments demonstrate DeepMSA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the invivo and invitro datasets. The results indicate that attention can make the model learn the consistent pattern of candidate motifs, which can provide some important guiding advice for RBP motifs.},

Secondly, the multiple time-varying additive uncertainties are introduced in the controller design and the state variables depending on additive uncertainties. Thirdly, the delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with double integral terms is designed to derive the less conservative stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The characteristic of the state variables are reflected effectively by employing the controller with multiple time-varying additive uncertainties. The closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with prescribed H-infinity performance index γ γ by employing the matrices transformation information.

To this end, a monotonic relation-constrained Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system classifier is proposed in this paper. The proposed method introduces a monotonic relation between the inputs and the outputs, where the objective function is expressed in a monotonically constrained form and a strategy for generating monotonicity constraint pairs is developed. Furthermore, to address the convexity loss caused by the increasing monotonicity constraints, the proposed method introduces the Tikhonov regularization strategy to ensure the uniqueness and boundedness of the solution. The results from extensive experiments show that the proposed method exhibits better classification performance than the original Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system and state-of-the-art monotonic classification methods in handling monotonic datasets.},

However, EMT algorithms often face negative transfer problems. In this paper, a novel multi-objective evolution strategy, called CT-EMT-MOES, is proposed based on a cultural transmission theory for solving multi-objective multitask optimization problems . First, two evolutionary operators inspired by cultural transmission theory are proposed. The elite-guided variation strategy can transfer the information from the current Pareto front to all individuals and guide the population to quickly converge. The horizontal cultural transmission strategy can efficiently transfer information from the source task to the target task. Second, to solve the negative transfer problem, an adaptive information transfer strategy is proposed to adaptively adjust the probability of an information transfer. Third, the proposed algorithm can gain a Pareto front with good convergence and diversity by utilizing a smaller population size and fewer computing resources. As a result, the proposed algorithm can effectively utilize the implicit similarity and complementarity between simultaneous optimized tasks to improve the overall convergence efficiency and reduce a negative transfer. Finally, comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better performance compared with previous state-of-the-art multi-objective EMT algorithms.},

To fill this gap, we introduce Shape-Sphere , a vector space where time series are presented as points on the surface of a sphere. We prove a pseudo-metric property for distances in Shape-Sphere. We show how to describe the average shape of a time series set using the pseudo-metric property of Shape-Sphere by deriving a centroid from the set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the pseudo-metric property and its centroid in capturing the ‘ shape ’ of a time series set, using two important machine learning techniques , namely: Nearest Centroid Classifier and K-Means clustering, using 85 publicly available data sets. Shape-Sphere improves the nearest centroid classification results when the shape is the differentiating feature while keeping the quality of clustering equivalent to current state-of-the-art techniques.},

Firstly, under the framework of traditional fuzzy stabilization, the recent multiple-sums-based method reported in the literature is improved by removing all the redundant variables, and thus the same feasible stabilization range can be obtained at the cost of more economical computational burden. Secondly, in order to further enhance the control efficiency, a dynamic trade-off between conservatism and complexity is established by proposing a new online evaluator of the updated system variation information across two adjacent sampling instants, and thus the so-called resilient stabilization is developed for reducing the conservatism without increasing or even alleviating the complexity. Moreover, all the determined matrices at the farthest sampling instant can be entirely removed without introducing any conservatism due to the proposed substitution technique. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed methods are illustrated by a set of simulation comparisons with relevant research results reported in recent literature.},

  abstract     = {Many embedding approaches of drugs have been proposed for the downstream task of drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction in a DDI-derived network where drugs are considered nodes, and interactions are represented as edges. One of the most popular approaches is learning the representation of a drug from the DDI network by aggregating the features or information of its neighboring drugs. However, existing methods do not consider the specific type of the relation between the drugs, leading to an incomplete embedding learning process. Given that different relations between drugs may have different effects on drug embedding, the combination of multirelational embedding and relation-aware network structure embedding of drugs can be helpful to improve the prediction of DDIs. Therefore, in this paper, a relation-aware network embedding model for the prediction of drug-drug interactions (RANEDDI) is proposed. RANEDDI not only considers the multirelational information between drugs but also integrates the relation-aware network structure information in the topology of a multirelational DDI network to obtain the drug embedding. Under evaluation metrics such as AUC, AUPR and F1, the experimental results show that RANEDDI is superior to several state-of-the-art methods and can be used in the prediction of binary and multirelational DDIs. We also perform ablation studies that demonstrate that RANEDDI is effective and that it is robust in the task of binary DDI prediction, even in the case of a scarcity of labeled DDIs.

Then with the aid of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a sharing sub-model is proposed to perform feature selection on each class by integrating each view’s locally sparse regularizers and shared loss that makes all views share a common penalty and regresses samples to their labels. Finally, all the sharing sub-models are fused to form the final general additive feature selection model, in which each sub-block adjusts its corresponding variables to perform block-based feature selection. In the optimization process, the proposed model can be decomposed into multiple separate subproblems, and an efficient optimization algorithm is proposed to solve them quickly. The comparison experiments with several state-of-the-art feature selection methods show that the proposed method is superior in classification accuracy and training speed.},

Moreover, the involvement of not only ontology engineers during the ontology verification process , but also domain experts and users, can provide valuable feedback to avoid misunderstandings and lack of information. This paper proposes a method for ontology verification that defines the testing activities to be performed. The method uses a testing language based on lexico-syntactic patterns to facilitate the definition of tests and an ontology to store and publish such tests. Moreover, this verification testing method proposes an online tool to execute tests on one or more ontologies. The method was compared in terms of time and errors by user evaluation with other tools for ontology verification; the evaluation showed that the tools that use testing languages had better results in terms of reducing errors in the verification activity compared to the tools that do not.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the fault-tolerant load frequency control (LFC) design of interconnected wind power systems . For this, a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm is integrated into the interconnected power systems . Distinct from the existing works, the communication time-delay is taken into the area control error (ACE) signals of interconnected wind power systems . Also, compared with the traditional LFC scheme, a fault-tolerant H ∞ H∞ LFC scheme is presented with known and unknown actuator fault against load disturbances and wind speed fluctuations. Then, the asymptotic stability conditions are derived in the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) form by utilizing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) method and Wirtinger-based inequality technique under the designed LFC scheme with H ∞ H∞ performance. Finally, numerical examples are given to validate the applicability and superiority of the designed LFC scheme.},

  abstract     = {In research, we found that the purpose of most trackers is to obtain an accurate and robust score map, neglecting how to further examine the confidence of the results. Inspired by the Siamese trackers, which merely use the template from the first frame to locate the target, we propose a novel object-uncertainty policy. Firstly, we propose a dynamic design of the target template set for the tracked target, considering the initial target template and the reliable target template of the subsequent frames concurrently. Secondly, we adopt the multi-layer fusion to represent the target while analyzing the fusion of various feature layers. Moreover, we use a more effective cosine similarity function to calculate the similarity instead of the correlation operation. Finally, we propose a novel voting mechanism in accordance with the similarity between the target tracked in subsequent frames and the target template set. More importantly, this method can be embedded into DCF-like methods to improve tracking performance, which is embedded into the recent DiMP and PrDiMP trackers separately for comparison. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the discriminative ability of the model can be enhanced effectively by using our proposed method, capable of preventing the model from learning the background information. The code and raw tracking results are available at https://github.com/hexdjx/OUPT .},

  abstract     = {Feature selection plays a crucial role in machine learning and data mining , and improves the performance of learning models by selecting a distinguishing feature subset and eliminating irrelevant features. Existing feature selection methods are mainly used for single-label learning and multi-label learning; however, there are only a few feature selection methods for label distribution learning. Label distribution learning has the “curse of dimensionality” problem, similar to that in multi-label learning. In label distribution learning, the related labels of each sample have different levels of importance. Therefore, multi-label feature selection algorithms can not be directly applied to label distribution data, and discretizing the label distribution data into multi-label data would result in the loss of some important supervised information . To solve this problem, a novel feature selection algorithm for label distribution learning is proposed in this paper. The proposed method utilizes neighborhood granularity to explore feature similarity, and it uses a correlation coefficient to generate the label correlations. In addition, sparse learning is used to improve the robustness and control complexity. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method is more effective than five state-of-art feature selection algorithms on twelve datasets, with respect to six representative evaluation measures.},

  abstract     = {Recommender system has recently received a lot of attention in the information service community. In many application scenarios, such as Internet of Things (IoTs) environments, item multimodal auxiliary information (such as text and image) can be obtained to expand their feature representation and to increase user satisfaction with recommendations. Motivated by this fact, this paper introduces a novel two-stage embedding model (TSEM), which adequately leverage item multimodal auxiliary information to substantially improve recommendation performance. Specifically, it encompasses two sequential stages: graph convolutional embedding (GCE) and multimodal joint fuzzy embedding (MJFE). In the former, we first generate a bipartite graph for user-item interactions, and then utilize it to construct user and item backbone features via a spatial-based graph convolutional network (SGCN). While in the latter, by employing item multimodal auxiliary information, we integrate multi-task deep learning , deterministic Softmax, and fuzzy Softmax into a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based learning framework, which is optimized to obtain user backbone features and item semantic-enhanced fuzzy (SEF) features accurately. After TSEM converges, user backbone features and item SEF features can be utilized to calculate user preferences on items via Euclidean distance . Extensive experiments over two real-world datasets show that the proposed TSEM model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics .},

We also provide conditions under which the Choquet-Sugeno-like operator coincides with some Choquet-like integrals defined on finite spaces and appeared recently in the literature, e.g., the reverse Choquet integral , the d d -Choquet integral, the F F -based discrete Choquet-like integral, some version of the C F 1 F 2 CF1F2 -integral, the CC CC -integrals (or Choquet-like Copula-based integral) and the discrete inclusion-exclusion integral.
