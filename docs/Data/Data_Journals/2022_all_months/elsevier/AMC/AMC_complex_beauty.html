Using this property, we derive a feasible, rapid, and accurate numerical algorithm. An application to risk theory is considered. More in detail in a CramȨr-Lundberg model framework, using its integro-differential representation as a starting point, we prove the ruin probability to be a Lipschitz function. Using the proposed algorithm, we evaluate the ruin probability that solves the associated Volterra integral equation. To show that the proposed framework can be reasonably generalized, we considered a wide range of claim size distributions.},

The validation of the cell-based S-FEM (CS-FEM) combined with SUPG/SPGP was carried out by the blood flow over a backward-facing step. The performances of the presented method were explored by the blood flow in the carotid bifurcation and blood flow in the intracranial segment of internal carotid artery. Impressively, the results exhibit good features of the CS-FEM on solving severely distorted mesh vis-a-vis the standard finite element method (FEM).

A sliding mode output controller is designed for the AES, which integrates the known future information. The designed controller guarantees the discrete-time reach condition and maintains the states in a neighborhood region of the predesigned sliding surface. The stability criteria of the sliding motion on a linear sliding surface are given for the considered systems.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the tracking control problem for uncertain nonlinear non-strict feedback systems (NSFSs) in the presence of full-state constraints and unmeasured disturbances. It is of great practical significance to realize the full-state constraint under disturbed conditions. In view of the non-strict feedback problem, a novel design framework of the state feedback control is given based on the newly proposed dynamic compensation system (DCS). Different from the traditional backstepping, the estimated signal based on the adaptive fuzzy system is indirectly introduced into the virtual and actual control laws through the DCS, which has the advantage of avoiding the algebraic-loop problem in NSFSs. Accordingly, the disturbance observer (DO) design method is improved based on this framework. Integrating the DCS into the DO design avoids the coupling problem between the disturbance and the unknown nonlinear function . An improved barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is designed by introducing the concept of the inducible factor, and full-state constraints can be guaranteed after a transitional period for any initial state. By combining the DCS, the DO and the improved BLF, a novel adaptive fuzzy tracking control law is constructed, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that all states meet the corresponding constraints while meeting the stability.},

  abstract     = {Collective cooperation and social mobility are ubiquitous in human societies. Due to information sharing and the complexity of everyday life , multidimensional mobility is also common, for example when moving into different districts of a city for better education or when settling permanently abroad due to better job prospects. Nevertheless, it is not clear how such complex mobility might affect cooperation in situations that constitute social dilemmas, where individual and public interests are at odds. Here, as an initial step to understand the impact of multidimensional mobility, we investigate one of its significant dimensions, namely the range of mobility. We propose an updating algorithm where individuals either move adaptively in the area bounded by a mobility radius or stay put for social learning. We use this on the prisoner’s dilemma and the snowdrift game, and we find that an increase in either probability or radius of mobility may weaken network reciprocity, simply by decreasing the odds of meeting old interaction partners. However, if mobility is free, there is a window of parameters where synergies with network reciprocity are possible, and where indeed cooperation can be robust and significantly elevated. Local mobility in particular may favorably affect cooperation. In fact, even if mobility is costly, the failure of local mobility can often be associated with the risk caused by the shortage of available empty sites. We also find that the synergistic effects of mobility superposed upon network reciprocity are best expressed for small flow rates. Overall, we hope that our research will promote the better understanding of the complex interplay between networks reciprocity and mobility and their coaction.},

To do this, the hidden Markov model is introduced to describe the phenomenon of asynchronization between the controller and the given fuzzy jump systems. Then, a novel mode-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is constructed to achieve the stability conditions and expand the maximum sampling period of fuzzy systems. The main purpose of this study is to design the asynchronous non-fragile reliable control with sampled-data information such that the mode-dependent fuzzy system is stochastically stable and possesses the dissipativity performance. For this, a sufficient condition is derived for the proposed system in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Meanwhile, the less conservative results and the desired controller are attained by solving the inequalities. At last, the validity and the superiority of our design technique are demonstrated by numerical examples .},

Simultaneously, the unknown nonlinear term denotes the bias fault is approximated by the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs).

And a symplectic pseudospectral method, where the multi-interval pseudospectral scheme is applied with a proportional mesh, to solve the transformed problems is then developed based on the first-order necessary conditions. Each linear-quadratic problem is finally transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations with a sparse coefficient matrix. Due to the benefit of the successive convexification technique and the multi-interval pseudospectral method, initial guess on costate variables is avoided and converged solutions can be obtained with an exponential convergent rate. The proposed iterative framework is validated by four examples with distinct features, highlighting its numerical precision and efficiency. And either exponential or linear convergence property can be exhibited by tuning the approximation degree or the mesh number.},

On the basis of this method, a new fixed-time stability criterion is developed to ensure that the designed controller can make the considered system be fixed-time stable and particularly the settling time be independent of the initial conditions.

This construction generalizes a prior approach based on Pythagorean triples of real polynomials , and yields more free shape parameters for surfaces of a specified degree. Moreover, when one of the complex polynomials is just a constant, the minimal surfaces have the Pythagorean–hodograph (PH) preserving property — a planar PH curve in the parameter domain is mapped to a spatial PH curve on the surface. Cubic, quartic and quintic examples of these minimal PN surfaces are presented, including examples of solutions to the Plateau problem , with boundaries generated by planar PH curve segments in the parameter domain. The construction is also generalized to the case of minimal surfaces with non–isothermal parameterizations. Finally, an application to the problem of interpolating three given points in R 3 R3 as the corners of a triangular cubic minimal surface patch, such that the three patch sides have prescribed lengths, is addressed.},

By resorting to a hidden Markov model (HMM), an non-homogenous observer with an asynchronous topological structure and gain is developed to estimate the state of nodes. Second, for saving precious communication resources, the remote controller updates the control signal based on a dynamic event-triggered scheme (DETS). In this scheme, the threshold of DETS is improved into a diagonal threshold matrix, and the desired system performance can be obtained by flexibly arranging each entry of threshold matrix. To unify the works of the synchronization and state observation, an augmented error system (AES) is established. Subsequently, sufficient conditions for H∞ synchronization of complex networks with asynchronous constraints are proposed by choosing a suitable Lyapunov function.

The result indicates that if soil-water diffusion coefficient is appropriately large, there is at least one non-constant steady-state solution to a spatial vegetation system. Moreover, with the aid of Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem and implicit function theorem , local structure of non-constant steady-state solutions is obtained. Subsequently, the global continuation of the local steady-state bifurcation is performed, and we get global structure of non-constant solution. At last, the above non-constant steady-state solution is illustrated by our numerical simulations. The extended simulation additionally shows that the spatial heterogeneity of species is enhanced gradually as soil-water diffusion increases.},

  abstract     = {In this article we present a high order cell-centered numerical scheme in space and time for the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. To deal with multiscale phenomena induced by the different speeds of acoustic and material waves, we propose a semi-implicit time discretization which allows the CFL-stability condition to be independent of the fast sound speed, hence improving the efficiency of the solver. This is particularly well suited for applications in the low Mach regime with a rather small fluid velocity, where the governing equations tend to the incompressible model. The momentum equation is inserted into the energy equation yielding an elliptic equation on the pressure. The class of implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integrators is then used to ensure asymptotic preserving properties of the numerical method and to improve time accuracy. High order in space is achieved relying on implicit finite difference and explicit CWENO reconstruction operators, that ultimately lead to a fully quadrature-free scheme. To relax the severe parabolic restriction on the maximum admissible time step related to viscous contributions, a novel implicit discretization of the diffusive terms is designed. A variational approach based on the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization is devised in order to obtain a discrete cell-centered Laplace operator. High order corner gradients of the velocity field are employed in 3D to derive the Laplace discretization, and the resulting viscous system is proven to be symmetric and positive definite. As such, it can be conveniently solved at the aid of the conjugate gradient method. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and the robustness of the novel schemes in the challenging stiff limit of the governing equations characterized by low Mach numbers.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to design a robust observer-based dissipative controller for discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with nonhomogeneous Markov jumps through a non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) scheme. Based on a mode-dependent nonquadratic Lyapunov function, the final form of the stabilization conditions is expressed as linear matrix inequalities in a less conservative manner. To be specific, this paper proposes a decoupling technique that can address the inherent nonconvex terms by extracting them from the stabilization conditions, where all slack variables are set to be fuzzy-basis-dependent for less conservative performance. Furthermore, the proposed stabilization method adopts a one-step design strategy that simultaneously designs the fuzzy observer and control gains without any iteration procedures by employing a positive tuning parameter. In particular, the time-varying transition probabilities included in the stabilization conditions are effectively removed using a modified relaxation technique that can avoid excessive use of free weighting matrices. Finally, based on four examples, the validity of the proposed method is verified through comparison with other studies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a game-theoretic model describing voluntary social distancing during the spread of an epidemic. The payoffs of the agents depend on the social distancing they practice and on the probability of getting infected. We consider two types of agents: the non-vulnerable agents with a small cost if they get infected and the vulnerable agents with a higher cost. For the modeling of the epidemic outbreak, we consider a variant of the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model involving populations of susceptible, infected, and removed persons of vulnerable and non-vulnerable types. The Nash equilibria of this social distancing game are studied. The main contribution of this work is the analysis of the case where the players, desiring to achieve a low social inequality, pose a bound on the variance of the payoffs. In this case, we introduce and characterize a notion of Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for games with a continuum of players and provide characterizations for this type of GNE. It turns out that often there is a continuum of GNE. However, among the GNE, for a given value of the variance bound, there is one that Pareto dominates the others. We also provide conditions under which a more restrictive variance constraint benefits all the game participants. Furthermore, we describe a bargaining-based algorithm for choosing the variance constraint. Through numerical studies, we show that inequality constraints result in a slower spread of the epidemic and an improved cost for the vulnerable players. Furthermore, we present some examples where inequality constraints are also beneficial for non-vulnerable players.},

In particular, the collective behavior of a network of neuron models with many-body interactions has received much attention among researchers in recent times. In this paper, we study the effect of higher-order interactions in the synchronization stability of the network of neuron models, namely Hindmarsh-Rose and Morris-Lecar models, with electromagnetic induction. We consider both two-body and three-body interactions to be diffusive and analyze their effect on the synchronization of the network of neurons. Our analysis shows that higher-order interactions can make the neurons synchrony with the minimal value of first-order coupling strengths in both neuron models. Besides, electromagnetic flux coupling strength also has a significant effect on the synchronization of neurons. In the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, the flux coupling demands higher coupling strength in both the first and second-order interactions for the synchronization of neurons. However, the Morris-Lecar neuron model shows a notable distinct effect, where the flux coupling enhances the synchronization of neurons with lesser first and second-order coupling strengths.},

  abstract     = {Every “x”-adjustment in the so-called xVA financial risk management framework relies on the computation of exposures. Considering thousands of Monte Carlo paths and tens of simulation steps, a financial portfolio needs to be evaluated numerous times during the lifetime of the underlying assets. This is the bottleneck of every simulation of xVA. In this article, we explore numerical techniques for improving the simulation of exposures. We aim to decimate the number of portfolio evaluations, particularly for large portfolios involving multiple, correlated risk factors. The usage of the Stochastic Collocation (SC) method Grzelak et al. (2019)[, together with Smolyak’s (1963), Judd et al. (2014) sparse grid extension, allows for a significant reduction in the number of portfolio evaluations, even when dealing with many risk factors. The proposed model can be easily applied to any portfolio and size.We report that for a realistic portfolio comprising linear and non-linear derivatives, the expected reduction in the portfolio evaluations may exceed 6000 times, depending on the dimensionality and the required accuracy. We give illustrative examples and examine the method with realistic multi-currency portfolios consisting of interest rate swaps and swaptions.},

This shows that the stochastic systems are ISS in regard to a lower bound of the AII, provided that the continuous stochastic systems is ISS but has destabilizing impulse. Furthermore, the impulse can effectively stabilize the stochastic systems for a upper bound of the AII, provided that the continuous stochastic systems is not ISS.

With this dependence structure, claim sizes from different lines of business are distributed according to the multivariate regular variation. This paper proposes conditions that can be satisfied by several important stochastic processes, including the Lévy process, Vasicek interest rate model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest rate model, Heston model, and Stochastic volatility model. Under these conditions, the uniform asymptotic expansions of ruin probabilities are derived, which hold uniformly for the entire time horizon. Numerical examples are provided as a means of illustrating the main results.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the behavior of the numerical solutions of the p p -Laplacian Allen–Cahn equation. Because of the p p -Laplacian’s challenging numerical properties, many different methods have been proposed for the discretized p p -Laplacian. In this paper, we provide and analyze a numerical scheme for the boundedness of solutions and energy decay properties. For a comprehensive understanding of the effect of p p -Laplacian and its relationship in the context of phase-field modeling, we compare the temporal evolution and compute the eigenpairs of the classical, fractional, and p p -Laplacian in the Allen–Cahn equations. As for the p p -Laplacian Allen–Cahn equation, we characterize different morphological changes of numerical solutions under various numerical tests such as phase separation, equilibrium profile, boundedness of solution, energy decay, traveling wave solution , geometric motions, and comparison of the Allen–Cahn equations with the three different Laplacians . Our results imply that the interface profile along the two-phase boundary lines changes more steeply than classical one as the p p order decreases, therefore, the p p -Laplacian Allen–Cahn equation can be applied for the description of phase interface where it is important to maintain sharply.},

We show that using current methods grad-div stabilization can change the calculated drag and lift coefficients. We will then suggest a remedy for the given test problem and verify our results by showing the grad-div parameters agree with the reference values and those calculated using Scott-Vogelius finite elements.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies highlight that diffusion processes in highly heterogeneous, fractal-like media can exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, which motivates us to consider the use of generalised transport models based on fractional operators. In this work, we harness the properties of the distributed-order space fractional potential to provide a new perspective on dealing with boundary conditions for nonlocal operators on finite domains. Firstly, we consider a homogeneous space distributed-order model with Beta distribution weight. An a priori estimate based on the L 2 L2 norm is presented. Secondly, utilising finite Fourier and Laplace transform techniques, the analytical solution to the model is derived in terms of Kummer’s confluent hypergeometric function. Moreover, the finite volume method combined with Jacobi-Gauss quadrature is applied to derive the numerical solution, which demonstrates high accuracy even when the weight function shows near singularity. Finally, a one-dimensional two-layered problem involving the use of the fractional Laplacian operator and space distributed-order operator is developed and the correct form of boundary conditions to impose is analysed. Utilising the idea of ‘geometric reconstruction’, we introduce a ‘transition layer’ whereby the fractional operator index varies from fractional order to integer order across a fine layer at the boundary of the domain when transitioning from the complex internal structure to the external conditions exposed to the medium. An important observation is that for a fractional dominated case, the diffusion behaviour in the main layer is similar to fractional diffusion, while near the boundary the behaviour transitions to the case of classical diffusion.},

This article attempts to consider a dual-channel supply chain operation decision and coordination under credit sales transactions for the first time, in which the supplier and the retailer compete on the credit period provided to the final customers, and the market demand is random and depends on credit period. This paper develops and analyzes the mathematical models of the dual-channel supply chain expected profit maximization under centralized, decentralized and coordinated decision making structures. A decision framework for a dual-channel supply chain considering credit sales competition and random demand is given, in which the supplier decides on wholesale price and online direct sales channel credit period, and the retailer decides on traditional retail channel credit period. This study finds that the fierce credit sales competition is bad for the dual-channel supply chain, and classical coordination contracts such as wholesale price joint trade credit contract have limitations in the dual-channel supply chain coordination considering credit sales competition. To stimulate channel members to make optimal decisions while optimizing their expected profits, a two-part credit contract based on asymmetric Nash bargaining is proposed. The research results reveal that the proposed contract can not only achieve the dual-channel supply chain coordination considering credit sales competition, but also achieve Pareto improvements of all members. Finally, the performance of different models is compared by numerical examples and sensitivity analyses, the effectiveness of the proposed contract is proved, and some managerial insights are given.},

In addition, Bernoulli binomial distribution are used to simultaneously describe the phenomenon of deception and DoS attack. Multi-channel network delay is solved by the method of combining delay division and segmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The co-design conditions of the H ∞ H∞ resilient filter based on dynamic event-triggered are given by the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and ensures that the error filtering system is stochastically stable under the H ∞ H∞ performance index.

The conjecture was settled when r = 3 r=3 for sufficiently large m m , and is false outside the principal range for r ≥ 4 r≥4 , proved by Gruslys, Letzter and Morrison. Until now, it is still open to characterize the maximisers of the hypergraph Lagrangian outside the principal range for r ≥ 4 r≥4 . In this paper, we study the conjecture outside the principal range. We determine the smallest number of edges for which the conjecture is false, and also partially characterize the maximisers of the Lagrangian.},

The random transmission delays, which can be characterized by a set of random variables obeying certain probability distribution, cause the phenomenon of PDs. In addition, for the sake of decreasing the consumption of network resources, the ETCM is used to arrange the data transmission. On the basis of the measurable data information, a novel distributed filter is constructed that can ensure the existence of the upper bound matrix (UBM) regarding the filtering error (FE) covariance and then the trace of the presented UBM is minimized via constructing the suitable filter gain. Afterwards, the boundedness analysis of FE dynamics is provided to evaluate the filtering algorithm performance. Finally, the validity of the designed DF scheme is illustrated through a numerical experiment.},

The noise-input-to-state stability problem is first considered for systems, where switching instants and impulsive intervals are confined by the mode-dependent average dwell time and impulsive interval, respectively. Then, we revisit the noise-input-to-state stability for nonlinear systems with stochastic switching and impulsive densities.

The proposed scheme is described by the compact difference operators together with the additional stabilized term. As a matter of fact, the Allen-Cahn equation contains the nonlinear reaction term which is eminently proved that numerical schemes are mostly nonlinear. To solve the complexity of nonlinearity , the Crank-Nicolson/Adams-Bashforth method is applied in order to deal with the nonlinear terms with the linear implicit scheme. The well-known energy-decaying property of the equation is maintained by the proposed scheme in the discrete sense. Additionally, the L ∞ L∞ error analysis is carried out in the 1D case in a rigorous way to show that the method is fourth-order and second-order accuracy for the spatial and temporal step sizes, respectively. Concurrently, we examine the L 2 L2 and H 1 H1 error analysis for the scheme in the case of 2D. We consider the impact of the additional stabilized term on numerical solutions. The consequences confirm that an appropriate value of the stabilized term yields a significant improvement. Moreover, relevant results are carried out in the numerical simulations to illustrate the faithfulness of the present method by the confirmation of existing pieces of evidence.},

  abstract     = {In some maps the existence of an attractor with a positive Lyapunov exponent can be proved by constructing a trapping region in phase space and an invariant expanding cone in tangent space . If this approach fails it may be possible to adapt the strategy by considering an induced map (a first return map for a well-chosen subset of phase space). In this paper we show that such a construction can be applied to the two-dimensional border-collision normal form (a continuous piecewise-linear map) if a certain set of conditions are satisfied and develop an algorithm for checking these conditions. The algorithm requires relatively few computations, so it is a more efficient method than, for example, estimating the Lyapunov exponent from a single orbit in terms of speed, numerical accuracy, and rigor. The algorithm is used to prove the existence of an attractor with a positive Lyapunov exponent numerically in an area of parameter space where the map has strong rotational characteristics and the consideration of an induced map is critical for the proof of robust chaos.},

  abstract     = {Best sparse tensor rank-1 approximation consists of finding a projection of a given data tensor onto the set of sparse rank-1 tensors, which is important in sparse tensor decomposition and related problems. Existing models used ℓ 0 ℓ0 or ℓ 1 ℓ1 norms to pursue sparsity. In this work, we first construct a truncated exponential induced regularizer to encourage sparsity, and prove that this regularizer admits a reweighted property. Lower bounds for nonzero entries and upper bounds for the number of nonzero entries of the stationary points of the associated optimization problem are studied. By using the reweighted property of the regularizer, we develop an iteratively reweighted algorithm for solving the problem, and establish its convergence to a stationary point without any assumption. In particular, we show that if the parameter of the regularizer is small enough, then the support of the iterative points will be fixed after finitely many steps. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we mainly establish the Crank–Nicolson (CN) mixed finite element (MFE) method for the system of time-domain Maxwell’s equations with a lossy medium. To this end, we first deduce the two-dimensional (2D) improved system of time-domain Maxwell’s equations with the lossy medium, construct the time semi-discretized CN format for the 2D improved system of Maxwell’s equations, and discuss the existence, stability, and error estimates of time semi-discrete solutions. And then, we construct a fully discretized CN MFE (FDCNMFE) format with both symmetry and positive definiteness, and analyze the existence, stability, and errors of FDCNMFE solutions. Furthermore, we make use of some numerical tests to verify the correctness of theoretical results in the 2D case. Finally, as a generalization, we also give the corresponding methods and results for three-dimensional (3D) improved system of time-domain Maxwell’s equations in the appendix A. This paper has advantages in at least the following four aspects. First, the study process herein is to discrete time and then discrete space variables so as to save the semi-discretized MFE discussion for spatial variables, which is a new attempt. Second, the magnetic field strength in the improve system of Maxwell’s equations is independent of the electric intensity such that their MFE subspaces can avoid the constraint of the Babuška-Brezzi (B-B) condition and can be freely chosen, so that the FDCNMFE solutions reach optimal order error estimates. Third, the 2D and 3D FDCNMFE formats reach the second-order accuracy in time and have both symmetry and positive definiteness so as to be solved easily. Fourth, both time semi-discretized CN solutions and the FDCNMFE solutions are unconditionally stable and unconditionally convergent.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider a novel model for a binary mixture of inert gases. The model, which preserves the structure of the original Boltzmann equations, combines integro-differential collision operators with BGK relaxation terms in each kinetic equation: the first involving only collisions among particles of the same species, while the second ones taking into account the inter–species interactions. We prove consistency of the model: conservation properties, positivity of all temperatures, H H -theorem and convergence to a global equilibrium in the shape of a global Maxwell distribution. We also derive hydrodynamic equations under different collisional regimes. In a second part, to numerically solve the governing equations, we introduce a class of time and space high order finite volume schemes that are able to capture the behaviors of the different hydrodynamic limit models: the classical Euler equations as well as the multi-velocities and temperatures Euler system. The methods work by integrating the distribution functions over arbitrarily shaped and closed control volumes in 2D using Central Weighted ENO (CWENO) techniques and make use of spectral methods for the approximation of the Boltzmann integrals with high order Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge Kutta schemes. For these methods, we prove accuracy and preservation of the discrete asymptotic states. In the numerical section we first show that the methods indeed possess the theoretical order of accuracy for different regimes and second we analyse their capacity in solving different two dimensional problems arising in kinetic theory. To speed up the computational time, all simulations are run with MPI parallelization on 64 cores, thus showing the potentiality of the proposed methods to be used for HPC (High Performance Computing) on massively parallel architectures.},

For this purpose, a low-order spectral model with three modes will produce for the fluid flow system using the Galerkin technique. It proved that the generated model is physically meaningful, as it conserves energy in the dissipationless limit and has bounded solutions in the phase space. Analytical procedures indicate that the system has three stationary points and the onset of instability in the flow is when the Rayleigh number reaches a critical value. With an appropriate Lyapunov function is proved that for the Rayleigh numbers below the critical value, the flow is globally stable. As the Rayleigh number gets higher and reaches a fixed value, a Hopf bifurcation occurs, and chaotic motion appears in the system. The critical and Hopf Rayleigh numbers relation are derived parametrically based on dynamical system theories. Also, numerical simulations will carry on the presented low-order model. Different dynamical behaviors of this flow and its transition from regular to chaotic motion are explained, with phase portraits and velocity-temperature diagrams obtained by numerical solutions. This parametric study can pave the way for future researchers to determine at around values of critical parameters should an experiment or direct numerical simulation be performed to have more accurate data without resorting to tests at all operating conditions.},

The primary contribution of this study is to establish a universal nonlinear transformation of relative output errors among agents for dealing with the initial network interaction, collision prevention, and predefined-time tracking performance problems in a fully distributed manner. To this end, nonlinear relative output errors among agents are designed using performance functions dependent on communication and avoidance ranges. Local event-triggered adaptive control laws are recursively designed using nonlinear relative output errors and neural networks . It is proved that the boundedness of the presented nonlinear errors ensures the achievement of network interaction preservation, collision prevention, and formation tracking with predefined-time convergence.

We propose a virus resource asymmetric coupling propagation model to simulate the propagation process of virus affected by recovered resources, and use a generalized discrete Markov chain method to describe the propagation dynamics. This paper mainly considers the effects of initial seed fraction, network edge coincidence degree, degree distribution heterogeneity and public resource allocation ratio on virus transmission mechanism. We find that by increasing the edge coincidence rate between nodes in the two-tier network, the propagation range of the virus changes from discontinuous growth to continuous growth with the growth of propagation probability . When the heterogeneity of network degree distribution is weak and the initial seed fraction is small, with the increase of the proportion of public resources allocation, the critical probability of virus transmission gradually increases, and the critical probability of virus outbreak first decreases and then increases. At this time, there is a critical value for the public resource allocation proportion. When the public resource allocation proportion exceeds this value, the hybrid resource allocation strategy can be better than the neighbor resource allocation strategy. In other cases, increasing the proportion of public resources allocation will reduce the critical probability of virus transmission and increase the critical probability of virus global diffusion.},

First, an augmented system consisting of the controlled system and the desired trajectory system is formulated, and the FHLQT problem transforms to the finite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (FHLQR) problem with the augmented system. Then, a time-varying Q -function which depends explicitly on the control input is defined. With the defined time-varying Q -function, a model-free finite-horizon control method is developed to approximate the solutions of the time-varying Riccati equations of the transformed FHLQR problem. At last, simulation studies are carried out to verify the validity of the developed method.},

Since observations are always discrete in practice, based on these discrete observations of solution processes, we propose moment estimations for unknown parameters by Euler method approximation of high-order uncertain differential equations. Matching sample moments with corresponding population moments, a system of equations whose solution is the moment estimation of the set of unknown parameters is derived.

The decomposition makes it possible to distinguish the long-term and the short-term behaviour through the trend component and the seasonality component. Among the decomposition methods, the STL (Seasonal Trend decomposition based on Loess) method stands out for its versatility and robustness. This method, however, has one main drawback: it works with a single seasonality, and does not deal with the calendar effect. In this article we present a new decomposition method, based on the STL, which allows the use of different seasonalities while allowing the calendar effect and special events to be introduced into the model using discrete-interval moving seasonalities (MSTL-DIMS). To show the improvements obtained, the MSTL-DIMS technique is applied to short-term load forecasting in some electricity systems, and the results are discussed.},

A key feature of our newly proposed TVD schemes is that the resulting CFL condition does not depend on the fast waves of the considered model, as long as they are integrated implicitly. However, a result from Gottlieb et al. [1] gives a first order barrier for unconditionally stable implicit TVD-RK schemes and TVD-IMEX-RK schemes with scale-independent CFL conditions. Therefore, the goal of this work is to consistently improve the resolution of a first-order IMEX-RK scheme, while retaining its L ∞ L∞ stability and TVD properties. In this work we present a novel approach based on a convex combination between a first-order TVD IMEX Euler scheme and a potentially oscillatory high-order IMEX-RK scheme. We derive and analyse the TVD property for a scalar multi-scale equation and numerically assess the performance of our TVD schemes compared to standard L L -stable and SSP IMEX RK schemes from the literature. Finally, the resulting TVD-MOOD schemes are applied to the isentropic Euler equations.},

Results show that individuals’ cooperation behavior could be restrained while the underlying contact network structure with possessing a high average connection. In the case of a small value of psychological bias factor, the ϵ − g r e e d y ϵ−greedy strategy selection way could just be conducive to better stimulate the individuals’ cooperation behavior in a homogeneity network. However, in the case of a large value of psychological bias factor, ϵ − g r e e d y ϵ−greedy strategy selection way can enhance the propensity of cooperation regardless of the contact network structure. More comparative analysis of individuals’ gain in a heterogeneity network and a homogeneity network, we find that one’s average gain in former network is significantly greater than that in the latter network. In addition, an optimal value of psychological bias factor exists which can realize benefits maximization in the population while individuals tend to choose strategies at random. Finally, we show that no matter what strategy a player adopted, his average gain shows a significant linear relation with his connection.

A novel control strategy, namely, periodically intermittent impulsive control (PIIC), is designed to cut down unnecessary communication costs and maintain the well-pleasing performance, where the impulsive instants only appear at control windows. Specifically, we explore the ELFC of SDMASs without DoS attacks via the PIIC strategy. The relation among the control period, the control width and the impulsive interval is derived by mean of utilizing the Lyapunov method and the linear matrix inequality technique. Besides, for SDMASs under DoS attacks, the following results are obtained: 1) under reasonable assumption that adversaries fail to work persistently within given intervals, a sufficient criterion is derived to ensure the ELFC of SDMASs; 2) the control rate is derived associated with the impulsive interval, the impulsive gain, the DoS attack ratio and the attack intensity; and 3) the novel protocol can achieve ELFC and cut down control costs effectively. More interestingly, a novel concept of periodic window-based average impulsive interval is proposed to make our developed criteria less conservative. Finally, simulation examples are demonstrated to certify the applicability of PIIC and the effectiveness of our main results.},

Then, we show that the viscous terms can be treated either by plugging them directly to the obtained system, making it of the hyperbolic-parabolic type or by casting them into an approximate algebraic source term that is asymptotically equivalent to the former formulation.

There are also changes in the equations modeling the dynamics of the berry volume ( v ) (v) and the rot volume ( v r ) (vr) . A high gain observer is constructed and it is proved that it displays an exponential stability under certain conditions. The existence and the conservation of some fundamental properties of anthracnose inhibition rate are also proved. Several simulations are realized to assess the effectiveness of the observer which definitely has the expected behavior.},

  abstract     = {Prey can ease the burden of exploitation by attracting a third party that interferes with their predators. Such is the case for plant-ant or aphid-ant mutualisms, where the victim supplies food to the ants, while the ants attack or drive away the offenders. Since ants are adaptive foragers, defense services can be altered by alternative food sources (e.g., other plants, or human-supplied resource). This article explores the prey-predator-ant system, using a model that combines predator-prey population dynamics with ant optimal foraging, where ants consume prey-supplied resources or alternative resources. Feedbacks between prey-predator dynamics and adaptive ant foraging leads to complex dynamics. For a given ant colony size and supply rate of alternative resources, prey can coexist with predators at alternative stable states, or along alternative limit cycles. Limit cycles extend the scope of defensive mutualism beyond the point where ants would abandon prey in favor of alternative resources under equilibrium conditions. These results highlight the importance of trait-mediated indirect interactions for natural mutualistic–antagonistic systems, and potential outcomes of manipulating ant defense services using baits in the case of agriculture.},

To decrease the transmission rate of the redundant data and alleviate the communication network burden, a method of designing distributed event-triggered mechanisms with dynamic triggering threshold functions is proposed, which are related to tracking errors, triggering errors and consistency errors. By taking the lumped disturbances into account, which include the primary disturbance generated by exogenous system and the secondary disturbance effects from adjacent UAVs, a composite disturbance observer is constructed for each UAV to counteract the negative effects of the unknown disturbances. Moreover, by referring to the prescribed performance control method, a consensus controller, which can avoid the internal collision among the multiple UAVs, is presented for each UAV to achieve the control target. The stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed by using the Lyapunov stability theory , along with the gains of controller and observers being represented in explicit forms . Finally, a simulation example regarding six UAVs testifies the availability of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Competing behavior spreading dynamics occur not only through pairwise interactions but also through higher-order collective interactions. The simplicial complex is widely adopted to describe the co-existence of pairwise and higher-order interactions. Previous studies have demonstrated that heterogeneous populations and the homophily effects are crucial in shaping the spreading pattern and phase transition. There is still a lack of a theoretical study for competing spread when higher-order interactions, heterogeneous populations, and homophily effects are all considered at the same time. We propose a mathematical model for the competing behaviors A A and B B to study the effects of homophily on heterogeneous populations with higher-order interactions. The heterogeneity population consists of three groups. Agents who only adopt behavior A A or B B are denoted as Ω A ΩA and Ω B ΩB , respectively. Agents in Ω A B ΩAB may adopt one of two behaviors. To capture the competing behavior dynamics, we offer a theoretical Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). We find that increasing 1-simplex transmission rate contributed to the spread of both two behaviors. The saddle point of the system is investigated and it is shown that the observed coexistence is caused by the average result of multiple experiments, revealing that there is still no coexistence present under our model. Decreasing the proportion of the population Ω A B ΩAB would lead to a significant decrease in the final adopted density of the system. Due to the existence of groups that only adopt behavior A A or B B , there are always adopted individuals in the system. In addition, the final adopted density is almost consistent across different homophily effects when the two behaviors interact symmetrically. When the proportion of Ω A ΩA remains constant, the final adopted density of behavior A A decreases significantly as the proportion of Ω B ΩB increases, whereas the final adopted density of behavior B B remains almost constant. Also, When the proportion of Ω A B ΩAB is fixed, an increase in the proportion of population Ω A ΩA ( Ω B ΩB ) makes the final adopted density of behavior A A (behavior B B ) to increase with it.},

We show that this formulation enjoys an extended range of applicability while remaining stable. Moreover, a significant improvement in terms of linear dispersive properties in high frequency regime is made due to the suitable adjustment of a dispersion correction parameter. We develop a second order splitting scheme where the hyperbolic part of the system is treated with a high-order finite volume scheme and the dispersive part is treated with a finite difference approach. Numerical simulations are then performed under two main goals: validating the model and the numerical methods and assessing the potential need of such higher-order model. The applicability of the proposed model and numerical method in practical problems is illustrated by a comparison with experimental data.},

The new proposal employs the kinematic model of the WMR robot together with a reference system to generate a transformed set of two decoupled and disturbed second-order systems. The control design stage consists in dividing the control signal into two parts. The first one uses an observer to compensate for the effect of the kinematic disturbances, which makes all the disturbances affecting the closed-loop system converge to zero uniformly and asymptotically. Then, the second control part consists of a PID controller designed to achieve asymptotic convergence of the tracking error. We provide a synthesis procedure through rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis, demonstrating that the new control scheme achieves the trajectory tracking control objective . Also, we include a set of numerical simulations to assess the performance of the new controller. Here, we compare our novel methodology against a feedback controller and a finite-time controller. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed control scheme achieves the trajectory tracking objective despite kinematic disturbances and outperforms the other control methodologies with the lowest overshoots and tracking errors.},

In order to deal with the relaxed restrictions, we develop a new pair of observer and output feedback controller with an improved dynamic gain, where the dynamic gain is ingeniously embedded in the backstepping design. Also, to economize communication and/or computation resources, two event-triggered control schemes via output feedback are presented with the time-varying threshold and dynamic threshold, respectively. It is worth emphasizing that the improved backstepping method can simplify the control design especially in the case of the dynamic threshold because of avoiding using hyperbolic tangent function .

Although consensus of EL multi-agent systems has been extensively studied in recent years, how to achieve better consensus performance under constraints such as switching topologies and uncertainties is still an open issue. Aiming at fast convergence and effective disturbance rejection, this paper studies the integral sliding mode control problem for robust finite-time consensus of EL multi-agent systems subject to switching topologies and uncertainties. A basic integral sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is first presented for finite-time consensus of EL multi-agent systems subject to undirected topologies and uncertainties. It is shown that the proposed consensus protocol reaches good disturbance rejection and achieves robust finite-time consensus while avoiding the singularity problem in the existing studies. The proposed integral sliding mode control scheme is further extended to finite-time consensus of EL multi-agent systems subject to directed and switching topologies. Compared with the existing algorithms, faster finite-time convergence is achieved. In the simulation studies, the obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Stochastic propagation and diffusion of ions across the cell membrane can break the balance of ion concentration. An appropriate external stimulus can speed up the exchange of ions and then different firing modes in the neuron can be induced for energy release. An improved neuron model is proposed and suggested to explore the effect of the magnetic field from the physical aspect, which a memristive channel with locally active feature is added to the known Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model by connecting a memristor in parallel with the HH neural circuit. That is, the memristive channel current is equivalent to the induction current, and an additive magnetic flux variable is introduced into the HH model, and its evolution is guided by the law of electromagnetic induction and energy conversion. The induction current can modulate the excitability and the threshold for inducing distinct action potentials. The transition from different-type firing patterns is induced by modulating the inductive current. In addition, an external magnetic field from two sources is applied to estimate the mode transition and firing patterns by regulating the magnetic flux, which induces further changes in the neural activity of the neuron. The neuron keeps quiescent when two identical magnetic field sources are emitted at high frequency. While the neuron can be activated to generate continuous firing patterns when the two applied magnetic field sources show certain diversity in the frequency. The potential mechanism is that the frequency synthesized by the two stimuli is close to the intrinsic frequency of the neuron, and then bursting can be induced effectively.},

  abstract     = {During a pandemic event like the present COVID-19, self-quarantine, mask-wearing, hygiene maintenance, isolation, forced quarantine, and social distancing are the most effective nonpharmaceutical measures to control the epidemic when the vaccination and proper treatments are absent. In this study, we proposed an epidemiological model based on the SEIR dynamics along with the two interventions defined as self-quarantine and forced quarantine by human behavior dynamics. We consider a disease spreading through a population where some people can choose the self-quarantine option of paying some costs and be safer than the remaining ones. The remaining ones act normally and send to forced quarantine by the government if they get infected and symptomatic. The government pays the forced quarantine costs for individuals, and the government has a budget limit to treat the infected ones. Each intervention derived from the so-called behavior model has a dynamical equation that accounts for a proper balance between the costs for each case, the total budget, and the risk of infection. We show that the infection peak cannot be reduced if the authority does not enforce a proactive (quantified by a higher sensitivity parameter) intervention. While comparing the impact of both self- and forced quarantine provisions, our results demonstrate that the latter is more influential to reduce the disease prevalence and the social efficiency deficit (a gap between social optimum payoff and equilibrium payoff).},

  abstract     = {This paper aims at investigating the adhesive nanocontact properties between a rigid cylindrical punch and an exponentially graded coating perfectly bonded with a homogeneous half-plane substrate. The interface of nanocontact is modeled with the Maugis–Dugdale adhesive contact model and the Steigmann–Ogden surface mechanical theory. Under plane strain assumption, governing equations and boundary conditions of the nanocontact problem are converted into triple integral equations. They are numerically solved for the determination of nanocontact length, pressure distribution and the application range of the adhesive zone, by the use of Gauss–Chebyshev quadrature, Gauss–Legendre quadrature and a self-designed iterative algorithm. The method of solution and numerical algorithm are first validated against literature results. Extensive parametric studies are then conducted with respect to the adhesive energy density, Tabor’s parameter, surface material constants and inhomogeneity index of the exponentially graded coating. Based on these results, the relationship between adhesive and surface effects can be identified as competitive. Both are of great importance in the determination of nanocontact behaviors of graded materials and structures. In addition, the Maugis–Dugdale adhesive contact model is found to converge to the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts model under large Tabor’s parameters. Large indenters, high adhesive energy densities, soft substrates and small adhesive cut-off distances are all helpful to the transition. The current work provides a generalized solution framework to the nanocontact problems of graded materials and structures in the simultaneous presence of adhesive and surface effects.},

  abstract     = {Most of the published results on solving operator equations are very restrictive i.e. they have been proved under certain additional assumptions and in fact we do not have general solvability conditions . There are many reasons why this is so, one of them being the fact that the usual methods employed when solving these equations involve the use of generalized inverses which exist and are bounded in the case of operators only under certain special conditions such as closedness of the range of operators. Using two previously considered systems of operator equations as examples, we will show that using a particular general approach we can give necessary and sufficient solvability conditions without any additional assumptions. We will consider the system A X C = C = C X A AXC=C=CXA and generalize recent particular results from the paper C. Deng, et al. (Appl. Math.

As a practical application, we compute option prices and Greeks in the multivariate Black–Scholes model as there is an urgent need for highly efficient methods. After a single training phase, the prices and sensitivities for different times, states and model parameters are available in milliseconds. Exploiting the PDE framework and incorporating a-priori knowledge of no-arbitrage bounds improves the performance significantly. We evaluate the accuracy in the price, the Greeks and the implied volatility with examples of up to 25 dimensions.

The proposed game consists of two competing firms seeking the optimum of their productions by maximizing weighted objectives that are profit and social welfare under the same marginal costs . Based on those objectives, the bounded rationality is adopted to construct the model describing the game’s evolution. A unique fixed point which is Nash equilibrium point is obtained for the game. The stability conditions for this point are discussed and shown that the equilibrium point can be unstable through flip bifurcation. In our discussion, we show that the model’s map is noninvertible and belongs to Z 3 − Z 1 Z3−Z1 type. Numerical experiments for the dynamics of the map are performed and shown that the map possesses several stable attractors. Furthermore, the shapes of some attractive basins for the map are analyzed providing the existence of the so-called lobes.},

The metric dimension problem(MDP) of computing the metric dimension of graphs is a kind of complex combinatorial optimization problem . In this paper, a hybrid algorithm for solving the MDP is developed, through which the metric base of graphs can be learned, and consequently the metric dimension of graphs is estimated. It is particular that the hybrid algorithm combines graph representation learning with greedy repair policy. Extensive experiments show that the hybrid algorithm has higher computational accuracy and efficiency on random graphs.

Moreover, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the asynchronous phenomenon between the original system and the filter is established. By constructing an asynchronous dissipative filter based on HMM, the filtering error systems are transformed into SSMJSs with partially known conditional probability. Criteria of exponentially admissible and dissipative for the filtering error systems are presented concerning a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, based on the LMI technique, the design of the asynchronous dissipative filter and the dynamic-memory event-triggered scheme are given in a unified way. Lastly, a numerical example and a tunnel diode circuit system are given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is widely used in the parameter estimation for complex models, which is the key to establishing a mathematical model. However, convergence to the local optimal easily occurs in PSO. A substantial amount of researches have been conducted to improve the evolutionary process of PSO; nonetheless, the study on initialization method is relatively limited. Generally, initial particle positions are uniformly distributed in the parameter space but unevenly distributed in the response space for nonlinear models, which can hinder optimization. In this paper, a novel initialization method for PSO with an uninformative prior of parameters in the model (UPPSO) is proposed. The method initializes particle positions uniformly distributed in the response space and makes the effect of particle velocity uniform in the response space. The UPPSO and other five algorithms were applied to estimate parameters for three different polymer models, that is, viscosity and PVT (pressure-volume-temperature) models which are very important and must be estimated for each type of polymers. In comparison with other algorithms, the optimization capacity of UPPSO for each model was ranked second, and UPPSO was particularly outstanding in obtaining the optimal parameter. Moreover, UPPSO was also competitive in computation performance. In general, UPPSO is conducive to optimization, efficient and adaptable, and it can also be generalized to other swarm intelligence algorithms, such as the differential evolution (DE) and artificial bee colony (ABC), etc.},

Firstly, we introduce an attack compensation mechanism for the sake of reducing the effects of DoS attacks. At the same time, a network predictive delay compensation mechanism is proposed for compensating the effects of RTT delays caused by packet dropouts, network time-delay and packet disorders. What’s more, the DET method is developed to save communication resources. The nonlinear system is represented by an equivalent data model where the nonlinear characteristics are expressed as pseudo-partial derivative (PPD) parameters. The designed DET-MFATC algorithm can guarantee the security tracking control problem only using input and output (I/O) data. In the end, simulation results clearly certify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.},

By using a structurally simple error transformation, the issue of guaranteeing prescribed transient and steady state tracking performance is converted to a general state-constraint problem, which together with the velocity constraints form a trajectory tracking control problem with full-state constraint. Time-invariant and time-varying asymmetric barrier Lyapunov functions are adopted to realize the constraint of trajectory-level and velocity-level errors. Within this setting, neural network and adaptive techniques are incorporated to construct a fault-tolerant trajectory tracking controller, which can not only estimate thruster faults, but also provide better robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbance.

Our approach provides the compact mesh stencil for the unknowns, while the noncompact mesh stencil is employed for the source term and the parameter function without involving their derivatives. For the proper interior grid points that are without adjoining the boundary, the sixth-order truncated errors are obtained by the QCD method. Yet the compact scheme is utilized for both of the source term and the parameter function on the improper interior grids that neighbor the boundary, which only reaches the fourth-order local truncated errors. Theoretically, the sixth-order accuracy of the global error by the proposed QCD method is strictly proved for the non-positive constant parameter. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate that the QCD method achieves the global sixth-order convergence for general variable parameters.},

To overcome this problem, two-sided Jacobi spectral quadrature rules are proposed to develop a Jacobi spectral collocation method for nonlocal diffusion equations.

First of all, the asymmetric time-varying constraints on the states are realized by introducing the corresponding function transformations, thus the feasibility conditions are eliminated and the requirements of constrained boundary functions are relaxed. Meanwhile, to ensure that the system output asymptotically tracks the desired signal, a new nonlinear function of the tracking error is constructed which is different from other system states . Then, the saturation nonlinearity is approximated by using a smooth function, and an auxiliary system is introduced to compensate for the effect of the error function. During the design process, fuzzy logic systems and command filtered technique are applied to handle the uncertainties and the problem of complexity explosion in adaptive backstepping method, respectively. The proposed scheme guarantees that system states will not exceed the given asymmetric constraint boundaries and the tracking error can converge to zero asymptotically. Finally, the given simulation examples validate the effectiveness of the constructed strategy.},

For a high density of simplices, the system exhibits a double transition. In the first transition, there is a discontinuous drop in the size of the giant component. In contrast, all connected components become negligibly small in the second transition, and the giant component disappears.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has emphasized that a precise prediction of a disease spreading is one of the most pressing and crucial issues from a social standpoint. Although an ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach has been well established, stochastic spreading features might be hard to capture accurately. Perhaps, the most important factors adding such stochasticity are the effect of the underlying networks indicating physical contacts among individuals. The multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach works effectively to quantify the stochasticity. We systematically investigate the stochastic features of epidemic spreading on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The study quantitatively elucidates that a strong microscopic locality observed in one- and two-dimensional regular graphs, such as ring and lattice, leads to wide stochastic deviations in the final epidemic size (FES). The ensemble average of FES observed in this case shows substantial discrepancies with the results of ODE based mean-field approach. Unlike the regular graphs, results on heterogeneous networks, such as Erdős–Rényi random or scale-free, show less stochastic variations in FES. Also, the ensemble average of FES in heterogeneous networks seems closer to that of the mean-field result. Although the use of spatial structure is common in epidemic modeling, such fundamental results have not been well-recognized in literature. The stochastic outcomes brought by our MAS approach may lead to some implications when the authority designs social provisions to mitigate a pandemic of un-experienced infectious disease like COVID-19.},

The aim of this paper is to design a filtering algorithm such that unknown modes, parameters and state are estimated simultaneously over a given finite horizon. By employing the Variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm, several marginal distributions are generated to approximate the joint distribution with the unknown variables.

  abstract     = {The problem of robust stabilization of interval type-2 fuzzy systems are studied by using equivalent-input-disturbance estimator-based event-triggered fuzzy control scheme. The estimator of the addressed system is designed by introducing new membership functions and then by using the same premises of the observer, the fuzzy controller is designed. To be precise, sampling-based event-triggered scheme is taken into the account in the controller design to save the communication resources and avoid the existence of Zeno behaviour. Furthermore, to compensate the impact of unknown disturbance, the equivalent-input-disturbance estimator-block is included as an internal loop of closed-loop system. To derive the stability conditions, a novel type of sampling-dependent piece-wise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed. Then, by introducing slack matrices, the fuzzy membership function dependent stability criteria are derived. The event-triggered weighting matrix and the gains of controller and observer can be obtained by obtaining the solutions of the developed stability criteria. At last, numerical simulations are given to reflect the effectiveness and applicability of the developed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A signed graph ( G , σ ) (G,σ) on n n vertices is called a parity signed graph if there is a bijection f : V ( G ) → { 1 , 2 , … , n } f:V(G)→{1,2,…,n} such that for each edge e = u v e=uv of G G , f ( u ) f(u) and f ( v ) f(v) have the same parity if σ ( e ) = 1 σ(e)=1 , and opposite parities if σ ( e ) = − 1 σ(e)=−1 . The signature σ σ is called a parity-signature of G G . Let Σ − ( G ) Σ−(G) denote the set of the number of negative edges of ( G , σ ) (G,σ) over all possible parity-signatures σ σ . The rna number σ − ( G ) σ−(G) of G G is given by σ − ( G ) = min Σ − ( G ) σ−(G)=minΣ−(G) . In other words, σ − ( G ) σ−(G) is minimum cardinality of an edge-cut of G G such that the number of vertices in the two sides differ at most one. In this paper, we prove that for any graph G G , Σ − ( G ) = { σ − ( G ) } Σ−(G)={σ−(G)} if and only if G G is K 1 , n − 1 K1,n−1 with n n even or K n Kn . This confirms a conjecture proposed by Acharya and Kureethara (2021)[1]. Moreover, we prove nontrivial upper bounds for the rna number: for any graph G G on m m edges and n n ( n ≥ 2 n≥2 ) vertices, σ − ( G ) ≤ ⌊ m 2 ( 1 + 1 2 ⌈ n 2 ⌉ − 1 ) ⌋ ≤ ⌊ m 2 + n 4 ⌋ σ−(G)≤⌊m2(1+12⌈n2⌉−1)⌋≤⌊m2+n4⌋ . We show that K n Kn , K n − e Kn−e , and K n − ▵ Kn−▵ are the only graphs reaching the bound ⌊ m 2 + n 4 ⌋ ⌊m2+n4⌋ . Finally, we prove that for any graph G G , σ − ( G ) + σ − ( G ¯ ) ≤ σ − ( G ∪ G ¯ ) σ−(G)+σ−(G¯)≤σ−(G∪G¯) , where G ¯ G¯ is the complement of G G . This solves a problem proposed by Acharya et al.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on linearisation techniques for a class of mixed singular/continuous control problems and ensuing algorithms. The motivation comes from (re)insurance problems with reserve-dependent premiums with Cramér-Lundberg claims, by allowing singular dividend payments and capital injections. Using variational techniques and embedding the trajectories in an appropriate family of occupation measures, we provide the linearisation of such problems in which the continuous control is given by reinsurance policies and the singular one by dividends and capital injections. The linearisation translates into a dual dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm. An important part of the paper is dedicated to structural considerations allowing reasonable implementation. We also hint connections to methods relying on moment sum of squares and LMI (linear matrix inequality)-relaxations to approximate the optimal candidates.},

The weak conjecture is that the variable Szeged index is always larger for any exponent exceeding 1. They proved the weak conjecture for bipartite graphs, and the strong conjecture for trees.

The second method, which is called the Bessel-QLM method converts firstly HIV problem to a sequence of linear equations by using the technique of quasilinearization and then the reduced problem is solved by the direct Bessel matrix method. Error and convergence analysis are studied for the Bessel method. Finally, the applications are made on the numerical examples and also the numerical results are compared with the results of other available techniques.

Incorporating the prescribed performance control (PPC) with DSC methods, we present a neural adaptive control method that characterizes the steady-state tracking error and its convergence rate. By constructing a type of funnel error variables, the error variables can be limited in the boundary of funnel functions, and the violations of the conditions of partial and full state constraints are shunned. In the latter case, a new assumption is proposed to handle the circular design problem in the design procedure. Under the control scheme designed, the considered nonlinear systems can be stabilized with the Lyapunov stability theory , and it can be guaranteed that all variables are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed prescribed performance DSC-based control scheme can ensure stability and prescribed performance metrics in the existence of partial and full-state constraints.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the event-triggered asynchronous fault detection (FD) problem for Markov jump systems with partially accessible hidden information and subject to aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The hidden Markov model with partially unknown probabilities is introduced to characterize the asynchronous phenomenon between the system and the filter, where the partially unknown probabilities may exist in the transition rate matrix of Markov chain, the conditional probability matrix of detected signal, or in both of them. In order to save the limited network bandwidth while resisting the aperiodic DoS jamming attacks, a new resilient dynamic event-triggered communication strategy is devised. Then, a new switched residual model for asynchronous FD is formulated by comprehensively considering the effects of the event-triggered scheme, asynchronization, and DoS attacks. By means of this model combined with the piecewise stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stochastic stability of the resulting switched residual system with desired dissipativity performance. Based on convex optimization techniques, an explicit expression of the desired asynchronous FD filter is derived. Finally, a single-link robot arm and a mass-spring system model are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design technique.},

Thus, it is highly desired to construct high order schemes to solve the elliptic interface problems with discontinuous and high-contrast coefficients. Let Γ Γ be a smooth curve inside a rectangular region Ω Ω . In this paper, we consider the elliptic interface problem − ∇ · ( a ∇ u ) = f −∇·(a∇u)=f in Ω ∖ Γ Ω∖Γ with Dirichlet boundary conditions , where the coefficient a a and the source term f f are smooth in Ω ∖ Γ Ω∖Γ and the two jump condition functions [ u ] [u] and [ a ∇ u · n → ] [a∇u·n→] across Γ Γ are smooth along the interface Γ Γ . To solve such elliptic interface problems, we propose a high order compact 9-point finite difference scheme and a high order local calculation for numerically computing the solution u u and its gradient ∇ u ∇u respectively on uniform Cartesian grids without changing coordinates into local coordinates . We numerically verify the sign conditions of our proposed compact finite difference scheme and prove the convergence rate by the discrete maximum principle. Our numerical experiments confirm the fourth order accuracy for computing the solution u u in both l 2 l2 and l ∞ l∞ norms of the proposed compact finite difference scheme on uniform meshes for the elliptic interface problems with discontinuous and high-contrast coefficients.},

  abstract     = {Real-world networks show community structures – groups of nodes that are densely intra-connected and sparsely inter-connected to other groups. Nevertheless, Community Detection (CD) is non-trivial, since identifying these groups of nodes according to their local connectivity can hold many plausible solutions, leading to the creation of different methods. In particular, CD has recently been achieved by Force-Directed Algorithms (FDAs), which originally were designed as a way to visualize networks. FDAs map the network nodes as particles in a D D -dimensional space that are affected by forces acting in accordance to the connectivity. However, the literature on FDA-based methods for CD has grown in parallel from the classical methods, leaving several open questions, such as how accurately FDAs can recover communities compared to classical methods. In this work, we start to fill these gaps by evaluating different numerical implementations of 5 FDA methods and different clustering analyses on state-of-the-art network benchmarks – including networks with or without weights and networks with a hierarchical organisation. We also compare these results with 8, well-known, classical CD methods. Our findings show that FDA methods can achieve higher accuracy than classical methods, albeit their effectiveness depends on the chosen setting – with optimisation techniques leading over numerical integration and distance-based clustering algorithms leading over density-based ones. Overall, our work provides detailed information for any researcher aiming to apply FDAs for community detection.},

Yet the co-dependent nature seems to give a single individual few capabilities to change the environment. Intuitively, it is the collective actions that matter. What is a single individual able to do with the population welfare and the environment? We set up a toy model to explicitly address this issue. We take into account the eco-evolutionary nature of the feedback between environment and human behavior. One strategy, termed as Welfare-Time strategy, is found, using which one individual suffices to set a linear relationship between collective welfare and environmental quality, no matter what the opponent does. This linear relationship can be either positively or negatively correlated, which is also unilaterally set by a single individual. It indicates that collective welfare can be higher even if it takes longer in a poor environment. Furthermore, we prove that the Welfare-Time strategy is able to dominate Win-Stay-Lose-Shift strategy, which is evolutionary stable against many strategies in repeated games. Our work reveals a hidden relationship between population welfare and the environment quality, which can be controlled unilaterally by a single individual. In addition, it implies that a single individual is able to control the environmental quality, provided that the rule of the environmental dynamics is known.},

  abstract     = {Prosocial incentives are recognized as effective tools to promote public cooperation. But their usage is costly, hence we need to find an optimal policy that offers the best outcome for a minimal cost. This problem has attracted extensive attention of scholars from many fields, and it has been studied intensively in well-mixed populations. Yet, the system behavior in the case of group interactions where decentralized incentives are involved is rather unexplored. To fill this gap, we consider the possible consequences of decentralized rewarding and punishing incentives in a spatially arranged population where players play public goods game with their neighbors. Importantly, both time-independent and dynamically varying cases are checked. With the help of pair approximation approach, we derive the dynamical equations under weak selection and obtain theoretical conditions of the minimally requested amounts for the expected outcome. By using optimal control theory , we also devise an index function to quantify the executing costs and obtain the optimal dynamical punishing and rewarding protocols. In addition, both numerical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations support that the optimal dynamical rewarding scheme requires a lower cumulative cost than the punishing alternative if the initial cooperation level is below a threshold value. Otherwise, the usage of punishment is more efficient.},

Despite being implicit in nature, the developed methods require no numerical or analytical inversion of the coefficient matrix, that is, computationally explicit. Fourier analysis is used to assess the stability results for the developed methods with the model two-dimensional reaction diffusion equation. The efficiency and robustness of the developed methods are validated by numerical simulations of spatiotemporal patterns for reaction-diffusion systems governing phase-separation, the Schnakenberg model, and the electrodeposition process.

The distinctive feature of the system is the coexistence of IDAs in the cyber layer and unknown parameters in the physical layer. Cyber attacks are modeled as state-dependent functions, which may change the direction of the state variables. To overcome the aforementioned issues, an adaptive finite-time controller is built using adding a power integrator technique and Nussbaum-function method, which may reduce the demands of the attack information. It is shown that the system states can converge to a neighbourhood of the origin in finite-time. Two numerical examples in this paper verified the scheme are effective.},

  abstract     = {When group members claim a portion of limited resources, it is tempting to invest more effort to get a larger share. However, if everyone acts similarly, they all get the same piece they would obtain without extra effort. This is the involution game dilemma that can be detected in several real-life situations. It is also a realistic assumption that resources are not uniform in space and time, which may influence the system’s resulting involution level. We here introduce spatio-temporal heterogeneity of social resources and explore their consequences on involution. When spatial heterogeneity is applied, network reciprocity can mitigate the involution for rich resources, which would be critical otherwise in a homogeneous population. Interestingly, when the resource level is modest, spatial heterogeneity causes more intensive involution in a system where most cooperator agents, who want to keep investment at a low level, are present. This picture is partly the opposite in the extreme case when more investment is less effective. Spatial heterogeneity can also produce a counterintuitive effect when the presence of alternative resource levels cannot explain the emergence of involution. If we apply temporal heterogeneity additionally, then the impact of spatial heterogeneity practically vanishes, and we turn back to the behavior observed in a homogeneous population earlier. Our observations are also supported by solving the corresponding replicator equations numerically.},

Since predator density depends on the prey density in current time and in past, a two-component model of prey-predator interactions is complemented with a third differential equation for the influence of recent past. The role of constant time delays incorporated in the functional form of Allee effect (referred as delays in competition and cooperation) is investigated analytically and numerically. Steady states of the model are obtained and the local stability analysis around the coexisting state is calculated in the presence of both delays. The critical threshold for time delays, above which the stability of the system switches from stable (unstable) to unstable (stable), is computed for various cases. Analytical findings of this paper are supported with numerical simulations, where time evolution as well as numerical bifurcation diagrams are presented. The results of this paper demonstrate that the influence of past on the prey-predator density in the present of time delay may have a considerable effect upon the system behaviour and can give important insights into underlying biological mechanism.},

Firstly, a universal delayed FOCNNs model is introduced, which includes several FOCNNs with various time delays structures such as distributed delays and constant delays or time-varying delays, as its special cases. Besides, for the case where the existing results cannot be applied to infinite time delays, a generalized fractional-order Halanay inequality is proposed, which facilitates the analysis of synchronization of FOCNNs. Based on the generalized inequality, a unified synchronization analysis framework for FOCNNs is established, which is also applied to the cases with commonly considered FOCNNs with distribute delays, constant or time-varying delays. All the derived synchronization criteria have similar results and can be easily verified. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the stability problem and H ∞ H∞ performance of networked control system (NCS) in the presence of mixed attacks by developing an improved event-triggered mechanism (ETM). Firstly, both aperiodic denial of service (DoS) attacks and random deception attacks are encountered for investigating system dynamic behavior. Then, a resilient optimized dynamic event-triggered mechanism (RODETM) is proposed for reducing the unnecessary costs of system operation and mitigating the impact caused by attacks. On this basis, the standard NCS is reformulated into a switched system under the mixed attacks. Further, using the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, average dwell time scheme and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, some sufficient conditions with control design implementation are obtained, which can ensure the exponential stability with the expected prescribed H ∞ H∞ performance index of the studied system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using a numerical simulation with comparative analysis.},

A description of the event-triggered bumpless transfer performance for switched linear systems is first proposed, which can reduce the control bumps caused by both switches and triggers. The bumpless transfer dependent event-triggered strategy is given, in order to obtain better bumpless transfer performance. Then, a state-dependent switching law, an event-triggered mechanism and the controller are jointly designed to ensure stability of the closed-loop system by the multiple Lyapunov functions method, and a sufficient condition for the performance of the event-triggered bumpless transfer is obtained. Furthermore, Zeno behavior is excluded by providing a positive lower bound on the intervals of the event triggering. Simulation examples of the control design including a railway system model and a turban model are presented to verify the effectiveness of the developed approach.},

  abstract     = {How the cooperation between individuals emerges in complex networked systems is a hot issue of common concern in many different fields. Evolutionary game theory has provided a mathematical framework for studying this problem. In social networks, the interaction between individuals is not fixed, but constantly changing. Therefore, this paper considers the coevolution of strategy and network structure when studying the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation. For the linking dynamics, different from the traditional random selection of connection objects, we propose a mechanism that individuals can actively recommend themselves before being selected. Through such active efforts, individuals expect to get more opportunities to be connected. In particular, the attributes of individuals considered in this paper have two characteristics without correlation. One is strategy, that is, cooperation or defection, and they have their own intensities of self recommendation respectively. The other is the high or low response to others’ recommendation, which reflects whether individuals are easy to be persuaded. We make a theoretical analysis of the system under the limit condition that the linking dynamics are much faster than strategy evolution. It is found that when the self recommendation intensity of the defector is greater than that of the cooperator, it is not conducive to the emergence of cooperation. On the contrary, when cooperators make self recommendation more actively than defectors, the response levels of different types of individuals and their proportion in the system jointly determine whether cooperation emerges. We theoretically analyze the conditions that can promote cooperation when the recommendation intensity of cooperators is high. However, the arms race in which both sides actively strive to raise the intensity of self recommendation will lead to an increasing adjustment cycle and form a Red Queen like evolution.},

For solving them three algorithms, which use different techniques of constructing the approximate solutions , are designed: the least-squares collocation method based on the piecewise polynomial approximations , which lead to the overdetermined systems of linear algebraic equations ; the finite element method , which uses weak formulations; and the non-local method without saturation, which operates with the global approximations in the elliptical coordinate system and with the matrix Sylvester equations. The proposed algorithms are verified by solving the test problem with the known analytical solution. Further we use them for the numerical analysis of the polymer fluid flows with its parameters varying in wide ranges. Comparison of the results obtained by the different algorithms shows their high performance and confirms that the solution of the considered non-linear problem exists and that it was computed accurately. The singularities of the obtained stationary solutions are analyzed. Taking them into account within the proposed algorithms enables us to increase the accuracy and the speed of simulations.},

The theoretical discussion on computational efficiency index is presented. Further, numerical results obtained are compared with existing robust methods to verify the theoretical analysis and higher computational efficiency. Several numerical examples, including rectangular, rank-deficient, large sparse, and non-singular matrices from the matrix computation tool-box (mctoolbox) are included.

Traditional encryption scheme has two significant stages, including image confusion and diffusion. Our encryption algorithm utilizes DNA coding and sequences to construct short DNA strand and long DNA strand, where short DNA strand is used for DNA strand exchange, and long DNA strand is used for DNA strand diffusion. Compared to general image confusion, DNA strand exchange permutates parts of two diverse DNA strands, where the length of exchange is uncertain. Compared to image diffusion, DNA strand diffusion is divided into two categories according to Watson-Crick base pairing property, and different category applies diverse DNA computation operation. Through security analysis and statistical analysis, our encryption scheme can resist different attacks. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm has a high degree of security and the excellent efficiency.},

Secondly, when the impulses in the CDNs are synchronizing, the existing criterion of local FTS (LFTS) is extended to global FTS (GFTS) and the settling time which depends on the initial values and the impulses is estimated.

First, we consider PDEs where the function is constrained to be positive and integrate to unity, as is the case with Fokker–Planck equations. Our approach involves reparameterizing the solution as the exponential of a neural network appropriately normalized to ensure both requirements are satisfied. This then gives rise to nonlinear a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) where the integral appearing in the equation is handled by a novel application of importance sampling. Secondly, we tackle a number of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations that appear in stochastic optimal control problems. The key contribution is that these equations are approached in their unsimplified primal form which includes an optimization problem as part of the equation. We extend the DGM algorithm to solve for the value function and the optimal control simultaneously by characterizing both as deep neural networks . Training the networks is performed by taking alternating stochastic gradient descent steps for the two functions, a technique inspired by the policy improvement algorithms (PIA).},

Simultaneously, uncertainties associated with system dynamics and unknown time delays are taken into account while designing controllers for RFCRSs.

The first case is when the wave governing equation is subject to the so-called unusual (non-local/non-classical) boundary condition. Where there is a non-local displacement and flux tension boundary data are placed at the very left end of the examined domain (string or rob), combined with Dirichlet and Neumann data at blue the left end of the domain. We explore the ideal value for the rational stiffness coefficient to be used for the second case which concerns moving Dirichlet data to the right and adding over-determination Neumann boundary conditions to the right or left. The forward solutions for the given problems, represented in the flux tension values, are investigated using the finite difference method (FDM) combined with the separation variable method. We also test the effect of the rotational stiffness coefficient on the effectiveness and convergence of those direct solutions. On the other hand, to obtain stable numerical results for the corresponding inverse problems (concerning retrieval of the force source function), the zeroth, the first, and the second-order of the Tikhonov regularization parameters are tested and the minimum error norm is calculated accordingly to find the best estimate for that space-dependent force source. Because such inverse problems are ill-posed, the existence and uniqueness of their solutions are tolerated and verified based on existing theorems in literature. This work includes numerical examples which illustrate the usefulness of the approach for solving non-homogeneous wave equations under novel kinds of boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {We propose an unconditionally stable numerical algorithm, which uses the Feynman-Kac formula of the Black-Scholes equation to obtain accurate option prices and hedge parameters. We discretize the asset and time using uniform grid points. We approximate the option values by piecewise quadratic polynomials for each time step and integrate them analytically over the log-normal distribution. The piecewise quadratic approximation gives the third-order convergence in the asset direction, and the analytic integration reduces truncation error in the time direction. The estimation errors are propagated backward in time following the convection and diffusion characteristics of the Black-Scholes equation, which assures the unconditional stability of our method. The vectorized code implementation reduces the time complexity. The convergence test shows that our approach outperforms the Crank-Nicolson scheme of the finite difference method in both time and asset directions, and the stability test verifies that our method is stable as the Crank-Nicolson. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm reduces the price errors and hedge parameter errors by more than 50% from the benchmark.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the dynamic system of the Hawk-Dove game with deterministic and stochastic interference and considers the two-player game and N N -player game, respectively. First, we introduce the replicator dynamics equations of the Hawk-Dove game for the two-player and N N -player cases and prove the stability of the unique equilibrium point. When the system reaches a stable state , we find that the frequency of individuals adopting D D -strategy depends upon the number of players. As the number of players increases, the frequency of D D -strategy increases. Second, we ponder two forms of stochastic noise, additive noise and multiplicative noise, and use the potential function method to prove the stochastic stability of equilibria of the two-player and N N -player game systems respectively. The additive noise causes the frequency of players who use D D -strategy to oscillate at the stochastically stable equilibrium . Then, we use Itô’s formula and the strong law of large numbers to prove that the frequency of D D -strategy is almost surely exponentially stable ( A S E S ) (ASES) and persistent. We obtain a threshold value for multiplicative noise, when the multiplicative noise value is greater than the threshold value, the frequency of D D -strategy x = 0 x=0 is A S E S ASES . Conversely, when the multiplicative noise value is less than the threshold value, the frequency of D D -strategy is persistent. The results show that noise interference has an important effect on the replicator dynamics of Hawk-Dove game, this improves the study of game dynamics without noise. Finally, numerical simulations are used to show our theoretical results.},

The difference finite element method consists of combining the finite difference discretization based on the P 1 × P 0 P1×P0 -element in the z z -direction and the finite element discretization based on the ( P 1 , P 1 , P 1 ) × P 1 (P1,P1,P1)×P1 -element in the ( x , y ) (x,y) -plane.

Some spatial spreading results are established in this paper in terms of the shifting speed of environment. Particularly, we prove that the model system admits a forced wave when the shifting speed belongs to a certain interval, which indicates that the competition exclusion takes place as the shifting ranges is beneficial to one species while is harmful to the another species. In addition, we obtain some gap formations when the shifting speed outside that interval, which suggest that both species will eventually disappear as a result of fast climate change.},

  abstract     = {Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to model dynamical behavior of systems. It is important to perform identifiability analysis prior to estimating unknown parameters in ODEs (a.k.a. inverse problem), because if a system is unidentifiable, the estimation procedure may fail or produce erroneous and misleading results. Although several qualitative identifiability measures have been proposed, much less effort has been given to developing quantitative (continuous) scores that are robust to uncertainties in the data, especially for those cases in which the data are presented as a single trajectory beginning with one initial value . In this paper, we first derived a closed-form representation of linear ODE systems that are not identifiable based on a single trajectory. This representation helps researchers design practical systems and choose the right prior structural information in practice. Next, we proposed several quantitative scores for identifiability analysis in practice. In simulation studies, the proposed measures outperformed the main competing method significantly, especially when noise was presented in the data. We also discussed the asymptotic properties of practical identifiability for high-dimensional ODE systems and conclude that, without additional prior information, many random ODE systems are practically unidentifiable when the dimension approaches infinity.},

The coupled model is formed from the momentum equation based on the fractional constitutive relationship and the fractional heat-conduction equation derived from the Fourier law. The fractional coupled model is solved numerically by combining the weighted and shifted Grünwald difference method in the temporal direction with the spectral method based on Lagrange-basis polynomials in the spatial direction. In addition, we propose a fast method to reduce the computational time and the memory requirements of the actual calculation. We also prove the stability and convergence of the numerical scheme with the fast method. Furthermore, a numerical example is given to verify the efficiency of the numerical method and of the theoretical analysis.

  abstract     = {In this paper, non-asymptotic and robust estimation for fractional integrals of noisy acceleration is considered for a class of fractional linear systems based on the study of the behaviour of fractional derivatives at zero. Particularly, the position and velocity can be estimated from the noisy acceleration via the designed estimators. Such estimates can be of value for health monitoring, reliability assessment, and vibration control of mechanical systems. Based on the existing numerical approaches addressing the proper fractional integrals, our attention is primarily restricted to estimating the unknown initial values . For completing the estimation, two methods based on classical modulating functions and generalized modulating functions are proposed, respectively. Via the results on fractional derivatives at zero, the initial values of the considered systems are discussed, and the corresponding estimator simplifications are performed. In addition, constructions of the required modulating functions are discussed. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided, which demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results and the efficiency of the proposed estimators.},

Using data on rare earth products from the UN Comtrade database, the global rare earth trade network and its evolving topological characteristics are analyzed for the period 1999–2020. Spatial correlation analysis using the global Moran index showed that countries tended to carry out rare earth trade with neighboring countries, and there were certain spatial aggregations in the trade patterns. A temporal exponential random graph model (TERGM) was used to analyze the influencing factors and evolution of the global rare earth trade, and network motif analysis was used to analyze the influence of network topology on the trading network structure. The results showed that the global rare earth trade model presented the following characteristics: trade from one core country to many other countries, reciprocity between trading countries, and trade around near neighboring rare earth-rich countries. Other factors, such as countries with the same GDP levels and World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries, influenced the global rare earth trade but not the formation of the rare earth trade network. In examining the temporal dependence of rare earth trade networks over a 22-year period, it was found that the linkages of rare earth trade networks among countries remained relatively stable, pointing to the long-term dependence of countries with scarce rare earth resources on resource-rich countries.},

Moreover, this adaptive control pattern finds in real-time approximations of the optimal value and the non-zero sum Nash-equilibrium, while also ensuring the uniform ultimate ε ε -boundedness of the closed-loop system. Further, as the number of hidden-layer neurons tends to infinite, the approximation errors converge to zero. As a result, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.

In our main results, adaptive control (continuous control) and impulsive control (discontinuous control) are both designed to reach the bipartite leader-following synchronization of the underlying networks. In addition, a Halanay inequality of fractional version is established. With the help of it, by using signed graph theory and Lyapunov method, some bipartite synchronization criteria are derived under the Lyapunov-type theorems and coefficients-type theorems. Then, as an application of theoretical results, the bipartite leader-following synchronization of fractional-order coupled Chua’s circuits modeled on delayed multilayer signed networks is considered.

Two-dimensional convective roll instability is discussed with finite-amplitude disturbances. For linear stability, as a first-order problem, the expressions for Rayleigh numbers for stationary and oscillatory convection are derived and the effects of Coriolis force and magnetic parameters on the onset of ferromagnetic convection are studied, numerically. In weakly nonlinear oscillatory analysis, the second-order and third-order stability problems are discussed and the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation describing the amplitude of convection cell in rotating ferrofluid is derived and consequently, the expression for Nusselt number representing the heat transfer rate is obtained. From the present analysis, we observed that the rotation has the usual stabilizing effect on the linear stability in ferroconvection, however, the magnetic number ( M 1 ) and the measure of nonlinearity of magnetization ( M 3 ) both have a destabilizing effect on the onset of linear instability. Also, we found that for non-linear convection, the heat transfer rate (the Nusselt number ) increases with increasing values of Taylor number, magnetic number, and the measure of nonlinearity of magnetization .},

  abstract     = {The study of cospectral graphs is one of the traditional topics of spectral graph theory. Initial expectation by theoretical chemists Günthard and Primas in 1956 that molecular graphs are characterized by the multiset of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix was quickly refuted by the existence of numerous examples of cospectral graphs in both chemical and mathematical literature. This work was further motivated by Fisher in 1966 in the influential study that investigated whether one can “hear” the shape of a (discrete) drum, which has led over the years to the construction of many cospectral graphs. These findings culminated in setting the ground for the Godsil-McKay local switching and the Schwenk’s use of coalescences, both of which were used to show (around the 1980s) that almost all trees have cospectral mates. Recently, enumerations of cospectral graphs with up to 12 vertices by Haemers and Spence and by Brouwer and Spence have led to the conjecture that, on the contrary, “almost all graphs are likely to be determined by their spectrum”. This conjecture paved the way for myriad of results showing that various special types of graphs are determined by their spectra. On the other hand, in a recent series of papers, Hosoya drew the attention to a particular aspect of constructing cospectral graphs by using coalescences: that cospectral graphs can be constructed by attaching multiple copies of a rooted graph in different ways to subsets of vertices of an underlying graph. The principal focus of this research effort is to address the expectations and questions raised in Hosoyas papers. We give an explicit formula for the characteristic polynomial of such multiple coalescences, from which we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for cospectrality of these coalescences. We enumerate such pairs of cospectral multiple coalescences for a few families of underlying graphs, and show the infinitude of cospectral multiple coalescences having paths as underlying graphs, which were deemed rare by Hosoya.},

Some of the system states are then treated as unknown inputs to form an infinitely observable reduced-order system. A sliding mode observer (SMO) is applied to estimate the states and faults based on measurable signals. Next, a memoryless controller is designed using these estimates. Design conditions for the SMO and controller are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities . In the case where the state and input delays are different, the FTC scheme is designed to limit the effect of the mismatch in delays on the output. In the case of equivalent state and input delays, the FTC scheme is designed so that the system output asymptotically converges to zero. A simulated example is lastly performed to verify the scheme’s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a four dimensional mathematical model for Human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) infection that includes delayed CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) immune response. The proposed system has three biologically feasible steady states, namely disease-free steady state, CTL-inactive steady state and an interior steady state. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that local and global stability analysis are established by the two critical parameters R 0 R0 and R 1 , R1, basic reproduction numbers due to viral infection and due to CTLs immune response, respectively. The disease-free steady state E 0 E0 is globally stable if R 0 ≤ 1 , R0≤1, and the HTLV-I infections are eliminated. The asymptotic-carrier steady state E 1 E1 is globally stable if R 1 ≤ 1 1 , R1&amp;gt;1, which implies that the HTLV-I infection is choric in persistence of CTLs immune response. Due to immune response delay, our proposed model undergoes a destabilization of the interior steady state leading to Hopf bifurcation and periodic oscillations. We estimate the length of time delay that preserve the stability of period-1 limit cycle. We also derived the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation around the interior steady state by center manifold theory and normal form method. To determine the robustness of the model, we performed normalized forward sensitivity analysis with reference to R 0 R0 and R 1 R1 . Our proposed model undergoes Hopf bifurcation with respect to the production rate of uninfected CD4+T cells h , h, removal rate of virus-specific CTLs d 4 , d4, spontaneous infected CD4+T cell activation d 2 d2 and transmissibility coefficient β β . Implications of our numerical illustrations to the pathogenesis of HTLV-I infection and the development of HTLV-I related HAM/TSP are explored.},

  abstract     = {This paper concentrates on robust finite-time H ∞ H∞ control for uncertain Itô stochastic semi-Markovian jump systems with generally uncertain transition rates, multiple state delays and input constraint. There are few attempts for Itô stochastic semi-Markovian jump systems with generally uncertain transition rates. In contrast to the existing results, the system explored in this paper is more general and has more potential applications. By means of the partial transition rate information, a semi-Markovian jump controller is developed to realize fault-tolerant control. Then, a closed-loop system can be gathered. Moreover, a cluster of stability conditions are attained via stochastic Lyapunov function with the way of linear matrix inequalities . Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate this effectiveness of the approach depicted in the work.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an enhanced chaos synchronization control scheme of stochastic nonlinear systems for the permanent magnet synchronous motors(PMSMs) applications for dynamic operating mechanism under different working environment. Firstly, a novel fixed-time stochastic stability theorem and convergence for the stochastic nonlinear system is valid through formulating a novel Lyapunov function. Different from what has been achieved on the fixed-time stability, it’s not the usual range but it’s more precise for settling time which improving control performance effectually. Secondly, the chaos synchronization issue of driven-response PMSMs with stochastic noise is firstly investigated based on the proposed Lyapunov theorem synchronizing the complex dynamic systems considering practical significance . Finally, the fixed-time synchronization control scheme is developed via applying the adaptive algorithms, furthermore, through constructing a reasonable synchronization dynamic error system achieving stability in probability of fixed time. A simulation analysis is demonstrated to verify the availability of the proposed control strategy.},

Our analytical and numerical results show that, in addition to the rise of criminality due to the presence of illegal guns, the increase of legal guns leads to a fast increase of violent crimes, suggesting that the access of firearms by civilians is not a good option regarding the control of crimes.},

For the objective of conserving computing resources and decreasing network load, an event-triggered impulsive control (ETIC) mechanism depending on state errors is introduced. The event-triggered controller updates only at impulsive instants, which are defined by some certain triggering conditions and not predetermined. Then, by means of fractional Lyapunov theory, the Kronecker product together with the comparison principle and Laplace transform , sufficient conditions depending on fractional order are obtained to achieve event-triggered impulsive synchronization of FOCNNs. Furthermore, it is also proved that there exists a positive constant less than the time interval between arbitrary two consecutive impulsive instants, which means the Zeno phenomenon is eliminated. At last, a numerical simulation of the typical chaotic system is presented to indicate the feasibility of the developed ETIC mechanism and the correctness of the obtained results.},

The numerical studies show that the new numerical scheme provides a very significant reduction of the required computing time as compared to the discrete velocity method on a fixed mesh. Cross-comparisons with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach further confirm the accuracy of the new scheme and model kinetic equations as applied to plume expansion studies. Finally, the good parallel scalability of the new ALE scheme as implemented into the in-house code Nesvetay  is demonstrated. The use of two very different approaches to numerical prediction of the transient flow pattern allows us to obtain a reliable numerical solution, which can be regarded as a new transient benchmark test.},

Since the control gain is time-varying and agent-dependent, the implementation of event-triggered control may cause desynchrony of the control gain and the time-variation of Laplacian matrix. Moreover, the coexistence of antagonistic information and multiplicative noise gives rise to the difficulty of regarding the error system as the deterministic counterpart. To cope with these challenges, the boundedness of each agent’s states is first formulated. Based on it, a criteria for mean square bipartite consensus with event-triggered mechanism is derived by utilizing the semi-decomposition method.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the problem of sampled-data distributed state estimation for a linear continuous-time system with multiple transmission channels under denial-of-service attacks. To solve this problem, sampled-data distributed observers, which only have access to their respective measurable output variables and the information obtained from their neighbors, are designed, where a decomposition form of the coefficient matrices of the system and a time interval division-based method are proposed to deal with the complex interaction of the sampled-data schemes and the attack schemes among different transmission channels. Different from the previous results, the transmission channels from the sensors to the remote observers do not share the same sampled-data scheme and are allowed to be compromised by different adversaries. An example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To solve numerically these problems, we consider the kernel-based method of lines that allows us to split the spatial and time derivatives, dealing with each separately. This adaptive scheme is based on a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) procedure, which is employed as an error indicator. By this technique, we can first detect the domain areas where the error is estimated to be too large – generally due to steep variations or quick changes in the solution – and then accordingly enhance the numerical solution by applying a two-point refinement strategy. Numerical experiments show the efficacy and performance of our adaptive refinement method.},

Then, the spectral collocation approach based on the alternative Laguerre polynomials (with positive coefficients) is adopted for approximation of the resulting semi-discrete ordinary differential equations . The convergence of the spectral technique is established. Three numerical test examples are given to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

We propose an extension of this concept to the class of all bivariate shock induced copulas, the most well-known part of them being the Marshall-Olkin copulas. This class properly contains semilinear copulas. Our technique coincides with the existing notion on them and has some advantages. First, it is defined on a wider family of copulas, which is helpful in finding more examples of extreme copulas. Second, we show that they are dense in each class they belong to (including the class of semilinear copulas) in a stronger sense than in the Krein-Milman approach; actually, they are dense in a similar way as shuffles of M M are dense in the set of all copulas. Third, this definition enables practitioners to give stochastic interpretation of extremality. Roughly speaking, a shock induced copula is extreme whenever the inducing shocks have pairwise disjoint supports.},

Then, on the basis of this adaptive distributed observer functioning in the system, the problem for multiple ELSs of leader-following bipartite consensus will be solved by using the Lyapunov method and the deterministic equivalence principle.

Firstly, we establish certain discrete energy estimates based on the projection scheme. Next, we testify the unconditional stability and error estimates of the velocity, pressure, magnetic field and temperature. The regularity of the projection scheme will be given. The numerical results show the method has an optimal convergence order, and can keep Gauss’s law well. The numerical results are consistent with our theoretical analysis, and our method is effective.

(Such systems are common, for instance, in computer networking, where flows of packets arrive to the same router’s buffer from different network users). Assuming a general service time distribution and Poisson flows, we study the burst ratio parameter, which reflects the tendency of losses to cluster together, in long series. In particular, an explicit formula for the burst ratio in each individual flow is derived. Using this formula we show, among other things, that the per-flow burst ratio may vary significantly among flows and differ from the global burst ratio. This distinguishes the per-flow burst ratio from the per-flow loss ratio, which is the same for all flows. We demonstrate also the dependence of the per-flow burst ratio on the flow rate, number of flows, buffer size, system load and variance of the service time.},

Erdős and Simonovits [10] conjectured that an n n -vertex graph G G with ex ( n ; C 4 ) + 1 (n;C4)+1 edges may contain at least n + o ( n ) n+o(n) 4-cycles. In this paper we investigate the number of 4-cycles in a graph. We show that the number of 4-cycles in an n n -vertex graph G G is at least ( ϵ 4 n − 3 ) / 4 + ϵ 2 / ( 2 n ) (ϵ4n−3)/4+ϵ2/(2n) provided that | E ( G ) | = n ( 1 + 4 n − 3 ) / 4 + ϵ , |E(G)|=n(1+4n−3)/4+ϵ, where ϵ ϵ is an arbitrary positive real number . This result is an approach solving to this open problem. Furthermore, we prove that if n n is large enough, then there are at least ( ( 4 ϵ − 1 ) 4 n − 3 + 5 ) / 16 + o ( 1 ) ((4ϵ−1)4n−3+5)/16+o(1) 4-cycles in an n n -vertex graph with e = ( n − 1 ) ( 1 + 4 n − 3 ) / 4 + ϵ e=(n−1)(1+4n−3)/4+ϵ edges which has k k vertices whose degrees are mutually different, where k ≥ 24 n 3 + 12 n − ( 12 n ) 2 − 1 / 27 3 k≥24n3+12n−(12n)2−1/273 and ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 is a real number. In addition, we get that a triangle-free graph with n n vertices and e = n n − 1 / 2 + ϵ e=nn−1/2+ϵ edges has at least ( 2 ϵ ( n − 1 − 2 ) + 1 ) / 4 + o ( 1 ) (2ϵ(n−1−2)+1)/4+o(1) 4-cycles, where ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 is an any real number and n n is large enough. This shows that the weak version of Erdős and Simonovits&#39; conjecture [10] holds for such graphs when n n is sufficiently large. Finally, we obtain a bipartite version of this result.},

A new asynchronous edge-based dynamic event-triggered control protocol based on directed edges is designed. Using this event-triggered control protocol can reduce the frequency of event-triggered, save communication resources and avoid Zeno behavior. Since events on different edges occur independently of each other, there is no need for clock synchronization among neighbors. Besides, we relax the constraints on the communication topology of multi-agent systems by limiting it only to a weight-balanced digraph containing a directed spanning tree. In addition, the stochastic multi-agent systems can reach mean square consensus exponentially.

Although computing power has been speedily growing in recent decades, embedded and large-scale problems have motivated significant research to improve the computational efficiency. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on finite precision limitation on discretization schemes due to round-off effects in floating-point number representation. In this paper, a computational effective discretization scheme for nonlinear dynamical systems is introduced. By means of a theorem, it is shown that high-order terms in the Runge-Kutta method can be neglected with no accuracy loss. The proposed approach is illustrated using three well-known systems, namely the Rössler systems, the Lorenz equations and the Sprott B system. The number of mathematical operations and simulation time have reduced up to 81.1% and 90.7%, respectively. Furthermore, as the step-size decreases, the number of neglected terms increases due to the precision of the computer. Yet, accuracy, observability of dynamical systems and the largest Lyapunov are preserved. The adapted scheme is effective, reliable and suitable for embedded and large-scale applications.},

In this paper, we deal with a reaction-diffusion predation model with mixed functional responses. We are mainly concerned with the coexistence of the species. We firstly give the long-time behaviors of parabolic dynamical system . Secondly, we consider the steady state system, including the priori estimate , existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of positive solutions to the system. The result shows that the coexistence of the species depends to a great extent on their intrinsic growth rates , diffusion situations and the predation pressure imposed to preys by predators. The uniqueness and stability results show that the functional response has important effects on the model, which is mainly reflected by the predation behavior of predators. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

One of the main accomplishments of this study is to develop a stable high-order algorithm for the system of reaction–diffusion equations. The algorithm is “robust” because it is designed to prevent non-physical oscillations through an iteration procedure of a block Gauss-Seidel type. The other is to develop an efficient algorithm for the Cauchy problem. For this, we first find half of the upstream points by adopting a multi-step q q th-order ( q = 2 , 3 ) (q=2,3) error correction method. The algorithm is also “economical” in the sense that an interpolation strategy for finding the remaining upstream points is designed to dramatically reduce the high computational cost for solving the nonlinear Cauchy problem without damage to the order of accuracy. Three benchmark problems are simulated to investigate the accuracy and the superiority of the proposed method. It turns out that the proposed method numerically has the q q th-order temporal and 4th-order spatial accuracies. In addition, the numerical experiments show that the proposed method is superior to the compared methods in the sense of the computational cost.},

However, the pyramid algorithm cannot replace wavelet transform algorithms, which obtain wavelet coefficients directly from signals. The barrier to implementing quantum versions of wavelet transforms has been the fact that the mapping from sampled signals to wavelet coefficients is not canonically represented with matrices. To solve this problem, we introduce new inner products and norms into the sequence space l 2 ( Z ) , based on wavelet sampling theory. We then show that wavelet transform algorithms using L 2 ( R ) inner product operations can be implemented in infinite matrix forms, directly mapping discrete function samples to wavelet coefficients. These infinite matrix operators are then converted into finite forms for computational implementation. Thus, via singular value decompositions of these finite matrices, our work allows implementation of the standard wavelet transform with a quantum circuit. Finally, we validate these wavelet matrix algorithms on MRAs involving spline and Coiflet wavelets, illustrating some of our theorems.},

The Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) consists of a methodology to compute RP RP quantifiers based on statistics over vertical/diagonal recurrent lines, densities, and other features of the RP. The traditional way to calculate the quantifiers computes each recurrent point individually and builds the histogram of the whole RP. Here we propose a new, statistical approach to calculate the quantifiers using the (recurrence) microstates, which are small representative chunks of the RP. The new way of statistically calculating the quantifiers converges fast and brings a computational gain. In particular, it reduces the time complexity from O ( K 2 ) O(K2) to O ( K ) O(K) , for K K the size of the time-series.

  abstract     = {Tacit knowledge is the knowledge existing in human brain which is not easy to be recorded or quantified, and often is learned in the face-to-face interactions. The tacit knowledge diffusion depends on the decision-making of tacit knowledge owners, and the expression of explicit knowledge carriers. However, the comprehensive influence of the tacit knowledge owners, explicit knowledge carriers and the relations of them were not attracted enough attention. In this paper, an algebra matrix method is used to integrate the multidimensional information of network structures and the nodes’ states. By the algebra matrix method, the diffusion threshold of the tacit knowledge is calculated, which is called algebra matrix evaluation. This evaluation method is proven to be effective by comparing with Monte Carlo simulations on three types of artificial networks and five reals. With applications of the algebra matrix evaluation, we construct a co-author network according the data of the academic papers from 1980 to 2017 on Aminer platform, and define states of tacit knowledge owners and the explicit knowledge carriers by the scholar’s career lengths and the paper’s cited quantities respectively. It is found that the thresholds of tacit knowledge diffusion are decreasing with the expansions of the scale of the largest connected components, whether tacit knowledge diffuses in the co-author networks or in the largest connected components. And with the evolution of cumulative co-author network, the diffusion thresholds of tacit knowledge in the largest connected component decrease in ladder-like with unequal steps. Furthermore, it is find ignoring the state factor will lead to the deviation in the evaluation of tacit knowledge diffusion thresholds, which is 16.33% in the largest connected components and 45.07% in the whole network.},

  abstract     = {Vegetation pattern provides useful signals for vegetation protection and can be identified as an early warning of desertification. In some arid or semi-arid regions, vegetation absorbs water through nonlocal interaction of roots. In this study, we present a vegetation model with nonlocal interaction which is characterized by an integral term with a kernel function. Mathematical analysis provides the conditions for the generation of stationary pattern. Numerical simulations exhibit different spatial distributions of vegetation. Densities of vegetation and water show an inverse relationship at same spatial locations due to water transport mechanism. The results reveal that the interaction intensity and the shape of the kernel function can cause the transition of vegetation pattern. Specifically, the vegetation biomass increases as the interaction intensity decreases or as the nonlocal interaction distance increases. We demonstrate that the nonlocal interactions between roots of vegetation is a key mechanism for the formation of vegetation pattern, which provides a theoretical basis for the preservation and restoration of vegetation.},

  abstract     = {It is now well known that the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal decay deviates from the classical mono-exponential relaxation. This deviation is referred to in the literature as anomalous relaxation. The modelling of this anomalous relaxation can provide a better understanding of MRI magnetization. The purpose of this work is to investigate the utility of the distributed-order time fractional Bloch equations to describe anomalous relaxation processes in human brain MRI data. Two choices of continuous distribution weight functions, which are parameterised by their mean μ μ and standard deviation σ σ , are studied to investigate their impact on the model solution behaviour. An implicit numerical method implemented on a graded mesh is proposed to solve the model and the stability and convergence analysis are presented. We also derive semi-analytical solutions of the fully coupled Bloch equations using the Laplace transform technique to assess the accuracy of the numerical scheme . Furthermore, three different voxel models of continuous distribution weight functions, namely a single continuous probability distribution (model 1), two distinct continuous probability distributions (model 2) and a mixture of two continuous probability distributions (model 3), are applied to the in vivo human brain MRI data, and a feasible and reliable parameter estimation method based on a modified hybrid Nelder-Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimization is presented to perform the voxel-level temporal fitting of the MRI data. The application of these distributed-order time fractional Bloch models highlights the validity of the proposed models, and based on the mean square error we conclude that models 2 and 3 might be more suitable than model 1 to characterize anomalous relaxation processes in human brain MRI data.},

This paper demonstrates the exact location of the source, which is the solution of l 1 l1 minimization for squared distance errors with three measurements. It also shows that the number of sources is less than 3, and the nonunique cases with two or three solutions are classified in detail and presented along with some examples. We considered four critical points and their related singular points in the measurement circles.

Especially, we consider the mixed strategy update rule, among which some agents adopt Q-learning method to update their strategies, the proportion of these agents (these agents are denoted as Artificial Intelligence (AI)) is controlled by a simple parameter ρ. The rest of other agents, the proportion is denoted by 1 − ρ, adopt the Fermi function to update their strategies. Through extensive numerical simulations, we found that the mixed strategy-update rule can facilitate cooperation compared with the pure Fermi- function-based update rule. Besides, if the proportion of AI is moderate, cooperators among the whole population exhibit conditional behavior and moody conditional behavior. However, if the whole population adopts the pure Fermi-function-based strategy update rule or the pure Q-learning-based strategy update rule, then cooperators among the whole population exhibit the hump-shaped conditional behavior. Our results provide a new insight to understand the evolution of cooperation from AI&#39;s view.},

By decomposing true image into cartoon part and texture part, we propose a fractional image denoising model with two-component regularization terms. Setting some appropriate parameters, the proposed model can deal with both smooth and non-smooth image denosing problems. The existence and uniqueness of solution for the variational model are proved.

Moreover, to deal with disturbances well, a reinforcement learning (RL) with the critic-actor-disturbance structure is introduced. Meanwhile, the weights of neural networks are adjusted online by applying the gradient descent method to positive functions newly constructed, which not only significantly simplifies the algorithm but also eliminates the persistent excitation condition. For obtaining a fast convergence rate, the finite-time control technique is embedded into the RL algorithm, and an effective finite-time optimal control scheme is proposed to achieve the consistency of multi-agent system in a finite time.

Because of the sparse multiscale representations of functions and operators by these wavelets, the CPU time and computer memory are reduced by the proposed algorithm. Also, the convergence analysis of the method is discussed.},

  abstract     = {We present monostatic sampling methods for limited-aperture scattering problems in two dimensions . The direct sampling method (DSM) is well known to provide a robust, stable, and fast numerical scheme for imaging inhomogeneities from multistatic measurements even with only one or two incident fields. However, in practical applications, monostatic measurements in limited-aperture configuration are frequently encountered. A monostatic sampling method (MSM) was studied in full-aperture configuration in recent literature. In this paper, we develop MSM in limited-aperture configuration and derive an asymptotic formula of the corresponding indicator function. Based on the asymptotic formula, we then analyze the imaging performance of the proposed method depending on the range of measurement directions and the geometric, material properties of inhomogeneities. Furthermore, we propose a modified numerical scheme with multi-frequency measurements that improve imaging performance, especially for small anomalies. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the analytical results.},

In this paper, we disprove the conjecture by constructing two families of counterexamples . Also, we present some cases for a hamiltonian digraph D D having w c → ( D ) = 2 wc→(D)=2 .

  abstract     = {In this paper, we extensively study the orthogonal spline collocation method known as the spline collocation at Gauss points with Rannacher’s time-marching scheme for free boundary value option pricing problems. Such financial problems commonly feature non-smooth payoff functions that cause inaccuracies in approximating the solution and its derivatives. As a result, unlike the problems with the smooth initial data, the quadratic convergence is not realized by the Crank-Nicolson time-stepping scheme for these problems. Furthermore, the non-smoothness in the initial condition leads to severe degradation in the convergence rates and spurious oscillations near the discontinuity. The rationale is that classical schemes strongly rely on the smoothness of the initial data. A rigorous time-marching scheme referred to as Rannacher time-stepping scheme is introduced for the American option’s price diagnosed by a linear complementarity problem to smoothen the data. Moreover, with careful analysis, second and fourth orders of convergence are established for the present scheme in temporal and spatial directions, respectively. The numerical results for three test problems are presented in tables and graphs to validate the theory. These results show that the present scheme achieves higher accuracy and sufficiently restores the expected behavior.},

The velocity-source coupling term is related to the transport of source which affects the accuracy of simulations of convection, chemical reaction and so on. The temperature-force coupling term is related to the inner product of force and temperature gradient which affects the accuracy of simulations of boundary layer and the edge of plumes in convection. We extended two new heuristic treatments to handle the adiabatic and isothermal boundary conditions. Their efficiency and accuracy are analyzed theoretically and proved by some numerical validations. Finally, we simulated natural convection flows with compression work and viscous dissipation over a wide range of Eckert number using the present model and obtained a scaling law between average Nusselt number and Eckert number.},

Then, to tackle the “differential explosion” problem caused by repeated derivative of virtual controllers, an innovative tracking differentiator (TD) technology is introduced into each step of design process to improve the tracking accuracy.

For this purpose, a novel inequality (which is referred to as Bessel-type inequality in s.i.p. spaces) is constructed by combining the Bessel inequality and a set of polynomials which is pairwise orthogonal in a s.i.p. space. The proposed inequality is more general than the conventional Jensen-type inequality, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the only inequality to deal with the problem of stability analysis for discrete-time systems with distributed delays up to now.

Firstly, disturbance observers are designed to obtain the disturbance estimations, and a dynamic coupling matrix is introduced to describe the coupling relationships between the UAH system and the slung-load system. Secondly, based on the proposed coupling matrix, a disturbance observer-based coordination control scheme is designed for the position system of the UAH and the slung-load one by using hierarchical sliding mode control. Thirdly, an improved controller is designed for the attitude system of the UAH by combining the backstepping control, disturbance observer, and dynamic surface control, in which the detrimental coupling is suppressed while the beneficial one is retained to improve control performance.

G. Bounds dim ( G ) ≤ L ( G ) + 2 c ( G ) dim(G)≤L(G)+2c(G) and edim ( G ) ≤ L ( G ) + 2 c ( G ) , edim(G)≤L(G)+2c(G), where c ( G ) c(G) is the cyclomatic number in G G and L ( G ) L(G) depends on the number of leaves in G G , are known to hold for cacti and it is conjectured that they hold for general graphs. In leafless graphs it holds that L ( G ) = 0 , L(G)=0, so for such graphs the conjectured upper bound becomes 2 c ( G ) . 2c(G). In this paper, we show that the bound 2 c ( G ) 2c(G) cannot be attained by leafless cacti, so the upper bound for such cacti decreases to 2 c ( G ) − 1 2c(G)−1 , and we characterize all extremal leafless cacti for the decreased bound. We conjecture that the decreased bound holds for all leafless graphs, i.e. graphs with minimum degree at least two. We support this conjecture by showing that it holds for all graphs with minimum degree at least three and that it is sufficient to show that it holds for all 2-connected graphs, and we also verify the conjecture for graphs of small order.},

The solvability, the unconditional stability and the convergence rates of second-order in time and fourth-order in space are rigorously proved for the fractional stress v v and the displacement u u , respectively, under a mild assumption on the loading f . f. Numerical experiments are given to verify the theoretic findings. One of the main contributions of this article is to evaluate the positive lower- and upper-bound of the eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix Λ Λ generated from the weighted Grünwald difference operator for fractional integral operators, and thus prove that the matrix Λ Λ is positive definite and can induce a norm in a vector space. This finding improves significantly the existing semi-positive definiteness theory of the matrix Λ Λ for fractional differential operators and facilitates the proof of the stability and convergence for the stress v v .},

On the other hand, leader-following quasi-synchronization, the reference trajectory is designed in advance and the corresponding distributed controller is developed to make the synchronization errors still tending to the bounded set.

This is in contrast to the conventional method where the optimal solution is based on unobserved quantities which are estimated. We also obtain the expressions for the weights of the global minimum VaR (GMVaR) and global minimum CVaR (GMCVaR) portfolios, and specify conditions for their existence. It is shown that these portfolios may not exist if the level used for the VaR or CVaR computation are too low. By using simulation and real market data, we compare the new Bayesian approach to the conventional plug-in method by studying the accuracy of the GMVaR portfolio and by analysing the estimated efficient frontiers. It is concluded that the Bayesian approach outperforms the conventional one, in particular at predicting the out-of-sample VaR.},

The singularities in the singular part are analytically eliminated by the direct method of the concept of the finite part of an integral (Hadamard principal integral), while the singular integrals in the regular part are solved by the convenient Gaussian integration. Due to the increase of the dimension and the additional causality relevant function, the 3D TD-BEM formulation is further more intricate than the 2D one. In order to reduce the complexity, in the process of the solution of the boundary integral equation in the 3D TD-BEM formulation, a new coordinate transformation method is proposed to analytically transform the coefficient integrals on the spatial surface element into the 2D plane element.

Based on the partition of state space with different operating regions, the objective of this paper is to design a mode-dependent and region-dependent filter such that the filtering error system is finite-time bounded and satisfies an l 2 − l ∞ l2−l∞ performance. By resorting to Lyapunov stability theory and finite-time analysis theory, some sufficient conditions are proposed to obtain such a desired filter.

To overcome this difficulty, the unmeasurable interconnection terms are estimated within the data-driven framework firstly. Then, a residual generator is designed in terms of the input and output data. Moreover, considered the freedom degree in design of the residual generator, an H − / H ∞ H−/H∞ mixed optimization scheme is proposed to enhance the sensitivity to the actuator faults as well as the robustness against the measurement noises. Based on it, actuator faults with smaller magnitude can be detected. Also, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed FD approach are verified by a numerical example .},

For the sake of reducing the communication resources and actuator actions, an event-triggered control technique is presented to adjust the control inputs based on the proposed FTC strategy. To ensure the system is free from Zeno phenomenon, a bound on the inter-event execution time is established. On the basis of the event-trigger condition, the uniformly bounded stability results of the adaptive FTC system are obtained by utilizing Lyapunov stability theory in the presence of actuator failures and perturbations.

As a first attempt, we develop the Störmer–Verlet type of schemes based on the SHF, which are structure-preserving for deterministic Hamiltonian systems without external forces, the dissipative forces in DPD. Long-time behaviour of the schemes is shown numerically by studying the damped Kubo oscillator. In particular, the proposed schemes include the conventional Groot–Warren’s modified velocity-Verlet method and a modified version of Gibson–Chen–Chynoweth as special cases. The schemes are applied to DPD simulations and analysed numerically.},

  abstract     = {The computation of C C -eigenvalues and their corresponding C C -eigenvectors of a given third-order piezoelectric-type tensor is generally difficult by its original definition. In this paper, we attempt to find a convenient pathway for this topic. To reach this goal, a series of steps is performed with the intention of using pioneering results on Z Z -eigenpairs. Firstly, a fourth-order symmetric tensor is constructed according to a given piezoelectric-type tensor. Secondly, we show the relationships between C C -eigenpairs of a piezoelectric-type tensor and Z Z -eigenpairs of the constructed fourth-order symmetric tensor. Finally, by computing all non-negative Z Z -eigenvalues of the constructed fourth-order symmetric tensor, we obtain all C C -eigenvalues of the piezoelectric-type tensor; and then their C C -eigenvectors can be got correspondingly. To validate efficiency of the method based on the foregoing three main steps, some numerical experiments are also presented. From the results obtained, it can be found that the method we proposed is valid.},

Besides, the impact of both unexpected disturbances and uncertainties in fuzzy semi-Markovian jump systems is considered. In particular, the nonlinearity in the addressed system is represented by the T-S fuzzy model, wherein the disturbances and uncertainties are estimated by precisely considering uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based control approach. Whilst, the desired fuzzy rule-based mode-dependent control law is formulated by exploiting the parallel distributed compensation strategy and estimated output of disturbances and uncertainties. In the proposed tracking control scheme, the resilient strategy is considered to overcome the impact of gain perturbations. Further, in terms of LMIs, a set of sufficient constraints is derived in accordance with the appropriate selection of mode-dependent fuzzy rule-based Lyapunov function. Under which, the asymptotic tracking and enhanced disturbance rejection performances are guaranteed for the system under consideration. Notably, the desired control gain matrices are determined by solving the derived sufficient conditions via MATLAB LMI toolbox. Conclusively, a single-link robot arm model is adopted to justify the practicability and efficacy of the theoretical findings.},

This assumes that there are no tests that are checking the same properties, i.e. that they are not correlated. One of the most commonly used measures to verify the interrelation between variables is the Pearson’s correlation. In this case, linear dependencies are checked, but it may be interesting to verify other types of non-linear relationships between variables. For this purpose, mutual information has recently been proposed, which measures how much information, on average, one random variable provides to another. In this work we analyze some well-known batteries by using correlation analysis and mutual information approaches.},

  abstract     = {Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular scheme for non-linear non-parametric learning. However, existing implementations of KRR require that all the data is stored in the main memory, which severely limits the use of KRR in contexts where data size far exceeds the memory size. Such applications are increasingly common in data mining , bioinformatics, and control. A powerful paradigm for computing on data sets that are too large for memory is the streaming model of computation , where we process one data sample at a time, discarding each sample before moving on to the next one. In this paper, we propose StreaMRAK - a streaming version of KRR. StreaMRAK improves on existing KRR schemes by dividing the problem into several levels of resolution, which allows continual refinement to the predictions. The algorithm reduces the memory requirement by continuously and efficiently integrating new samples into the training model. With a novel sub-sampling scheme, StreaMRAK reduces memory and computational complexities by creating a sketch of the original data, where the sub-sampling density is adapted to the bandwidth of the kernel and the local dimensionality of the data. We present a showcase study on two synthetic problems and the prediction of the trajectory of a double pendulum. The results show that the proposed algorithm is fast and accurate.},

The study considers the nanofluid injection process through porous beds. The combined effects of ion diffusivity and injected nanofluid velocity on EDL (Electric double layer) thickness are analytically expressed. The differential transform method (DTM) is used to solve the flow equations. The DTM solution is then compared with the exact analytical solution of velocity, Zeta potential function and a square averaged residual analysis is conducted. These comparisons show excellent matching. We observe that the enhancement of ion diffusion coefficient increases nanofluid velocity at the edge of EDL but diminishes with intrinsic couple stress. The bulk nanofluid flow rate is found to follow a quadratic like relationship with the couple stress parameter. We have investigated the nanofluid temperature and nanoparticle concentration distribution in microchannel for variations of the diffusive Reynolds number, porous permeability parameter and couple stress parameter. The nanofluid temperature is found to increase with an enhancement of ion diffusion coefficient, which is related with experimental results observed by Kong et al. (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 19 (2017) 7678) for NaCl electrolyte solution confined in a graphene nanochannel. Moreover, the nanofluid temperature decreases with enhancement of both porous permeability of the medium and couple stress parameter.},

One consequence is that any bounded nondegenerate behaviours which can occur in a CRN can occur in a CRN with bounded stoichiometric classes. The main result adds to a family of theorems which tell us which enlargements of a CRN preserve its capacity for nontrivial dynamical behaviours. It generalises some earlier claims, and complements similar claims involving the addition of reactions into CRNs. The result gives us information on how ignoring some chemical species, as is common in biochemical modelling, might affect the allowed dynamics in differential equation models of CRNs. We demonstrate the scope and limitations of the main theorem via several examples. These illustrate how we can use the main theorem to predict multistationarity and oscillation in CRNs enlarged with additional species; but also how the enlargements can introduce new behaviours such as additional periodic orbits and new bifurcations.},

  abstract     = {In game theory, it is an essential topic to study the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behavior in groups based on the theories of evolutionary game and complex network. Unfortunately, an in-depth analysis of cooperative behavior on maintenance and development is usually challenged by the diversity of groups in society, which is mainly caused by the single mechanism in traditional networks. More recent studies have shown that multi-layer coupled network based evolutionary game theory is promising in exploiting the transmission of cooperative behavior between individuals in the game. Meanwhile, inspired by the decisive ability of reinforcement learning in overcoming the limitation of replica, in this work, we propose to combine the game strategy of reinforcement learning with the traditional prisoner’s dilemma strategy based on multiple coupled networks. The most advantage of this model is the improved capability of intelligent decision making for group behaviors. With the simulation of game evolution, the influence of individual strategy change, as well as individual ability on cooperative behavior in reinforcement learning, is also explored. Substantial validations have verified that in social dilemmas, the cooperative behavior can be maintained by adjusting the group’s ability with effective guidance.},

The interpolation scheme is completely local. Each spline segment is defined as a PH biarc curve of degree 7, which results in having a closed form solution of the G 2 G2 interpolation equations depending on four free parameters. By fixing two of them to zero, it is proven that the length constraint can be satisfied for any data and any chosen ratio between the two boundary tangents. Length interpolation equation reduces to one algebraic equation with four solutions in general. To select the best one, the value of the bending energy is observed. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the obtained theoretical results and to numerically confirm that the approximation order is 5.},

Firstly, the differential mean-value theorem (MVT) is applicable to deal with the nonaffine function in systems and the control input signals were successfully decoupled. Then, by using backstepping technique and the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), a novel finite-time ETFTC scheme is effectively rendered. Furthermore, the newly designed fault-tolerant controller compensates for actuator faults, the trigger mechanism improves the transmission efficiency of the input signals, and the ETFTC scheme guarantees that all closed-loop signals are bounded.

This scheme is a nested iterative algorithm with an outer loop calculating the pricing model in a game and an inner loop solving the robust optimization problem. Specifically, in the outer loop, all stakeholders in a grid-connected microgrid cluster (MGC), i.e. one energy trading center (ETC) and several MGs, are in a game where a genetic-priced model is developed. By utilizing this evolutionary pricing model, the ETC can fix electricity prices to maximize its profits and these prices are passed to the inner loop where a two-stage robust optimization approach is introduced to mitigate adverse effects of uncertainties in MGs induced by renewable energy resources (RERs) and loads. All optimization problems of MGs are solved and optimal values of electricity exchanged between ETC and MGs are passed to the outer loop. This optimization scheme can help address the robust economic dispatch problem in a game-theoretic framework. A grid-connected MGC is used as a case to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization scheme.},

  abstract     = {The control of heat transfer in the hydromagnetic semiconductor crystal involves Marangoni convection with buoyancy forces. In this study, the conventional thermo-solutal Marangoni mixed flow model is modified by incorporating the solutal buoyancy effects that are significant in the flow phenomenon. The heat and mass transfer (HMT) characteristics of the Marangoni convective flow of a Cu − H 2 O nanofluid subjected to the assisting/resisting buoyancy forces and cross-diffusion are numerically studied. The homogeneous single-phase nanoliquid model is used in conjunction with experimental data of dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity. The Dufour and Soret effects are considered. Governing equations are solved using the finite difference-based algorithm. The problem is analyzed in a unified way considering the cases of buoyancy-assisted flow and buoyancy-opposed flow. The response surface methodology (RSM) based on the face-centered composite design (CCD) is used to optimize the heat and mass transfer rates. A multivariate regression model is proposed and authenticated prior to optimization. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed using the full quadratic regression model. The increase in the temperature profile is more significant due to the radiative heat flux than the inclined magnetic field. Heat transfer has a high sensitivity to the appearance of thermal radiation, while mass transfer has a high sensitivity to the Soret effect. Simultaneous optimization of HMT rates is achieved with the high level of thermal radiation and low levels of the cross-diffusion aspects.},

  abstract     = {Conformity behavior is crucial in human social learning and we consider this effect on spatial public goods game (SPGG). Two types of agents and two corresponding social learning rules are introduced in SPGG. One is link-type agents based on the rational conformity learning rule, whose strategies are independent in different groups. The other is node-type agents based on the Fermi learning rule, whose strategies are the same in different groups. Rational conformity behavior signifies that conformity only occurs when individuals are unsatisfied with their payoffs. Through simulation experiments, we find that cooperation can be induced constantly with a large proportion of link-type agents, in which situation rational conformity behavior in social learning is conducive to the emergence of cooperation. We further find that the independent strategies of link-type agents favor reciprocity to be enhanced among cooperative groups and the extended imitation range is beneficial to distinguish cooperative groups which also improves cooperation. Moreover, an appropriate payoff threshold is favorable to induce a positive correlation between payoffs and contributions, and thus a more reasonable distribution of payoffs and strategies. Meanwhile, the payoff threshold in the rational conformity learning rule is also contributed to diminishing the spread of defective behavior for those defectors with outstandingly high payoffs. These results expand our comprehension of individuals’ conformity behavior in social learning and its effect on cooperation in social dilemmas.},

The color-class digraph C C ( D ) CC(D) of D D is the digraph whose vertices are the colors represented in the arcs of D D and ( i , j ) ∈ A ( C C ( D ) ) (i,j)∈A(CC(D)) if and only if there exist two arcs, namely ( u , v ) (u,v) and ( v , w ) (v,w) in D D , such that ( u , v ) (u,v) has color i i and ( v , w ) (v,w) has color j j . Since not every H H -colored digraph has an H H -kernel and V ( C C ( D ) ) = V ( H ) V(CC(D))=V(H) , the natural question is: what structural properties of C C ( D ) CC(D) , with respect to the H H -coloring, imply that D D has an H H -kernel? In this paper we investigate the problem of the existence of an H H -kernel by means of a partition ξ ξ of V ( H ) V(H) and a partition { ξ 1 ξ1 , ξ 2 ξ2 } of ξ ξ . We establish conditions on the directed cycles and the directed paths of the digraph D D , with respect to the partition { ξ 1 ξ1 , ξ 2 ξ2 }. In particular we pay attention to some substructures produced by the partitions ξ ξ and { ξ 1 ξ1 , ξ 2 ξ2 }, namely ( ξ 1 , ξ , ξ 2 ) − H (ξ1,ξ,ξ2)−H -subdivisions of C 3 → C3→ and ( ξ 1 , ξ , ξ 2 ) − H (ξ1,ξ,ξ2)−H -subdivisions of P 3 → P3→ . We give some examples which show that each hypothesis in the main result is tight.},

  abstract     = {The direct current(DC) multi-microgrid(MMG) with island operation mode is a system formed by interconnecting DC multiple microgrids, which is more complicated than a single microgrid. First of all, this paper proposes the modeling method of the power regulation cost for each controllable unit to guide their power regulation order, which reduces the power regulation cost. Second, the hierarchical control strategy is proposed. The top-level control allocates power through the consensus algorithm to accelerate the convergence rate of the state of charge(SoC) of energy storage batteries(ESBs). The convergence of SoC reduces the switching times of working mode of MMG system caused by the deviation of SoC from the normal working range, which further reduces the cost of power regulation. The bottom-level control performs constant power control on each controllable unit according to the load rate of ESB obtained by top-level control. Furthermore, the correction scheme of measured SoC value is proposed according to its predicted value when the measured SoC value of ESB is inaccurate, which ensures the stability of MMG system. Finally, the example simulation shows that the consensus algorithm can effectively solve the real-time power distribution problem of MMG.},

Secondly, a hybrid feedback controller is designed, some conditions are derived to stabilize DQVCNNs with saturated impulse in finite time by the idea of polytopic representation and sector nonlinearity model, respectively. Furthermore, this paper shows the settling-time of DQVCNNs with saturated impulse, which discloses it related to both impulse and initial state.

The equivalence of problem transformation is demonstrated meanwhile the upper bound of cost function of overall interconnected system is analyzed. Subsequently, for the isolated auxiliary subsystem, a dynamic event-triggered adaptive dynamic programming (DET-ADP) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal control policy, which can remove the restriction of initial admissible control, eliminate the actor network, and save more communication resources. Furthermore, we prove that the closed-loop auxiliary subsystems are ensured to be uniform ultimate bounded based on Lyapunov approach.

Due to actual physical constraint, the effect of actuator saturation is taken into account in the controller design . Unlike the existing works where the communication environment is secure, DoS attacks are explored in the communication channel connecting master and slave MNNs. Based on the above considerations, an observer-based control approach is developed to estimate the MNNs states and guarantee the MNNs synchronization in the presences of DoS attacks and actuator saturation. By using the Lyapunov method and stochastic analysis technique, the sufficient synchronization conditions are derived via a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Meanwhile, the attraction domain of error system is estimated to satisfy the demand of actuator saturation. Then, numerical simulation is used to manifest the validity of our theoretical results. Finally, the proposed synchronization theory is applied to image encryption. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented image encryption scheme has a reliable performance.},

In [1, 2] a finite difference boundary treatment method is proposed for Runge-Kutta methods of hyperbolic conservation laws. The method combines an inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure and a WENO type extrapolation to achieve desired accuracy and stability. In this paper, we further develop the boundary treatment method for high-order linear multistep methods (LMMs) of hyperbolic conservation laws. We test the method through both 1D and 2D benchmark numerical examples for two third-order LMMs, one with a constant time step and the other with a variable time step. Numerical examples show expected high order accuracy and excellent stability. In addition, the approach in [3] may be adopted to deal with an exceptional case where eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian matrix change signs at the boundary. These results demonstrate that the combined boundary treatment method works very well for LMMs of hyperbolic conservation laws.},

It has been hypothesized that a specific arrhythmogenic mechanism, known as rotor, is the main driver sustaining the AF. Thus, the ablation of rotors has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to terminate the arrhythmia. Nonetheless, such strategy poses a problem related with the characterization of the rotor propagating activity. This work addresses the rotor characterization by means of a fractional generalization of the entropy concept. By adopting complex order derivative operators, we endorse the definition of information content. The derived metric is used to study the AF propagation dynamics in computational models. The results evince that the fractional entropy approach yields a better spatio-temporal characterization of rotor dynamics than the conventional entropy analysis, under a wide range of simulated fibrillation conditions.},

Numerical solutions are also provided based on the finite difference method . The process through which the velocity and flow rate attain a steady state is related to the governing groups, including the fractional calculus parameter α α , slip coefficient L L , Deborah number D e De , normalized electrokinetic width K K and ratio Π Π of the pressure to electroosmotic driving forces . Results show that an increase in α α , D e De , L L or Π Π increases the time required to reach a steady state. The steady flow rate depends on L L and K K but is independent of α α and D e De . For the same slip coefficient, increases in α α , D e De or K K increase the slip velocity at the wall.},

The key idea is to relate the oscillatory fluxes, including the convective ones, to the normal monotonic diffusive flux thanks to a technique used in the Scharfetter-Gummel discretizations . Then, we obtain a nonlinear two-point-like scheme with positive coefficients on primal and dual meshes. We check that the structure of the scheme naturally ensures the nonnegativity of the approximate solutions . We also establish energy estimates, which leads to a proof of existence of the numerical solutions. This analytical study is accompanied with a series of numerical results and simulations. They highlight the fulfillment of the discrete maximum principle, the optimal accuracy of our scheme, and its robustness with respect to the mesh and to high ratios of anisotropy.},

However, the positive role of altruistic punishment in enhancing cooperation will be undermined if corruption is considered. Recently, behavioral experiments have confirmed this finding and further investigated the effects of the leader’s punitive power and the economic potential. Nevertheless, there are relatively few studies focusing on how these factors affect the evolution of cooperation from a theoretical perspective. Here, we combine institutional punishment public goods games with bribery games to investigate the effects of the above factors on the evolution of cooperation. Theoretical and numerical results reveal that the existence of corruption will reduce the level of cooperation when cooperators are more inclined to provide bribes. In addition, we demonstrate that stronger leader and richer economic potential are both important to enhance cooperation. In particular, when defectors are more inclined to provide bribes, stronger leaders can sustain the contributions of public goods from cooperators if the economic potential is weak.},

The linear analysis is performed using normal mode technique and nonlinear analysis is developed using energy technique. The Chebyshev pseudo-spectral technique is performed to analyze the effect of variable gravity field and throughflow on the behavior of system stability. The results obtained from linear and nonlinear analysis are compared and found that the results are in better agreement for the heated from below and salted from above system however, the comparatively less agreement is obtained for the system when both heating and salting are done from below. The direction of throughflow and gravity field have considerable effect on the stability of system. The behavior of gravity field is invariant for both the type of system heating and salting from below as well as heating from below and salting from above. The solute Rayleigh number stabilizes the system for heating from below and salting from below, however, destabilizes the system for heating from below and salting from above. In the absence of gravity field, a comparatively good agreement between thresholds is seen for Q = 0, however, the agreement is shifted towards positive value of Q or negative value of Q when gravity is found to be present in the system. Thus, effect of gravity field is dominant on the influences of throughflow on the stability of system.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the catch of fishery resources in South Korea has fallen more than 40%, from 1.73 million tons in 1986 to 1.01 million tons in 2018. In particular, the amount of chub mackerel, one of the most favored fish species by South Koreans, caught in 2017 was 103,870 tons, which was only 25% of the total catch, compared with 415,003 tons in 1996. The total allowable catch system and the closed season are currently in place as a countermeasure to the continued decline in fishery resources; however, their effectiveness is questionable. Our study aims to maximize fishing profits by controlling the monthly fishing effort while maintaining the amount of chub mackerel. Discrete age-structured mathematical model was established with an optimal harvest control system. Density-dependent mortality was applied at the juvenile stage to reflect fish mortality because it is highly dependent on population density in the underage phase. The conditions of the parameters guaranteeing the existence of optimal harvest strategies were demonstrated and obtained using Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle. We compared an optimal harvest strategies and the actual harvest strategies of fishing effort from July 2010 to June 2020. In addition, we compared the profit and biomass of the optimal harvest strategies when designating one month in a year as closed season. We also conducted sensitivity analysis by varying the price of chub mackerel and cost of fishing effort. As a result, the optimal harvest strategies are to have the highest amount of fishing effort from August to September and gradually reduce the amount of effort. The optimal harvest strategies could improve the maximum economic yield and the maximum sustainable yield by 11.9% and 10.9%, respectively, over the observed strategy. To the best of our knowledge, forecasting analysis of the maximum economic yield and closed season conducted based on optimal harvest control system for Chub mackerel in South Korea. The appropriate allocation of monthly fishing effort can increase sustainable catch and profit. In addition, it is better to implement a closed season in July to maximize the profit of fishing and in June to the resource recovery.},

The mixed delays involve both the infinitely distributed delay and the time-varying delay without requiring the upper bound, which has a distinction in existing conclusions and makes the model be more comprehensive. An event-triggered mechanism (ETM) with mode dependence is adopted to determine the appropriate updating instants of measurement outputs so as to alleviate the transmission of signals. By constructing a novel time-varying L-K functional with a general convergency rate and employing several analysis techniques, a sufficient criterion is obtained for ensuring the stochastic μ μ -stability performance of error system, which is a more general stability performance including exponential stability, power stability as well as logarithmic stability as its special cases.

  abstract     = {The probabilistic reachability problem, which involves the computation of probabilistic reachable sets, is studied for nondeterministic systems. In the existing works, the system evolution initialized from the probabilistic reachable set is required to reach the target set with a certain probability in a given time horizon. In this paper, the definition of probabilistic reachable sets is refined by taking into account time-varying target set and obstacle. In the context of this definition, the evolution of the system is required not only to reach the target set but also to avoid obstacle. We address two distinct interpretations of probabilistic reachability problem via dynamic planning. In the first case, the control policy is given. In the second case, the control policy is a parameter to be optimized. A numerical method is proposed to compute probabilistic reachable sets. First, a scalar function in the state space is constructed by backward recursion and grid interpolation, and then the probabilistic reachable set is represented as a nonzero upper level set of this scalar function. In addition, based on the constructed scalar function, the optimal control policy can be designed. Two examples are provided at the end of this article. The first example consists of a one-dimensional problem where the analytical solution is compared with the results of the proposed method in order to analyze the computational accuracy . The second example, which contains a three-dimensional problem, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

One benefit of the method is that one wave propagation direction can be taken as an evolution direction, and one then can discretize it using a classical scheme like backward Euler method . Consequently, one obtains a set of quasi-gas-dynamic (QGD) models with possibly different heterogeneous permeability fields. For coarse discretization , we employ constraint energy minimization generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) to perform spatial model reduction. The resulting system can be solved by combining the central difference in time evolution. Due to the variable media, we apply the technique of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to further the dimension of the problem and solve the corresponding model problem in the POD space instead of in the whole multiscale space spanned by all possible multiscale basis functions. We prove the stability of the full discretization scheme and give the convergence analysis of the proposed approximation scheme. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The key to this method is that the right-hand term of the original integral equation is reconstructed by the GPR model to obtain a new integral equation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). We present an analytical approximate solution of the new equation and prove that it converges to the exact minimal-norm solution of the original equation under the L2-norm. Especially, for the degenerate kernel equation, we obtain an explicit formula of the exact minimal-norm solution.

  abstract     = {Investigation of the asymptotic properties of solutions to systems of discrete equations is a topic of permanent interest. Numerous papers analyze the so-called prescribed behaviour of solutions giving sufficient conditions for the existence of at least one solution having a given asymptotic behaviour. To a smaller extent the problem is considered of determining the initial data generating such solutions. The present paper finds its niche being concerned with the case of a triangular system of linear discrete equations. The existence of solutions with a prescribed asymptotic behaviour is proved and algorithms suggested for computing stepwise the initial data defining such solutions and eventually suggesting these. Illustrative examples (supported with a MATLAB program) are considered and some open problems are formulated as well.},

  abstract     = {A Filippov crop-pest-natural enemy ecological system with threshold switching surface related to the pest control is developed, which has been completely analyzed by employing the qualitative techniques of non-smooth dynamical systems. The main results reveal that the proposed switching model can have multiple pseudo-equilibria in the sliding region, which result in rich bifurcations in the sliding region including saddle-node, Hopf, Bogdanov-Takens and Hopf-like boundary equilibrium bifurcations. Moreover, the pseudo-periodic solution (or pseudo-homoclinic loop) can be generated in the sliding region through a Hopf bifurcation (or a homoclinic bifurcation), which can collide with the tangential lines at the cusp singularities and finally disappears as parameter varies. This reveals that although the system can stabilize on the sliding region to achieve the purpose of pest control, there are complex dynamical behaviors and sliding bifurcations within the sliding region. Furthermore, as the threshold level varies, the model exhibits the interesting global sliding bifurcations including grazing bifurcation, buckling bifurcation, crossing bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation to a pseudo-saddle, period-halving bifurcation and chaotic dynamics. This implies that control outcomes are sensitive to the threshold level, and hence it is crucial to choose the threshold level to initiate control strategy.},

Furthermore, in connection to the first-order optimization methods, the discrete gradient of energy functional is assembled in a way that the gradient components are evaluated over all degrees of freedom all at once. The key ingredient is the vectorization of exact or approximate energy gradients over nodal patches. It leads to a time-efficient implementation at higher memory-cost.

It is assumed that all nonlinear functions of the vehicle dynamics are unknown and the velocity information of vehicles is immeasurable for feedback. Compared with existing distributed tracking results for UUVs, the primary contribution of this study is the development of a state-transformation-based adaptive observer using a time-varying scaling signal to achieve the output-feedback three-dimensional formation tracking in the presence of unknown nonlinearities and the underactuation constraint. Based on the state transformation, local adaptive observers using neural network approximators and their adaptive laws are designed to estimate local unmeasured velocities of UUV followers. By designing distributed nonlinear error functions and auxiliary stabilizing signals, local output-feedback tracking laws with triggering conditions are recursively constructed to ensure preselected formation performance while solving the underactuation problem of the UUV dynamics. It is shown that the formation tracking errors remain within pre-designable time-varying bounds and finally converge to a neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the suggested output-feedback formation tracking strategy.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in breast cancer risk assessment is to provide a patient with an easily interpretable perspective on her disease&#39;s situation. This paper proposes a new method for accessing breast cancer risk, called Hybrid High-order Type-2 Fuzzy Cognitive Map Improved Random Forest Classification (H-HT2 FCM IRFC, in which, by taking an exact analysis, the disease risk is qualitatively obtained in three modes, i.e., each optimistic, realistic and pessimistic. Using either FCM or high-order FCM does not make a favorable response in uncertain situations where applying type-2 fuzzy to obtain the weights of FCM will have much better answers. A hybrid version of high-order type-2 FCM, proposed in this work, enables us to assess the breast cancer risk in three modes of optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic. The proposed method has three levels; at the first level, patient profile, family history, and inherited factors are tested by high-order FCM. At the second level, by examining the mass characteristics obtained from the mammograms, the disease risk is achieved by hybrid high-order type-2 FCM in three modes of optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic. The position of the tumor&#39;s effect on breast cancer is obtained in the third level by the fuzzy method. Finally, an overall breast cancer risk is predicted by a new algorithm, called Improved Random Forest Classification, which results in superior performance. Compared with the existing methods, the accuracy of the results obtained from the proposed method is desirable. The three-mode assessment will help the patients and their physician (oncologist) run the best treatment. Finally, the proposed method is successfully tested on an actual medical dataset.},

  abstract     = {For the first time, the laminar jet in a free-stream flow around a corner with/without a moving wall condition (as it assists the flow) is studied theoretically. The corner may contract the streamlines or expand them depending on the angle of inclination. In the context of incompressibility, it is presented a composite non-similar transformation of the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in Cartesian space to approximately decipher the nature of the boundary layer flow over the entire physical domain; i.e. 0 ≤ x, y &lt; ∞. The transformed Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are then solved by an in-house MATLAB code, which employs an implicit algorithm of a tridiagonal form with quasi-linearization technique. For a stationary wall, as the negative angle of the corner meets Falkner-Skan (F-S) limitation and expands beyond, the predictive model starts to show a critical location, which reveals directly the flow separation point. This critical location moves toward the jet origin as the angle of inclination becomes more negative. Here, these locations are extracted as a function of the inclination parameter in order to manifest the suitability of a jet to delay boundary layer separation. A similar scenario also applies to the moving wall case. In this case, it was recorded that a moving wall condition delays separation for a considerable distance. It should be pointed out that up to date, there is no theoretical investigation on this specific flow geometry despite the many associated applications; and the limited available reports on an analogous flow geometry are those from the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and on a case by case basis. More specifically, the present geometry is quite similar to the flow passing the way down to the trailing edge of an airfoil, with a jet generator mechanism such as Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuator to delay flow separation on the backside of the airfoil. Here, by the use of the theoretical non-similarity concept empowered by some recent advancements (see Jafarimoghaddam, 2020 and Jafarimoghaddam, 2021), the fundamental problem of a jet discharged in the lower boundary of a freestream flow over a wedge is successfully solved. This theoretical breakthrough suggests promising avenues for the future design of airfoils with moving parts/flaps as an innovative step forward to enhance maneuverability of the flying objects.},

  abstract     = {A new model that describes a dynamic frictional contact between a viscoelastic body and an obstacle is investigated in this paper. We consider a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive law which involves a convex subdifferential inclusion term and thermal effects. The contact condition is modeled with unilateral constraint condition for a version of normal velocity. The boundary conditions that describe the contact, friction and heat flux are govern by the generalized Clarke multivalued subdifferential. We derive a coupled system of two nonlinear first order evolution inclusions problems, which consists of a parabolic variational-hemivariational inequality for the displacement and a hemivariational inequality of parabolic type for the temperature. Then, the unique weak solvability of the contact problem is obtained by virtue of a fixed point theorem and the surjectivity result of multivalued maps . Finally, we deliver a continuous dependence result on a coupled system when the data are subjected to perturbations.},

To realize the global and exponential consensus, a kind of effective distributed impulsive pinning control strategy is proposed. Adequate conditions are derived to assure the consensus by applying the average impulsive interval, the comparison principle with hybrid time-varying delays, and the method of parametric variation. Considering that the impulse could not only be beneficial but also be adverse to the final consensus, the positive and negative impulsive effects are studied in detail, respectively, and the larger ranges of impulsive effects are obtained. Correspondingly, by considering the impulsive effects in different situations, different convergence rates are accurately calculated. In addition, the validity of the control strategy proposed in this paper is verified based on the simulation examples.},

Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy strategy is used to deal with finite-time nonlinear problem. Firstly, the sufficient condition of finite-time boundedness for S-MJFSs is proposed by the derivation and transformation of matrix inequality.

Furthermore, finit-time passive controller is solved to guarantee the control requirements of uncertain S-MJFSs.

Different from those existing results of S-MJSs, the multi-objective control requirements need to be achieved. Firstly, both the T-S disturbance models and the corresponding disturbance observer (DO) are successively introduced to dynamically estimate those irregular disturbances. Secondly, by combining the saturated convex hull description with the designed event-triggered condition, an event-triggered anti-disturbance controller is designed to achieve effective monitoring of the augmented S-MJSs. Furthermore, not only the stochastic stability of closed-loop S-MJSs and disturbance estimation systems, but also the state/output constraints can be simultaneously guaranteed based on the designed asthenic infinitesimal generator optimization algorithm. Meanwhile, the dynamical tracking error is verified to converge to zero and the Zeno phenomenon can also be effectively avoided. Finally, simulation results for different types of disturbances are given to verify the meaning of the proposed algorithm.},

The non-Lipschitz conditions of linear growth condition and Hölder condition are considered in the time-varying disturbance and uncertainty. An important innovation is that the virtual controller is designed to be piecewise constant such that the usage of the command filter is avoided. In the process of designing the robust controller, a semi-synchronous event-triggered scheme is proposed to relieve the communication pressure in high-order systems. Thus, a switched controller without using average dwell time (ADT) is considered. The finite-time practical stability with the form of fast terminal sliding mode (TSM) is also obtained. Then, the Zeno behavior is excluded and a self-triggered scheme is further proposed to avoid the continuous monitoring of the event-triggered conditions. Compared with some existing command-filtered results, the design process is simplified and more suitable for networked systems. The effectiveness of the proposed theory is validated by the numerical simulation of a hypersonic vehicle.},

Second, a innovative Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) containing augmented non-integral and single-integral quadratic terms is put forward, which can inflect internal connections of multiple functional terms. Meanwhile, in order to handle the infinitesimal operators of LKF effectively, generalized free-weighting-matrix integral inequality (GFWMII) is chosen to cooperate with wirtinger-based inequality. As a consequence, less conservative criteria are obtained, which ensure that the considered system is asymptotically mean-square stable with a desired H∞ performance.

  abstract     = {The operation of insurance institution is often affected by random environment, potential opportunity cost of capital or inflation. Considering this phenomenon, this paper establishes a new Markovian environment compound binomial risk model with capital cost, abbreviated as RMCM model. The new RMCM model is a complex recursive model which is difficult to calculate. To calculate the results in many future periods at one time, it is necessary to design an algorithm that can greatly improve calculation efficiency. One of the aims of this study is to conduct an analysis of the recursive algorithm , divide and conquer strategy and other algorithm theories to, designs a new MCPRAM-algorithm that is able to solve the calculation of this kind of recursive model with high complexity, multiple cycles and multiple periods, significantly improving the practical application value of the actuarial model. Taking aviation accident insurance as an example, the measurement methods of actuarial quantity in the model are explained statistically, and the calculation algorithm of conditional ruin probability is elaborated in detail. The conditional ruin probabilities of 60 periods under different operating conditions and different environment states were obtained and then compared and analyzed. RMCM has a wide range of applications and is suitable for describing the insurance products with low premium, small compensation probability; large claim amount and one-off compensation in a random market environment. The RMCM model proposed in this paper clarifies the risk of insurance institutions, compares the calculation of seven groups of parameter data, and obtains better parameters to control the bankruptcy risk at about 5 % % in the next five years. Parameter data reference and MCPRAM-algorithm can be used to design and develop new insurance products in a random environment, and provide valuable decision support for the scientific operation and management of insurance institutions.},

The orb-web, having axial symmetry and fixed boundary, is described by a continuous pre-stressed membrane undergoing infinitesimal deformation. The impact of the prey is modeled by an in-plane pressure field, whose two spatial components constitute the unknowns of the inverse problem. A reconstruction algorithm for the impact region is proposed, which is essentially based on the determination of certain generalized Fourier coefficients of the loading terms starting from discrete in-plane dynamical measurements that mimic what the spider performs in nature. The results show that the information gathered by the spider positioned at the center of the web is sufficient for a precise localization of the prey, for different prey and orb-web characteristics. The simulations also show that the sensitivity of the reconstruction to errors on the data is significant only when the observation time is close to the theoretical minimum time.},

  abstract     = {This article is focused on studying the spatially extended reaction-diffusion system with a diagonal diffusion matrix in a bounded domain for a biophysically motivated excitable model. Diffusion induces spontaneous stationary patterns in the spatially extended homogeneous medium. We investigate the dynamics of the diffusively coupled network modulated by a Hindmarsh–Rose prototype model that describes the emergence of self-excited spiking activities with certain parameters and a constant injected stimulus. The linear stability analysis in this framework around the homogeneous steady states illustrates the emergence of stationary patterns. Turing domains are reported in the parameter space where Hopf bifurcation is determined. The bifurcation diagram helps us in understanding the transition mechanism in the spatial system. We have investigated the existence of Turing–Hopf bifurcation and established how Hopf and Turing curves divide the parameter space into three different dynamically significant regions. We have also studied the existence of Hopf bifurcation in the spatiotemporal system. Theoretically, the amplitude equations are derived by means of nonlinear multiple-scale analysis method and analyzed near the Hopf and Turing instabilities in the system. In particular, we observe asymptotic expressions for a wide range of various patterns (stationary, hexagonal, mixed-state) sustained by the spatial system. We obtain the explicit conditions to establish the structural transitions and stability of the diverse forms of these Turing patterns. These results reveal how the diffusive network evolves. To establish the results, the analytical derivations are demonstrated that are corroborated by numerical simulations of the corresponding diffusion induced system. Finally, we observe that the coupled excitable systems participate in a collective behavior that may contribute significantly to irregular neural dynamics associated with certain brain pathologies.},

Notice that as a general nonlinear system, its sub-systems may have no common equilibrium or no equilibriums, but their trajectories may still be kept near equilibriums. Motivated by this, practical stability of nonlinear systems is considered by employing the Lyapuov method. Practical stability criteria in forms of linear matrix inequalities are obtained, where improved integral inequalities are given to reduce the conservatism of the obtained results. Finally, the obtained results are applied to analyze two problems of load frequency control of a one-area networked power system with sampled input and flight control of a two-degree-freedom helicopter system. The advantage and effectiveness of our approach are shown by a comparison with the literature.},

In order to explore the toxin avoidance effects on pattern formation and selection, Turing bifurcation analysis and amplitude analysis are performed. The results of Turing analysis show that patterns can be formed when diffusion coefficient is less than a critical value. Amplitude equations are calculated and amplitude analysis show that stripe patterns, hexagon patterns and mixed patterns of stripes and hexagons can be theoretically predicted. Focusing on toxin avoidance coefficient (cross-diffusion coefficient) and diffusion coefficient of zooplankton, parameter space for pattern formation and selection is plotted. Numerical simulations on pattern formation are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis with five groups of parameters. With the increase of toxin avoidance effects, simulated patterns can be obtained as hexagons, mixed patterns of stripes and hexagons, stripes, mixed patterns of stripes and hexagons, and hexagons. Finally, taking stripe pattern as an example, simulated pattern is compared with predicted pattern. Simulation results are all consistent with theoretical analysis.},

Based on the temperature-dependent transformation thermotics, we first theoretically derive the material parameters of the diamond-shaped switchable thermal concentrators and cloaks in the transformed space, thus achieving the construction of the mathematical models of temperature-dependent switchable thermal concentrators and cloaks. Then, we further integrate the switchable thermal concentrating and cloaking functions described above into a single device to construct the path-dependent switchable devices, which can intelligently control the thermal concentrating and cloaking functions along different axes simultaneously as the temperature changes. Finally, the temperature-dependent properties of the switchable thermal concentrators, cloaks and path-dependent devices are validated numerically. The results show that the switchable thermal concentrators, cloaks, and path-dependent devices can perfectly realize the thermal concentrating, cloaking, and x x -directional concentrating and y y -directional cloaking functions at specific different temperature intervals, respectively. Once the specific temperature intervals have changed, the thermal bifunctions described above are turned off automatically. The temperature-dependent switchable properties can also be extended to other physical fields to design the intelligent multi-physical metadevices.},

We discretize the equation using the multiquadric trigonometric quasi-interpolation method in space and the Crank–Nicolson scheme in time. The quasi-interpolant is constructed through a linear combination of function values and node translations of a kernel function. It is very simple to compute since it doesn’t need to solve any linear system. We adopt two different approaches to approximate second order spatial derivatives and analyze the symmetric or anti-symmetric properties of differentiation matrices. Moreover, the convergence and conservation properties including the total mass and energy conservation laws are also investigated in detail. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The aim of this work is to enlarge the region of attraction (ROA) of the synchronous state for CNNs with input saturation. Unlike existing works, the Lyapunov functional in the proposed approach is constructed from a polynomial with respect to the piecewise-continuous delay. Moreover, the proposed Lyapunov functional is combined with looped-functionals to derive the sufficient condition. The synchronization criterion is formulated in terms of sum of squares (SOS) programs, which reduces the infinite-dimensional linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions to a finite number of SOS conditions. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.},

In fact, L ( K t ) L(Kt) is, to within switching equivalence, the unique maximal signed line graph having such a star complement. It follows that if t ∉ { 7 , 8 , 9 } t∉{7,8,9} then, to within switching equivalence, K t Kt is the unique maximal signed graph with T T as a foundation. We obtain analogous results for a signed unicyclic graph as a foundation, and then provide a classification of signed graphs with spectrum in [ − 2 , ∞ ) [−2,∞) . We note various consequences, and review cospectrality and strong regularity in signed graphs with least eigenvalue ≥ − 2 ≥−2 .},

  abstract     = {This work studies mainly the dissipative analysis issue of T-S fuzzy networked control systems (NCSs) with stochastic cyber-attacks (SCAs) and voluntary defense strategy (VDS), which has strong application background in the network information security field. Firstly, a novel time-delay-product relaxed condition (TDPRC) is introduced, which fully excavates time-varying delay (TVD) information in the established condition. Secondly, an improved boundary circulatory function (BLF) is developRed, which takes advantage of the characteristics of the sampling moments. Here, when t ∈ [ t k , t k + 1 ) t∈[tk,tk+1) , we only require Q d ( t ) Qd(t) to be an asymmetric matrix in V c ( x ( t ) ) Vc(x(t)) . Then, a novel criterion and the corresponding control algorithm are developed by using reciprocally convex matrix inequality (RCMI), proper integral inequalities, and the linear convex combination method (LCCM). Furthermore, a new quantized sample-data and VDS controller under SCAs is established, which can prove that T-S fuzzy NCSs under a better dissipative index are asymptotically stable (AS). Lastly, a numerical simulation of the dynamic equation of truck-trailer system to certify the theory’s feasibility and validity.},

This paper deals with the control of nonlinear Roesser systems by employing feedback strategies with multiple constraints on the input signal. The input constraints are slope restriction, quantization, and generalized nonlinearities related to actuator overflow. Modeling deficiencies are also handled with the generalized actuator nonlinearities in a robust fashion. Novel results for state and output feedback topologies are furnished. Local stability criteria are developed for both feedback topologies by considering intrinsic nonlinearity as one-sided Lipschitz and generalized nonlinearity in a bounded sector. To the best of our knowledge, the outcomes of present paper are novel for nonlinear Roesser discrete-time systems while considering such nested restrictions on input signal. The results are verified by applying the proposed method on different 2-D practical systems.},

Because of the two-part nanomaterials, the hybrid nanofluid has an efficient heat transfer approach which helps to increase the heat transport capacity of standard nanofluids. The flow, heat transport, and entropy of a high conductivity hybrid nanofluid and a stretching surface with velocity slip effects are investigated numerically in this study. The fluid model depicts understanding the thermodynamic efficiency of nanomaterials. The numerical framework for the hybrid nanofluid model is formed and similarity transformations are used to transform the PDEs into nonlinear ordinary differential equations. These equations are numerically calculated for different parameters in the computational tool MATLAB using the shooting (bvp4c) method. The most significant consequences of this investigation are the impacts of various physical flow parameters on the velocity, entropy and temperature profiles including the permeability parameter, velocity slip parameter, magnetic parameter, heat source-sink parameter, Biot number, volume fraction of nanoparticles, thermal radiation parameter, Brinkman number and temperature ratio parameter. For velocity, temperature, and entropy generation profiles, the magnetic parameter performs inversely. Moreover, the system&#39;s entropy generation profile is enriched with the incorporation of nanoparticles percentage by volume fraction of nanoparticles and Brinkman number.

For the translation and rotation subsystems of QUAV, the finite-time command filter can make the derivative of virtual control signals be quickly approximated, and the effect of filtered error is eliminated by constructing the fractional power error compensated mechanism. By synthesizing command filter technique and event-triggered mechanism into the framework of backstepping design procedure, the finite-time adaptive control strategy for a QUAV is proposed, which reduces the resource occupation and maintains the stability and performance. It is proved that the position and attitude tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood near the origin in a finite time . Finally, the availability and superiority of the proposed finite-time algorithm are verified by a comparative simulation.},

The main purpose of this note is to design a time-dependent switching signal assuring the global exponential stability of a desire limit cycle (which is selected from a set of attainable limit cycles). By constructing a discretized Lyapunov function and using the linear matrix inequalities technique, a set of conditions in the framework of dwell time are designed. For CTSASs, the performance indexes of the system in this neighborhood cannot be analyzed because most of the proposed controllers drive the system trajectory into a small enough neighborhood. Differently, the technique proposed in this note leads the CTSAS’s trajectory to the limit cycle so that the resulting conditions can consider the weighted H ∞ H∞ performance level of the system. More specifically, the design conditions can be applied to open-loop subsystems that are unstable. At last, a numerical example and a practical example are given to illustrate our method.},

For continuous-time systems, a system with a stable equilibrium, forced van der Pol system, and a system with a line of equilibria are discussed. For each system under investigation, the proposed FFT bifurcation diagrams are compared with the conventional bifurcation diagrams, showing some interesting information uncovered by the FFT bifurcation. For periodic trajectories, the FFT bifurcations show high power at the dominant frequency and harmonics. By doubling the periods, their dominant frequencies are halved, and more harmonics emerge in the studied frequency intervals. For the chaotic dynamics, the FFT bifurcation shows a wideband power spectrum. The FFT bifurcation shows interesting results in comparison to conventional bifurcation diagrams.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the preconditioned TBiCOR and TCORS methods are presented for solving the Sylvester tensor equation. A tensor Lanczos L L -Biorthogonalization algorithm (TLB) is derived for solving the Sylvester tensor equation. Two improved TLB methods are presented. One is the biconjugate L L -orthogonal residual algorithm in tensor form (TBiCOR), which implements the L U LU decomposition for the triangular coefficient matrix derived by the TLB method. The other is the conjugate L L -orthogonal residual squared algorithm in tensor form (TCORS), which introduces a square operator to the residual of the TBiCOR algorithm. A preconditioner based on the nearest Kronecker product is used to accelerate the TBiCOR and TCORS algorithms, and we obtain the preconditioned TBiCOR algorithm (PTBiCOR) and preconditioned TCORS algorithm (PTCORS). The proposed algorithms are proved to be convergent within finite steps of iteration without roundoff errors . Several examples illustrate that the preconditioned TBiCOR and TCORS algorithms present excellent convergence.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease with a high death rate, which has attracted worldwide attention. In this paper, we focus on the annual data of tuberculosis in the United States from 1988 to 2019. Firstly, we propose an S V E I T R SVEITR dynamical model with vaccination, fast and slow progression, incomplete treatment, and relapse. Mathematical analyses show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable (unstable) if R 0 ≤ 1 R0≤1 (if R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 ). There exists a unique endemic equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 . Next, we use the Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method to acquire the model’s optimal parameters. From R 0 = 1.3763 R0=1.3763 , tuberculosis will not be eliminated without control measures taken in the United States. Through partial rank correlation analysis, the most sensitive parameters to the basic reproduction number are found. Based on this, we take the actual epidemic situation of tuberculosis in the United States into considerations to get the required conditions for optimal control using Pontryagin’s maximum principle and cost-effectiveness analysis. Implementation of three public health measures: tuberculosis prevention and control education, timely treatment, and enhanced efficacy can reduce the prevalence of tuberculosis in the United States. But at present, it is challenging for us to achieve the goal of eliminating tuberculosis by 2030 as called for by WHO.},

  abstract     = {The propagation of a current-fed string in 3-dimensional space interacting with an external magnetic field is described by the system of coupled Konno–Oono equations. Present research deals with the formation of one, two, and three dimensional optimal sub-algebras of the system. Then invariants are decided by using the Killing form. Similarity reductions and their solutions are determined for each sub-algebra. For strong integrability of the system, conserved vectors are also attained by using Noether’s theorem. The novelty of analytical solutions can be demonstrated by the fact that in earlier studies, all researchers solved coupled Konno–Oono equations involving only two components of the water wave, but in this study, the authors solved its more general form. Some comments are also made to demonstrate that the results in this article are preferable to those in previous studies. To make the solutions physically meaningful, they are reinforced with numerical simulation. Periodic, single soliton, doubly bright, bright and dark multisolitons, asymptotic, travelling waves with dark soliton, progressive, highly progressive, and stationary solutions can be seen in the profiles. Such solutions can be beneficial in optical nonlinearity, electro-magnetics, and quantum fields.},

Then, a new event-triggered output-feedback controller (ETOFC) is established, which can guarantee that all states of the closed-loop system converge to the origin almost surely (a.s.).

Most of the existing work deal with a discrete V V or even a finite V V . Continuous minimax problems can be applied to engineering, finance, and other fields. Sainz in 2008 proposed a modal interval algorithm based on their semantic extensions to solve continuous minimax problems. We developed an improved algorithm using modal intervals to solve unconstrained continuous minimax problems. A new interval method is introduced by taking advantage of both the original minimax problem and its dual problem . After theoretical analysis of major issues, the new algorithm is implemented in the framework of uniform partition of the search domain. Various improvement techniques including more bisecting choices, sampling methods, and deletion conditions are applied to make the new method more powerful. Preliminary numerical results provide promising evidence of its effectiveness.},

In this paper, we present a novel gradient-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm and we apply it to restore CT images. The plugged denoiser is implemented as a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the gradient domain (and not on the image one, as in state-of-the-art works) and it induces an external prior onto the restoration model. We further consider a hybrid scheme which combines the gradient-based external denoiser with an internal one, obtained from the Total Variation functional. The proposed frameworks rely on the Half-Quadratic Splitting scheme and we prove a general fixed-point convergence theorem, under weak assumptions on both the denoisers. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed gradient-based approach in restoring blurred noisy CT images, both in simulated and real medical settings.

To solve such a problem, an adaptive output feedback control scheme which involves estimator, observer and controller design is proposed. A fully distributed estimator is constructed to estimate the position of the leader for each robot. Based on the estimated information, an adaptive observer-based output feedback controller is designed to realize consensus tracking. It is shown that the boundedness of all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system is guaranteed, and the consensus tracking error of the system converges to an adjustable neighborhood of zero by appropriately choosing design parameters.

Using this method, a one-dimensional statement of the problem was obtained. Limitations on parameters in the shell equations are indicated for which such problem transformation is possible.

Since the port-Hamiltonian system is square, the cross Gramian on the time interval [ T 1 , T 2 ] [T1,T2] can also be approximated by using the shifted Legendre polynomials. Then, the truncated singular value decomposition of the approximate finite-time cross Gramian is carried out to obtain the projection matrix .

A purely interpolation and collocation approach has been used in order to develop the method. A constructive approach has been applied in the development of the method to consider two off-step optimal points among an infinite number of possible choices in a two-step block corresponding to a generic interval of the form [ x n , x n + 2 ] .

Next, the matrix representation of the solution is written. Using this matrix form, the matrix representations of the partial derivatives, the matrix representations of the Volterra integral part and the matrix forms of the conditions are also constituted. All obtained matrix forms are substituted in the equation and its conditions. Using equally spaced collocation points in matrix forms of this equation and initial conditions, the equation is reduced to a system of algebraic equations . The solution of this system gives the coefficients of the assumed solution. Additionally, the error analysis for the method is presented. According to this, an upper bound of the errors is determined. Also, the error estimation is made with the help of the residual function . Moreover, the residual improvement technique is also applied. Then, all these procedures are then supported with the examples. The results obtained from these examples are clearly tabulated and graphed. An important aspect of this study is to compare the obtained results with the present method with other results in the literature.},

Specifically, linear stability analysis is applied to obtain the conditions of Hopf bifurcation and Turing instability. Then, by utilizing the central manifold reduction theory analysis, the amplitude equation near the critical point of Turing bifurcation is deduced to study the selection and stability of pattern formation.

By constructing a finite-time performance function (FTPF), the tracking errors converge to a predefined attenuation range within finite-time. By using tanh ( · ) tanh(·) function and mathematical transformation, the effect of input saturation is solved. The unmodeled dynamics and dynamic disturbances of the system are solved by means of measurable dynamic signals. Through the Young’s inequality and the properties of Gaussian function , the coupling problem between multi-agents and the system controller design problem in non-strict feedback form are successfully dealt with. Furthermore, a finite-time adaptive neural controller is designed based on command filter, which not only guarantees the finite-time stability of the system, but also makes the tracking errors reach a predefined bound in a finite-time. Stability analysis proves that the proposed method is feasible, and simulation verifies its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial testing makes it possible to test large systems effectively while maintaining certain coverage guarantees. At the same time, the construction of optimized covering arrays (CAs) with a large number of columns is a challenging task. Heuristic and Metaheuristic approaches often become inefficient when applied to large instances, as the computation of the quality for new moves or solutions during the search becomes too slow. Recently, the generation of covering perfect hash families (CPHFs) has led to vast improvements to the state of the art for many different instances of covering arrays. CPHFs can be considered a compact form of a specific family of covering arrays. Their compact representation makes it possible to apply heuristic methods for instances with a much larger number of columns. In this work, we adapt the ideas of the well-known In-Parameter-Order (IPO) strategy for covering array generation to efficiently construct CPHFs, and therefore implicitly covering arrays. We design a way to realize the concept of vertical extension steps in the context of CPHFs and discuss how a horizontal extension can be implemented in an efficient manner. Further, we develop a horizontal extension strategy for CPHFs with subspace restrictions that identifies candidate columns greedily based on conditional expectation . Then using a local optimization strategy, a candidate may be adjoined to the solution or may replace one of the existing columns. An extensive set of computational results yields many significant improvements on the sizes of the smallest known covering arrays.},

Different from those previous methods, the proposed online evaluation mechanism is dependent not only the current-time but also the past-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions , and thus much more information can be absorbed and utilized in the process of stabilization synthesis by introducing extra free matrices than before. More importantly, an additional constraint is for the first time proposed for updating the plant status instantly so that critical replacement operations can be implemented for reducing the conservativeness of the designing conditions. Therefore, the adaptability to uplink data loss is improved evidently and thus the worse communication quality of uplink channel is bearable in this study.

  abstract     = {A semilinear second-order system of m ( ≥ 2 ) m(≥2) reaction-diffusion equations is analyzed in a singularly-perturbed regime. In these equations, the right-hand side (source term) has a discontinuity at a point inside the domain, and the coefficient of the second-order derivative is a positive parameter. These parameters can be arbitrarily small and different in magnitude; this causes to form the boundary layers in the solution which may interact and overlap inside the domain. Due to discontinuity in the source term, the solution may also exhibit layers in the interior of the domain. The decomposition of the solution has been made to obtain sharper bounds on its derivatives. A higher-order finite difference scheme is constructed using an appropriate generalized Shishkin mesh and established that the computed solution is almost fourth-order parameter-uniform. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical findings.},

To deal with the time-varying delay, a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with the system powers is constructed. By using radial basis function neural networks and hyperbolic tangent function, the residual terms caused by the derivative of LKF can be handled. Then, to achieve better communication efficiency, a dynamic event-triggered strategy is proposed, in which the threshold parameter is dynamically adjusted with the change of the virtual control signal. With the help of the proposed adaptive controller, all states of the closed-loop system are bounded and a favorable tracking performance is ensured. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The studied nonlinear networked MASs are expressed by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. For each agent, the sensor sends measurements to the controller through a non-ideal wireless network that may be attacked. Due to the fact that system states are unmeasurable, a fuzzy observer design method is proposed to resist DoS attacks. Based on observer states, a novel resilient containment controller is designed to compensate for DoS attacks and achieve the states containment objective. The proposed controller design method can convert the nonconvex design condition into a convex one by using the rank decomposition method combined with DoS attacks effect. Finally, simulation is shown to testify the effectiveness of the designed fuzzy observer and containment controller.},

Analytical steady states solutions (both lake at rest and non vanishing velocity) are deduced an approximated with the proposed scheme.

A novel 9-point finite difference scheme is proposed for the discretization of the spatial derivatives and the fully implicit time-stepping scheme is used for the time discretization of the PDE systems. We show that the coefficient matrix of the fully discretized system is an M M -matrix and prove that the solution generated by this finite difference scheme converges to the exact one when the mesh sizes approach zero. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the mathematical model and numerical method , we present a case study on a real option pricing problem in the iron-ore mining industry.

The transitions occurred in this flow phenomena has a great relevance with the geophysical motions and has applications in hydrodynamic problems. In the present work, we numerically study different flow instabilities in a narrow-gap SCF between two concentric spheres with only inner sphere rotating and the outer sphere is fixed. The time dependent three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSEs) along with a parallelized line Gauss-Seidel(LGS) solver has been used for the simulation of different flow instabilities in a narrow-gap clearance ratios(CR), β = ( R 2 − R 1 ) / R 1 = 0.10 β=(R2−R1)/R1=0.10 . The flow instabilities have been investigated for a range of Reynolds numbers ( Re ) (Re) 170 ≤ Re ≤ 12000 170≤Re≤12000 . For this narrow-gap CR, first we obtain the 0-,1-,2-,3-, and 4-vortex flows at Re = 1430 , 1440 , 1460 , 1750 Re=1430,1440,1460,1750 and 1950 respectively by using the Stokes flow (SF) as an initial condition. Further increasing the Re Re using the same initial condition the flow becomes wavy, spiral wavy, then return back to supercritical basic flow and finally becomes turbulent at higher Re Re . The computed numerical results have a good agreement with the existing numerical and experimental results. Further more, we have noticed some new flow states which have not been observed in the previous numerical and experimental studies.},

The dimensionless fine modelled BVP is worked out by adopting Runge-Kutta fourth-order method integrated with the shooting technique. A comprehensive study on the influence of significant thermo-physical non-dimensional factors controlling dispersals of flow characteristics is conducted.

Since both shifted Gegenbauer polynomials and the input digital images are defined in the domain [0, 1] × [0, 1], the proposed FrQSGMs did not need any image mapping or image interpolation. The invariance to geometric transformations of the proposed FrQSGMs is derived by expressing these moments in geometric moment invariants of fractional order . We conduct various experiments to test the accuracy, invariance to RST, sensitivity to noise, recognition of similar color images, and computational times.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate projection-based intrusive and data-driven model order reduction in numerical simulation of rotating thermal shallow water equation (RTSWE) in parametric and non-parametric form. Discretization of the RTSWE in space with centered finite differences leads to Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential equations with linear and quadratic terms. The full-order model (FOM) is obtained by applying linearly implicit Kahan’s method in time. Applying proper orthogonal decomposition with Galerkin projection (POD-G), we construct the intrusive reduced-order model (ROM). We apply operator inference (OpInf) with re-projection as data-driven ROM. In the parametric case, we make use of the parameter dependency at the level of the PDE without interpolating between the reduced operators. The least-squares problem of the OpInf is regularized with the minimum norm solution. Both ROMs behave similarly and are able to accurately predict the in the test and training data and capture system behaviour in the prediction phase with several orders of magnitude in computational speed-up over the FOM. The preservation of system physics such as the conserved quantities of the RTSWE by both ROMs enable that the models fit better to data and stable solutions are obtained in long-term predictions which are robust to parameter changes.},

Based on the stability analysis, the critical values of the fractional order for which Hopf-type bifurcations may occur are detected. In this context, it is shown that oscillatory behavior due to a Hopf-type bifurcation (considering the fractional order as bifurcation parameter) is expected only in the case of an odd number of repressive genes. Numerical examples are given in order to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed results and to exemplify the effect of the fractional order on the dynamics of cyclic GRNs, additionally revealing that period-doubling bifurcations of limit cycles may also occur in sufficiently large cyclic GRNs.},

However, a challenge in measuring traffic parameters is the high probability of sensor failure, which results in missing measurement or missing data. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptive-R extended Kalman filter (AREKF) combined with a model-based data imputation technique to estimate traffic density. We show analytically that the AREKF is able to accurately estimate the density even when the noise covariance matrices are not accurately known. Microscopic traffic simulations demonstrated the efficacy of the AREKF, where the estimated density is fed into a real-time ramp metering control algorithm to control vehicle flow on a merging road, which is highly susceptible to traffic congestion. The results show that the proposed AREKF with data imputation is able to accurately estimate the traffic density even when data is missing, and the ramp-metering controller significantly improves the traffic flow and thus, alleviates congestion.},

  abstract     = {Switching strategy is generally accompanied by material cost or mental pressure to players in reality. An efficient solution is to hold the current strategy for a period time before the next updating. In evolutionary games, it has been reported that strategy persistence or strategy inertia could promote cooperation. There arises a question that how players determine the duration of their strategy persistence time, which is also called the persistence level. Here, we consider the evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma games in which players can adapt their persistence levels based on the comparison between the local and global environments. We assume that, the players who have better local environments tend to preserve their current strategies longer and increase the persistence levels. In contrast, those whose local environments are worse than the global environment tend to decrease their persistence levels. The results show that network reciprocity can get greatly enhanced by such an adaptive strategy persistence, especially in hostile environments to cooperation. Moreover, by comparing with the fixed and randomly adaptive persistence level cases, we emphasize the importance of the environment comparison in enlarging the persistence levels of cooperators, which could be further enhanced by a larger upper limit or a smaller increment of persistence level. Our results provide insights into the promotion of cooperation by the adaptive strategy persistence when players can perceive both the local and global environments in evolutionary games.},

  abstract     = {Dimension governs dynamical processes on networks. The social and technological networks which we encounter in everyday life span a wide range of dimensions, but studies of spreading on finite-dimensional networks are usually restricted to one or two dimensions . To facilitate investigation of the impact of dimension on spreading processes, we define a flexible higher-dimensional small world network model and characterize the dependence of its structural properties on dimension. Subsequently, we derive mean field, pair approximation, intertwined continuous Markov chain and probabilistic discrete Markov chain models of a COVID-19-inspired susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemic process with quarantine and isolation strategies, and for each model identify the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 , which determines whether an introduced infinitesimal level of infection in an initially susceptible population will shrink or grow. We apply these four continuous state models, together with discrete state Monte Carlo simulations, to analyse how spreading varies with model parameters. Both network properties and the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations vary substantially with dimension or rewiring rate, but predictions of continuous state models change only slightly. A different trend appears for epidemic model parameters: as these vary, the outcomes of Monte Carlo change less than those of continuous state methods. Furthermore, under a wide range of conditions, the four continuous state approximations present similar deviations from the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations. This bias is usually least when using the pair approximation model, varies only slightly with network size, and decreases with dimension or rewiring rate. Finally, we characterize the discrepancies between Monte Carlo and continuous state models by simultaneously considering network efficiency and network size.},

  abstract     = {We present an analytical theory for laminar forced convection condensation of saturated vapor on horizontal surfaces. The condensation produces shear-thinning film moving downstream due to the viscous-drag occurring at the vapor-liquid interface. The mathematical model is built based on a few input parameters, viz. power-law index ( n n ), nondimensional film-thickness ( η δ , l ηδ,l ), Prandtl number ( P r Pr ), and inertia number ( M c Mc ). A set of output parameters is used to analyze the distinct characteristics of the fluid-flow and condensation, viz. the condensate’s nondimensional mass flow rate ( m ^ m^ ), Nusselt number , specific enthalpy ratio ( R h Rh ), thermal retention coefficient ( Θ Θ ), and nondimensional wall-shear stress ( τ ^ w τ^w ). We have identified the subtlety of shear-thinning film flow when liquid’s thermophysical properties vary according to the changes in wall-shear and the interfacial drag. Contextually, we illustrate that a rise in shear-thinning effect (obtained by decreasing n n ), keeping M c Mc and η δ , l ηδ,l fixed, results in a decrease of m ^ m^ , R h Rh , τ ^ w τ^w , and ( 1 / Θ 1/Θ ). We have demonstrated that for a fixed R h Rh , a shear-thinning film, compared to the Newtonian film, would exhibit a greater η δ , l ηδ,l but a smaller interfacial velocity ( f i ′ fi′ ). Furthermore, a greater film thickness is required for low P r Pr liquids to attain the same degree of subcooling compared to high P r Pr liquids. We perform systematic investigation over a wide range of η δ , l ηδ,l . We observe that for small η δ , l ηδ,l values, the vapor boundary-layer moving onto the liquid-film exhibits similar flow-features as found in the well-known Blasius boundary-layer. Conversely, at large η δ , l ηδ,l , the present solution would remarkably differ from the Blasius solution . Finally, we establish an approximate theory for small η δ , l ηδ,l motivated by the linearity in the cross-stream variations of velocity and temperature within the thin-film. This approximate theory gives rise to analytical correlations for R h Rh , Θ Θ , τ ^ w τ^w , and m ^ m^ , which would be useful for engineers.},

The proposed procedure is based on domain decomposition and combines the Multiscale Perturbation Method (MPM) [Ali, et al., Appl. Math. and Comput. , 387 (2020) pp. 125023] with the Multiscale Robin Coupled Method (MRCM) [Guiraldello, et al., J. Comput. Phys. , 355 (2018) pp. 1-21]. When an update of the velocity field is called for by the operator splitting algorithm, the MPM-2P may provide, depending on the magnitude of a dimensionless algorithmic parameter, an accurate and computationally inexpensive approximation for the velocity field by reusing previously computed multiscale basis functions. Thus, a full update of all multiscale basis functions required by the MRCM for the construction of a new velocity field is avoided. There are two main steps in the formulation of the MPM-2P. Initially, for each subdomain one local boundary value problem with trivial Robin boundary conditions is solved (instead of a full set of multiscale basis functions, that would be required by the MRCM). Then, the solution of an inexpensive interface problem provides the velocity field on the skeleton of the decomposition of the domain. The resulting approximation for the velocity field is obtained by downscaling. We consider challenging two-phase flow problems, with high-contrast permeability fields and water-oil finger growth in homogeneous media. Our numerical experiments show that the use of the MPM-2P gives exceptional speed-up - almost 90% of reduction in computational cost - of two-phase flow simulations. Hundreds of MRCM solutions can be replaced by inexpensive MPM-2P solutions, and water breakthrough can be simulated with very few updates of the MRCM set of multiscale basis functions.},

Closed form solutions in terms of the standard Fresnel integrals are for the first time presented and they are valid for a wide family of clothoids; for the remaining cases, numerical methods of order four, based on Lie algebra , Magnus Expansions and Commutator-Free Expansions are provided. These geometric integrators have been optimised to be easily implemented with few lines of code and require only matrix-vector products (avoiding explicit matrix exponentials at each iteration). The achieved computational efficiency has a dramatic impact for several real-time applications, especially for designing trajectories for flying vehicles, as previous approaches were fully numeric and could not take advantage of the present closed form solutions, which render the computation of the 3D clothoid as computationally expensive as its planar companion.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a new method for solving linear neutral delay differential equations. We derive and illustrate the main features of this novel approach, that combines the Laplace transform method with (harmonic) Fourier series theory. Linear neutral delay differential equations are generally more difficult to solve because the time delay appears in the derivative of the state variable. We rely on computer algebra and numerical methods to implement the method. In addition, we derive an approximate formula for the location of the complex poles, which are required for computing the inverse Laplace transform. The form of the resulting solution, when only the Laplace method is used is a non-harmonic Fourier series. The accuracy of this solution can be improved by including more terms in the associated truncated series, but the convergence to the correct solution is slow. The main goal of this paper is to present a modified method which enables us to account for the terms which are excluded from these truncated Laplace series. That is, the terms in the tail of the infinite series . We include several examples where we compare the solutions generated by the standard Laplace method and the proposed Laplace-Fourier approach. Both solutions require using Cauchy’s residue theorem and finding the real and complex poles. It is shown that the Laplace-Fourier solution provides more accurate solutions than the conventional Laplace transform solution. Finally, since the Laplace-Fourier method generates a solution which is valid for all times, it allows us to accurately approximate the solution at any point with a single calculation.},

  abstract     = {In many arid or semi-arid regions of the world, a variety of vegetation patterns have been found and many dynamic mechanisms have been proposed including scale-dependent, climatic effects, grazing and so on. However, the influences of the interactions between nonlocal effects and root hydrotropism on vegetation patterns are not well understood. As a result, we develop a reaction-diffusion equation with nonlocal time delay and root hydrotropism to explain the interaction between vegetation and water in this paper. We prove the existence of global weak solution of the water-vegetation model and analyze the Turing instability to identify the criteria for the emergence of vegetation patterns. The obtained results suggest that root hydrotropism has dual effects on vegetation pattern: on one hand, an appropriate root hydrotropism intensity can increase the vegetation density; on the other hand, when the root hydrotropism intensity exceeds the threshold, the isolation between vegetation patterns will gradually increase as the root hydrotropism intensity continues to increase, and thus there will be no vegetation pattern and desertification appears in this area. The research results provide a new theoretical basis for preventing from desertification.},

By applying the Coulomb sliding friction law, the position is established at which slipping occurs during rolling down the surface, and thereafter this mechanical system ceases to be holonomic. Dynamic differential equations of motion are obtained using general theorems of mechanics. The paper presents the procedure of determining the tangential and normal component of the reaction of constraint depending on the height of the contact point between the ball and the surface. On the basis of the initial total mechanical energy of the system and the value of Coulomb friction coefficient , the condition is determined to prevent the ball from slipping, as well as the height interval in which the considered system behaves as a nonholonomic system. The procedure is illustrated by examples of surfaces generated by rotating segments of the circular arc, line and parabola .

Then, by constructing a novel augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), it is containing more hybrid features, in which concerning the practical sampling pattern, and using the convex combinatorial optimization and inequality technique, the stabilization condition is proposed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, the desired event-triggered sampled-data controller gains are obtained for the closed-loop Markovian jump QVNNs with partially unknown transition probability.

By means of the strong Lipschitz condition, which relates to the present state, the almost sure stability of UDDEs is successfully explored. In this paper, the normal Lipschitz conditions concerning both the present and the past states are proposed. In other words, if the UDDEs satisfy the strong Lipschitz condition, it must satisfy the normal Lipschitz conditions. Conversely, it may not be established. Based on the normal Lipschitz conditions, two theorems for the almost sure stability of UDDEs and their equivalence relations are proved.

Firstly, we give a construction of ( n , n , n − 1 , n − 1 , n − 2 ) (n,n,n−1,n−1,n−2) -BIBD based on finite set. It is important to estimate recovery performance of measurement matrices in terms of coherence, and it is found that the incidence matrix H H of ( n , n , n − 1 , n − 1 , n − 2 ) (n,n,n−1,n−1,n−2) -BIBD is not suitable as a measurement matrix in CS. We present an optimal method of combining vertical expansions and horizontal expansions for addressing this problem. These two extensions provide a new perspective for the construction of measurement matrices. Vertical expansions ensure that the matrix has low coherence. Horizontal expansions ensure that the matrix is more suitable as a measurement matrix in CS because of sizes and coherence. Finally, compared with several typical matrices, our matrices have better recovery performance under OMP and IST by the simulation experiments.},

Different from the traditional complex networks, the communication topology between nodes of the complex networks can be either collaborative or antagonistic. In addition, the appearance of impulses is always dependent on each node in the network instead of appearing at fixed instants. Furthermore, by utilizing the B-equivalent technique, the VTI network models can be changed as fixed-time impulsive CCNs. The fixed-time impulsively controlled CCNs can be regarded as the comparison systems of the signed CCNs with variable-time impulses. By 1-norm analytical techniques, several assumptions are derived to guarantee every solution of the coupled error nodes intersect each discontinuous impulsive surface exactly once. Some sufficient conditions with theoretical demonstration are presented to guarantee the bipartite synchronization under mathematical induction.

To be precise, the study delineates the description of curved domain wall motion in the steady-state dynamic regime for metallic and semiconductor ferromagnets. The study is done under the simultaneous action of the Rashba field and nonlinear dissipative effects described via the viscous-dry friction mechanism. By means of reductive perturbation technique and realistic assumption on the considered parameters, we establish an analytical expression of the steady domain wall velocity that depends on mean curvature of domain wall surfaces, nonlinear dissipation coefficients, Rashba parameter, external magnetic field, and spin-polarized electric current. In particular, it is observed that the domain wall velocity, mobility, threshold, and Walker breakdown can be manipulated by the combined mechanism of the Rashba field and nonlinear dissipation coefficients. Finally, the obtained analytical results are illustrated numerically for the curved domain walls through constant-curvature surfaces under-considered scenarios. The results presented herein are in qualitatively good agreement with the recent observations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, by constructing a selector that can identify the less-smooth sub-stencils, we have improved the classical WENO-JS and WENO-Z schemes, and developed two new WENO schemes which can adaptively increase the weight of less-smooth sub-stencils, WENO-IJS and WENO-IZ. Theoretical analysis shows that the present schemes maintain essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) property and have lower numerical dissipation at discontinuities. The investigation of approximate dispersion relation analysis (ADR) shows that the spectral characteristics of the present schemes are better than those of the classical WENO-JS, WENO-Z and WENO-Z+ schemes. A series of numerical experiments show that the shock wave capture capability and resolution of the complex process structure of the present schemes are significantly better than WENO-JS, WENO-Z and WENO-Z+.},

In the first part of this work, the convergence rates of Kaczmarz’s algorithm with a given default order and a random order are studied by using the abstract theorems for the convergence rate of linear operator sequences. It is proved that Kaczmarz’s algorithm always converges exponentially in both cases of the selected order, which is quite different from the slow behavior in practice, such as in image reconstruction. That means there is a remarkable gap between the theoretical rate and the actual rate. The second part of this work is to propose a new scheme with the reordered rays in each view to accelerate the practical Kaczmarz’s algorithm, i.e., the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) in image reconstruction. Numerical experiments show that our acceleration scheme has a better performance than the previous multilevel and random-order schemes in literature.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present an algebraic, graph theoretic and data-based image inpainting algorithm. The algorithm is applied to reconstruct area or volume from one-dimensional and two-dimensional slice data. Given one-dimensional or two-dimensional slice data, our algorithm first performs a simple algebraic presmoothing of the data, e.g., Gaussian filters . The second step is to obtain, from these smoothed data, an operator that reconstructs them via Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Dynamic Mode Decomposition is an equation-free modeler, which is designed to construct the discrete dynamical operator considering slice data as a time series data . We interpret the DMD as a solution to the inverse problem and apply an appropriate continuous extension of DMD to fill the missing time series data. The last step is to smooth the outcome from the second step using a Constraint Bilateral Smoother. The Constraint Bilateral Smoother is designed to smooth the boundary of area or volume, respecting the given slice data. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, in several test cases, which include an Magnetic Resonance Imaging of a two-year-old and a Computed Tomography scan of a Covid-19 patient. We also show that a couple of test results are better than those from some competitive alternative techniques up to 50%. Our tests also show that the inpainting computation time increases linearly as a function of the number of pixels or voxels with slope just around 0.5.},

In the computation, the equations with different coefficients and even dissimilar types are assigned in two subdomains, and Schwarz iteration is made between the equations when marching from a time step to the next one. The analysis starts with the algebraic systems resulting from the full discretization of the linear advection-diffusion-reaction equations by explicit schemes. Conditions for convergence are derived, and its speedup and the effects of difference in the equations are discussed. Then, it proceeds to an implicit scheme, and a recursive expression for convergence speed is derived. An optimized interface condition for the Schwarz iteration is presented, and it leads to “perfect convergence”, that is, convergence within two times of iteration. Furthermore, the methods and analyses are extended to the coupling of advection-diffusion-reaction equations with nonlinear advection or/and reaction terms. Numerical experiments indicate that the conclusions, such as the “perfect convergence”, drawn in the linear situations may remain in the nonlinear equations’ computation. It is observed that the slowdown of convergence associated with the optimized interface condition occurs when the diffusion coefficients in subdomains become different, even slightly.},

  abstract     = {Although a major effort has been made in the study of the coupled dynamics of disease and awareness spreading on multiplex networks, the full understanding of their dynamical interactions is still lacking. To address this issue, in this paper we investigate a simple model for the competition between disease and awareness processes in a homogeneous network with natural birth and death processes. We show that the natural death process has no impact on the competiting dynamics between the epidemic and awareness spreading processes, while the birth process exerts siginificant impacts on the model dynamical behavior. In particular, there exists a threshold value of the population birth rate that distinguishes the model dynamics from a simple susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics to a nontrivial, intriguing competing dynamics between awareness and epidemic spreading. When the population birth rate is above the birth threshold, the pahse diagram of our model resembles that of the standard SIS model. That is, the system is always awareness-free, stabilizing at either a fully susceptible state (where neither epidemic nor awareness existes) or an awareness-free epidemic state (where awareness vanishes). However, when the population birth rate is below the birth thrshold, there emerges a tricritical point defined as a critical value of the awareness efficacy. When the awareness efficacy is below the tricritical point, there are two contiuous phase transitions, segregating an epidemic-free aware state (where epidemic vanishes) from an awareness-free epidemic state, with an intermediate hybrid state (where susceptible,infected, and aware individuals coexist in the population) interpolating between them. As the awareness efficacy reaches the tricritical point, the two continuous transitions disappear while a discontinuous transition emerges from the epidemic-free aware state to the awareness-free epidemic state. When the awareness efficacy exceeds the tricritical point, the discontinuous transition split into two discontinuous ones, leading to a bistability regime where both the epidemic-free aware state and the awareness-free epidemic state are stable. The rich dynamics in our model highlights the intriguing competition between the awareness and epidemic spreading processes as well as its dependence on demographic changes. Our analytical results are supported by extensive stochastic simulations of the model on homogeneous random networks.},

  abstract     = {Starting from the seminal paper published by Brin and Page in 1998, the PageRank model has been extended to many fields far beyond search engine rankings, such as chemistry, biology, bioinformatics, social network analysis , to name a few. Due to the large dimension of PageRank problems, in the past decade or so, considerable research efforts have been devoted to their efficient solution especially for the difficult cases where the damping factors are close to 1. However, there exists few research work concerning about the solution of the case where several PageRank problems with the same network structure and various damping factors need to be solved. In this paper, we generalize the Power method to solving the PageRank problem with multiple damping factors. We demonstrate that the solution has almost the equative cost of solving the most difficult PageRank system of the sequence, and the residual vectors of the PageRank systems after running this method are collinear . Based upon these results, we develop a more efficient method that combines this Power method with the shifted GMRES method. For further accelerating the solving phase, we present a seed system choosing strategy combined with an extrapolation technique, and analyze their effect. Numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed iterative solver for accelerating realistic PageRank computations with multiple damping factors.},

  abstract     = {In biology and technology systems, the proper functioning of agents may be mutually interdependent, where the failure of an agent can cause the dysfunctionality of other dependent agents. Usually, we adopt the dependence network to capture such dependency relations among agents; however, the interdependency relations are only pairwise but could be of higher-order. In other words, an agent’s failure can induce the failure of several other nodes in a high-order interaction (e.g., the same group or clique) simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a generalized k k -core percolation model to investigate the robustness of the higher-order dependent networks. In particular, we consider higher-order multi-layered dependency networks where both the interlayer and intralayer dependency relations are of a high order. We study the model using percolation theory and numerical simulations and find that the k k -core percolation threshold and phase transition type depend on the average degree. Increasing the average degree enhances the system robustness. The system exhibits a discontinuous phase transition with a small k k -core percolation threshold for networks with small average degree. Meanwhile, for networks with large average degrees, the system can either shows a continuous phase transition with a small k k -core percolation threshold or a discontinuous phase transition with a large percolation threshold. In addition, we find that the intralayer dependency enhances the robustness of the system. Finally, we reveal that the degree heterogeneity makes the network more fragile. The above stated phenomena are well predicted by our developed percolation theory.},

  abstract     = {When chaotic systems are realized on finite precision devices, dynamical degradation occurs, which causes many flaws in chaos-based applications. In this paper, a new bit cyclic shift method is introduced to reinforce digital chaotic maps and counteract the problem of dynamical degradation. The state value of digital chaotic map is modified by circularly shifting its bits according to a designed shift strategy. This method is applied to the Logistic map to generate many new improved chaotic maps by changing the shift strategy. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate their chaotic parameter ranges and chaotic behaviors. Furthermore, the simulation results under low computing precision indicate that our method has the ability to counteract the dynamical degradation. This method has high flexibility and can apply to any chaotic system. Finally, a new pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is designed to show the good performance of the improved digital chaotic maps.},

Motivated by a macroeconomic application, the notion of the robust energy-to-peak filter is extended to a class of unstable systems by making use of the results on stability with respect to noncompact sets. Parameter-dependent Lyapunov approach and Finsler’s lemma are used to establish sufficient conditions for the existence of energy-to-peak filter such that the error system is asymptotically stable with respect to a subspace and a prescribed energy-to-peak performance is guaranteed. The conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Two numerical examples modified from the literature are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results are also successfully applied to the estimation of the so called potential GDP using real data .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of full state approximation by model reduction is studied for stochastic and bilinear systems. Our proposed approach relies on identifying the dominant subspaces based on the reachability Gramian of a system. Once the desired subspace is computed, the reduced order model is then obtained by a Galerkin projection. We prove that, in the stochastic case, this approach either preserves mean square asymptotic stability or leads to reduced models whose minimal realization is mean square asymptotically stable. This stability preservation guarantees the existence of the reduced system reachability Gramian which is the basis for the full state error bounds that we derive. This error bound depends on the neglected eigenvalues of the reachability Gramian and hence shows that these values are a good indicator for the expected error in the dimension reduction procedure. Subsequently, we establish the stability preservation result and the error bound for a full state approximation to bilinear systems in a similar manner. These latter results are based on a recently proved link between stochastic and bilinear systems. We conclude the paper by numerical experiments using a benchmark problem. We compare this approach with balanced truncation and show that it performs well in reproducing the full state of the system.},

We obtain a networked version of the Gompertz function as a worst-case scenario for the exact solution to the SIS model on networks. This function is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the classical scalar Gompertz function for sufficiently large times. It proves to be very effective both as an approximate solution of the networked SIS equation within a wide range of the parameters involved and as a fitting curve for the most diverse empirical data. As an instance, we perform some computational experiments, applying this function to the analysis of two real networks of sexual contacts. The numerical results highlight the analogies and the differences between the exact description provided by the SIS model and the upper bound solution proposed here, observing how the latter amplifies some empirically observed behaviors such as the presence of multiple and successive peaks in the contagion curve.},

We analytically study the degree distribution and clique distribution of the network model. As an important degree-based topological index , Sombor index of the model has been derived in an iterative manner and an approximation method with closed expression is proposed. Moreover, we observe power-law and small-word effect for the simplicial networks and examine the effectiveness of the approximation method for Sombor index through computational experiments. We discover the scaling constant for Sombor index with the evolution of the network when the initial seed network is modeled as an Erdős-Rényi random graph. Our findings suggest the relevance and potential applicability of simplicial networks in modelling higher-order interactions in complex networked systems.},

To meet the constraints for states and the transformed errors generated by the prescribed performance control(PPC) scheme, a novel PPC controller is constructed with barrier Lyapunov function(BLF). For eliminating the impact caused by FDI attack, a threshold-based attack detection mechanism including a virtual system, an authentication signal, and an attack detection filter, is developed. The amplitude of the FDI attack is then estimated by a finite time adaptive attack estimation observer. To offset the influence induced by actuator fault, an adaptive threshold-based fault detection observer is designed which reduces the false alarm ratio affected by external disturbance. Additionally, the amplitude of the actuator fault is estimated by an auxiliary variable-based fault estimation observer. By injecting the estimation of the FDI attack and actuator fault into the reference signal and controller, the resilient control is achieved. Finally, simulation results are given to exemplify the effectiveness of the control strategy.},

The dynamic event-triggering scheme is used to decrease unnecessary transmissions from the sensor to the estimator. To facilitate the joint estimator design, a novel descriptor system model is constructed by aggregating the system state and the sensor fault. The main aim of the addressed problem is to design a joint estimator to ensure that the estimation error dynamics simultaneously achieves the finite-horizon H ∞ H∞ performance and the envelope constraint. Sufficient conditions are provided to obtain the desired joint estimator parameters by solving a series of recursive matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method.

The influences of various material length scale associated with strain gradient theory, geometry and surface parameters such as thickness to material length scale parameter, surface residual stress, Young&#39;s modulus of surface layer, surface mass density and surface piezoelectric constant on structural dynamic deflection behavior and natural frequency have been investigated. In addition, the vibration and dynamic responses of the model were compared with those micro sandwich beams based on modified couple stress and classical theories. The obtained results are compared with the results available in the literature to validate the correctness of the present solution method. The results indicated that strain gradient theory with considering the surface effects increases the model stiffness and shifts the amplitudes to lower magnitude faster in comparison to other theories. Moreover, the influences of material length related to dilatation gradient on vibrational frequency are significant among the other parameters. Also, the free vibrational frequency increases with decreasing the length to thickness ratio.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a Hermite interpolation element-free Galerkin method (HIEFGM) for functionally graded structures (FGSs) is proposed by combining the Hermite interpolation and interpolation element-free Galerkin method (IEFGM). The proposed method considers the normal derivative of the displacements at the boundary, which can improve the computational accuracy without adding the nodes. The material properties of the FGSs are assumed to vary exponentially along the thickness direction. Employing the constitutive equation, geometric equation and equilibrium equation, the Galerkin weak form for governing equation of the FGSs is obtained. The Hermite interpolation and moving least squares method are utilized for approximating the field variables in problem domain. The discrete governing equation is procured using the variational principle and the HIEFGM formulation for the FGSs is established. The shape function constructed in meshless approximation has Kronecker delta property, which is conducive to the application of the essential boundary conditions. Furthermore, an error analysis is performed to determine the effects of weight function, scale factor and node density in the performance of this method. Three benchmark numerical examples considering the different gradient indexes are conducted, and the results uniformly demonstrate the HIEFGM is accurate and reliable for the FGSs.},

  abstract     = {A k k -edge colouring (not necessarily proper) of a graph with colours in { 1 , 2 , … , k } {1,2,…,k} is neighbour sum distinguishing if, for any two adjacent vertices, the sums of the colours of the edges incident with each of them are distinct. The smallest value of k k such that such a colouring of G G exists is denoted by χ ∑ e ( G ) χ∑e(G) . When we add the additional restriction that the k k -edge colouring must be proper, then the smallest value of k k such that such a colouring exists is denoted by χ ∑ ′ ( G ) χ∑′(G) . Such colourings are studied on a connected graph on at least 3 vertices. There are two famous conjectures on these edge colourings: the 1-2-3 Conjecture states that χ ∑ e ( G ) ≤ 3 χ∑e(G)≤3 for any graph G G ; and the other states that χ ∑ ′ ( G ) ≤ Δ ( G ) + 2 χ∑′(G)≤Δ(G)+2 for any graph G ≠ C 5 G≠C5 . In this paper, we generalize these two versions of neighbour sum distinguishing edge colourings by introducing the edge colouring in which each monochromatic set of edges induces a subgraph with maximum degree at most d d . We call such an edge colouring that distinguishes adjacent vertices a neighbour sum distinguishing d d -relaxed k k -edge colouring. We denote by χ ∑ ′ d ( G ) χ∑′d(G) the smallest value of k k such that such a colouring of G G exists. We study families of graphs for which χ ∑ ′ χ∑′ is known. We show that the number of required colours decreases when the proper condition is relaxed. In particular, we prove that χ ∑ ′ 2 ( G ) ≤ 4 χ∑′2(G)≤4 for every subcubic graph. For complete graphs, we show that χ ∑ ′ d ( K n ) ≤ 4 χ∑′d(Kn)≤4 if d ∈ { ⌈ n − 1 2 ⌉ , … , n − 1 } d∈{⌈n−12⌉,…,n−1} and we also determine the exact value of χ ∑ ′ 2 ( K n ) χ∑′2(Kn) . Finally, we determine the value of χ ∑ ′ d ( T ) χ∑′d(T) for any tree T T .},

Despite being implicit, the developed CERK methods do not require any numerical or analytical inversion of the coefficient matrix computationally explicitly. The efficiency and robustness of the developed methods are validated by solving the convection-diffusion equation and the unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which display stiff dynamical behavior at low Mach numbers. The performance of the developed methods is also compared with the representative explicit and implicit time-marching methods discussed in the literature. Several benchmark problems in computational aeroacoustics are analyzed by solving the NS equations using the developed time-marching methods. The computed results display an excellent match with the numerical and experimental results reported in the literature. For the computational aeroacoustics (CAA) problems, the computational costs required for the present methods are also compared with the methods noted in the literature.},

Different from previous binarization approaches, in this paper, we propose a novel and convex variational level set model for document image binarization. Our energy functional is comprised of two terms: data term and fidelity term. We prove that our model is strictly convex and has a unique global minimum solution, which enables us to set the evolution termination criterion by the normalized step difference energy that measures the convergence state of level set function. We experimentally demonstrate the advantage of the fidelity term and show the merit of level set initialization robustness. In addition, the convergence of the alternative minimization algorithm for solving our model is analyzed. Extensive experiments are conducted on JM dataset, representative degraded document images and DIBCO series datasets to evaluate our model qualitatively and quantitatively. The experiment results verify that our model is effective to deal with most kinds of degraded images. Compared with four evolution and six non-evolution based binarization methods, our model could achieve better or competitive performance in terms of four metrics.},

The stability analysis of numerical methods around a numerical solution requires the uniform boundness of such solution. Although such bounds are usually taken as an assumption, in this paper these will be deduced as a corollary of suitable error estimates. As the methods can be simultaneously seen as piecewise linear finite element methods and finite difference methods, the convergence results can be seen simultaneously as superconvergence results and supraconvergence results. Numerical results illustrating the sharpness of the smoothness assumptions and an application to simulation of the solar magnetic field in the umbra (the central zone of a sunspot) are also included.},

Consequently, we get the same first integral obtained by Feng’s FIM for the first equation; for the second equation, we reobtain certain important first integral reported previously; for the third equation, we construct a new first integral of complex cubic-quintic Ginzburg–Landau equation; and for the fourth and fifth equations, we show the effectiveness of our approach to third-order ODEs and reobtain the same first integral recently presented by Kudryashov for the fourth equation, and for the fifth equation, two new first integrals are presented.

When applied on a cut cell mesh with a time step length that is appropriate for the size of the larger background cells, one encounters stability issues. The DoD stabilization consists of penalty terms that are designed to address these problems by redistributing mass between the inflow and outflow neighbors of small cut cells in a physical way. For piecewise constant polynomials in space and explicit Euler in time, the stabilized scheme is monotone for scalar problems.

  abstract     = {This work is devoted to the study of spatiotemporal fault detection, estimation and control for nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs). This strategy mainly includes the following three steps. Firstly, a fault detection observer is constructed by using average measurement, and the deviation signal generated by the observer is used to detect the existence of the fault. Secondly, a partial differential equation (PDE) fault estimator with a fault estimation algorithm is designed, which starts to perform only when the fault observer detects the existence of a fault. Thirdly, a feedback controller based on PDE fault estimator is designed to make the coupled system globally ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived to ensure the coupled system globally UUB by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method. Finally, simulation examples are carried out to illustrate the validity of the proposed fault estimation algorithm and the designed controller.},

  abstract     = {Many various projects may exist in an enterprise in parallel, which leads to distinct group interactions. Team members cooperate in their respective projects, and sometimes it is possible to engage in several concurrent projects. Owing to practice makes perfect, the longer the duration of members participating in an identical project is, the higher benefits will be under same contribution. However, in a fiercely competitive environment, a huge conflict of interest between groups and individuals which results in social dilemma makes projects difficult to proceed smoothly. The experience of direct reciprocity shows that repeated interactions can alleviate this problem, but most multi-person dilemma studies consider a single game scenario, and public resources remain constant. Here we introduce a general framework of multiple public goods games. Taking the public goods game with threshold into consideration, public resource evolves with the persistence and transition of games. Our results suggest although collaborators are at a disadvantage in different game scenarios, our model can still effectively promote the overall cooperation in multiple public goods games. Especially, it performs better when public resource is relative scarce.},

  abstract     = {The paper is devoted to the comparison of one-dimensional blood flow models in application to the solution of model problems. In the viscid case, the non-Newtonian properties of blood are considered. Original one-dimensional models, based on the Carreau, Carreau–Yasuda, Cross, and Powell–Eyring rheological models, are constructed by the averaging of the Navier–Stokes equations. The approach to the analytical solution of problems in the inviscid case is proposed. The originality of the method is based on the small perturbation of the initial rest state , corresponding to zero velocity. It leads to the solution of the linear wave equations. The solutions of three problems — for the infinite, semi-infinite, and finite intervals are obtained. The examples are presented for the small parameter value ∼ 10 − 2 ∼10−2 . Analytical solutions are used for the comparison of different one-dimensional models of blood flow, where the viscosity (Newtonian and non-Newtonian) is considered. The problems for the viscid models are solved numerically by the third-order WENO scheme. As the results of the comparison of models, the effects of the viscosity and velocity profile are analyzed. From a practical viewpoint, the solutions obtained by the perturbation method can be used for the testing of programs for numerical simulations and for the comparison of different blood flow models.},

Since the continuity of the solution and flux is treated appropriately, the scheme and the vertex interpolation algorithm allow arbitrary diffusion tensors. In addition, we employ an adaptive weighted coefficient in the least squares problem of the vertex interpolation using a novel way to evaluate the magnitude of the diffusion anisotropy. Consequently our vertex interpolation has better performance than the least squares interpolation in most tested cases. The presented scheme and vertex interpolation algorithm do not need edge information, which leads to less topological searches and simplifies the programming compared with other edge-based ones. By means of unified calculations of the geometric quantities, this scheme is suitable for meshes with nonplanar faces. Numerical experiments show that our scheme is linearity-preserving and achieves nearly optimal accuracy for the solution on general meshes. Moreover, the new vertex interpolation algorithm has an ideal performance for heterogeneous and highly anisotropic diffusion problems which are tough for some existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The saturated-constrained distributed filtering problem is discussed for a class of discrete nonlinear systems with random access protocol (RAP) and missing measurements (MMs) under uncertain missing probabilities (UMPs). In order to prevent data congestions, the RAP is adopted to regulate the information transmission, where only one sensor is scheduled to have the communication right and transmit the information at each time step through a shared network. In addition, the phenomenon of MMs is considered, in which the UMPs are characterized by means of the nominal means and error bounds. The main purpose of this paper is to design a distributed filter under saturation constraint such that, for both RAP and MMs under UMPs, there exists an upper bound (UB) matrix of filtering error covariance and the corresponding distributed filter gain is constructed to minimize the trace of the received UB matrix by resorting to the matrix simplifying technique. Besides, the filtering algorithm performances are discussed regarding the boundedness and monotonicity of the presented distributed filtering scheme from the mathematical perspective. Finally, some comparisons are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed time-varying distributed filtering algorithm.},

Using this compact representation, a novel algorithm is proposed to find the connected components of the Set–Based Graph . This algorithm, under certain restrictions, has the remarkable property of achieving constant computational costs with respect to the number of vertices and edges contained in each set. That way, under the mentioned restrictions, the proposed methodology can transform a large set of connections into the corresponding set of equations within a time that is independent on the size of the arrays contained in the model.

The application of the SMC brings another shortcoming: The chattering problem. To solve such a problem, this paper makes use the features of the EID approach and presents a method of designing a small switching gain based on the estimation error. Combining the SMC, the EID approach, and the switching-gain design law, this paper presents a new system configuration. The presented SMC-based-EID control system not only improves the disturbance-suppression performance of the EID approach but also solves the chattering problem in the SMC.

  abstract     = {To enhance the evacuation efficiency in partially observable asymmetric-exit evacuation under guidance, a general framework of the dynamic guiding assistant system is presented to investigate the effect of density control. In this framework, several evacuation assistants are established to observe the partial information of pedestrians’ location and adjust the guiding signals of the dynamic guiding assistant systems. A simple on-off-based density control algorithm is proposed for the evacuation assistants according to the delayed data of the observed information (i.e., pedestrian densities in the observed regions near the corresponding exits). This paper provides strategic suggestions on how to set the observed region and the target density by involving a force-driven cellular automaton model. It is observed that the proposed density control algorithm can control (positively affect) the global distribution of the pedestrians’ locations and suppress arching phenomena in the evacuation process even using the observed partial information under time delays. By imposing a moderate target density, the dynamic guiding assistant system also suppresses the triggers of collisions around the exits and avoids inefficiently separating the pedestrians. To enhance evacuation efficiency, we reveal an interesting fact without loss of generality that we only need to observe the pedestrians’ location from a small region near the exit instead of a large region when the time delay of the observed information is slight enough. Our numerical findings are expected to provide new insights into designing computer-aided guiding strategies in real evacuations.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs a numerical methodology, named PAMH, to approximate an investor’s optimal portfolio strategy in the contexts of expected utility theory (EUT) and mean-variance theory (MVT). Thanks to the use of hyperbolic absolute risk aversion utilities (HARA), the approach produces optimal solutions for decreasing relative risk aversion (DRRA) investors, as well as for increasing relative risk aversion (IRRA) agents. The accuracy and efficiency of the approximation is examined in a comparison to known closed-form solutions for a one dimensional ( n = 1 n=1 ) geometric Brownian motion with a CIR stochastic volatility model (i.e. GBM 1/2 or Heston model), and a high dimensional (up to n = 35 n=35 ) stochastic covariance model. The former confirms the method works even when the theoretical candidate is not well-defined, while the latter illustrates low errors (up to 8% in certainty equivalent rate (CER)) and feasible computational time (less than one hour in a PC). Given the potential of this method, we investigate a relevant practical setting with no closed-form solution, namely when assets follow an OrnsteinUhlenbeck 4/2 stochastic volatility (SV, i.e. OU 4/2) model. We conduct sensitivity analyses of the optimal strategies for DRRA and IRRA investors with respect to key parameters; (e.g. risk aversion, minimum capital guarantee and 4/2’s parameters). In particular, the efficient frontier for the IRRA case is presented. A comparison to important sub-optimal strategies in terms of CER is performed, indicating low CER performances due to ignorance of stochastic volatility for CRRA investors, i.e. a myopic strategy would be even better than ignoring SV. The analyses highlight the importance of efficient and precise numerical methods to obtain substantially higher CERs.},

And while they have separately received ample attention for their ability to promote cooperation in social dilemmas, their joint effects in this regard are much less explored. Here we propose a multilayer network model that takes into account that not only individuals are connected by means of networks, but that also groups can be connected in much the same way. The model thus couples together network reciprocity and group selection, and it allows us to study their joint effect on the evolution of cooperation. We use the prisoner’s dilemma game as the paradigmatic social dilemma example, showing that the fine-tuning of evolution frequency and the imitation rate in the group network play key roles in determining the survival thresholds of cooperators. We also explore the importance of deterministic and stochastic updating rules, showing that the former provides more options to further promote cooperation. We discuss the importance of our findings for cooperation in structured interactions among groups and in higher-order networks.},

With the distribution of the attack probability and attack signals modeled as Beta distribution and Gaussian mixture distribution, a variational Bayesian based adaptive cubature Kalman filter is proposed to approximate the joint posterior distribution of the system state vector and unknown parameters. In addition, the update rules of the state and the statistical parameters of attacks are analytically derived by employing the fixed-point iteration approach.

Mathematical formulation of complex problem has been carried out in cylindrical coordinates due to the axisymmetric flow. The nonlinear set of partial differential equations is solved by the recursive approach and hydrodynamic aspects of axisymmetric flow of Jeffery fluid are explained in detail. Results are achieved for axial and radial velocity, hydrostatic pressure, stream function, leakage flux, and fractional reabsorption on the boundary. Numerical analysis has also been carried out to demonstrate the effects of emerging parameters due to linear reabsorption on the boundary of micro channel and relaxation time due to Jeffrey fluid parameters. The findings of the study suggest that axisymmetric flow decelerates by the growing values of relaxation time but the reabsorption rate gives the increasing effect on shear stress, volume flow rate, and transverse velocity. This study is useful for bioengineers to design the medical tools required for the flow of bio fluids.},

We prove some of the main properties of the Clifford short-time Fourier transform such as the orthogonality relation, the reconstruction property and the reproducing kernel formula. Moreover, we show the effects of modulating and translating the signal and the window function, respectively.

In general, it can simultaneously combine A-stability, second order accuracy and explicit implementation. As a result, it is best suited to solve systems of nonlinear first order stiff ordinary differential equations since it is of high computational efficiency in contrast to conventional implicit methods.},

By introducing a mode storage rule and transforming the asynchronous system into a general switched system, the stability criteria is obtain with available modes, the sum of these modes’ sojourn probabilities and the bounds of sojourn time. Then, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the mean-square stability (MSS) by employing Young inequality and the desired asynchronous controller is designed by using available softwares.

Moreover, the evolutionary paths are a lot less predictable when catastrophes are possible.

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations have recently been established as a viable framework for image processing, particularly for image binarization. One drawback of this framework is the requirement for manual parameter tuning. In this work we propose a novel development wherein the spatio-temporal dynamics of the thresholding parameter are governed by an additional partial differential equation which is engineered to exhibit desirable traits. While the model can still be tuned manually to achieve optimal results, we show experimentally that the present framework is near optimal for the default choice of parameter, τ τ . This novel system enforces a smooth evolution of the threshold map while still offering locally adaptive thresholding properties, a requirement for non-uniformly illuminated images. The proposed model is applied to images through a rudimentary finite difference based numerical method due to the parallelizability and provable stability of the method. The proposed work offers an unsupervised binarization scheme and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods in the field.},

It is well known that for every H ∈ HS h H∈HSh : (1) 0 ≤ n i ( H ) ≤ 2 h + 1 − ⌈ 12 h − 3 ⌉ . 0≤ni(H)≤2h+1−⌈12h−3⌉. The hexagonal systems which attain the lower bound of (1) are called catacondensed hexagonal systems, a class which has been extensively studied. On the other extreme we have the hexagonal systems which attain the upper bound of (1), which in contrast to the catacondensed hexagonal systems, we call anacondensed hexagonal systems, and denote them by A h Ah . We shall see in this paper that the number of anacondensed hexagonal systems in HS h HSh have a super-polynomial growth for infinite values of h h : for any t &gt; 0 t&amp;gt;0 , there exist h h large enough such that there are more than h t ht anacondensed hexagonal systems in HS h HSh . Consequently, A h Ah is a large class in HS h HSh . One useful parameter associated to a hexagonal system is the so-called number of bay regions of H ∈ HS h H∈HSh , denoted by b ( H ) b(H) . We will show how to construct anacondensed hexagonal systems with a given number of bay regions. Moreover, among all hexagonal systems in A h Ah , we find those which have extremal value of number of bay regions. This result has strong implications in the study of the extremal values of vertex-degree-based topological indices (molecular descriptors) over A h Ah .},

The model is cast as a system of three ordinary differential equations for the dependent variables biofilm thickness, quorum sensing signal concentration in the reactor, and concentration of the growth limiting substrate in the reactor. The model is investigated with analytical and numerical techniques. We find that a single QS dispersal mechanism, depending on parameters, can lead to (i) continuous cell loss at a signal level at which the biofilm is entirely up-regulated, (ii) periodically repeating almost instantaneous cell loss with the biofilm switching between down- and up-regulated states, (iii) continuous cell loss at a signal level at which the biofilm is entirely down-regulated, or (iv) complete washout. We contrast this with a simple model of starvation induced dispersal, which is cast in the same modeling framework, but shows entirely different dynamic behavior, in that it only permits washout or asymptotic convergence to a steady state at break-even concentration, depending on parameters.},

  abstract     = {We construct neural network interpolation operators with some newly defined activation functions, and give the approximation rate by the operators for continuous functions. By adding some smooth assumptions on the activation function, we establish two important inequalities of the derivative of the operators. With these two inequalities, by using K K -functional and Berens–Lorentz lemma in approximation theory , we obtain the converse theorem of approximation by the operators. To approximate smooth functions, we further introduce special combinations of the operators, which can be regarded as FNNs with four layers, and can approximate the object function and its derivative simultaneously. Finally, we introduce a Kantorovich type variant of the operators. We establish both the direct theorem and the converse theorem of approximation by the Kantorovich type operators in L p Lp spaces with 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ . 1≤p≤∞.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we construct and derive a new class of exponentially fitted two-derivative diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (EFTDDIRK) methods for the numerical solution of differential equations with oscillatory solutions. First, a general format of so-called modified two-derivative diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta methods (TDDIRK) is proposed. Their order conditions up to order six are derived by introducing a set of bi-colored rooted trees and deriving new elementary weights. Next, we build exponential fitting conditions in order for these modified TDDIRK methods to treat oscillatory solutions, leading to EFTDDIRK methods. In particular, a family of 2-stage fourth-order, a fifth-order, and a 3-stage sixth-order EFTDDIRK schemes are derived. These can be considered as superconvergent methods. The stability and phase-lag analysis of the new methods are also investigated, leading to optimized fourth-order schemes, which turn out to be much more accurate and efficient than their non-optimized versions. Finally, we carry out numerical experiments on some oscillatory test problems. Our numerical results clearly demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the newly derived methods when compared with existing trigonometically/exponentially fitted implicit Runge–Kutta methods and two-derivative Runge–Kutta methods of the same order in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Punishing those who refuse to participate in common efforts is a known and intensively studied way to maintain cooperation among self-interested agents. But this act is costly, hence punishers who are generally also engaged in the original joint venture, become vulnerable, which jeopardizes the effectiveness of this incentive. As an alternative, we may hire special players, whose only duty is to watch the population and punish defectors. Such a policelike or mercenary punishment can be maintained by a tax-based fund. If this tax is negligible, a cyclic dominance may emerge among different strategies. When this tax is relevant then this solution disappears. In the latter case, the fine level becomes a significant factor that determines whether punisher players coexist with cooperators or alternatively with defectors. The maximal average outcome can be reached at an intermediate cost value of punishment. Our observations highlight that we should take special care when such kind of punishment and accompanying tax are introduced to reach a collective goal.},

This thermal contribution addressed the optimized aspects of viscous nanoparticles confined by curved surface with Joule heating and viscous dissipation thermal reflections. Moreover, the radiative pattern is also observed to execute the energy enhancement. The slip enrollment is considered instead of traditional no-slip flow mechanism. After re-attaining dimensionless form of governing equations, the shooting algorithm via MATLAB software is developed. The confirmations of obtained numerical data are verified after comparative analysis. The physical sense of parameters is observed with graphical framework. The change in entropy generation and Bejan number is also visualized in view of parameters.

Compared with the conventional fast marching method, the new method has an improved accuracy in tracing moving wavefronts via computing the solution at each grid point along several stencils. To deal with the source singularity, we solve for the viscosity solution iteratively by factorize the unknown traveltime function into a function that captures the singularity and a multiplicative factor which is differentiable at the source location. By leveraging the strengths of multi-stencils and factorisation , the newly developed algorithm is highly accurate in solving anisotropic eikonal equations. Through a series of numerical examples , we explicitly show that the algorithm (1) has an obvious first (second) order convergence rate with the first (second) order finite-difference scheme, and (2) is unconditionally stable as long as the initial time table around the source is specified. Finally, we design an eikonal-based anisotropic ray tracing technique. We test the anisotropic ray tracing technique on both radial and azimuthal anisotropy cases and the numerical results demonstrate that the usage of multi-stencils scheme increase the accuracy of the anisotropic ray paths especially for azimuthal anisotropy case. This high-accurate eikonal solver and the associated ray tracing technique can be used in high-resolution seismic anisotropic tomography and other researches in the future.},

The choice of specific architecture of the neural networks used in the proposed algorithm provides for interpretability of the model, a feature that is often desirable in the financial context. Specifically, the interpretation leads us to demonstrate that any discretely monitored contingent claim —possibly high-dimensional and path-dependent— under Markovian and no-arbitrage assumptions, can be semi-statically hedged using a portfolio of short maturity options. We also show, for Bermudan style derivatives, how the method can be used to obtain an upper and lower bound to the true price, where the lower bound is obtained by following a sub-optimal policy, while the upper bound is found by exploiting the dual formulation. Unlike other duality based upper bounds where one typically has to resort to nested simulation for constructing super-martingales, the martingales in the current approach come at no extra cost, without the need for any sub-simulations. We demonstrate through numerical examples the simplicity and efficiency of the method for both pricing and semi-static hedging of path-dependent options.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies on network spreading dynamics often adopt pairwise interaction to describe the simple spreading process while using higher-order interaction to describe the collective behavior of the dynamical system on the network. However, the interaction between competing pathogens usually includes both pairwise and high-order interactions. Due to dynamic correlation, it is hard to solve the theory by considering two modes of interaction. Here, we propose a theoretical analysis framework based on Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) to solve simplicial competing spreading involving pairwise and high-order interactions. Because of the competitive mechanism in the framework, a susceptible node can only be infected by one pathogen, and contagion can spread simultaneously through pairwise interactions (1-simplices) and higher-order interactions, i.e., 2-simplices. The theory and simulation agree in good accuracy on real networks and artificial networks, which reveals the validity of the theoretical analysis and indicates that the initial density of the two pathogens and the infection rate of 1-simplices act together on the process of pathogen transmission. The effect of 1-simplices and 2-simplices infection rates of two pathogens are also included in the discussion. When the average degree of the network is fixed, in the case of a larger average number of 1-simplices incidents on a node, infection rates of pathogen A A is greater than infection rates of pathogen B B may result in final infection density of pathogen A A greater than the final infection density of pathogen B B . We discuss the influences of 1-simplices average degree and 2-simplices average degree on the final infection range. We find that with the increase of 1-simplices average degree, the pathogen may undergo a transition from outbreak to death while increasing the 2-simplices average degree is more conducive to spreading. Finally, in the study of two different seed selection strategies, we find that selecting the nodes with the highest degree as seeds can promote pathogen spreading more than randomly selecting seeds.},

  abstract     = {A kinetic model, describing the influence of decision-making competence in evolution of wealth for a multi-agent system with feedback control, is investigated. The control term is analyzed by the minimization of a quadratic cost functional, which aims to decrease the wealth gap between agents. The constant saving propensities and diffusion coefficients in the model are modified as functions of wealth and decision competence, respectively. In our micro binary wealth exchange model, an extra risk shared by all agent is discussed, which increases the inequality of wealth distribution. The main macro properties of the kinetic model and the marginal distributions of wealth and decision-making competence are considered through several examples. Our results illustrate that the disequilibrium of decision-making competence is one of the reasons to increase wealth inequality.},

  abstract     = {For an unstable Markov jump stochastic differential system (MJ-SDS) with high nonlinearity, can one introduce a discrete feedback control to stabilize it? This question has been well answered for the case of the feedback control derived from discrete state observations, in the form of H ∞ H∞ stabilization and exponential stabilization. Whereas, the existing theory can not tackle the non-autonomous systems and do not consider the factor of discrete mode observations, which are the motivations of this paper. Fortunately, for an unstable non-autonomous MJ-SDS, the feedback control, originated from discrete observations of system state and system mode, is well designed to stabilize it not only in the sense of exponential decay rate but also of polynomial decay rate and even general decay rate. Thereinto, the designing rule of discrete feedback control is given as well.},

We consider the nanoparticles and the interstitial fluid extravasate from the vessel into the surrounding tissue through a uniform distribution of pores at the vessel wall . We introduce similarity transformations to convert the governing equations into a system of ODEs, which we solve numerically using MATLAB. The model predictions show a significant influence of the vessel pore size on the heat transfer in the tissue. On the other hand, the nanoparticle transport across the tissue depends on the thermophoresis parameter. Furthermore, the heat removal from the tissue by the vessel strongly depends on the fluid extravasation velocity and the heat flux across the tissue outer boundary interface.},

However, the accelerated degradation tests and accelerated life tests are always performed to shorten the testing time. Hence, based on a general log-linear form acceleration model, we develop the artificial neural network supported Wiener process model into an accelerated testing model to utilize the accelerated testing data and improve the reliability estimating accuracy. Furthermore, the corresponding model training and parameter inferencing approaches are also constructed to apply the proposed model in reliability estimation. A simulation experiment and a case study on stress relaxation dataset are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is concluded that, the proposed method shows superiorities on population evaluation and individual predictions comparing the other methods, considering the accuracies of degradation modeling, life and reliability estimations.

In a human-robot system, the robot can be described by using a stochastic model subject to internal disturbances due to random changes in the mass and posture of different users. The proposed algorithm uses model predictive method to adjust the velocity input to each omnidirectional wheel of the cushion robot, which is novel because the velocity constraint information obtained from a kinematic model is used to design a tracking controller based on a stochastic dynamic model for constraining the robot’s actual velocity, which is described by a stochastic system . The internal disturbance to the human-robot system is estimated by a neural network to improve the robustness of the tracking system. A safety-triggered controller that constrains the trajectory tracking error of the cushion robot was built that makes the system exponentially practically mean-square stable. Simulation results confirmed that the proposed method effectively constrains the velocity and trajectory of the cushion robot, which will allow it to support different users perform activities of daily living in safe motion states.},

These presented ZNN models, which mainly use classical sign-bi-power (S-B-P) activation function and varying parameters, are S-B-P based ZNN (S-ZNN), S-B-P function based linear varying parameter ZNN (LVP-ZNN) and S-B-P function based exponential varying parameter ZNN (EVP-ZNN) models. Due to the applications of S-B-P activation function and varying parameters, the S-ZNN, LVP-ZNN and EVP-ZNN models can accomplish finite-time convergence, i.e., the state solutions generated by these models can converge to the analytical solutions of the TV-STE problem in finite-time. Further, based on the relationship between error, design parameter and convergence property , a dynamic varying parameter adapted to the error variation is designed and applied to the S-ZNN model. Then an error-adaptive dynamic varying parameter ZNN (DVP-ZNN) model is obtained for the TV-STE, which possesses faster finite-time convergence. These four models are proved to be stable and their upper bounds of convergence time are derived and analyzed. Theoretical analyses and comparison experiments demonstrate that the proposed ZNN models can solve the TV-STE in finite-time and the convergence of the DVP-ZNN model is the best.},

This ends up being related to a problem of independent interest, which asks when it is possible to 2-color the edges of a graph G G such that there is a path between any two vertices of G G which uses each color the same number of times.

  abstract     = {Contact tracing is widely adopted to inhibit the epidemics in the global world, and has been proved to be very effective in reducing infections. But it is rarely investigated whether contact tracing can completely eradicate an epidemic with asymptomatic infection. This paper proposes a novel model to explore the impacts of contact tracing on the outbreak size and outbreak threshold of an epidemic with asymptomatic infection in a two-layered network structure. Based on contact tracing, three types of effects are considered simultaneously: social distancing on the close contacts, infection test on the close contacts, and arousing risk perception from the close contacts. The results indicate that contact tracing and its three effects can largely reduce the number of infections. Among the three effects, the effect of social distancing is more effective because it acts on both the susceptible nodes and the asymptomatic nodes, while the other two only act on one type of nodes. However, contact tracing and its three effects are unable to change the epidemic threshold, even if the asymptomatic nodes and symptomatic nodes are all set to be infectious. The primary reason is that the identification of close contacts is driven by the detection of infections, and is lagged behind the outbreak of epidemic. In fact, the threshold for close contacts to emerge is highly dependent on the epidemic threshold. When the epidemic size approaches 0, close contacts will also disappear. To increase the efficiency of contact tracing on the epidemic threshold, the optimal strategy should directly target the normal people besides the close-contact individuals.},

In many singularly perturbed systems, since the perturbed parameter κ κ is not available, our task is to determine an ellipsoid as small as possible which can be independent on κ κ . In this case, for any admissible singularly perturbed parameters, this ellipsoid can surround the states of the system. First, in order to obtain more accurate result, the delay is unequally divided into two sub-intervals and a κ κ -dependent Lyapunov-Krasocskii functional is established. Then, with the aid of reciprocally convex inequality for each sub-interval, sufficient delay-dependent conditions are established which can make the system states contained by a κ κ -independent ellipsoid.

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a model reduction technique to speed up the diagonalization-based parallel-in-time (ParaDIAG) preconditioner, for iteratively solving all-at-once systems from evolutionary PDEs. In particular, we use the reduced basis method to seek a low-dimensional approximation to the sequence of complex-shifted systems arising from Step-(b) of the ParaDIAG preconditioning procedure. Different from the standard reduced order modeling that uses the separation of offline and online stages, we have to build the reduced order model (ROM) online for the considered systems at each iteration. Therefore, several heuristic acceleration techniques are introduced in the greedy basis generation algorithm, that is built upon a residual-based error indicator, to further boost up its computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments are conducted, which illustrate the favorable computational efficiency of our proposed ROM-accelerated ParaDIAG preconditioner, in comparison with the multigrid-based one.},

Firstly we devise an algorithm for these indices based on 3-eccentricity and analyze the computing complexity. As their applications, we employ the topological indcies based on 2- and 3-eccentricity as the feature vectors to predict anti-HIV activity by devising machine learning predicting models with the help of Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree (DecTree), respectively. Experiment results show that the highest accuracy is 99.7 % 99.7% , while the lowest is 97.7 % 97.7% except the special cases. The special cases are that the experiments are with the single 2-CEI or 3-CEI as the feature vector, respectively. Through these experiments, we find that these topological indices based on the k k -eccentricity ( k = 2 , 3 k=2,3 ) have good applications in predicting anti-HIV activity. But not every feature vector is generally applicable. Different feature vectors may be used to different models. Furthermore, there is no clear relationship between the dimension of feature vectors and the accuracy of prediction.},

They also exhibit excellent long-time energy behavior even if external forcing is involved. Motivated by this fact, we present a new approach, that is based on the local path fitting technique, to construct variational integrators for forced mechanical systems. The core technology exploited is to fit the local trajectory as the Lagrange interpolation polynomial by requiring that the forced Euler–Lagrange equations hold at the internal interpolation nodes. This operation also yields the essential terms of the discrete forced Euler–Lagrange equations and consequently formulates the final integrator. This new approach not only avoids numerical quadrature involved in the classical construction, but also significantly improves the precision of the resulting integrator, as illustrated by the given examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new uncertainty-based approach, termed the universal grey number-based Gaussian elimination method, is presented for the analysis of large structures that require the solution of systems of linear interval algebraic equations. Although exact ranges of the solution can be found using the enumeration method, it is known to be computationally expensive as it requires a large number of analyses. Although interval analysis has been used by some researchers, it is found to lead to wider ranges of the response quantities due to the dependency problem. Hence, modified procedures such as the truncation-based interval analysis have been suggested in the literature to overcome the dependency problem. In fact, no interval analysis-based method is available in the literature for solving large number of interval linear equations accurately. The present method is expected to overcome the limitations associated with the available methods in terms of accuracy and computational effort. To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, the stress analysis of several truss structures under specified interval values of input parameters is considered. It is shown that the proposed method yields accurate results more efficiently with less computational effort compared to the truncation-based interval analysis and enumeration method.},

By introducing a time-discrete system, the error is separated into two parts: the temporal error and the spatial error. As the result of τ τ -independent of the spatial error, we obtain the L ∞ L∞ -norm boundedness of the fully discrete solutions without any restrictions on the grid ratio. The unconditionally optimal L 2 L2 -norm error estimate is then obtained naturally. Furthermore, in order to numerically solve the system with nonsmooth solutions, we construct another Galerkin FEM with nonuniform temporal meshes, and corresponding fast algorithm by using sum-of-exponentials technique is also built.

Second, a choice of feedback control is proposed in order to achieve that a trajectory eventually enters the nonnegative orthant and remains therein for all time thereafter.

Firstly, we order the trees with respect to the Sombor index among the n n -vertex trees with diameter 3. Then, we determine the largest and the second largest Sombor indices of n n -vertex trees with a given diameter d ≥ 4 d≥4 and characterize the corresponding trees. Moreover, for n − d = 3 n−d=3 , we characterize the extremal n n -order trees which reach from the third to the fourth (resp. the sixth, the seventh) largest Sombor indices with d = 4 d=4 (resp. d = 5 , d ≥ 6 d=5,d≥6 ).

Then, a special vibration model with a nonholonomic constraint is introduced to match the obtained third-order linear system. On this basis, the energy function of the original delayed subsystem is constructed by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the special vibration model. After that, a state-dependent switching rule with large energy loss in a switching loop is designed by using the energy functions of two delayed subsystems.

  abstract     = {In this paper, wavelet optimized finite difference B-spline polynomial chaos method is proposed for solving stochastic partial differential equations. The generalized polynomial chaos is applied by considering linear B-spline wavelet basis. Then, stochastic Galerkin projection is executed for evaluating the deterministic coefficients of the generalized polynomial chaos. In the next step, the system of equations is discretized by using Crank-–Nicolson scheme for time integration and for approximating the differential operators, central finite difference matrices are considered. An adaptive grid is generated using the linear B-spline generalized polynomial chaos for optimizing the numerical solution. The method is then tested on three problems namely heat equation with uncertain initial conditions, Burger’s equation with random initial conditions and Burger’s equation with random viscosity as well as uncertain initial conditions. For the three test problems, grid modifications are displayed by taking periodic boundary conditions into consideration. Mean and standard deviation are plotted for each test problem. Moreover, for the third test problem, computational time comparison is performed by computing CPU time taken by the proposed method and the CPU time taken by the finite difference method on a uniform grid.},

  abstract     = {A number of empirical studies have proved that human decision-making behaviors are bounded rational with external regulations and intrinsic motivations. In some situations, without information exchanges, an individual could make decisions only based on its own payoff, experience, memory and aspiration level. Such process can be theoretically expressed as the aspiration-driven dynamics applied in anonymous evolutionary games. On the other hand, from the perspective of behavioral economics and cognitive psychology, Prospect Theory qualitatively describes the bounded rationality of human decision-making behaviors under uncertain conditions. Here we explore a new approach to quantitatively construction of such bounded rationality by combining the aspiration updating rules in evolutionary games with the asymmetric utility value function in Prospect Theory. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out on a square lattice using the model of public goods game. The simulation results have shown that the level of cooperation at equilibrium states depends on the combined effects of synergy factor, individual greediness and sensitivity to gains and losses. Besides, the results give a reasonable explanation for the spontaneous emergence of cooperation among irrelevant individuals as well as the necessary conditions for the full-cooperation state. Furthermore, we argue that the study on human decision-making behaviors in groups requires more extensive and profound interdisciplinary researches.},

We show that the notion of viscosity solution is useful in thoroughly describing the characteristics of possibly non-smooth and discontinuous solutions to such problems, achieving the conservation of momentum and the entropy condition. Those viscosity solutions are the generalized solutions in the space of bounded measurable functions. Generalized solutions to some Dirichlet problems are not always unique, and a necessary condition for the non-uniqueness is derived. A concrete example illustrates the non-uniqueness of discontinuous viscosity solutions in a channel of a particular cross-sectional shape.},

In generic case where the transitioning eigenvalue has multiplicity one, we show that the transition involved is of continuous type, and the basic solution will be bifurcated to two stable convection solutions which attract globally. If the leading eigenvalue multiplicity is two, the transition is also continuous and a global attractor homeomorphic to the unit circle bifurcates. The attractor then contains four steady-state convection solutions, two of which are stable while the other two are unstable.

To address this challenge, we study neural networks from a nonlinear computation point of view and propose a novel weight initialization strategy that is based on the linear product structure (LPS) of neural networks. The proposed strategy is derived from the polynomial approximation of activation functions by using theories of numerical algebraic geometry to guarantee to find all the local minima. We also provide a theoretical analysis that the LPS initialization has a lower probability of dying ReLU comparing to other existing initialization strategies. Finally, we test the LPS initialization algorithm on both fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to show its feasibility, efficiency, and robustness on public datasets.},

Here we extend this equivalence to the case of “biased” patterns, that is patterns which display an unbalanced count of positive neurons/pixels: starting from previous results of the bias paradigm for the HN, we construct the BM’s equivalent Hamiltonian introducing a constraint parameter for the bias correction. We show analytically and numerically that the parameters suggested by equivalence are fixed points under contrastive divergence evolution when exposed to a dataset of blurred examples of each pattern, also enjoying large basins of attraction when the model suffers of a noisy initialisation. These results are also shown to be robust against increasing storage of the models, and increasing bias in the reference patterns. This picture, together with analytical derivation of HN’s phase diagram via self-consistency equations, allows us to enhance our mathematical control on BM’s performance when approaching more realistic datasets.},

By utilizing the delay system method, the event-triggered fault tolerant control system is modeled as a delay system. Then, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are derived in form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee the system is stochastically passive with prescribed passive performance γ γ . The impact of the actuator fault and the random occurring parameter uncertainty are studied under the unified framework.

This is the first time to explore fault detection issue via filtering for networked random models. First, an event-triggered scheme is designed. Secondly, a zero order holder is studied. According to this event-triggered mechanism, a fault detection filter, a fault weighting system and a controller are investigated for the networked random system. And then an augmented system can be got. Sufficient conditions of mean-square finite-time boundedness with input-output finite-time mean square stabilization can be provided through the framework of linear matrix inequalities . Finally, these effectiveness and merits are verified by an example.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid difference methods are a kind of finite difference methods which is similar to hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods introduced by Jeon and Park (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2010). In the previous hybrid difference method, the approximate solution is only defined on the lines parallel to the coordinate axes, but the approximation is not defined at the corner/edge nodes. Thus, it is hard to calculate the approximation value without loosing accuracy at any point in the domain due to the aforementioned missing information. To overcome this issue, we first propose a novel hybrid difference method by imposing some conditions to determine the missing information. With this, we are able to provide not only continuous approximations in the whole domain, but also the gradient of the numerical solution becomes continuous under certain conditions. Next, we prove that the proposed method is stable and locally conservative. The proposed method can be also viewed as the existing hybrid difference method with a simple postprocessing. The postprocessing not only induces a simple tridiagonal system on each mesh line, but also it can be done efficiently line by line or in parallel. Lastly, a reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimate is established for computational efficiency. Several numerical results are presented to confirm our findings.},

It turns out that the points naturally partition into groups that we refer to as orbits, with a number of properties that prove useful for studying and efficiently processing the non-crossing matchings. Bottleneck matching is a matching that minimizes the length of the longest segment. Illustrating the use of the developed tools, we solve the problem of finding bottleneck matchings of points in convex position in O ( n 2 ) O(n2) time. Subsequently, combining our tools with a geometric analysis we design an O ( n ) O(n) -time algorithm for the case where the given points lie on a circle. The best previously known running times were O ( n 3 ) O(n3) for points in convex position, and O ( n log n O(nlogn ) for points on a circle.},

Notably, aiming at decrease the triggering intervals while improving the dynamic performance, a novel mode-dependent memory-based event-triggered mechanism is proposed, whose triggering condition varies with some historic released data. By virtue of the hidden semi-Markov model and historic released data, a memory asynchronous control strategy is skillfully synthesized. By resorting to Lyapunov theory, some criteria are formulated to guarantee the stochastically stable of the resulting dynamic.

One of the main difficulties is that the limit cycles can reside within areas of vastly different scales. This makes numerical explorations very hard to perform, requiring high precision computations, where the necessary precision is not known in advance. Using rigorous computations, we can dynamically determine the required precision, and localize all limit cycles of a given system. We prove that the Songling system of planar, quadratic polynomial differential equations has exactly four limit cycles. Furthermore, we give precise bounds for the positions of these limit cycles using rigorous computational methods based on interval arithmetic.

Regarding the pollution of water resources by organic matter, dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) are important indicators for their monitoring. In this way, this research presents a two-dimensional mathematical model in space that evolves over time, for the study of the variations in concentrations of these variables, through a coupled system of non-linear partial differential equations, with Holling type III reaction kinetics between DO and BOD. Under some simplifications, the stability of the equilibrium points of the model is analyzed. An approximate solution is proposed using the centered finite difference (CFD) method for spatial variables and the Crank–Nicolson method for the temporal variable. An upwind scheme was employed in the advective-term discretization . Computer simulations were performed using Matlab software, in a rectangular domain. For the advective transport, the influences of the wind and the current given by a parabolic profile were considered. We performed a series of space-time numerical simulations and found that the model allows the analysis of regions with higher and/or lower DO and BOD concentrations, as well as the temporal variations of concentrations at specific points in the domain, and the influence of diffusive-advective transport in the mass transfer process .},

Our goal here is to develop a fictitious domain method where one solves a variant of the original problem on the full Ω Ω , followed by a well–chosen correction over B B and corrections related to translation velocity and angular velocity of the particle. This method is of the virtual control type and relies on a least–squares formulation making the problem solvable by a conjugate gradient algorithm operating in a well chosen control space. Since the fully explicit scheme to update the particle motion using Newton’s equation is unstable, we propose and implement an explicit–implicit scheme in which, at each time step, the position of the particle is updated explicitly, and the solution of Navier-Stokes equations and particle velocities are solved by the the least–squares/fictitious domain method implicitly. Numerical results are given to verify our numerical method .},

However, how transaction costs affect the American option price, particularly the most important feature of American options, the optimal exercise price, is much less investigated. It is primarily because such a study must be conducted under an incomplete market, which presents additional difficulties on top of an already difficult nonlinear mathematical problem. This paper attempts to provide a supplement study in this area by analyzing the optimal exercise price of an American option in addition to the option price itself in the presence of transaction costs through a utility-based approach. With a computationally efficient numerical scheme , we are able to demonstrate clearly how the optimal exercise price should be calculated and consequently how the option prices for the buyer and writer as well as the early exercise decision are affected by the inclusion of transaction cost.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the observer-based controller design issue for a class of discrete-time networked nonlinear systems . Due to the stochastic effects, the switching between subsystems occurs. The persistent dwell-time switching mechanism, which is more general than dwell-time switching and average dwell-time switching mechanisms, can well describe these switching cases with both fast and slow switchings. Furthermore, there is packet dropout during data transmission, which is described by Bernoulli white sequence, and a corresponding mechanism is used to compensate for the impact of packet dropout. Then based on the Lyapunov function approach, some sufficient conditions for mean-square exponentially stable and an expected H ∞ H∞ performance are derived. Finally, an illustrative example that demonstrates the superiority and feasibility of the proposed method is given.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop an iterative scheme to construct multiscale basis functions within the framework of the Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM) for the mixed formulation. The iterative procedure starts with the construction of an energy minimizing snapshot space that can be used for approximating the solution of the model problem. A spectral decomposition is then performed on the snapshot space to form global multiscale space. Under this setting, each global multiscale basis function can be split into a non-decaying and a decaying parts. The non-decaying part of a global basis is localized and it is fixed during the iteration. Then, one can approximate the decaying part via a modified Richardson scheme with an appropriately defined preconditioner. Using this set of iterative-based multiscale basis functions, first-order convergence with respect to the coarse mesh size can be shown if sufficiently many times of iterations with regularization parameter being in an appropriate range are performed. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed computational multiscale method.},

New sufficient conditions for the leader-follower non-fragile consensus of FO linear multi-agent systems are presented.

In this paper, we analyze two kinds of modified multistep collocation methods for VIE3: collocation boundary value method with the fractional interpolation (FCBVM) and that with Lagrange interpolation (CBVMG). The former is developed based on the non-polynomial interpolation which is particularly feasible for approximating functions in the form of t η tη with the real number η ≥ 0 . η≥0. The latter is devised by using classical polynomial interpolation . The application of the boundary value technique enables both approaches to efficiently solve long-time integration problems. Moreover, we investigate the convergence properties of these two kinds of algorithms by Grönwall’s inequality.},

In addition, we investigate the sensitivities in the resulting prices, as well as the inherent errors, to changes in the underlying market conditions. Our numerical results demonstrate that the SWIFT method is not only more efficient when benchmarked to its closest competitors, such as the Fourier-cosine (COS) and the widely-acclaimed fast-Fourier transform (FFT) methods, but it is also robust across a range of different market conditions exhibiting exponential error convergence.},

This paper studies the effects of wealth-based rule in costly public goods games when individual selection is inevitable. Specifically, we assume that only the top V individuals with relatively high cumulative payoffs in each group can be selected for costly PGG. The results show that when V is large, the increase of participation cost has slight inhibitory effects on the evolution of cooperation, but it alleviates the polarization of individuals. However, when V is small, the increase of participation cost within a certain range promotes cooperation prosperity, but it also causes an increase in the proportion of polarized individuals and a widening of the wealth gap between rich and poor individuals.},

The convergences of the trainings in Critic-Actor neural networks are strictly proved without knowing the drift dynamics and the input dynamics in the presence of unknown nonlinearities and approximation errors. Using the residuals that are generated by measuring the difference of each network output and the measured engine output, various criteria are established for accomplishing the fault diagnosis task, that addresses the problem of fault detection and isolation of the system components. A number of simulation studies are carried out for combustion chamber of a single-spool jet engine to demonstrate and illustrate the advantages, capabilities, and performance of our proposed fault diagnosis scheme.},

For the purpose of eliminating the redundant computation and to deal with the associate terms caused by the model decomposition, inspired by the coupling concept, a partially-coupled nonlinear parameter optimization algorithm is proposed for the multivariate hybrid models.

In this paper, we initiate the study of maximal double Roman domination. We first show that the problem of determining γ d R m ( G ) γdRm(G) is NP-complete for bipartite, chordal and planar graphs. But it is solvable in linear time for bounded clique-width graphs including trees, cographs and distance-hereditary graphs. Moreover, we establish various relationships relating γ d R m ( G ) γdRm(G) to some domination parameters. For the class of trees, we show that for every tree T T of order n ≥ 4 , n≥4, γ d R m ( T ) ≤ 5 4 n γdRm(T)≤54n and we characterize all trees attaining the bound. Finally, the exact values of γ d R m ( G ) γdRm(G) are given for paths and cycles.},

An analysis result on the exponential H ∞ H∞ performance is presented by the use of a Lyapunov functional together with a few inequalities. On its basis, a linear matrix inequalities-based design scheme for the Luenberger observer is proposed by getting rid of the nonlinear terms composed of the Lyapunov matrix, the gain matrix, and an uncertainty matrix caused by the sensor failures. In the case when the factors of sensor failures and reaction-diffusion are not concerned, the design scheme is shown to be an improvement over an existing design scheme.

Many numerical methods have been developed in the last few decades for this purpose and are typically based on Riemann solvers, which are strongly dependent on the underlying eigen-structure of the governing equations. Objective of the present work is to develop simple algorithms which are not dependent on the eigen-structure and yet can tackle easily the hyperbolic parts. Central schemes with smart diffusion mechanisms are apt for this purpose. For fixing the numerical diffusion, the basic ideas of satisfying the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) conditions along with generalized Riemann invariants are proposed. Two such interesting algorithms are presented, which capture grid-aligned steady contact discontinuities exactly and yet have sufficient numerical diffusion to avoid numerical shock instabilities. Both the algorithms presented are robust in avoiding shock instabilities, apart from being accurate in capturing contact discontinuities, do not need wave speed corrections and are independent of eigen-struture of the underlying hyperbolic parts of the systems.},

Under digital communication channels, all transmitted signals between the system and the actuator (including the controller and the observer) will be quantized by the dynamic quantizers in the closed-loop system. Taking into consideration the design of the controller, observer, and dynamic parameters of quantizers, an effective matrix inequality decoupling method is presented to handle the problem. One is shown that the proposed design conditions of the controller, observer, dynamic parameters of quantizers are summarized in a matrix inequality, which can be synthesized synchronously. The resulting design ensures that the quantized closed-loop system can meet the prescribed H ∞ H∞ performance.

The waves are allowed to propagate through the interface, i.e., between the layer and the medium. Basic arithmetic procedures are employed to derive the dispersion equation for surface waves propagation. A comprising study is accomplished through numerical estimation to study the behavior of surface waves. Further analysis of surface waves in the absence of a liquid layer manifests that the phase velocity equation loses its dispersity like waves propagation in an isotropic medium. Some particular cases are extracted from the dispersion equation by taking correspondence with the results.

In this paper, we extend this model to the color image in the opponent color space, which is closer to human perception than the RGB space. It is important to extend the TV norm and the G-norm correspondingly because the color image is viewed as a vector-valued vector. We introduce the definition of the L 1 L1 norm and L ∞ L∞ norm for the vector-valued vector and accordingly define the TV norm and the G-norm for the color image. In order to handle the numerical difficulty caused by the non-differentiability of the TV norm and G-norm, the dual formulations are used to represent these norm. Then the decomposition problem is reformulated into a minimax problem. A first-order primal-dual algorithm is readily applied to compute the saddle point of the minimax problem. Numerical results are shown the performance of the proposed model.},

Note that the control strategy is implemented in a fully distributed manner, which means that it does not require any global network information. By using the multiple Lyapunov function approach based on edge-dependent average dwell time, this study presents the MASs subject to MSDoS attacks with limited attack frequency and attack width can achieve the specified time-varying state formation structure under the designed control strategy.

  abstract     = {The aim of the present paper is to provide new criteria for the asymptotic behaviors of dynamical systems , approaching simultaneously four directions: nonuniform, uniform stability and respectively nonuniform, uniform expansiveness, treating both discrete and continuous-time case and using computational type methods. In order to characterize the asymptotic properties of discrete variational systems, we consider two classes of weighted ℓ ∞ ℓ∞ -spaces and we define two types of nonuniform input-output properties, by employing spaces from these classes in the admissible pair . Our study continues the line initiated in Dragičević, Sasu and Sasu  [J. Differential Equations 268 (2020), 4786-4829] and [J. Dynam. Differential Equations, doi.org/10.1007/s10884-020-09918-4], giving a completely new perspective regarding the connections between admissibility techniques for stability and expansiveness. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for nonuniform, uniform exponential stability and also for nonuniform, uniform exponential expansiveness, providing a unified approach and emphasizing the key differences when passing from nonuniform to uniform behavior. Next, we present two categories of applications of the discrete-time results. First, we deduce criteria for stability and expansiveness in terms of input-output type properties along period orbits. After that, we obtain characterizations for uniform exponential stability and uniform exponential expansiveness of skew-product semiflows in terms of the solvability of an associated integral control system between well-chosen weighted spaces of continuous functions, pointing out new computational methods of recovering the continuous information from the discrete-time behavior in the framework of nonuniform input-output techniques. Our results are applicable to general classes of variational systems.},

  abstract     = {The theoretical approach for mathematical modeling of the evaporative convection in a multiphase system with interface based on the use of an exact solution of governing equations is discussed. The mathematical model builds on the “diffusive” laws of the transfer of matter, momentum and energy and includes the interface boundary conditions formulated with respect to the conservation laws. The carried out compatibility analysis of the equations concludes that there are three classes of exact solutions of the system under consideration. One of the possible solutions is circumstantially studied in the framework of the evaporative convection problem in a bilayer liquid – gas system, where both phases are the binary mixtures. The convection-diffusion equations are used to govern the transfer of one selected component and its vapor in the liquid and gas layers, respectively. The thermodiffusion effect is taken into account additionally for more precise description of heat transfer processes. The impact of this effect on the concentration and thermal characteristics as well as on the mass evaporation flow rate is investigated. It is shown that the utilized solution can describe convective regimes appearing on a working area of a long plane channel under thermal load distributed with respect to longitudinal coordinate by means of quadratic law. The solution correctly predicts hydrodynamical, temperature and concentration parameters of convective flows arising in the bilayer system. Basic characteristics calculated by this solution are feasible when the system is slightly deviated from the thermodynamic equilibrium state, and mass transfer through the interface is weak.},

However, it is hard to adequately explain the behavior patterns of conditional cooperation with the evolutionary game theory . This paper introduces expectation-based reinforcement learning methods in the public goods game to investigate and account for the behavior patterns. Instead of letting individuals occupy the entire network as previous studies have done, we focus on studying individual behavior patterns on a network with empty nodes. The results under total population density show the effectivity of our model as they are consistent with those of the previous studies, that is, individuals’ behavior exhibits conditional cooperation and its variant moody conditional cooperation. However, in the network with empty nodes, conditional cooperation shows opposite trends. We finally demonstrate that an appropriate population density can facilitate the maintenance and development of cooperation.},

The inverse problem theory is developed for this discrete system. We describe the two principal cases: degenerate and non-degenerate. For these two cases, appropriate inverse problems statements are provided, uniqueness theorems are proved, and reconstruction algorithms are obtained. Moreover, the relationship between the eigenvalues of the continuous problem and its finite-difference approximation is investigated. We obtain the “correction terms” for approximation of the discrete problem eigenvalues by using the eigenvalues of the continuous problem. Relying on these results, we develop a numerical algorithm for recovering the potential of the Sturm–Liouville operator with frozen argument from a finite set of eigenvalues. The effectiveness of this algorithm is illustrated by numerical examples.},

Even in the presence of cross-derivative terms, the discretization uses only nineteen point stencil. Extension of this newly proposed discretization to semi-linear and convection-diffusion-reaction problems is seen to be straightforward and this inherent advantage is thoroughly exploited. The scheme being designed on a transformation free coordinate system is found to be efficient in capturing boundary layers and preserve the nonoscillatory property of the solution. The proposed method is tested using several benchmark linear and nonlinear problems from the literature. Additionally, problems with sharp gradients are solved. These diverse numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme proposed. Further, the numerical rate of convergence is seen to approach four confirming theoretical estimation.},

Furthermore, the presented approach is adopted to solve the elastoplastic problem of functionally graded materials (FGMs). Using Galerkin weak form of elastoplastic problem, the meshfree RRKPM for elastoplastic problem of FGMs is established, and the penalty method is employed to impose the essential boundary conditions, then the corresponding formulas are obtained.

  abstract     = {The primary goal of this paper is to model and study the behavior of ellipsoidal microplastic particles in a 3D lid-driven cavity. An Eulerian equation for the hydrodynamics is solved toward stationarity under the Reynolds number 1000 and coupled with a Lagrangian system governing the particle dynamics. The key points of departure in the modeling are laminar flow and small particle Reynolds number under which the drag force has extensively been studied. We then address the question, what would be the behavior of prolate and oblate particles under extreme conditions, where the aspect ratio tends to either ∞ ∞ (thin needle) or 0 (thin disk). The corresponding tool, Singular Perturbation Theory, not only settles the analysis of the critical manifold but also underlies a quasi-steady state approximation (QSSA) of the particle velocity around the manifold. We show that in a certain range of particle aspect ratio, the QSSA gives quite good approximations of the particle positions yet more computational efficiency. Sedimentation is shown to highly be dependent on the particle’s initial position, aspect ratio, and size. Meanwhile initial position determines to which direction the fluid stream drifts the particles, larger size and aspect ratio closer to 1 increase the likelihood of sedimenting. We also show that neutrally buoyant particles prefer to deposit on the cavity base as well as on vorticity-dominating regions. Generally, buoyant particles with aspect ratios between 1 / 20 1/20 and 20 spin faster than tumble, and they spin even faster as the aspect ratio gets smaller.},

Second, we establish the upper semi-convergence from the numerical attractor towards the global attractor when the step size tends to zero. Third, we establish the upper semi-convergence from the random attractor of the stochastic sine-Gordon lattice equation to the global attractor when the intensity of noise goes to zero. Fourth, we show the finitely dimensional approximations of the three (numerical, random and global) attractors as the dimension of the state space goes to infinity. In a word, we establish four paths of convergence of finitely dimensional (numerical and random) attractors towards the global attractor.},

The problem of secure state estimation and attack reconstruction of cyber-attacks corrupting states of CPPS is addressed. First, the classical small signal model of CPPS under disturbance and cyber-attacks is established. Then, an intermediate observer is proposed to realize the security state estimation and state attack reconstruction of CPPS under cyber-attacks, meanwhile, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) is used to solve the parameters of the intermediate observer. Finally, an attack defense strategy satisfying optimal economic dispatch is proposed. Case studies are presented to assess the effectiveness of intermediate observer reconstruction and the effectiveness of defense strategy.},

The system outputs are measured by multiple groups of sensors and transmitted to observers through communication networks suffering from deception attacks. To attain real-time monitoring and interval estimation of the system state and achieve a satisfactory estimation accuracy, a distributed secure interval observation approach is presented, where the interval observer is composed of an upper-bounding observer and a lower-bounding observer. The construction of each interval observer is based on the system positivity and the bounds of parameter perturbation, disturbance input and attack signals. Using the stochastic finite-time boundedness and l 1 l1 -gain analysis method together with the linear programming technique, some sufficient conditions on analysis, design and optimization of the distributed interval observers for the uncertain positive system against deception attacks are established. The practicability and advantage of the proposed approach is checked by a numerical example, which comes from the remote monitoring of power distribution in smart grid.},

During the control design, uncertain nonlinearities are approximated by radial basis function neural networks. Moreover, the number of adaptive law is only one, thereby reducing the computational burden. Under the proposed quantized tracking control scheme, the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is validated and the output tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small domain of origin.

This biphase fluid flow model accounts for the capillary wall permeability, and the interstitial avascular phase, both being mixed in the limit homogenised problem. When the vessel walls become more permeable, we show that the biphase fluid flow exhibits a boundary layer that make the computation of the full problem costly and unstable. In the limit, both capillary and interstitial pressures coincide except in the vicinity of the boundary where different boundary conditions are applied. Thanks to a rigorous asymptotic analysis , we prove that the solution to the full problem can be approached at any order of approximation by a monophasic model with appropriate boundary conditions on the tumor boundary and appropriate correcting terms near the boundary are given. Numerical simulations in spherical geometry illustrate the theoretical results.},

Those studies focus on dependence structures arising from insurance businesses themselves and pay few attentions to dependence between insurance risk and investment risk. This study considers a continuous-time Poisson risk model with insurance claims and investment return jumps shocked by common systematic risk factors. Systematic risk factors cause immediate jumps of investment returns but there are often random delays for insurers to settle incurred claims. The study further assumes that the arrival times of claims are delayed by a common random time to the ones of their corresponding investment return jumps. When claim sizes are heavy-tailed distributed, a uniform asymptotic estimate for ruin probabilities of the model is established and a numerical study is given to show the accuracy of the result. The result captures the effect of the dependence structures caused by systematic risk factors on the asymptotic behaviors of ruin probabilities and allows arbitrary dependence structures between claim sizes and their corresponding investment return jumps.},

In the proposed study, the same concept of leader-based consensus is suggested to develop a consensus on the identical speed of several motors connected in a network with leader following topology. In this study, each of the motorized circuits is deliberated as an i th agent, and each agent of the proposed system is considered to have the same dynamics, an essential requirement to make a multi-agent system. Moreover, the consensus control algorithm is also modified as per the requirement of the proposed problem. Furthermore, the proposed study uses an observer-based approach to deal with the aforesaid problem due to the unavailability of direct measurement of the state variable i.e. speed, in the case of multi-motor systems the required output state is motors speed, in some of the industrial applications. The stability of the proposed system is established by developing a common Lyapunov function and is simulated in MATLAB.},

The present paper is concerned with the detailed theoretical and numerical study of a 4 × 4 4×4 non-linear, time-dependent first-order system that has been proposed for modelling the dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal subarachnoid space [14] , [15] , [53] . The system has also been proposed as a model for the dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the optic nerve [45] ; see also [39] ; in this case however, there are physiological aspects that require clarification, before a realistic application of the present model to optic nerve physiology is considered. Here we address mathematical aspects and prove a well-posedness theorem that identifies necessary and sufficient conditions for the system to be strictly hyperbolic and conditions under which the system is of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type. This result was anticipated in [53] and full details are given in [45] . We then address more generally the numerical implications for such type of systems. Solving numerically systems that contain a mixed elliptic-hyperbolic region is challenging. First, the use of upwind methods, so popular for hyperbolic first-order systems, is ruled out automatically here. One is then left with having to choose centred-type methods with great care. Moreover, the non-conservative character of the present system adds another challenge. Results for various representative examples are shown and analysed and the potential of the proposed model for simulating CSF dynamics in physiological and pathophysiological settings is discussed.},

We study an evolutionary process of public goods game among individuals in multiple groups in a population. We find that the existence of an independent cooperator group is beneficial to the rise of cooperation in the population, which is applicable to both Moran process and a so-called disaster update process proposed in this paper. However, the introduction of mutation can completely overturn the emerging trend of cooperation, and even let the defectors occupy the whole population for a short period of time, by continuously reducing the number of cooperator groups. In addition, the migration of individuals between groups can also inhibit cooperation. More specifically, a higher frequency of migration can reduce the probability of cooperators occupying the population, and extend the time it takes for the population to reach the stationary state. Furthermore, we find that a special kind of multi-individual migration, namely group division, can resist the anti-cooperation effect of mutation to some extent, mainly by maintaining a certain number of cooperator groups in the population. The aforementioned results suggest that cooperation can rise without strengthening the ability of cooperators to directly confront the defectors in a population composed of multiple groups.},

It is followed by the backward shift algorithm that was originally developed for estimating poles of linear time-invariant systems. After poles of linear subsystem are estimated, coefficients of linear and nonlinear subsystems are respectively determined by using the least squares (LS) method. The robustness of the backward shift algorithm guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the poles of linear subsystem are well located.

In our model, firstly, there are four players, and then we imitate real organism behavior, such as eating, migration, game, leaning, and reproduction. Meanwhile, during this process, finite resource also decreases with players’ consumption. After numerical simulation, we find that defectors can occupy the most resource-rich areas at first, but they cannot survive in hostile area and decrease rapidly. While cooperators always keep growing. In addition, when resources decrease substantially, cooperative behavior can be promoted.

  abstract     = {An emerging datacenter network (DCN) with high scalability called HSDC is a server-centric DCN that can help cloud computing in supporting many inherent cloud services. For example, a server-centric DCN can initiate routing for data transmission. This paper investigates the construction of independent spanning trees (ISTs for short), a set of the rooted spanning trees associated with the disjoint-path property, in HSDC. Regarding multiple spanning trees as routing protocol, ISTs have applications in data transmission, e.g., fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution. We first establish the vertex-symmetry of HSDC. Then, by the structure that n n -dimensional HSDC is a compound graph of an n n -dimensional hypercube Q n Qn and n n -clique K n Kn , we amend the algorithm constructing ISTs for Q n Qn to obtain the algorithm required by HSDC. Unlike most algorithms of recursively constructing tree structures , our algorithm can find every node’s parent in each spanning tree directly via an easy computation relied upon only the node address and tree index. Consequently, we can implement the algorithm for constructing n n ISTs in O ( n N ) O(nN) time, where N = n 2 n N=n2n is the number of vertices of n n -dimensional HSDC; or parallelize the algorithm in O ( n ) O(n) time using N N processors. Remarkably, the diameter of the constructed ISTs is about twice the diameter of Q n Qn .},

  abstract     = {This article presents a study of nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid near a parabolic surface under the influence of heat generation and MHD. AA7072 and AA7075 are treated as nano particles while mathanol is used as a base fluid. We incorporated aluminum alloy of AA7072 in a base fluid for nanofluid and AA7072+AA7075 in base fluid for hybrid nanofluid. AA7072 and AA7075 manipulated in this study are uniquely manufactured to possess high heat transfer features. AA7072 alloy is a combined mixture of zinc and aluminium with some metallic elements such as copper, silicon, and ferrous. Similarly AA7075 is a compounded mixture of zinc, magnesium, ferrous, and silicon. By using similarity transformations, the PDEs are transmuted into ODEs . Furthermore, the transmuted equations are than interpreted numerically in MATLAB using Bvp4c. The graphical analysis is performed for different parameters to check the behaviour of velocity and temperature profiles. Velocity field attains increasing behaviour by an accretion in volume fraction ϕ 1 ϕ1 for both methanol+AA7072(nanofluid) and methanol+AA7072+AA7075(hybrid nanofluid). The velocity profile for methanol+AA7072 is higher than methanol+AA7072+AA7075. By increasing magnetic field parameter M, the velocity component f ′ ( ψ ) f′(ψ) proceeds diminish trend for both methanol+AA7072 and methanol+AA7072+AA7075. But velocity field for methanol+AA7072 is moderate than methanol+AA7072+AA7075. The influence of heat generation parameter γ γ shows rising trend in temperature profile for both fluids. But heat generation parameter γ γ is more effective for hybrid nanofluid . Moreover, an entropy generation rate is also evaluated.},

The evidence shows the existence of individuals, who are still tested negative in tuberculin skin test after living with people with active tuberculosis for up to six months. Since the Mtb pathogen is spread from person to person through airborne particles, we build a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model to describe the initial infection with small amount of inhaled bacteria. The CTMC model successfully simulates sample paths presenting disease clearance. We apply the theory of multitype branching processes to analytically approximate the probability of disease clearance. We also estimate the disease clearance time, which is as less than a month for R 0 ∈ [ 1 , 1.5 ] R0∈[1,1.5] . Our results demonstrate that the host immune factors affect both the probability and the time of the disease clearance. These relationships are linked by the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 . Our findings provide new mechanisms for disease prevention and therapy developments.},

  abstract     = {The present work describes the implementation of an implicit time-integration numerical scheme to solve viscous flows in an in-house CFD solver. The scheme is developed to calculate engineering problems involving compressible flows. This work extends the defect-correction technique for the 3D flow calculations, and all mathematical formulations are described. The CFD solver is based on the finite-volume method (FVM) to calculate the three-dimensional flow and can be applied to solve unstructured meshes. The current implementation uses the Flux-Difference Splitting method (FDS) developed by Roe combined with the MUSCL method and the Venkatakrishnan flux limiters to provide better accuracy of the numerical solutions. The implicit time-integration scheme was linearized applying the backward Euler method on the left-hand side (LHS) and a Newton-type linearization on the right-hand side (RHS) of the governing equations. The Jacobian matrix was computed analytically for the inviscid fluxes using the Roe fluxes, and for the viscous fluxes differentiating the conservative vector. Earlier work by Cavalca et al. (2018) showed the robustness and accuracy of this implicit solver to predict inviscid flows over the airfoil and into the supersonic nozzle. Finally, the Gauss-Seidel (GS) iterative method was applied to solve the resultant sparse and large system of equations. These numerical schemes and methods were applied to solve the laminar flow over a flat plate. Afterwards, the numerical solution was validated and verified with the exact Blasius solution . From the results, the numerical simulations exhibited superior robustness of the implicit-defect correction scheme when compared with the explicit scheme for compressible flows. All numerical particularities and their implementations are detailed in this paper.},

An analytical continuation of the Epstein zeta-function to the whole complex s s -plane is constructed for the spatial dimension d d being a continuous variable ranging from 0 to ∞ ∞ . Zeros of the Epstein zeta-function ρ = ρ x + i ρ y ρ=ρx+iρy are defined by ζ ( d ) ( ρ ) = 0 ζ(d)(ρ)=0 . The nontrivial zeros split into the “critical” zeros (on the critical line) with ρ x = d 2 ρx=d2 and the “off-critical” zeros (off the critical line) with ρ x ≠ d 2 ρx≠d2 . Numerical calculations reveal that the critical zeros form closed or semi-open curves ρ y ( d ) ρy(d) which enclose disjunctive regions of the plane ( ρ x = d 2 , ρ y ) (ρx=d2,ρy) . Each curve involves a number of left/right edge points ρ * = ( d * 2 , ρ y * ) ρ*=(d*2,ρy*) , defined by a divergent tangent d ρ y / d d | ρ * dρy/dd|ρ* . Every edge point gives rise to two conjugate tails of off-critical zeros with continuously varying dimension d d which exhibit a singular expansion around the edge point, in analogy with critical phenomena for second-order phase transitions. For each dimension d &gt; 9.24555 … d&amp;gt;9.24555… there exists a conjugate pair of real off-critical zeros which tend to the boundaries 0 and d d of the critical strip in the limit d → ∞ d→∞ . As a by-product of the formalism, we derive an exact formula for lim d → 0 ζ ( d ) ( s ) / d limd→0ζ(d)(s)/d . An equidistant distribution of critical zeros along the imaginary axis is obtained for large d d , with spacing between the nearest-neighbour zeros vanishing as 2 π / ln d 2π/lnd in the limit d → ∞ d→∞ .},

The functionally graded (FG) carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) arch with shallow curvature is analysed under uniformly distributed transverse loading. The arch is assumed to rest on a three-parameter nonlinear elastic foundation in a uniform temperature field. Thermo-mechanical properties of the arch are graded through the thickness and are considered to be temperature-dependent. The equations of motion are established based on a general high-order shear deformation theory. These nonlinear equations are derived by Hamilton’s principle within the framework of the von Kármán assumption. The static equilibrium equations and dynamic equations of motion are solved analytically for the arch with immovable simply supported edges. The two-step perturbation technique and Galerkin method are implemented to obtain the closed-form solutions. The novel results illustrate the influences of CNT distribution pattern, foundation stiffness and geometrical parameters on the linear/nonlinear frequency and snap-through instability of the arch. It is shown that the minimum value of limit loads/frequencies belongs to the FG-O type of nanocomposite arches and the maximum ones are obtained in FG-X pattern.},

With the help of memory, we propose a stability-based strategy updating rule and study its effect on cooperative behaviors. Under this updating rule, the probability of learning strategy is affected not only by the difference of average payoffs but also the stability. Based on the prisoner’s dilemma game and snowdrift game, simulations show that compared with the Fermi rule, the introduction of stability enhances cooperative behaviors and average payoffs. Moreover, cooperators in population own much higher and more stable payoffs than defectors when considering long memories. Compared with the memory-based rule which considers the difference of average payoffs, the stability-based rule shows these superiorities on cooperators when the payoff parameters are relatively large, which suggests that the proposed rule exhibits its dominant position when the fluctuation of payoffs is obvious. According to this conclusion, we obtain the application scope enhancing cooperators of memory-based and stability-based rules, which maybe helpful in understanding the influence of these two rules on cooperation under different circumstances.},

The coupled system is formulated as a time-dependent interface problem based on Robin–Robin transmission conditions, for which the decoupling SWR algorithm is proposed and proved for the convergence. In this approach, the Stokes and Darcy problems are solved independently and globally in time, thus allowing the use of different time steps for the local problems. Numerical tests are presented for both non-physical and physical problems with various mesh sizes and time step sizes to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

This paper proposes an enhanced technique to numerically solve this identification problem, extending the conventional Newton–Raphson approach with second-order derivatives in the determination of the search direction. Despite the requirement to solve a nonlinear equation to obtain a search direction, the application of the Hadamard/Schur product operator enables the resulting formulation to be represented compactly and thus facilitates the development of an efficient and more robust solving-technique. Algorithms on the basis of this more enhanced solving method are then compared to a customized Newton–Raphson approach in simulation examples.},

Motivated by the papers [5] and [2], we perturb the disease transmission coefficient with a Gaussian white noise, formally modelled as the time derivative of a mean reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We remark that, thanks to a suitable representation of the solution to the deterministic SIS model, this perturbation is rigorous and supported by a Wong-Zakai approximation argument that consists in smoothing the singular Gaussian white noise and then taking limit of the solution from the approximated model. We prove that the stochastic version of the classic SIS model obtained this way preserves a crucial feature of the deterministic equation: the reproduction number dictating the two possible asymptotic regimes for the infection, i.e. extinction and persistence, remains unchanged. We then identify the class of perturbing noises for which this property holds and propose simple sufficient conditions for that. All the theoretical discoveries are illustrated and discussed with the help of several numerical simulations.},

In the deterministic case, by discussing the existence and stability of equilibria as well as equilibrium point bifurcations, we observe that the model can possess more than one positive equilibrium and exhibit rich dynamics such as bistability and complex bifurcations, meaning that its dynamics is easily affected by the environmental perturbations. In the stochastic case, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions we establish respectively the sufficient conditions for the ergodic stationary distribution and extinction of the model. Moreover, for the bistability scenario between a positive equilibrium and an interior limit cycle in the absence of noise, we can numerically observe the phenomenon of noise-induced state frequent switching between two stochastic attractors in the bistable zone. Biologically, our results can partially explain the phenomenon that in real world, for the inevitably small environmental noise intensities, the biological populations may remain at least two patterns of survival to switch.},

A hybrid switching scheme based on state-dependent switching and minimum dwell time constraint is developed to ensure the stability of closed-loop systems and satisfy the dwell-time requirement of turbofan systems. Then, a robust resilient controller is built by combining the DOBC approach and resilient control technique. Based on the multiple Lyapunov functions method, some easy-to-test results are given to guarantee that the closed-loop switched systems are asymptotically stable with H ∞ H∞ property.

  abstract     = {Interactions in biology and social systems are not restricted to pairwise but can take arbitrary sizes. Extensive studies have revealed that the arbitrary-sized interactions significantly affect the spreading dynamics on networked systems. Competing spreading dynamics, i.e., several epidemics spread simultaneously and compete with each other, have been widely observed in the real world, yet the way arbitrary-sized interactions affect competing spreading dynamics still lacks systematic study. This study presents a model of two competing simplicial susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemics on a higher-order system represented by simplicial complex and analyzes the model’s critical phenomena. In the proposed model, a susceptible node can only be infected by one of the two epidemics, and the transmission of infection to neighbors can occur through pairwise (i.e., an edge) and higher-order (e.g., 2-simplex) interactions simultaneously. Through a mean-field (MF) theory analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the model displays rich dynamical behavior depending on the 2-simplex infection strength. When the 2-simplex infection strength is weak, the model’s phase diagram is consistent with the simple graph, consisting of three regions: the absolute dominant regions for each epidemic and the epidemic-free region. With the increase of the 2-simplex infection strength, a new phase region called the alternative dominant region emerges. In this region, the survival of one epidemic depends on the initial conditions. Our theoretical analysis can reasonably predict the time evolution and steady-state outbreak size in each region. In addition, we further explore the model’s phase diagram both when the 2-simplex infection strength is symmetrical and asymmetrical. The results show that the 2-simplex infection strength has a significant impact on the system phase diagram.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of a spatial moments model (SMM) in approximating an individual-based model (IBM) dedicated to the study of the aggregation phenomenon in a phytoplankton population. The dynamic system of spatial moments consists of a system of integro-differential equations derived from a phytoplankton IBM. The later is built on the basis of stochastic processes describing the dynamics of phytoplankton cells and their interactions. These processes are: (1) the movement of cells, which takes into account the random dispersion of cells in water and the attraction between cells due to their chemosensory abilities, (2) the demographical process (cell division or cell death) in which, the effect of local competition for nutrient resources on the cell’s division process is taken into account through the use of density dependent division rate. We solve numerically the SMM and then simulate the two models (IBM and SMM), for a set of scenarios chosen to analyze the aggregation and the different interactions in the population. The numerical results have led to the conclusion that in contrast to the mean-field model (MFM), the method of spatial moments is efficient to capture the dynamics of the IBM. Further, the SMM easily permits the prediction of long term behavior of phytoplankton cells and their spatial structure, namely that the aggregation behavior of the cells is very much related to their cellular diffusion and the perceptual radius. Concerning competition on resources, this process has a short and medium-term effect on aggregation, since regardless of its intensity, in the long term the population tends to be stable with formation of aggregates, as a result of the equilibrium between different mechanisms, including reproduction, competition, diffusion and cells attractions due to chemosensory abilities.},

  abstract     = {We consider wave propagation across an infinite waveguide of an arbitrary bounded cross-section, whose interior is blocked by two identical thick perforated barriers with holes. When the holes are small, the waves over a broad range of frequencies are almost fully reflected. However, we show the existence of a resonance frequency at which the wave is almost fully transmitted, even for very small holes. Counter-intuitively, this resonance effect occurs for barriers of arbitrary thickness. We also discuss another asymptotic limit , in which the thickness of barriers grows to infinity but the fixed diameter of the holes can be large and even arbitrarily close to the diameter of the waveguide. The resonance scattering, which is known as tunneling effect in quantum mechanics, is demonstrated in a constructive way by rather elementary tools such as separation of variables and matching of the resulting series, in contrast to commonly used abstract methods such as searching for complex-valued poles of the scattering matrix or non-stationary scattering theory. In particular, we derived an explicit equation that determines the resonance frequency. The employed basic tools make the paper accessible to non-experts and educationally appealing.},

  abstract     = {Regional scale forest distribution models are important tools for biogeography and understanding the structure of forest communities in space. These models take climate and geographic variables as input and are therefore helpful for long-term decision support and climate adaptation planning. Generally, local processes of tree germination and seedling survival are resolved probabilistically with explanatory variables such as elevation, latitude, exposure, soil type, moisture availability, climate and weather inputs and `trained’ using landscape and regional presence-absence data and machine learning techniques. How seeds are distributed in these models, that is, determining the dispersal kernel, is far more problematic. The challenge is that variables conditioning vertebrate seed dispersal (motility and probability of utilization or caching in response to cover type) are not represented in large scale distribution models, and in fact vary on scales (10-100 meters) that are much smaller than the smallest pixel size for the distribution model (1-10 kilometers). We present a homogenized seed digestion kernel (HSDK) which incorporates this scale separation. Homogenization naturally links highly variable small-scale processes (like seed foraging and caching by birds and rodents) with large scale effects (like dispersal of seeds over tens of kilometers). We develop a homogenization strategy to predict seed dispersal on landscape scales, analytically linking small-scale variables (landscape fraction cover by tree type, gut residence times and cover type utilization by frugivorous birds) with large scale behaviors. Closed form approximations are developed in two dimensions for two limiting cases of seed handling behavior, and the approach is illustrated using landscape data and piñon-pine dispersal in a 630,000 square kilometer region in the southwestern US.},

  abstract     = {Explaining the evolution of cooperation represents one of the greatest challenges in both evolutionary biology and social science. However, asymmetrical interaction, as one typical characteristic of cooperative system, has not been sufficiently considered in the existing literature for the evolution of cooperation. Incorporating the asymmetry in the strategy sets, we here construct an asymmetric game model with the so-called carrot-stick strategy, which is a mixed strategy of reward and punishment. Based on mathematical analyses, it is unveiled that this asymmetric interaction can lower the dilemma of cooperation: the dominant players and recipient players might coexist through cycle frequency. Further analysis shows that the multi-equilibria are possible, which depend on the payoff parameters and the initial conditions. That is to say, by setting up different values of the cost-to-benefit, the punishment-to-benefit, and the reward-to-benefit, we can recover three basic evolutionary dynamics of systems: dominance; bistability and coexistence. These theoretical observations are consistent with existing empirical outcomes that asymmetric sanction or reward of host species might solve the conflicts between the actors in the fig-fig wasp mutualism or in the cleaner fish-client mutualism. It is thus suggested that this asymmetric strategy setup may shed new light into the solution of social dilemmas.},

First, a new inequality called reverse differential Gronwall inequality is established to achieve less conservative conditions for finite-time annular domain stability. Second, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the closed-loop system is finite-time annular domain stable by constructing a state feedback controller and an observer-based controller, respectively. All related conditions can be expressed in terms of matrix inequalities and corresponding algorithms are given.

The exact solutions are given in each time instant, which enables to express final results as appropriate limiting expressions. This enables more rigorous convergence analysis in terms of exact solutions. Finally, trajectories of state variables in considered dynamical systems can be generated by avoiding time-consuming numerical solving matrix differential equations inside the selected time interval . Using the fact that the stated dynamical systems are in the essence systems of linear equations , explicit solutions can be obtained using known techniques of ordinary differential equations . Main results of the paper are further transformations of obtained exact solutions using main properties of generalized inverses and linear algebra tools. It is important to mention that the convergence results are expressed in terms of expressions involving outer inverses.

  abstract     = {The electronic structure encapsulated in the density of states (DOS) is key to explain several physical properties of any material, i.e. from the knowledge of the DOS and its dependence on certain parameters it is possible to obtain a lot of information on the type of material and its behaviour. We outline in this article a series of methods that can be employed to classify and predict bulk DOS in an easy and efficient manner. These methods are based on machine learning techniques that are used to classify the elements and extract information from the DOS curves. We focus in particular in the bulk DOS of d-elements with different crystal lattices. We use a clusterization algorithm based on information obtained from the DOS, which is able to properly classify the elements in groups that are electronically similar. We find four groups clearly differentiated, whose more representative elements are scandium, iron, gold and mercury, and which tend to crystallize in similar lattice structures in their ground state. We further reduce the dimensionality of the data and find a new basis of DOS that, along with chemical properties of each type of element and basic information encapsulated in the DOS, is able to predict with a high degree of accuracy most of the original curves. We apply such basis and information to predict with reasonably accuracy the DOS curve of different elements. We also use that data to predict the chemical properties and the correlations between them. In particular, we apply the algoritm to calculate the Pauling electronegativity and find a rather good agreement between the predicted and real values. Finally, from intrinsic parameters, the DOS of other elements and additional information that is needed to properly describe the electronic structure, we predict the particular DOS of a particular element with a good degree of accuracy, including the width and general shape of the central part associated to the d states. These calculations prove that, by using pure electronic information encapsulated in the bulk DOS, it is possible to univocally classify materials and predict in a fast and accurate manner different physical and chemical properties.},

Extensive experimental and theoretical researches have shown that punishment can significantly facilitate cooperation. In nature and society, the individual continuously adjusts the degree of cooperation and severity of punishment. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for describing the learning rule of updating the input of cooperation and punishment cost. Cooperators performing both cooperation and punishment make a trade-off between public goods investment and punishment cost. We examine how the PSO learning rule affects the evolution of cooperation and punishment intensity. Our simulation results show that the intermediate values of weighting coefficient ω ω increase the input of punishment. More cooperators in the interior of clusters input punishment cost, which decreases the cooperation level. For low or high values of ω ω , cooperators decrease the input of punishment and only cooperators on the edge of clusters incline to punish defectors, which increases the cooperation level of population. Our research provides new insights on the coexistence of cooperation and punishment.},

The switching rule is constructed based on persistent dwell time (PDT) with an average dwell time (ADT) constraint. The introduced ADT constraint can allow a much smaller PDT lower bound to be designed, which provides more freedom of designing switching signal. Next, some time-varying dynamic output feedback controllers/detectors matching different switching processes of PDT are constructed such that the closed-loop systems meet the desired objectives. The corresponding robust control and fault detection levels can be characterized by a class of non-weighted performance indexes.

  abstract     = {In classical ruin theory, the time of ruin is defined as the time when the surplus of an insurance portfolio falls below zero. This simplification of a single barrier, however, needs careful adaptations to imitate the real-world liquidation process. Inspired by [7] and [24], this paper adopts a three-barrier model to describe the financial stress leading to bankruptcy of an insurer. The financial status of the insurer is classified into three states, namely, the solvent , the insolvent , and the liquidated . The insurer’s surplus processes at the states of solvent and insolvent are modeled by two spectrally negative Lévy processes, which have been taken as good candidates to model insurance risks in the recent literature. Accordingly, the time of liquidation is defined in this three-barrier model. By adopting the techniques of excursions in fluctuation theory, we obtain the joint distribution of the time of liquidation, the surplus at liquidation, and the historical high of the surplus until liquidation, which generalizes the known results on the classical expected discounted penalty function from [16] . The results have semi-explicit expressions in terms of the scale functions and the Lévy triplets associated with the two underlying Lévy processes. The special case when the two underlying Lévy processes coincide with each other or differ from each other by a constant drift term is also studied, and our results are expressed compactly via only the scale functions. The corresponding results are consistent with the classic works of literature on Parisian ruin with (or without) a lower barrier in [4,22], and [14]. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the underlying features of liquidation ruin.},

Two mutually uncorrelated random variables with known statistical properties are introduced to depict the existing RONs. Considering the case that the information concerning to the system modes cannot be completely acquired by the state estimator to be designed, the asynchronous phenomenon is considered via a hidden Markov model with only partial mode detection probabilities being accessible. By resorting to the intensive stochastic analysis as well as an improved complex-valued reciprocal convex inequality, some mode-dependent criteria are provided which ascertain that the estimation error system is asymptotically mean square stable. In addition, the estimator gains desired can be appropriately designed by resorting to feasible solutions of a set of complex matrix inequalities. One numerical example is also provided to demonstrate effectiveness of the estimation scheme proposed.},

Here, a quantized distributed model-free adaptive iterative learning bipartite consensus control (QDMFAILBC) approach is proposed based on the dynamic linearization technology, algebraic graph theory, and sector-bound methods. The proposed approach doesn’t require each agent’s dynamics knowledge and only uses the input/output data of MASs, where the data is coded by the logarithmic quantizer before being transmitted. Moreover, we consider both cooperative and competitive relationships among agents. We rigorously prove the stability of the proposed scheme and analyze the effects of data quantization. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that data quantization does not affect the stability of MASs, and bipartite consensus tracking errors can converge to zero with the processing of the proposed scheme, although the data quantization slows the convergence rate. Furthermore, the results are extended to switching topologies, and three simulation studies further validate the effectiveness of the designed method.},

Simultaneously, the particular Layapunov functions are constructed by feat of two auxiliary functions.

Switching instants with decrements and increments of the Lyapunov function are described as stable and unstable switching instants respectively. Firstly, a hybrid average dwell time strategy is proposed to restrict the occurrence ratio of unstable/stable switching instants and reasonably arranges the number of stable switching instants to offset the increment of the Lyapunov function caused by unstable switching instants and insolvabilities of the involved problem for all subsystems. Then, by interpolating the gains of adjacent controllers within the minimum dwell time, a dynamic error feedback controller with bumpless transfer property is designed to suppress the control bumps induced by controller switchings.

The innovation involved in the results of the work owes to the construction of a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to the handling of the asymmetric output constraint. By incorporated the BLF into the backstepping-like technique, a state feedback controller is first developed. An implementable observer is subsequently designed to estimate the unmeasurable system state . Lastly, an observer-based finite-time output feedback controller is explicitly proposed. Theoretically, the Lyapunov stability theory is adopted to show that the system states are finite-time stabilized under the presented control scheme. Meanwhile, the violation of a pre-established asymmetric output constraint is circumvented. To testify the derived theoretical results, the case studies of a permanent magnet linear motor system are offered.},

The analytical solution of the velocity profile is obtained using the semi-inverse approach for a perturbation approximation. The partial differential equation for the perturbation approximation is solved numerically, and compared with the analytical solution in order to validate the numerical scheme .

  abstract     = {To improve the performance of the low-order linear triangular element for solving transient wave propagation problems, this paper presents a novel enriched finite element method (EFEM) for wave analysis. The original linear nodal shape functions are enriched by using the additional interpolation cover functions over patches of elements. To effectively solve the wave problems, the used interpolation cover function is constructed by using the Lagrangian functions plus the harmonic trigonometric functions. The present approach can be regarded as a combination of the classical finite elements and the spectral techniques, but individual strengths of the two methods are synergized, so more accurate results can be obtained compared to the standard finite elements. In this work the root of the linear dependence (LD) issue in the present EFEM is investigated detailedly, and then an effective approach is proposed to completely eliminate the LD problem. By performing the dispersion analysis, it is found that the present EFEM possesses the attractive monotonic convergence property for transient wave propagations, that is the obtained numerical solutions will monotonically converge to the exact solutions with the decreasing time steps for time integration as long as the reasonably fine meshes are used. Several typical numerical examples are solved to illustrate the capacities of the present method.},

All these metrics have the common characteristic of not taking into account the density of the clusters. In this paper, we apply an analysis of network centrality, from a perspective oriented to ranking nodes, reinforcing dense communities using evaluating graphs using a two-trip transition probability matrix. We define a new centrality measure based on random walk betweenness. We study and analyse the new metric as a betweenness centrality measure with common characteristics with Pagerank, presenting through its practical implementation in some examples based on synthetic, and testing with well-known real-world networks. This method helps to increase the ranking of nodes belonging to dense clusters with a higher average degree than the remaining clusters, and it can detect the weakness of a network comparing it with the classical betweenness centrality measure.},

Since exposed individuals and infected individuals can infect the susceptible with different transmission rates, we use the Markovian approach to construct a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model with recurrent mobility patterns in the metapopulation network. We first theoretically calculate the epidemic threshold, and then, perform the proposed model in different underlying metapopulation networks, named as ER-like metapopulation network and BA-like metapopulation network. Simulation results indicate that BA-like metapopulation network is more conductive for epidemic spreading. Further research presents that both comprehensive interferences and the initial mobility rate can influence disease propagation heavily. In particular, for ER-like metapopulation network, comprehensive interferences can suppress the disease propagation when the initial mobility rate approaches to one. Whereas for BA-like metapopulation network, comprehensive interferences can contain the disease when the initial mobility rate is greater than a certain value. Meanwhile, implementing stronger interventions in patches with larger populations could reduce epidemic spreading effectively in BA-like metapopulation network. In addition, a long latent period could lead to the spread and infection of disease in both kinds of metapopulation networks.},

The first equation is of hyperbolic type and the second of elliptic type . Variational frames for obtaining weak solutions to the initial value Hasegawa–Mima problem with periodic boundary conditions were also derived. Using the Fourier basis in the space variables, existence of solutions were obtained. Implementation of algorithms based on Fourier series leads to systems of dense matrices. In this paper, we use a finite element space-domain approach to semi-discretize the coupled variational Hasegawa–Mima model, obtaining global existence of solutions in H 2 H2 on any time interval [ 0 , T ] , ∀ T [0,T],∀T . In the sequel, full-discretization using an implicit time scheme on the semi-discretized system leads to a nonlinear full space-time discrete system. For the existence proof, a condition on the time step is imposed that is independent from the space mesh size h h . For the uniqueness proof, a CFL-type of condition on the time step is imposed. Tests on a semi-linear version of the implicit nonlinear full-discrete system are conducted for several initial data , assessing the efficiency of our approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper will investigate the linear quadratic (LQ) control problem for a stochastic system with different intermittent observations. Different from traditional LQ control problems, two controllers with different information structures are considered to minimize a quadratic performance index. Specifically, the information sets available to two controllers are different and mutually exclusive (i.e., either of both is not the subset of the other one). The problem under consideration in this paper is an asymmetric information control problem. It is highlighted that previous literature on asymmetric information control mainly focused on the case when the information set is a subset of the other one. However, the case of the information sets being mutually exclusive remains less investigated to the best of our knowledge, which brings essential difficulties in finding the optimal control strategies: the structures and forms of two controllers are not clear; seeking for the solvability conditions of the optimal control problem is challenging. We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: Firstly, by adopting the convex variational method, the necessary and sufficient solvability conditions are derived under some basic assumptions, which are relied on the forward and backward difference equations (FBSDEs); Secondly, by decoupling the FBSDEs, the control strategies are derived; Finally, the results are extended to investigate the general multiple controllers case.},

  abstract     = {In industrial control systems , industrial infrastructure is often attacked by hackers. Due to the serious sample imbalance in industrial control data, the traditional machine learning method has poor performance in anomaly detection. In this paper, TrAdaboost algorithm is applied to industrial control anomaly detection. The samples that are easy to classify are taken as the source domain data, and the samples with poor classification effect are taken as the target domain. The source domain data is used to guide the target domain data training. Then, we improve the traditional TrAdaboost algorithm from two aspects of initial weight and final classifier, and apply it to industrial control anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm on two different industrial control data sets is verified. And the improved algorithm is compared with other traditional algorithms. The experimental results show that the improved TrAdaboost algorithm has a significant advantage in predicting categories with a small sample size. This algorithm can accurately identify a few abnormal samples. Moreover, the F1 value, recall and precision value of the improved TrAdaboost algorithm on the two data sets have been significantly improved. This indicates that the improved TrAdaboost algorithm greatly improves the overall prediction accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the H ∞ H∞ sliding mode control problem of persistent dwell-time switched nonlinear systems is investigated. Due to the limited bandwidth resources, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced to alleviate the transmission burden. Considering that the system parameters are switched in accordance with the persistent dwell-time switching strategy, a novel switched sliding mode control law is constructed. Then, drawing on the Lyapunov function approach, sufficient conditions are derived, which not only ensure the reachability of the sliding region around the specified sliding surface but also guarantee the globally uniform exponential stability of the system with an H ∞ H∞ performance. Moreover, the specific form of the controller gains is derived by utilizing an efficient decoupling method. Eventually, the validity of the proposed method is validated by two numerical examples .},
