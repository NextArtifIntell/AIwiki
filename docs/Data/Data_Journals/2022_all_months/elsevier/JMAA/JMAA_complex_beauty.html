  abstract     = {The strong truncated Hamburger moment problem (STHMP) of degree ( − 2 k 1 , 2 k 2 ) (−2k1,2k2) asks to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive Borel measure , supported on R R , such that β i = ∫ x i d μ ( − 2 k 1 ≤ i ≤ 2 k 2 ) βi=∫xidμ(−2k1≤i≤2k2) . The first solution of the STHMP, covering also its matrix generalization, was established by Simonov [60] , who used the operator approach and described all solutions in terms of self-adjoint extensions of a certain symmetric operator . Using the solution of the truncated Hamburger moment problem and the properties of Hankel matrices we give an alternative solution of the STHMP and describe concretely all minimal solutions, i.e., solutions having the smallest support. Then, using the equivalence with the STHMP of degree ( − 2 k , 2 k ) (−2k,2k) , we obtain the solution of the 2–dimensional truncated moment problem (TMP) of degree 2 k with variety x y = 1 xy=1 , first solved by Curto and Fialkow [22] . Our addition to their result is the fact previously known only for k = 2 k=2 , that the existence of a measure is equivalent to the existence of a flat extension of the moment matrix. Further on, we solve the STHMP of degree ( − 2 k 1 , 2 k 2 ) (−2k1,2k2) with one missing moment in the sequence, i.e., β − 2 k 1 + 1 β−2k1+1 or β 2 k 2 − 1 β2k2−1 , which also gives the solution of the TMP with variety x 2 y = 1 x2y=1 as a special case, first studied by Fialkow in [33] .},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the backward Euler based linear time filtering method for the developed energy-momentum-angular momentum conserving (EMAC) formulation of the time dependent-incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the case of weakly enforced divergence constraint. The method adds time filtering as a post-processing step to the EMAC formulation to enhance the accuracy and to improve the approximate solutions. We show that in comparison with the Backward-Euler based EMAC formulation without any filter, the proposed method not only leads to a 2-step, unconditionally stable and second order accurate method but also increases numerical accuracy of solutions. Numerical studies verify the theoretical findings and demonstrate preeminence of the proposed method over the unfiltered case.},

  abstract     = {Recent experiments have revealed the formation of stable droplets in a dipolar Bose–Einstein condensate ( BEC ). This surprising result has been explained experimentally by the stabilization provided by the three-body loss process that appears in the form of a critical damping term in an extended Gross–Pitaevskii equation ( eGPE ) to model the formation of these dipolar quantum droplets. This paper examines the dynamics of solutions to this equation ( eGPE ). We validate this prediction by proving that nonlinear damping prevents collapse and ensures the existence of global-in-time solutions. The asymptotic dynamics of these solutions are discussed as well, especially when the system is free (without potential). We show that all global solutions asymptotically behave as free waves in time.},

The Goodwin model, a prototypical negative feedback oscillator, has been applied largely in the studies of biological rhythms. By applying the degenerate Routh-Hurwitz criterion, we perform a thorough Hopf bifurcation analysis on the Goodwin model and two other models on negative feedback loops. We not only derive the precise conditions for the Hopf bifurcation in these models, but also obtain the frequencies of the bifurcating periodic solutions. Such frequencies are acquired by factorizing the characteristic polynomials of the linearized systems at the bifurcation points and the bifurcation values. We also compute the higher-order terms which determine the stability of the bifurcating periodic solution and other properties of the Hopf bifurcation for the Goodwin model. Our result indicates that the minimal Hill coefficient does not increase and no further condition is required for the bifurcating periodic solution to be stable. We allocate the parameter values according to the present theories to illustrate limit-cycle oscillations in several numerical examples for these models.},

  abstract     = {A converse is given to the well-known fact that a hyperplane localised zero mode of a crystallographic bar-joint framework gives rise to a line or lines in the zero mode (RUM) spectrum. These connections motivate definitions of linear zero mode spectra for an aperiodic bar-joint framework G G that are based on relatively dense sets of linearly localised flexes. For a Delone framework in the plane the limit spectrum L lim ( G , a _ ) Llim(G,a_) is defined in this way, as a subset of the reciprocal space for a reference basis a _ a_ of the ambient space. A smaller spectrum, the slippage spectrum L slip ( G , a _ ) Lslip(G,a_) , is also defined. For quasicrystal parallelogram frameworks associated with regular multi-grids, in the sense of de Bruijn and Beenker, these spectra coincide and are determined in terms of the geometry of G G .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the deformation of a semi-transparent body Ω resulting from its radiative heating by a black source S surrounding it at absolute temperature T S ( t ) for 0 ≤ t ≤ t f . This deformation is modeled during the thermal process by Maxwell&#39;s model of viscoelasticity theory with a viscosity in the constitutive equation depending on the absolute temperature T ( x , t ) solution of the heat transfer equations between S and Ω. The rate of thermal deformations is also taken into account in the constitutive equation. We consider a mixed formulation of the thermoviscoelasticity problem in the variables ( σ , v , ρ ) where σ is the Cauchy stress tensor field , v the velocity field , and ρ the vorticity tensor field. For the proof of the well posedness of this mixed formulation, we will need to prove that ∂ T ∂ t exists and is continuous on Q ¯ , where Q : = Ω × ] 0 , t f [ . This regularity result plays a critical role in proving the boundedness of a family of linear operators that leads directly to establishing the time regularity of the stress fields of a family of auxiliary elasticity problems. It is precisely these auxiliary stress fields that will allow us to find the unique stress field for the dual mixed formulation of our non-isothermal Maxwell model.},

Then, by choosing the tanh-function solution as a seed, we implement the one-fold BDT and obtain two new types of soliton solutions including the exponential and exponential-and-rational types. Both two types of solutions are nonsingular with a wide range of parameter regimes, and they can describe the elastic soliton interactions over the nonzero background with the asymptotic phase difference π as x → ± ∞ x→±∞ . Also, we derive the expressions of all asymptotic solitons and discuss the parametric conditions for different soliton profiles. It turns out that each asymptotic soliton can display both the dark and antidark soliton profiles or exhibit no spatial localization, which confirms that the focusing NNLS equation admits a rich variety of soliton interactions like the defocusing NNLS case.},

Following the latter approach and the work of Titchmarsh (1986), we present an explicit version of the Atkinson formula, improving on a recent bound by Simonič (2020). Moreover, we extend the Atkinson formula to the range ℜ(s)∈[14,34] , giving an explicit bound for the square mean integral value of ζ and improving on a bound by Helfgott and the authors (2019). We use mostly classical tools, such as the approximate functional equation and the explicit convexity bounds of the zeta function given by Backlund (1918).},

We overcome this by transforming it into an equivalent stochastic control problem in which the control constraint is state-independent so that the standard theory can be applied. We give an explicit optimal consumption-investment strategy when the constraint is homogeneous. When the constraint is non-homogeneous, it is shown that the value function is third-order continuously differentiable by a differential equation approach, and a feedback form optimal consumption-investment strategy is provided. According to our findings, if the investor is concerned with long-term more than short-term consumption, then she should always consume as few as possible; otherwise, she should consume optimally when her wealth is above a threshold, and consume as few as possible when her wealth is below the threshold.},

Our method employs suitable results from the theory of general resolvent families of operators.

Our GLQ includes most existing stochastic LQ forms as its special cases, and also widens new frontier beyond. We first derive a generalized stochastic maximum principle for GLQ which involves projection and conditional expectation operators both. Then, focusing on information constraint, we further study its open-loop solvability in dynamically recursive context. Moreover, we derive and compare the optimal values for various information structures of GLQ via closed-loop representation, that reveals a novel insight on underlying information capacity. In particular, information redundancy , efficiency and monotonicity in stochastic LQ setting are first addressed.},

  abstract     = {Inclusion of a term − γ ∇ ∇ ⋅ u −γ∇∇⋅u , forcing ∇ ⋅ u ∇⋅u to be pointwise small, is an effective tool for improving mass conservation in discretizations of incompressible flows . However, the added grad-div term couples all velocity components decreasing sparsity and increasing the condition number in the linear systems that must be solved every time step. To address these three issues various sparse grad-div regularizations and a modular grad-div method have been developed. We develop and analyze herein a synthesis of a fully decoupled, parallel sparse grad-div method of Guermond and Minev with the modular grad-div method. Let ⁎ G ⁎ = − d i a g ( ∂ x 2 , ∂ y 2 , ∂ z 2 ) G⁎=−diag(∂x2,∂y2,∂z2) denote the diagonal of G = − ∇ ∇ ⋅ G=−∇∇⋅ , and α ≥ 0 α≥0 an adjustable parameter. The 2-step method considered is ⁎ ⁎ 1 : u ˜ n + 1 − u n k + u n ⋅ ∇ u ˜ n + 1 + ∇ p n + 1 − ν Δ u ˜ n + 1 = f &amp; ∇ ⋅ u ˜ n + 1 = 0 , 2 : [ 1 k I + ( γ + α ) G ⁎ ] u n + 1 = 1 k u ˜ n + 1 + [ ( γ + α ) G ⁎ − γ G ] u n . 1:u˜n+1−unk+un⋅∇u˜n+1+∇pn+1−νΔu˜n+1=f&amp;#x26;∇⋅u˜n+1=0,2:[1kI+(γ+α)G⁎]un+1=1ku˜n+1+[(γ+α)G⁎−γG]un. We prove its unconditional, nonlinear, long time stability in 3 d for α ≥ 0.5 γ α≥0.5γ . The analysis also establishes that the method controls the persistent size of | | ∇ ⋅ u | | ||∇⋅u|| in general and controls the transients in | | ∇ ⋅ u | | ||∇⋅u|| when u ( x , 0 ) = 0 u(x,0)=0 and f ( x , t ) ≠ 0 f(x,t)≠0 provided α &gt; 0.5 γ α&amp;gt;0.5γ .

Also we establish the connection between CDF of the McKay I ν Iν Bessel rv and another important CDF which belongs to the non–central chi–square law. Another goal is to give answers to the moment determinacy problem, unimodality and some mode results for this distribution.},

  abstract     = {We formulate and analyze a general diffusive host-pathogen model with an incubation period and nonlocal infections in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The model system is partially degenerate and the solution map is not compact. We first prove that the solutions of the model exist globally and are ultimately bounded. Next, we define the basic reproduction number R0 as the spectral radius of the sum of two next generation operators corresponding to direct and indirect infection modes, and prove that R0 is decreasing with respect to the incubation period and the diffusion coefficient of infectious hosts under some conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that the model system possesses a global attractor, and explore the global dynamics of the system. Especially, we show that the infection-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable if R0≤1 . On the other hand, if R0&amp;gt;1 , then the infection will persist and the model system admits at least one positive steady state. For spatial homogeneous system , global asymptotic stability of the positive steady state is proved via Lyapunov functional technique. Numerical simulation is conducted to explore singular perturbation phenomenon when the diffusion coefficients approach zero. We observe that the diffusion will not only spread the infection to the low-risk region, but it may also increase the infection level in the high-risk region.},

Since the shortest geodesic is used to define an interaction between two particles, if there exist two or more than two shortest geodesics, then the system is not well-defined. In this paper, instead of using the shortest geodesic to define an interaction between two particles, we use all geodesics to define an interaction. From this assumption, we can relax the a-priori condition and conditions on communication functions. We also explain the relationship between the suggested model and previous models. Finally, we provide some emergent behaviors on some specific manifolds (e.g. flat torus , flat Möbius strip , and flat Klein bottle). From these results, we can discuss how the topology of the domain effects to emergent behaviors of the CS model on manifolds.},

Since this equation features the Basset history integral, the popularity of this equation has broadened the use of a certain form of fractional differential equation to study inertial particle motion. In this paper, we give a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Maxey-Riley equation. In particular, we build on previous local in time existence and uniqueness results to prove that solutions of the Maxey-Riley equation are global in time. In doing so, we also prove that the notion of a maximal solution extends to this equation. We furthermore prove conditions under which solutions are differentiable at the initial time. By considering the derivative of the solution with respect to the initial conditions, we perform a sensitivity analysis and demonstrate that two inertial trajectories can not meet, as well as provide a control on the growth of the distance between a pair of inertial particles. The properties we prove here for the Maxey-Riley equations are also possessed, mutatis mutandis, by a broader class of fractional differential equations of a similar form.},

The size of the microrotation viscosity and angular viscosity coefficients allows us to measure, in a certain sense, the derivation of flows of micropolar fluids from the flows of the Navier-Stokes model. Here we study vanishing coefficients limit of the above two viscosities, and give the convergence rates.},

Historically, mock theta functions can be represented as Eulerian forms, Appell-Lerch sums, Hecke-type double sums, and Fourier coefficients of meromorphic Jacobi forms. In this paper, in view of the q -Zeilberger algorithm and the Watson–Whipple transformation formula, we establish five three-parameter mock theta functions in Eulerian forms, and express them by Appell–Lerch sums. Especially, the main results generalize some two-parameter mock theta functions. For example, setting ( m , q , x ) → ( 1 , q 1 / 2 , x q − 1 / 2 ) (m,q,x)→(1,q1/2,xq−1/2) in ∑ n = 0 ∞ ( − q 2 ; q 2 ) n q n 2 + ( 2 m − 1 ) n ( x q m , x − 1 q m ; q 2 ) n + 1 , ∑n=0∞(−q2;q2)nqn2+(2m−1)n(xqm,x−1qm;q2)n+1, we derive the universal mock theta function g 2 ( x , q ) g2(x,q) .},

  abstract     = {A one-dimensional nonlinear model of the so-called upper hybrid oscillations in a magnetoactive plasma is investigated taking into account electron-ion collisions. It is known that both the presence of an external magnetic field of strength B 0 B0 and a sufficiently large collisional factor ν help suppress the formation of a finite-dimensional singularity in a solution (breaking of oscillations). Nevertheless, the suppression mechanism is different: an external magnetic field increases the oscillation frequency, and collisions tend to stabilize the medium and suppress oscillations. In terms of the initial data and the coefficients B 0 B0 and ν , we establish a criterion for maintaining the global smoothness of the solution. Namely, for fixed B 0 B0 and ν &gt; 0 ν&amp;gt;0 one can precisely divide the initial data into two classes: one leads to stabilization to the equilibrium, and the other leads to the destruction of the solution in a finite time. Next, we examine the nature of the stabilization. We show that for small | B 0 | |B0| an increase in the intensity factor first leads to a change in the oscillatory behavior of the solution to monotonic damping, which is then again replaced by oscillatory damping. At large values of | B 0 | |B0| , the solution is characterized by oscillatory damping regardless of the value of the intensity factor ν .},

Outcomes of the therapy in our model are largely determined by the infectivity constant, the infection value, and stochastic relative immune clearance rates. The infection value is a universal critical value for immune-free ergodic invariant probability measures and persistence in all cases. Asymptotic behaviors of the stochastic model are similar to those of its deterministic counterpart. Our stochastic model displays an interesting dynamical behavior, stochastic Hopf bifurcation without parameters, which is a new phenomenon. We perform numerical study to demonstrate how stochastic Hopf bifurcation without parameters occurs. In addition, we give biological implications about our analytical results in stochastic setting versus deterministic setting.},

More precisely, by using the notion of convex curvilinear integral , provided by uncertain complete integrable controlled Lagrange 1-form, and the concept of robust weak optimal solution to the problem under study, we build a new math context to state the optimality conditions which are necessary and sufficient for a point to be an extreme of the new studied class of robust optimization problems with uncertainty in the constraint and objective functionals.

Hence the corresponding cases of the three-dimensional inequality are proved. Second, we show that the three-dimensional inequality is equivalent to an improved Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to present a new and complete study based on input-output methods for exponential expansiveness of discrete variational systems, treating both the nonuniform behavior and the uniform one. We continue the line of studies initiated in Dragičević et al. (2020) [19] and Dragičević et al. (2022) [20] , providing a new approach in exploring the expansiveness properties. We associate to a discrete variational system a control type system that consists of a family of input-output discrete-time equations defined between two sequence spaces whose norms are translations invariant and we introduce new concepts of exact admissibility that rely on nonuniform local conditions. First, by imposing some minimal hypotheses on the input space or respectively on the output space, we establish connections between the exact admissibilities and the nonuniform exponential expansiveness. Moreover, we give for the first time a complete description of the structure of exactly admissible pairs that can be considered to explore nonuniform expansive behaviors in the discrete variational case. In addition, all the hypotheses on the classes from which we choose the input or the output spaces are motivated by illustrative examples. Next, we present characterizations for uniform exponential expansiveness via certain nonuniform exact admissibilities and we generalize the recent criteria for expansiveness of dynamical systems from Dragičević et al. (2020) [19] . Furthermore, we show via relevant examples that the results are the most general and the working hypotheses cannot be weakened or removed. As application, we give general criteria for uniform exponential expansiveness of skew-product semiflows in terms of nonuniform admissibility properties with sequence spaces invariant under translations.},

As it is known from the Hartogs&#39;s theorem, for a complex function with two complex variables, the joint analyticity with respect to two variables can be derived from combining of analyticity with respect to each variable. However, as a function of two real variables for space and time, the joint space-time analyticity of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations cannot be directly obtained from the combination of space analyticity and time analyticity. Our result seems to be the first quantitative result for the joint space-time analyticity of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, and the proof only involves real variable methods. Moreover, the decay rate estimates also yield the bounds on the growth (in time) of radius of space analyticity, time analyticity, and joint space-time analyticity of solutions.},

Then we investigate the stability of this spherical symmetric transonic shock solution to the 3-D axisymmetric steady isentropic Euler system with external force when the incoming supersonic flow and the nozzle boundary and the exit pressure and the external force are suitable perturbed. One of new ideas in the analysis is to use the deformation-curl decomposition provided in [21] to deal with the transonic shock problem.},

In this paper, we extensively study L 0 L0 -convexly compact sets in random locally convex modules so that a series of fundamental results are obtained. First, we show that every L 0 L0 -convexly compact set is complete (hence is also closed and has the countable concatenation property). Then, we prove that any L 0 L0 -convexly compact set is linearly homeomorphic to a weakly compact subset of some locally convex space , and simultaneously establish the equivalence between L 0 L0 -convex compactness and convex compactness for a closed L 0 L0 -convex set. Finally, we establish Tychonoff type, James type and Banach-Alaoglu type theorems for L 0 L0 -convex compactness, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Structural changes of the pore space and clogging phenomena are inherent to many porous media applications. However, numerical investigations of the related flow and transport problem remain challenging due to the degeneration of the hydrodynamic parameter porosity, and in turn of the permeability and diffusion tensor. A remedy is to use appropriate scalings of the unknowns velocity, pressure and species&#39; concentration in terms of the porosity. This enables us to conduct numerical simulations for the combined, degenerating flow and transport problem. As discretization method, lowest order mixed finite elements are used and stability of the numerical scheme is shown. Under certain additional regularity assumptions, convergence (with optimal order) can be proven. Our numerical results confirm that optimal convergence is obtained for the transformed variables whereas the non-transformed variables might not converge.},

In particular, we completely extend the fractional Bloom theory of Holmes, Rahm, and Spencer to the two matrix weighted setting with a matrix symbol and also provide new two matrix weighted norm inequalities for commutators of fractional integral operators with a matrix symbol and two arbitrary matrix weights . These results are new even in the scalar one weighted setting with a scalar symbol.},

For real or complex matrices A and B it is said that B Lyapunov dominates A if ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ H = H ⁎ , H A + A ⁎ H ⩾ 0 ⇒ H B + B ⁎ H ⩾ 0 . H=H⁎,HA+A⁎H⩾0⇒HB+B⁎H⩾0. (In case A and B are real we usually restrict to real Hermitian matrices H , i.e., symmetric H .) Hence B Lyapunov dominates A if all Lyapunov solutions of A are also Lyapunov solutions of B . In this paper we restrict to the case that appears in the study of Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation, namely where B is in the bicommutant of A and where A is Lyapunov regular, meaning the eigenvalues λ j λj of A satisfy λ i + λ ‾ j ≠ 0 , i , j = 1 , … , n . λi+λ‾j≠0,i,j=1,…,n. In this case we provide a matrix criterion for Lyapunov dominance of A by B . The result relies on a class of ⁎-linear maps for which positivity and complete positivity coincide and a representation of ⁎-linear matrix maps going back to work of R.D. Hill. The matrix criterion asks that a certain matrix, which we call the Hill-Pick matrix, be positive semidefinite .},

  abstract     = {We study the fractal pointwise convergence for the equation i ħ ∂ t u + P ( D ) u = 0 iħ∂tu+P(D)u=0 , where the symbol P is real, homogeneous and non-singular. We prove that for initial data f ∈ H s ( R n ) f∈Hs(Rn) with s &gt; ( n − α + 1 ) / 2 s&amp;gt;(n−α+1)/2 the solution u converges to f H α Hα -a.e., where H α Hα is the α -dimensional Hausdorff measure. We improve upon this result depending on the dispersive strength of P . On the other hand, for a family of polynomials P and given α , we exploit a Talbot-like effect to construct initial data whose solutions u diverge in sets of Hausdorff dimension α . To compute the dimension of the sets of divergence, we adopt the Mass Transference Principle from Diophantine approximation. We also construct counterexamples for quadratic symbols like the saddle to show that our positive results are sometimes best possible.},

In Fréchet spaces, we consider approximations by one single-valued mapping such that the inverse of it has convex fibers. Subsequently, in Banach and finite-dimensional spaces, we focus on approximations determined by a convex set of bounded linear mappings such as Páles-Zeidan Jacobian, Clarke&#39;s generalized Jacobian, shields by T.H. Sweetser, or Neumaier&#39;s interval extensions of the derivative of a smooth mapping. As easy corollaries in Euclidean spaces , we obtain perturbation stability of the property of metric semiregularity under the additive perturbation by a single-valued mapping having sufficiently small calmness modulus; as well as the non-smooth Lyusternik-Graves theorem and Robinson&#39;s theorem by A.F. Izmailov. Finally, given two quadratic mappings f and g , a polyhedral convex set Ω, and an ordered interval Θ, we provide conditions guaranteeing that an ordered interval Γ is such that for each y ∈ Γ y∈Γ there is an x ∈ Ω x∈Ω with y = f ( x ) y=f(x) and g ( x ) ∈ Θ g(x)∈Θ .

The class of p -radial distributions is extended to p -balls in classical matrix spaces, both for self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint matrices. The eigenvalue distribution of a self-adjoint random matrix, chosen in the matrix p -ball according to such a distribution, is determined. Similarly, the singular value distribution is identified in the non-self-adjoint case.

We prove that if deg ⁡ ( A ) deg⁡(A) is even or deg ⁡ ( B ) &gt; ( deg ⁡ ( A ) − 1 ) / 2 deg⁡(B)&amp;gt;(deg⁡(A)−1)/2 then the equation has at most two rational solutions. For any other case, an upper bound on the number of rational solutions is obtained. Moreover, we prove that if there are more than ( deg ⁡ ( A ) + 1 ) / 2 (deg⁡(A)+1)/2 rational solutions then the equation admits a Darboux first integral.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this note is to provide a full space quadratic external field extension of a classical result of Marcel Riesz for the equilibrium measure on a ball with respect to Riesz s -kernels. We address the case s = d − 3 s=d−3 for arbitrary dimension d , in particular the logarithmic kernel in dimension 3. The equilibrium measure for this full space external field problem turns out to be a radial arcsine distribution supported on a ball with a special radius. As a corollary, we obtain new integral identities involving special functions such as elliptic integrals and more generally hypergeometric functions . It seems that these identities are not found in the existing tables for series and integrals, and are not recognized by advanced mathematical software. Among other ingredients, our proofs involve the Euler – Lagrange variational characterization , the Funk – Hecke formula, the Weyl regularity lemma, the maximum principle, and special properties of hypergeometric functions .},

We prove the improbability of the 2-collision singularities with zero spiral vectors. By constructing singularities, we prove the Lebesgue measure of singularities is infinity and singularities are of the second Baire category. The singularities are not negligible in the measure-theoretic or the topological sense, and we thus solve Littlewood&#39;s thirteenth problem in the relativistic situation.},

A new regime quintic Uniform Algebraic Hyperbolic (QUAH) tension B-spline with a very well-known method called Differential Quadrature Method (DQM) is used. Over the past few years, the idea of consuming DQM to solve partial differential equations numerically has acknowledged much consideration all over the science community. Initially, the QUAH tension B-spline is used as a basis function in DQM to solve the weighting coefficients . After calculating weighting coefficients , the basis function converts the Initial boundary value problem into an ordinary differential equation , which is further solved by using a strong preserving Runge-Kutta 43 regime. Then, to check the accuracy and amendment of the used method, different test problems are solved numerically as well as error norms L 2 L2 and L ∞ L∞ are calculated. Calculated results are shown graphically and in tabular form for quick and easy access. An obtained result gives the insight that the proposed technique is effective and efficient for elucidating the variety of complex partial differential equations .},

Well known examples of such cylinders are the grim reaper translating solitons for the mean curvature flow. For such solitons, F. Martín, J. Pérez-García, A. Savas-Halilaj and K. Smoczyk proved that, if Σ is a properly embedded translating soliton with locally bounded genus and C 1 C1 -asymptotic to two vertical planes, outside a cylinder, then Σ must coincide with some grim reaper translating soliton. In this paper, applying the moving plane method of Alexandrov together with a strong maximum principle for elliptic operators , we increase the family of [ φ , e → 3 ] [φ,e→3] -minimal graphs where these types of results hold under different assumption of asymptotic behaviour .},

It is shown that the system satisfies the genuine coupling condition of Humpherys [23] , which is, in turn, an extension to higher order systems of the classical condition by Kawashima and Shizuta [30] , [42] for second order systems. It is proved that genuine coupling implies the decay of solutions to the linearized system around a constant equilibrium state. For that purpose, the symmetrizability of the Fourier symbol is used in order to construct an appropriate compensating matrix. These linear decay estimates imply the global decay of perturbations to constant equilibrium states as solutions to the full nonlinear system , via a standard continuation argument.},

These functions are extensively used in economics (inequality and risk analysis) and machine learning (evaluation of the performance of binary classifiers). We also compute the maximal L 1 L1 -distance between two Lorenz (or ROC) curves with specified Gini coefficients. This result allows us to introduce a bidimensional index to compare two of such curves, in a more informative and insightful manner than with the usual unidimensional measures considered in the literature (Gini index or area under the ROC curve). The analysis of real income microdata illustrates the practical use of this proposed index in statistical inference .},

  abstract     = {A nonnegative continuous-state branching process becomes extinguishing if it converges to 0 as time goes to infinity but never hits 0 in finite time. We consider a class of continuous-state nonlinear branching processes obtained from spectrally positive stable like Lévy processes by Lamperti type time changes using regularly varying (at 0+) rate functions, and obtain several large time asymptotic results on the extinguishing behaviors. In particular, we show that, depending on whether the stable index for the spectrally positive Lévy process is smaller than or equal to the regularly varying index for the rate function, a phase transition occurs from convergence in distribution to convergence in probability for the rescaled first passage times of levels approaching 0. For the later case, we further find conditions on almost sure convergence for the rescaled first passage times . We also obtain integral tests on almost sure long time fluctuations of the running minimum for the nonlinear branching process.},

Then, the basic reproduction number is given and a threshold dynamics is established. Finally, when there is a positive steady state, we investigate the asymptotic profiles of the positive steady state when host individuals disperse at small or large rate. Our results show that the incubation period can significantly enhance the persistence of the disease if the dispersal rate of susceptible hosts or exposed hosts is small or large.},

With the help of Harnack inequalities and the detailed asymptotic higher order expansion, the precise asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions is established. Our results show that these traveling wave solutions decay algebraically, and the corresponding decaying rates of traveling wave solutions are independent of the delay. To illustrate our results on the asymptotic behavior, several degenerate equations are investigated. For a special equation, we present that the delay could affect the asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions. Furthermore, based on the special asymptotic behavior, we obtain the uniqueness up to translation and Lyapunov stability of traveling wave solutions.},

We prove the existence of a martingale solution and its continuous dependence on the initial state and deterministic external forces. The analysis is based on the stochastic compactness method and the Jakubowski generalization of the Skorokhod Theorem for nonmetric spaces. Moreover, in the case of 2D domains we prove the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution. Using the Maslowski-Seidler result we prove the existence of an invariant measure for the semigroup corresponding to the strong solutions of the MHD equations in 2-dimensional Poincaré domains. The results concerning the continuous dependence play an important role in proving sequentially weak Feller property of this semigroup. The aim of the paper is to extend the results obtained in [4] and [5] for the Navier-Stokes equations to the MHD equations.},

If G admits a quasicrystal, then it is known that this quasicrystal is a universal sampling and universal interpolation set. However, there exist simple groups without quasicrystals. In this work, we fill this gap. We prove that G admits universal sampling and interpolation sets, provided that G is also compactly generated. If G is not assumed to be compactly generated, we prove the existence of universal sampling or interpolating sets in a slightly weaker sense.},

Such coupled PDE systems have been used in the literature to describe the blood transport process in mammalian vascular systems. In particular, the deformations of the boundary interface (thin layer) are described via the two dimensional elastic equation. The present work constitutes an investigation of the extent of the stabilizing effects of the underlying fluid dissipation – across the boundary interface – upon both the thick and thin structural components. (All three PDE components evolve on their respective geometries.) In this regard, our main result is the derivation of uniform decay rates for classical solutions of this multilayered PDE model. To obtain these estimates, necessary a priori inequalities for certain static multilayered PDE models are generated here to ultimately allow an application of a wellknown resolvent criterion for rational decay.},

  abstract     = {Following the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK in late 2020 and the emergence of the alpha (also known as B117) variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a third national lockdown was imposed from January 4, 2021. Following the decline of COVID-19 cases over the remainder of January 2021, the question of when and how to reopen schools became an increasingly pressing one in early 2021. This study models the impact of a partial national lockdown with social distancing measures enacted in communities and workplaces under different strategies of reopening schools from March 8, 2021 and compares it to the impact of continual full national lockdown remaining until April 19, 2021. We used our previously published agent-based model, Covasim, to model the emergence of the alpha variant over September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 in presence of Test, Trace and Isolate (TTI) strategies. We extended the model to incorporate the impacts of the roll-out of a two-dose vaccine against COVID-19, with 200,000 daily vaccine doses prioritised by age starting with people 75 years or older, assuming vaccination offers a 95\% reduction in disease acquisition risk and a 30\% reduction in transmission risk. We used the model, calibrated until January 25, 2021, to simulate the impact of a full national lockdown (FNL) with schools closed until April 19, 2021 versus four different partial national lockdown (PNL) scenarios with different elements of schooling open: 1) staggered PNL with primary schools and exam-entry years (years 11 and 13) returning on March 8, 2021 and the rest of the schools years on March 15, 2020; 2) full-return PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021; 3) primary-only PNL with primary schools and exam critical years (years 11 and 13) going back only on March 8, 2021 with the rest of the secondary schools back on April 19, 2021 and 4) part-rota PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021 with primary schools remaining open continuously but secondary schools on a two-weekly rota-system with years alternating between a fortnight of face-to-face and remote learning until April 19, 2021. Across all scenarios, we projected the number of new daily cases, cumulative deaths and effective reproduction number R until April 30, 2021. Our calibration across different scenarios is consistent with alpha variant being around 60\% more transmissible than the wild type. We find that strict social distancing measures, i.e. national lockdowns, were essential in containing the spread of the virus and controlling hospitalisations and deaths during January and February 2021. We estimated that a national lockdown over January and February 2021 would reduce the number of cases by early March to levels similar to those seen in October 2020, with R also falling and remaining below 1 over this period. We estimated that infections would start to increase when schools reopened, but found that if other parts of society remain closed, this resurgence would not be sufficient to bring R above 1. Reopening primary schools and exam critical years only or having primary schools open continuously with secondary schools on rotas was estimated to lead to lower increases in cases and R than if all schools opened. Without an increase in vaccination above the levels seen in January and February, we estimate that R could have increased above 1 following the reopening of society, simulated here from April 19, 2021. Our findings suggest that stringent measures were integral in mitigating the increase in cases and bringing R below 1 over January and February 2021. We found that it was plausible that a PNL with schools partially open from March 8, 2021 and the rest of the society remaining closed until April 19, 2021 would keep R below 1, with some increase evident in infections compared to continual FNL until April 19, 2021. Reopening society in mid-April, without an increase in vaccination levels, could push R above 1 and induce a surge in infections, but the effect of vaccination may be able to control this in future depending on the transmission blocking properties of the vaccines.},

The forward problem of solving random differential equations with delay has received increasing attention in recent years. Motivated by the challenge to predict the COVID-19 caseload trajectories for individual states in the U.S., we target here the inverse problem. Given a sample of observed random trajectories obeying an unknown random differential equation model with delay, we use a functional data analysis framework to learn the model parameters that govern the underlying dynamics from the data. We show the existence and uniqueness of the analytical solutions of the population delay random differential equation model when one has discrete time delays in the functional concurrent regression model and also for a second scenario where one has a delay continuum or distributed delay. The latter involves a functional linear regression model with history index. The derivative of the process of interest is modeled using the process itself as predictor and also other functional predictors with predictor-specific delayed impacts. This dynamics learning approach is shown to be well suited to model the growth rate of COVID-19 for the states that are part of the U.S., by pooling information from the individual states, using the case process and concurrently observed economic and mobility data as predictors.},

  abstract     = {Since the first official case of COVID-19 was reported, many researchers around the world have spent their time trying to understand the dynamics of the virus by modeling and predicting the number of infected and deaths. The rapid spread and highly contagiousness motivate the necessity of monitoring cases in real-time, aiming to keep control of the epidemic. As pointed out by [3] , some pitfalls like limited infrastructure, laboratory confirmation and logistical problems may cause reporting delay, leading to distortions of the real dynamics of the confirmed cases and deaths. The aim of this study is to propose a suitable statistical methodology for modeling and forecasting daily deaths and reported cases of COVID-19, considering key features as overdispersion of data and correction of notification delay. Both, reporting delays and forecasting consider a Bayesian approach in which the daily deaths and the confirmed cases are modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution in order to accommodate the population heterogeneity. For the correction of notification delay, the mean number of occurrences regarding time t notified at time t + j t+j (mean delayed notifications) is associated to the temporal and the delay lag evolution of the notification process through a log link. With regard to daily forecasting, the functional form adopted for the number of deaths and reported cases of COVID-19 is related to the sigmoid growth equation. A variable regarding week days or days off was considered in order to account for possible reduction of the records due to the lower offer of tests on days off. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze data of deaths and infected cases of COVID-19 in Espírito Santo, Brazil. We also obtain long-term predictions.},

  abstract     = {We propose a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a homogeneously mixing non constant population, and generalize it to a model where the parameters are given by piecewise constant functions. This allows us to model the human behavior and the impact of public health policies on the dynamics of the curve of active infected individuals during a COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of epidemic waves. Then, to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex network with six distinct regions based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal. We perform numerical simulations for the complex network model, where the objective is to determine a topology that minimizes the level of active infected individuals and the existence of topologies that are likely to worsen the level of infection. We claim that this methodology is a tool with enormous potential in the current pandemic context, and can be applied in the management of outbreaks (in regional terms) but also to manage the opening/closing of borders.},

  abstract     = {Computation of basic reproductive numbers is one of the primary goals of epidemic modelers. There are several challenges in such computations, especially when the data from the virus transmission networks are not so easy to collect; this makes model validation almost impossible. We provide a technical comment on the precautions to be taken while computing model-based basic reproductive numbers so that the ground realities of such computation are maintained. Basic reproductive numbers need to be adjusted retrospectively to compensate for reporting errors within the epidemic spread networks. Such an adjustment would lead to revised pandemic preparedness and mitigation plans.},

  abstract     = {Background : The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods : A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results : Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion : Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.},

Gneiting in the beginning of the century provides a large class of continuous positive definite functions on the product R d × R Rd×R commonly used in theory and applications. It turns out that the positive definite functions given by this theorem fit into what is frequently called the scale mixture approach. In other words, they are generated by certain integral transforms defined by products of parameterized positive definite functions on R d Rd and R R . In this paper, we consider positive definite functions on a product of metric spaces which are given by general integral transforms. We provide conditions under which the positive definite functions are either continuous or strictly positive definite. In the case in which one of the metric spaces is R d Rd , we offer constructions of continuous strictly positive definite functions defined by certain hypergeometric functions and conditionally negative definite functions. They complement and generalize the original Gneiting&#39;s contribution. Additionally, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the strict positive definiteness of the aforementioned generalizations.},

  abstract     = {Spectral factorization is a prominent tool with several important applications in various areas of applied science. Wiener and Masani proved the existence of matrix spectral factorization . Their theorem has been extended to the multivariable case by Helson and Lowdenslager. Solving the problem numerically is challenging in both situations, and also important due to its practical applications. Therefore, several authors have developed algorithms for factorization. The Janashia-Lagvilava algorithm is a relatively new method for matrix spectral factorization which has proved to be useful in several applications. In this paper, we extend this method to the multivariable case. Consequently, a new numerical algorithm for multivariable matrix spectral factorization is constructed.},

In Part I, we analyze the deterministic model . The model incorporates both innate and adaptive immune responses which have opposite effects on the outcome of the therapy. According to relative immune clearance rates, the model can be reduced to two subsystems, one with only innate immunity and one with only adaptive immunity, which provide detailed dynamical properties for the full model. The full system shows many different asymptotic behaviors which correspond to outcomes of the therapy. It undergoes classical Hopf bifurcation when the infectivity constant passes through a particular value and, interestingly, it also undergoes Hopf bifurcation without parameters when the tumor cell number passes through some particular value.

To better understand the elusive behavior, we explore the C ⁎ ⁎ C⁎ -covers of an operator algebra.

The numerical algorithm to solve this problem ensures conservation of the total population mass during timeline.

The obtained system of equations is a coupling of a two second-order in time equations with higher gradients terms due to the strain gradient length scale parameter l and the elastic nonlocal parameter ϖ coupled with two parabolic equations . This poses some new mathematical difficulties due to the lack of regularity. Using the semigroup theory, we show the well-posedness of the one dimensional problem.

We establish the WCP under a rather general, “natural sufficient condition” on the convection velocity, b ( x ) b(x) , and the reaction function, φ ( x , u ) φ(x,u) . Furthermore, we establish also the SCP under a number of various additional hypotheses. In contrast, with these hypotheses being violated, we construct also a few rather natural counterexamples to the SCP and discuss their applications to an interesting classical problem of fluid flow in porous medium, “seepage flow of fluids in inclined bed” . Our methods are based on a mixture of classical and new techniques.},

The weaker property of local rigidity in normed planes (where only ( G , q ) (G,q) within a neighbourhood of ( G , p ) (G,p) are considered) has been studied by several researchers over the last 5 years after being introduced by Kitson and Power for ℓ p ℓp -norms. However global rigidity is an unexplored area for general normed spaces , despite being intensely studied in the Euclidean context by many groups over the last 40 years. In order to understand global rigidity in X , we introduce new generalised rigid body motions in normed planes where the norm is determined by an analytic function. This theory allows us to deduce several geometric and combinatorial results concerning the global rigidity of bar-joint frameworks in X .},

The separation curve is also a straight line which is not invariant. We provide families having at the origin a weak-foci of maximal order. In the continuous class, the cyclicity problem is also solved, being 3 such maximal number. Moreover, for the discontinuous class but without sliding segment, we prove the existence of 7 limit cycles of small amplitude.},

  abstract     = {We consider a one-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation coupled to a conservation law, where both equations contain additional dispersive terms breaking the reflection symmetry x ↦ − x x↦−x . This system exhibits a Turing instability and we study the dynamics close to the onset of this instability. First, we show that periodic traveling waves bifurcate from a homogeneous ground state. Second, fixing the bifurcation parameter close to the onset of instability, we construct modulating traveling fronts, which capture the process of pattern-formation by modeling the transition from the homogeneous ground state to the periodic traveling wave through an invading front. The existence proof is based on center manifold reduction to a finite-dimensional system. Here, the dimension of the center manifold depends on the relation between the spreading speed of the invading modulating front and the linear group velocities of the system. Due to the broken reflection symmetry , the coefficients in the reduced equation are genuinely complex. Therefore, the main challenge is the construction of persistent heteroclinic connections on the center manifold, which correspond to modulating traveling fronts in the full system.},

The mapping method is applied to group classification of various classes of Kolmogorov equations and of Fokker–Planck equations in the case of space dimension one. The equivalence groupoids and the equivalence groups of these classes are computed. The group classification problems for these classes with respect to the corresponding equivalence groups are reduced to finding all inequivalent solutions of heat equations with inequivalent potentials admitting Lie-symmetry extensions. This reduction allows us to exhaustively solve the group classification problems for the classes of Kolmogorov and Fokker–Planck equations with time-independent coefficients.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a number of results has been proven in the literature for strong approximation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a drift coefficient that may have discontinuities in space. In many of these results it is assumed that the drift coefficient satisfies piecewise regularity conditions and the diffusion coefficient is Lipschitz continuous and non-degenerate at the discontinuity points of the drift coefficient. For scalar SDEs of that type the best L p Lp -error rate known so far for approximation of the solution at the final time point is 3/4 in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion and it is achieved by the transformed equidistant quasi-Milstein scheme, see [24] . Recently in [27] it has been shown that for such SDEs the L p Lp -error rate 3/4 can not be improved in general by no numerical method based on evaluations of the driving Brownian motion at fixed time points. In the present article we construct for the first time in the literature a method based on sequential evaluations of the driving Brownian motion, which achieves an L p Lp -error rate of at least 1 in terms of the average number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion for such SDEs.},

For this purpose, we first establish the CNFE methods of the Sobolev equation in both functional form and matrix form, and provide the existence, stability, and error estimates of CNFE solutions. We then build a CNFE reduced-dimension recursive (CNFERDR) method in the matrix-form by using a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique, and discuss the existence, stability, and error estimates of CNFERDR solutions by using matrix analysis. In this case, the CNFERDR method includes only few unknowns, but has the same basis functions and accuracy as the CNFE method. Finally, we use two numerical examples to verify the effectiveness of the CNFERDR method.},

The system under consideration consists of the generalized Navier–Stokes equations with a power-law-type stress-strain relation, where the power-law index depends on the concentration of a chemical, coupled to a convection-diffusion equation for the concentration. This system of equations arises in the rheology of the synovial fluid found in the cavities of synovial joints. We prove the existence of global weak solutions of the non-stationary model by using the Galerkin method combined with monotone operator theory and parabolic De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory. As the governing equations involve a nonlinearity with a variable power-law index, our proofs exploit the framework of generalized Sobolev spaces with variable-integrability exponent.},

In particular, we prove that if the exponents of the nonlinear terms satisfy suitable conditions, all solutions blow up in finite time even for small initial data , and we are also concerned with the upper estimate of lifespan of blowing-up solutions. A study on blowing up of solutions for this problem was originated by Wakasugi (2017), which used the test function method, and was subsequently partially improved by Chen-Reissig (2021) with an iteration argument. However, there is a gap between these two results. Our main aim in this paper is to bridge this gap while also providing a more concise proof.},

Later, considering the scaling property of the modulation spaces, Sugimoto and Wang [11] defined the scaling limit of the modulation spaces, which contains both the modulation spaces and Bényi and Oh&#39;s modulation spaces [1] , and these spaces also have some applications in nonlinear Schrödinger equations . So, it is important to consider the relationship between these new spaces and some classical Banach spaces such as L p Lp spaces, Fourier L p Lp spaces and Besov-Triebel-Sobolev spaces. We study the embedding properties of the scaling limit of the modulation spaces, including the homogeneous case and nonhomogeneous case.},

The critical point to be noted is that these T B i TBi are assumed to be weaker than isometries as operators. Thus our main theorems extends the principal result of [10] in the following three directions: ( i ) from one to several variables ; ( i i ) (ii) from multiplication with the coordinate function z to an n -tuple of multiplication by finite Blaschke factors B i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n Bi,1≤i≤n ; ( i i i ) (iii) from vector subspaces of H 2 ( D ) H2(D) to the case of vector subspaces of H p ( D n ) , 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ Hp(Dn),1≤p≤∞ .

If the time scale is selected from the sets of all real numbers or all natural numbers, then these equations are half-linear differential and half-linear difference equations. As a feature of the nonoscillation theorems provided, if both the differential and difference equations are linear, the conditions ensuring nonoscillation are similar. However, if both are nonlinear equations with a one-dimensional p -Laplacian, differences exist in the nonoscillatory conditions. An Euler-type dynamic equation with damping is presented as an example to emphasize the similarities and differences in the nonoscillatory conditions described.},

The multipliers for the M-stationarity system can be constructed via convex combinations of various multipliers to auxiliary, linear problems.

The population balance equations are specific integro-partial differential equations. In this work, we first transform both the aggregation and breakage models into integral equations. Then the resulting integral equations are solved by the homotopy analysis method (HAM) to get the series solution, which in particular cases eventually converges to the exact solution. The semi-analytical solutions for various benchmark aggregation kernels like the Ruckenstein/Pulvermacher kernel and breakage kernels such as the Austin kernel are provided using HAM.},

Through the stochastic maximum principle, the solvability of the optimal control problem is reduced to that of corresponding forward and backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs).

In this present article we consider a more general situation where test functions are singular on a curve in R 3 R3 . We construct a topological vector space of such test functions and, by duality, the space ⁎ D ⁎ , C ′ ( R 3 ) D⁎,C′(R3) of distributions that are thick on this curve. We study several operations, including partial differentiation. We introduce the notion of line thick delta functions which is a lifting of line delta functions to ⁎ D ⁎ , C ′ ( R 3 ) D⁎,C′(R3) . These new distributions, in particular thick line delta functions, may have applications in providing more accurate models to some problems from physics, biology and engineering where a “line source” or a “tube source” is present. As an example of such applications, we propose a more refined model of a growth factor&#39;s reaction and diffusion of a very thin blood capillary in a bulk tumor, and give a solution of the corresponding PDE .},

  abstract     = {Recently, Charpentier showed that there exist holomorphic functions f in the unit disk such that, for any proper compact subset K of the unit circle, any continuous function ϕ on K and any compact subset L of the unit disk, there exists an increasing sequence ( r n ) n ∈ N ⊆ [ 0 , 1 ) (rn)n∈N⊆[0,1) converging to 1 such that | f ( r n ( ζ − z ) + z ) − ϕ ( ζ ) | → 0 |f(rn(ζ−z)+z)−ϕ(ζ)|→0 as n → ∞ n→∞ uniformly for ζ ∈ K ζ∈K and z ∈ L z∈L (see [9] ). In this paper, we give analogues of this result for the Hardy spaces H p , 1 ≤ p Hp,1≤p&amp;lt;∞ . In particular, our main result implies that, if we fix a compact subset K of the unit circle with zero arc length measure, then there exist functions in H p Hp whose radial limits can approximate every continuous function on K . We give similar results for the Bergman and Dirichlet spaces.},

  abstract     = {An optimal control model governed by parabolic equations is usually analyzed by carrying out the formulation of the so called “optimality system”, that consists of equations with opposite orientations. PDE-constrained optimization is employed in different fields, such as in economics and in ecology for allocating resources and managing ecosystems. Under the assumption that any solution exists, we provide an original proof of its uniqueness. This result is original and can be applied to a wide range of problems. Moreover, the same proof can be exploited to carry out a constructive method for approximating the solution, which is not available in closed form in the most cases. The method is based on successive approximations converging to a fixed-point that is the required solution. Due to the structure of the problem, this kind of approximation performs a forward-backward integration, giving raise to different iterative schemes . We investigate their convergence in the continuous setting under an original approach, by adapting the same proof provided for the exact solution uniqueness. Another innovative issue is related to the numerical implementation which involves exponential integration in time: up to our knowledge, the use of exponential integrators is new and original in the setting of PDE-constrained optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by providing some numerical results.},

  abstract     = {In the literature, the mathematical problem of optical wave propagation in dielectric straight waveguides has been systematically studied as a self-adjoint eigenvalue problem with real eigenvalues . In terms of the underlying physics, such real eigenvalues meant no losses during the wave propagation. However, when the waveguides were bent, experiments showed that the wave propagation became lossy. In this paper, optical wave propagation in dielectric bent waveguides is mathematically analyzed. It is shown that the corresponding eigenvalue problem is a non-self-adjoint eigenvalue problem and has complex-valued eigenvalues. The imaginary part of the eigenvalues is a measure of loss. For large-bend radii, the eigenvalue problem for bent waveguides behaves as an eigenvalue problem for straight waveguides, and the complex-valued eigenvalues approach the real-valued eigenvalues of the straight waveguide problem. By expressing the bent waveguide eigenvalue operator as a sum of the self-adjoint operator and the non-self-adjoint operator, asymptotic behaviour of guided modes and their lossy nature are investigated.},

This model is widely used in controlled magnetic fusion, in space and astrophysics plasmas and also in physics of solids. We show that initial data with limited smoothness in Sobolev spaces induce a Lagrangian flow-map X and a Lagrangian magnetic vector potential A (viz. the magnetic vector potential evaluated at the Lagrangian spatial point X ), which are ultradifferentiable in time, with the two particular cases of real analytic and Gevrey time regularity. It turns out that the Lagrangian canonical momentum P , the Lagrangian magnetic field B , and the Lagrangian electric field E inherit this Lagrangian regularity property . Among others, the proof makes crucial use of a novel Lagrangian formulation of the e-MHD in terms of the Lagrangian fields ( X , A , P , B , E ) (X,A,P,B,E) . A by-product of this Lagrangian and constructive proof is the design of arbitrary high-order semi-Lagrangian schemes to solve the e-MHD equations on a bounded domain .},

First, some fundamental properties of the related parabolic system are established. To be specific, some boundedness results are yielded by employing the comparison principle of parabolic equations , the theory of invariant regions and the method of Moser-Alikakos iteration. For the corresponding elliptic system, existence results of non-constant steady states are given by virtue of the Leray-Schauder degree theory. Profiles of the positive solutions are described when the diffusion rate of the nutrient is small or large, with the fixed diffusion rate of microorganisms. Different from the related previous models with spatial homogeneity, the obtained results suggest that such a diffusive nutrient-microorganism model in a spatially heterogeneous environment may be more realistic and perform more complex dynamical behaviors.},

We establish the existence of generalized solutions to the system with admissible powers of degradation corresponding to each case. It turns out that, as expected, the attraction-dominating case requires strictly larger powers of degradation than repulsion-dominating one.

In materials in which the dependence D = D ( E ) D=D(E) is nonlinear the quasilinear problem ∇ ⋅ D ( E ) = 0 ∇⋅D(E)=0 is hence to be solved. In many applications, e.g. in the modelling of wave packets, an approximative asymptotic ansatz of the electric field E E is used, which satisfies this divergence condition at t = 0 t=0 only up to a small residual. We search then for a small correction of the ansatz to enforce ∇ ⋅ D ( E ) = 0 ∇⋅D(E)=0 at t = 0 t=0 and choose this correction in the form of a gradient field. In the usual case of a power type nonlinearity in D ( E ) D(E) this leads to the sum of the Laplace and p -Laplace operators. We also allow for the medium to consist of two different materials so that a transmission problem across an interface is produced. We prove the existence of the correction term for a general class of nonlinearities and provide regularity estimates for its derivatives, independent of the L 2 L2 -norm of the original ansatz. In this way, when applied to the wave packet setting, the correction term is indeed asymptotically smaller than the original ansatz. We also provide numerical experiments to support our analysis.},

The resulting semilinear elliptic equation combines several difficulties: exponential growth and lack of sign preservation in the nonlinearity accounting for ion mobility, measure data arising from point charges inside the molecule, and discontinuous permittivities across the molecule boundary. Exploiting the modeling assumption that the point sources and the nonlinearity are active on disjoint parts of the domain, one can use a linear decomposition of the potential into regular and singular components. A variational argument can be used for the regular part, but the unbounded nonlinearity makes the corresponding functional not differentiable in Sobolev spaces . By proving boundedness of minimizers, these are related to standard H 1 H1 weak formulations for the regular component and in the framework of Boccardo and Gallouët for the full potential. Finally, a result of uniqueness of this type of weak solutions for more general semilinear problems with measure data validates the strategy, since the different decompositions and test spaces considered must then lead to the same solution.},

This property allows to reduce the number of calculations and leads to more complete analytical solutions of mathematical models on lattices. The connection is established by showing that a first order equation in the first variable, and of fractional order α &gt; 0 α&amp;gt;0 in the second, has the same solution as another of order 1 / α 1/α in the first variable and integer order in the second.

  abstract     = {We study algebraic curves that are envelopes of families of polygons supported on the unit circle T T . We address, in particular, a characterization of such curves of minimal class and show that all realizations of these curves are essentially equivalent and can be described in terms of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC), also known as Szegő polynomials. Our results have connections to classical results from algebraic and projective geometry , such as theorems of Poncelet, Darboux, and Kippenhahn; numerical ranges of a class of matrices; and Blaschke products and disk functions. This paper contains new results, some old results presented from a different perspective or with a different proof, and a formal foundation for our analysis. We give a rigorous definition of the Poncelet property, of curves tangent to a family of polygons, and of polygons associated with Poncelet curves. As a result, we are able to clarify some misconceptions that appear in the literature and present counterexamples to some existing assertions along with necessary modifications to their hypotheses to validate them. For instance, we show that curves inscribed in some families of polygons supported on T T are not necessarily convex, can have cusps, and can even intersect the unit circle. Two ideas play a unifying role in this work. The first is the utility of OPUC and the second is the advantage of working with tangent coordinates. This latter idea has been previously exploited in the works of B. Mirman, whose contribution we have tried to put in perspective.},

We prove that only affine transforms can do so in a certain large class of RKHS. Our result covers not only the Paley-Wiener space on the real line, studied in previous works, but also much more general RKHSs corresponding to analytic positive definite functions, where existing methods do not work. Our method only relies on intrinsic properties of the RKHSs, and we establish a connection between the behavior of composition operators and asymptotic properties of the greatest zeros of orthogonal polynomials on a weighted L 2 L2 -space on the real line. We also investigate the compactness of the composition operators and show that any bounded composition operators cannot be compact in our situation.},

From a rigorous point of view, this new dynamics is made possible by having replaced the original graph G with a weighted complete graph G ′ G′ on the same node-set, that depends on G and wherein the presence of new edges allows a direct passage between nodes that were not neighbors in G . We show that, in general, the graph G ′ G′ is not compatible with the dynamics characterizing the original model graph G : the random walks on G ′ G′ subjected to move on the edges of G are not stochastically equivalent, in the wide sense, to the random walks on G . From a purely analytical point of view, the incompatibility of G ′ G′ with G means that the normalized graph G ˆ Gˆ can not be embedded into the normalized graph G ˆ ′ Gˆ′ . Eventually, we provide a regularization method to guarantee such compatibility and preserving at the same time all the nice properties granted by G ′ G′ .},

For Weyl sums with polynomials of degree d ⩾ 3 d⩾3 we obtain a new upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the set of polynomial coefficients corresponding to large values of Weyl sums. Our methods also work for monomial sums, match the previously known lower bounds, just giving the exact value for the corresponding Hausdorff dimension when α is close to 1. We also obtain a nearly tight bound in a similar question with arbitrary integer sequences of polynomial growth.},

Then, by constructing an auxiliary functional and adopting the concavity argument, we give a new finite time blow-up criterion for this problem, which in particular implies that the problem admits blow-up solutions with arbitrarily high initial energy. Meanwhile, a bound for the blow-up time is derived from above. Further, we obtain a lower bound for the blow-up time when blow-up occurs.

In particular, we prove sufficient conditions to avoid a gap between the infimum of the original minimum problem and an extended problem, obtained by first enlarging the set of original controls and then convexifying the extended velocities set. These conditions, which also guarantee controllability of the original system to an extended solution, are given in terms of normality of multipliers for the Maximum Principle, involving an extended minimizer with possibly active state constraint at the endpoints. In the free time case, links between absence of a gap and normality have only recently been studied, for the relaxed problem without state constraints. This paper establishes such links for a more general extension admitting active state constraints. Furthermore, under additional constraint qualification conditions we improve the normality test for no gap, by considering nondegenerate multipliers only.},

Precisely, using the well-known Lumer-Phillips theorem, we establish the well-posedness result of the system. Furthermore, using the multiplier method, we prove that the system is exponential stable irrespective of any stability number or equality of wave propagation. This result is unique and unexpected, especially when compared to similar problems like Timoshenko, Bresse, and thermoelasticity with second sound. In each of the systems mentioned above, a stability number is necessary for the exponential stability of the systems. Undoubtedly, our coupling and the result give new contributions to the asymptotic behaviors of swelling porous thermoelastic soils.},

We would like to emphasize that the approach proposed in this paper is based on the fact that a stochastic integral with respect to fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter in ( 1 2 , 1 ) (12,1) can be defined as a generalized Stieltjes integral. In particular, to prove a limit theorem for the averaging principle, we will introduce a sequence of stopping times to control the size of multiplicative fractional Brownian noise. Then, inspired by the Khasminskii&#39;s approach, an averaging principle is developed in the sense of convergence in the p -th moment uniformly in time.},

We assume that the order of degeneracy at 0 of the diffusion operator is α ∈ ( 0 , 2 ) α∈(0,2) , and the coefficient functions (and their derivatives) are only locally bounded. We adopt a combination of probabilistic approach and analytic method: by analyzing the behaviors of the underlying diffusion process , we give an explicit construction to the fundamental solution p ( x , y , t ) p(x,y,t) and prove several properties for p ( x , y , t ) p(x,y,t) ; by conducting a localization procedure, we obtain an approximation for p ( x , y , t ) p(x,y,t) for x , y x,y in a neighborhood of 0 and t sufficiently small, where the error estimates only rely on the local bounds of a ( x ) a(x) and b ( x ) b(x) (and their derivatives). There is a rich literature on such a degenerate diffusion in the case of α = 1 α=1 . Our work extends part of the existing results to the cases with more general order of degeneracy, both in the analysis context (e.g., heat kernel estimates on fundamental solutions) and in the probabilistic view (e.g., wellposedness of stochastic differential equations).},

These surfaces admit canonical isothermal and canonical isotropic coordinates. It is known that the Gauss curvature K and the normal curvature ϰ of such a surface considered as functions of the canonical coordinates satisfy a system of two natural PDEs . Using the Weierstrass type representations of the corresponding null curves, we solve explicitly the system of natural PDEs , expressing any solution by means of four real functions of one variable. We obtain the transformation formulas for the functions in the Weierstrass representation of a null curve under a proper motion in R 2 4 R24 . Using this, we find the relation between two quadruples of real functions generating one and the same solution to the system of natural PDEs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we prove that the one-dimensional model of reactive micropolar real gas flow and thermal explosion has a solution locally in time. We first define the notion of a generalized solution for the governing initial-boundary value problem. We prove the claim of local existence by deriving a sequence of approximate problems obtained by Faedo-Galerkin projections. A priori estimates allow us to choose small enough time interval of existence, and show that the sequence of approximations is bounded in certain functional spaces, and therefore has a convergent subsequence . In the end, we show that it is precisely this limit that is the solution to the observed problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the performance output tracking for a one-dimensional heat partial differential equation with unknown external disturbance and non-collocated configuration, in which the control input is subject to a time delay. By writing the time delay as a first-order hyperbolic equation, the control system can be modeled as a cascade construction in which the transport equation can be viewed as the actuator dynamics of the heat partial differential system. With the help of the actuator dynamics compensation, the difficulties caused by input delay are addressed. The full state feedback law is constructed to achieve the performance output tracking and an error based observer is designed successfully. The exponential stability of the closed-loop system and the well-posedness of the observer are obtained.},

This paper aims to give minimal assumptions in order to recover typical features like tightness and equicontinuity with respect to the mixed topology as well as to carefully clarify on mutual relations between previously studied variants of these notions. The abstract results—exploiting techniques from topological vector spaces—are thoroughly discussed by means of several example classes, such as semigroups on spaces of bounded continuous functions .},

These in turn correspond to probability measures on a classical torus whose dimension depends on a certain degeneracy index of the restricted cocycle .

In particular, we show that if S is compact and differentiable then A A is finite-dimensional. We also prove some results (following Málek et al. (1994) [15] and Zelik (2000) [23] ) that give bounds on the (box-counting) dimension of such sets assuming a ‘smoothing property’: in its simplest form this requires S to be Lipschitz from X into another Banach space Z that is compactly embedded in X . The resulting bounds depend on the Kolmogorov ε -entropy of the embedding of Z into X . We give applications to an abstract semilinear parabolic equation and the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations on a periodic domain.},

Besides suitable boundedness conditions on the positive parts of the one-stage costs, the key condition here is that each subset of states with positive measure be reachable with probability one under some policy. Our proofs exploit an inequality for the optimal average cost functions and its connection with submartingales , and, in a special case that involves stationary policies, also use the theory of recurrent Markov chains .},

There have been many heuristic, experimental, theoretical, and numerical results with the purpose of estimating the scaling of the Nusselt number , which is viewed as a long time statistical quantity. Of the many numerical schemes available, very few are analytically investigated for their ability to adequately capture the long time statistical properties of the model. We present a semi-implicit scheme that treats the advection term explicitly, removing the need for a system solve at each step, with added stability from the implicit treatment of the diffusion term. Given a time step restriction that depends on the Rayleigh number, we show that our scheme falls into the class of “uniformly dissipative” schemes and has the potential to capture long time statistics of the infinite Prandtl number model.},

There are also many integrals, series or infinite product representations of them along the history. In this note, we try to provide a parallel story for the alternating Hurwitz zeta function (also known as the Hurwitz-type Euler zeta function) ζ E ( z , q ) = ∑ n = 0 ∞ ( − 1 ) n ( n + q ) z , ζE(z,q)=∑n=0∞(−1)n(n+q)z, the alternating zeta function ζ E ( z ) ζE(z) (also known as the Dirichlet&#39;s eta function η ( z ) η(z) ), the modified Stieltjes constants γ ˜ k ( q ) γ˜k(q) , the modified Euler constant γ ˜ 0 γ˜0 , the modified gamma function Γ ˜ ( q ) Γ˜(q) and the modified digamma function ψ ˜ ( q ) ψ˜(q) (also known as the Nielsen&#39;s β function). Many new integrals, series or infinite product representations of these constants and special functions have been found.

The integral operators are convolutions with shearlets as kernels. The shearlets are smooth compactly supported and away from the origin in the Fourier domain, therefore the operators are bounded. We show a series of relations in the form of shearlet coefficients, convolutions and inner products in different spaces. This framework yields potential applications since there is a natural translation from the continuous to the discrete theory of shearlets. We also develop a new biorthogonal shearlet decomposition for the 3D Radon transform inversion. This shades light on the differences between our method of integral (bounded) operators and the biorthogonal curvelet/shearlet decomposition of differential (unbounded) operators.},

Moreover, the convergence has been analysed also in presence of points in which a signal is not differentiable. In the latter case, under suitable assumptions, it can be proved the pointwise convergence of the first derivative of the above operators to a certain combination of the left and right first derivatives (whenever they exist and are both finite) of the signals under consideration. Finally, also the extension of the above results to the case of signals with high order derivatives has been discussed. At the end of the paper, examples of kernel functions and graphical representations are provided. Further, also numerical examples in the cases of functions for which the left and right derivatives are ±∞ or they do not exist in R ˜ R˜ , have been given.},

This generalizes an early result of Huang and Rao (2021) [9] on a class of self-similar sets called fractal cubes. Moreover, we show that the result is no longer valid if the slicing property is removed. Consequently, for a Barański carpet E possessing trivial points, the Hausdorff dimension and the box dimension of the connected part of E are strictly less than that of E , respectively. For slicing self-affine sponges in R d Rd with d ≥ 3 d≥3 , whether the attractor of a sub-IFS has strictly smaller dimensions is an open problem.},

The Φ-dimensions are intermediate Assouad-like dimensions, the (quasi-)Assouad dimensions and θ -Assouad spectrum being special cases. Their values depend on the size of Φ, with one size coinciding with the Assouad dimension and the other coinciding with the quasi-Assouad dimension. We give many applications, including to equicontractive self-similar measures and Cantor-like measures with probabilities that are uniformly distributed.

The proof passes through a sequential version of being almost square which we call being sequentially almost square . In this article we study these conditions in the nonseparable setting.

A surjective map ϕ : A → B ϕ:A→B is called a spectrally additive group homomorphism if the spectrum of x ± y x±y is equal to the spectrum of ϕ ( x ) ± ϕ ( y ) ϕ(x)±ϕ(y) for each x , y ∈ A x,y∈A . If A is semisimple and either A or B has an essential socle, then we prove that a spectrally additive group homomorphism ϕ : A → B ϕ:A→B is a continuous Jordan-isomorphism. If, in addition, either A or B is prime, then we conclude that ϕ is either a continuous algebra isomorphism or anti-isomorphism. It is noteworthy that the continuity and linearity (or even additivity) of the map ϕ does not form part of the hypothesis, but is rather obtained in the conclusion. The techniques employed in the proof of these results utilizes the spectral rank, trace and determinant, and yields a new additive characterization of finite rank elements in a Banach algebra which is of independent interest.},

We study the behaviour of λ 1 λ1 with respect to the rotations of P about its centre. We prove that the extremal configurations correspond to the cases where Ω is symmetric with respect to the line containing both the centres. Among these optimizing domains, the OFF configurations correspond to the minimizing ones while the ON configurations correspond to the maximizing ones. Furthermore, we obtain symmetry (periodicity) and monotonicity properties of λ 1 λ1 with respect to these rotations. In particular, we prove that the conjecture formulated in [11] for n odd and p = 2 p=2 holds true. As a consequence of our monotonicity results, we show that if the nodal set of a second eigenfunction of the p -Laplacian possesses a dihedral symmetry of the same order as that of P , then it can not enclose P .},

We first show the decay rates of the corresponding asymptotic profiles, the so-called nonlinear diffusion waves, then by means of the time-weighted energy method, we prove that the smooth solutions to the initial-boundary value problem exist uniquely and globally, and time-asymptotically converge to the nonlinear diffusion waves, provided that the initial perturbation around the diffusion wave is small enough. The convergence rates are in the forms that O(t−34(1+λ)) for −1&amp;lt;λ&amp;lt;35 and O(tλ−32) for 35&amp;lt;λ&amp;lt;1 , respectively, where λ=35 is the critical point, and the convergence rate at the critical point is O(t65lnt) .

We are interested in large values of m , that is, high frequencies. This is a companion paper of [3] , which is centered on random variables uniformly distributed on a symmetric interval. We refer to its bibliography for the wide literature on random Gram matrices , which are involved in this study. We show here that its results may be generalized in different directions. Some of them are straightforward, such as the comparison between spectra of random Fourier matrices and spectra of corresponding integral operators. We concentrate here on asymptotic formulas for Hilbert-Schmidt norms, which allows us to generalize estimates related to the number of degrees of freedom, which had been previously given for the sinc sinc kernel.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to give an infinite dimensional analogue of a result of Choi and Effros concerning dual spaces of finite dimensional unital operator systems. An (not necessarily unital) operator system is a self-adjoint subspace of L ( H ) L(H) , equipped with the induced matrix norm and the induced matrix cone. We say that an operator system T is dualizable if one can find an equivalent dual matrix norm on the dual space T ⁎ T⁎ such that under this dual matrix norm and the canonical dual matrix cone, T ⁎ T⁎ becomes a dual operator system. We show that an operator system T is dualizable if and only if the ordered normed space M ∞ ( T ) sa M∞(T)sa satisfies a form of bounded decomposition property. In this case, ‖ f ‖ d : = sup ⁡ { ‖ [ f i , j ( x k , l ) ] ‖ : x ∈ M n ( T ) + ; ‖ x ‖ ≤ 1 ; n ∈ N } ( f ∈ M m ( T ⁎ ) ; m ∈ N ) , ‖f‖d:=sup⁡{‖[fi,j(xk,l)]‖:x∈Mn(T)+;‖x‖≤1;n∈N}(f∈Mm(T⁎);m∈N), is the largest dual matrix norm that is equivalent to and dominated by the original dual matrix norm on T ⁎ T⁎ that turns it into a dual operator system, denoted by T d Td . It can be shown that T d Td is again dualizable. For every completely positive completely bounded map ϕ : S → T ϕ:S→T between dualizable operator systems, there is a unique weak- ⁎ -continuous completely positive completely bounded map ϕ d : T d → S d ϕd:Td→Sd which is compatible with the dual map ϕ ⁎ ϕ⁎ . From this, we obtain a full and faithful functor from the category of dualizable operator systems to that of dualizable dual operator systems. Moreover, we will verify that if S is either a C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra or a unital operator system, then S is dualizable and the canonical weak- ⁎ -homeomorphism from the unital operator system S ⁎ ⁎ S⁎⁎ to the operator system ( S d ) d (Sd)d is a completely isometric complete order isomorphism. Furthermore, via the duality functor above, the category of C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras and that of unital operator systems (both equipped with completely positive complete contractions as their morphisms) can be regarded as full subcategories of the category of dual operator systems (with weak- ⁎ -continuous completely positive complete contractions as its morphisms). Consequently, a nice duality framework for operator systems is obtained, which includes all C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras and all unital operator systems.},

The proof is based on the decomposition of the Schrödinger operators into a direct integral and a specific representation of fiber operators. The traces of the fiber operators are expressed as finite Fourier series of the quasimomentum. The coefficients of the Fourier series are given in terms of the potentials and cycles in the quotient graph from some specific cycle sets.

  abstract     = {Let u be a quasi-definite linear functional defined on the linear space of polynomials P with complex coefficients . For such a functional we can define a sequence of monic orthogonal polynomials (SMOP in short) ( P n ) n ∈ N , which satisfies a three term recurrence relation . If we increase the indices of the recurrence relation by one unity, then we get the sequence of associated polynomials of the first kind as solution. These polynomials will be orthogonal with respect to a linear functional denoted by u ( 1 ) . In the literature two special transformations of the functional u are studied, the canonical Christoffel transformation u ˜ = ( x − c ) u and the canonical Geronimus transformation u ˆ = ( x − c ) − 1 u + M δ c , where c is a fixed complex number, M is a free complex parameter and δ c is the linear functional defined on P as 〈 δ c , p ( x ) 〉 = p ( c ) . For the Christoffel transformation with SMOP ( P ˜ n ) n ∈ N , we are interested in analyzing the relation between the linear functionals u ( 1 ) and u ˜ ( 1 ) . The super index denotes the linear functionals associated with the orthogonal polynomial sequences of the first kind ( P n ( 1 ) ) n ∈ N and ( P ˜ n ( 1 ) ) n ∈ N , respectively. This problem is also studied for Geronimus transformations. Here we give close relations between their corresponding monic Jacobi matrices by using the LU and UL factorizations . To get this result, we first need to study the relation between u − 1 (the inverse functional) and u ( 1 ) which can be given from a quadratic Geronimus transformation.},

Observing that the subspace of unitary semigroups is completely metrisable and appealing to known density results, we solve this problem positively by showing that certain topological properties can in general be transferred from dense subspaces to larger spaces. The transfer result in turn relies upon classification of topological properties via infinite games. Our approach is sufficiently general and can be applied to other contexts, e.g. the space of contractions under the -topology.},

We analyze the asymptotic properties of these extremal values U N , s ( a N ) UN,s(aN) , studying separately the cases s = 0 s=0 , 0 0&amp;lt;s&amp;lt;1 , s = 1 s=1 , and s &gt; 1 s&amp;gt;1 .

A first-order result for s &gt; 1 s&amp;gt;1 is proved, and it is shown that the normalized sequence U N , s ( a N ) / N s UN,s(aN)/Ns is bounded and divergent in this case. We also consider, briefly, greedy energy sequences in which the minimization condition is required starting from the point a p + 1 ap+1 (instead of the point a 1 a1 as previously stated), for some p ≥ 1 p≥1 . For this more general class of greedy sequences, we prove a first-order asymptotic result for 0 ≤ s 0≤s&amp;lt;1 .},

In particular, a space X is uncountable if and only if C p ( X ) Cp(X) has the discrete shrinking property.

More surprisingly, Ramanujan obtained certain identities between q -series from which the above congruences follow as consequences. In this paper, we adopt Ramanujan&#39;s approach and prove an identity which witnesses another famous Ramanujan congruence, namely, p(11n+6)≡0(mod11) and also establish some new identities for the generating functions for p(17n+5),p(19n+7) and p(23n+1) .

By splitting the tracking problem into a linear exponentially stable wave equation and a nonlinear dynamical regulator wave equation, we construct an explicit feedback and feedforward boundary controller that involves the reference, the disturbance and the solutions of the two problems. If the controller is applied on the whole boundary and the nonlinearity is globally Lipschitz, then we prove that the wave average tracks a desired reference signal exponentially by using the wave Green&#39;s function and the Banach contraction fixed point theorem . If the controller is applied on only a part of the boundary, then the same result is proved for a linear unstable gradient-dependent wave equation, but it is open for the nonlinear wave equation. Furthermore, as a robust analysis, we prove that the change of tracking error continuously depends on the change of disturbance. As usual, the rate of convergence of tracking error is independent of the feedforward part of the controller. A numerical example is given to confirm our theoretical results.},

An alternative idempotent convex structure called inverse B -convexity was recently proposed in the literature. This paper continues and extends some investigation started in these papers. In particular we focus on the Ky-Fan inequality and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium for inverse B -convex games. This we do by considering a suitable “harmonic” topological structure which allows to establish a KKM theorem as well as some important related properties. Among other things a coincidence theorem is established. The paper also establishes fixed point results and Nash equilibriums properties in the case where two different convex topological structures are merged. It follows that one can consider a large class of games where the players may optimize their payoff subject to different forms of convexity. Among other things an inverse B -convex version of the Debreu-Gale-Nikaido theorem is proposed.},

This is an essentially important improvement for the existence literature Morgül et al. (1994) [32] where two measurements including the high order angular velocity feedback were adopted. When a control matched nonlinear internal uncertainty and external disturbance are taken into consideration, we construct an infinite-dimensional extended state observer (ESO) to estimate the total disturbance and state simultaneously. By compensating the total disturbance, an estimated state based controller is designed to exponentially stabilize the original system while making the closed-loop system bounded. Riesz basis approach is crucial to the verifications of the exponential stabilities of two coupled systems of the closed-loop systems. Some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness.},

This paper computes the power set of cyclic quasinilpotent operators and studies the connection with their invariant subspaces. We first prove that the power set of the strictly cyclic quasinilpotent unilateral weighted shift only contains 1. Then we define the strongly strictly cyclic quasinilpotent operator, characterize its invariant subspaces, and show that its power set also only contains 1. Finally, we show that the Volterra integral operator V on L 2 [ 0 , 1 ] L2[0,1] , whose power set contains more than one point, is cyclic but not strictly cyclic.},

The corresponding model is known to be not exponentially stabilizable by only one boundary feedback controller, controlling the voltage at the electrodes or mechanical strains. We consider the same model with two boundary feedback controllers measuring tip velocity and total current accumulated at the electrodes. The main focus in this paper is to investigate the effects of (i) distributed or (ii) boundary-type delayed damping on the overall exponential stabilizability. First, the equations of motion in the state-space formulation are shown to be well-posed by the semigroup theory. Next, the Lyapunov theory is cleverly utilized to prove that the exponential stability of each model is retained if the coefficients of the delayed damping terms and the boundary feedback controllers satisfy explicit conditions. Concurrently, the electrostatic/quasi-static models for each type of delay are also investigated for comparison. Finally, simulations for low and high-frequency normal vibrational modes are provided to enforce the theoretical findings.},

We first generalize this result by proving that there exist wavelet frames for which no approximately dual frame has wavelet structure. Motivated by this we show that by imposing a very mild decay condition on the Fourier transform of the generator ψ ∈ L 2 ( R ) ψ∈L2(R) , a certain oversampling { a j / 2 ψ ( a j ⋅ − k b / N ) } j , k ∈ Z {aj/2ψ(aj⋅−kb/N)}j,k∈Z indeed has an approximately dual wavelet frame; most importantly, by choosing the parameter N ∈ N N∈N sufficiently large we can get as close to perfect reconstruction as desired, which makes the approximate dual frame pairs perform equally well as the classical dual frame pairs in applications.},

These characterizations are formulated in terms of the metric properties of the approximating sets.

In this extension, the role of the ordinary translation is played by the Dunkl translation, that is a much more intricate operator. In this paper, we define discrete Appell-Dunkl sequences of polynomials, and we give some properties and examples.

We also show that the convergence of a hybrid viscosity version of the Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration follows from the convergence of the Browder type sequence. Our results follow from proof-theoretic techniques (proof mining). From an analysis of theorems due to T. Suzuki, we extract a transformation of rates for the original Browder type and Halpern iterations into rates for the corresponding viscosity versions. We show that these transformations can be applied to earlier quantitative studies of these iterations. From an analysis of a theorem due to H.-K. Xu, N. Altwaijry and S. Chebbi, we obtain similar results. Finally, in uniformly convex Banach spaces we study a strong notion of accretive operator due to Brezis and Sibony and extract an uniform modulus of uniqueness for the property of being a zero point. In this context, we show that it is possible to obtain Cauchy rates for the Browder type and the Halpern iterations (and hence also for their viscosity versions).},

Finally we establish the existence periodic solutions and give the structure of these solutions in term of response curves.

The demographic changes such as migration, births, and deaths due to natural causes and the chronological age of individuals are disregarded. The model is based on a coupled system of integro-ordinary and partial differential equations subject to conditions of the integral type. We study two forms of the infection rate and prove the existence and uniqueness of the global solution of the model in both cases of the infection rate form.

As the main result, the existence and uniqueness of nonnegative solution under a sufficient condition were proven, based on our established framework.

Consider a deterministic weighted branching process generated by ( p k ) k ∈ N (pk)k∈N . A nested Karlin&#39;s occupancy scheme is the sequence of Karlin balls-in-boxes schemes in which boxes of the j th level, j = 1 , 2 , … j=1,2,… are identified with the j th generation individuals and the hitting probabilities of boxes are identified with the corresponding weights. The collection of balls is the same for all generations, and each ball starts at the root and moves along the tree of the deterministic weighted branching process according to the following rule: transition from a mother box to a daughter box occurs with probability given by the ratio of the daughter and mother weights. Assuming there are n balls, denote by K n ( j ) Kn(j) the number of occupied (ever hit) boxes in the j th level. For each j ∈ N j∈N , we prove a functional limit theorem for the vector-valued process ( K ⌊ e T + u ⌋ ( 1 ) , … , K ⌊ e T + u ⌋ ( j ) ) u ∈ R (K⌊eT+u⌋(1),…,K⌊eT+u⌋(j))u∈R , properly normalized and centered, as T → ∞ T→∞ .

Moreover, in some cases we also show their equivalence with Trudinger-Moser inequalities. As consequences, the relations between the constants of these inequalities are investigated yielding asymptotically best constants in the obtained inequalities. We also obtain the corresponding uncertainty type principles.},

  abstract     = {We revisit and generalize the application of a method introduced by Latrémolière and Packer for constructing finitely generated projective modules over the noncommutative solenoid C*-algebras. By realizing them as direct limits of rotation algebras, the method constructs directed systems of equivalence bimodules between rotation algebras that satisfy the necessary compatibility conditions to build Morita equivalence bimodules between the direct limit C*-algebras. In the irrational case, we use a fixed projection in a matrix algebra over the rotation algebra satisfying a key condition to build an equivalence bimodule at each stage following a construction of Rieffel. From this, our main result shows that two irrational noncommutative solenoids are Morita equivalent if and only if such a projection exists. We also make additional observations about the Heisenberg bimodules construction studied by the aforementioned two authors and connect the two constructions.},

  abstract     = {In this work we study three different versions of small diameter properties of the unit ball in a Banach space and its dual. The related concepts for all closed bounded convex sets of a Banach space was initiated and developed in [9] , [4] , [12] , [13] was extensively studied in the context of dentability, huskability, Radon Nikodym Property and Krein Milman Property in [14] . We introduce the Ball Huskable Property ( BHP ), namely, the unit ball has relatively weakly open subsets of arbitrarily small diameter. We compare this property to two related properties, B S C S P BSCSP namely, the unit ball has convex combination of slices of arbitrarily small diameter and BDP namely, the closed unit ball has slices of arbitrarily small diameter. We show BDP implies BHP which in turn implies B S C S P BSCSP and none of the implications can be reversed. We prove similar results for the ⁎ w ⁎ w⁎ -versions. We prove that all these properties are stable under l p lp sum for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ , c 0 1≤p≤∞,c0 sum and Lebesgue Bochner spaces. Finally, we explore the stability of these with properties in the light of three space property. We show that BHP is a three space property provided X / Y X/Y is finite dimensional and same is true for B S C S P BSCSP when X has B S C S P BSCSP and X / Y X/Y is strongly regular ( [14] ).},

Taking into account the fact that the oil price in worldwide commodity markets fluctuates randomly following global and seasonal macroeconomic parameters, we model the evolution of the oil price as a mean reverting regime-switching jump diffusion process . Moreover, taking into account the fact that oil producing countries rely on oil sale revenues as well as taxes levied on oil companies for a good portion of the revenue side of their budgets, we formulate this problem as a differential game where the two players are the mining company whose aim is to maximize the revenues generated from its extracting activities and the government agency in charge of regulating and taxing natural resources. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium and characterize the value functions of this stochastic differential game as the unique viscosity solutions of the corresponding Hamilton Jacobi Isaacs equations. We propose a numerical approximation of the value functions and prove its convergence. Furthermore, optimal extraction and fiscal policies that should be applied when the equilibrium is reached are derived. A numerical example is presented to illustrate these results.},

In this situation, we study the relation of invariance, infinitesimal invariance, recurrence, transience, conservativeness and L r Lr -uniqueness, and present sufficient conditions for non-existence of finite infinitesimally invariant measures as well as finite invariant measures . Our main result is that recurrence implies uniqueness of infinitesimally invariant measures, as well as existence and uniqueness of invariant measures, both in subclasses of locally finite measures. We can hence make in particular use of various explicit analytic criteria for recurrence that have been previously developed in the context of (generalized) Dirichlet forms and present diverse examples and counterexamples for uniqueness of infinitesimally invariant, as well as invariant measures and an example where L 1 L1 -uniqueness fails for one infinitesimally invariant measure but holds for another and pathwise uniqueness holds.

  abstract     = {For planar systems with a pseudo-equilibrium point of focus type within its discontinuity line, computable normal forms are introduced. Thus, the classical theory of normal forms is adapted for dealing with piecewise smooth systems having a common invisible tangency from each side. The methodology looks for removing unessential terms in the expression of the vector field, and is based upon expanding the vector field as a sum of quasi-homogeneous terms, next applying adequate changes of variables that preserve every point of the discontinuity line. From these normal forms, it is easier to compute the associated half-return maps and to determine the maximal number of periodic orbits than can bifurcate from a pseudo-focus. Furthermore, a recent conjecture in this journal on the behaviour of the displacement function around an invisible fold-fold singularity is shown to be true. We illustrate the obtained results by considering some relevant examples concerning piecewise linear and linear-quadratic systems, also revisiting a piecewise smooth vector field of quasi-homogeneity degree four studied by A.F. Filippov.},

However, when this condition on the memory kernel and considering instead only the weak constraint of boundedness , the problem becomes more complex and it is less easy to prove the approximate controllability of the system. In this study, based on the operator semigroup method, a detailed proof of the approximate controllability of the system is given for the case where the memory kernel is nonconstant and bounded.

The existence of a unique global solution to the Fourier-transformed equation is shown in spaces of characteristic functions whose corresponding probability measures possess finite moments. Due to correspondences of such spaces of probability measures and those of characteristic functions, a unique global probability measure solution to the original equation is found in the weak sense. Moreover, it is shown that if the support of the initial data is in R + R+ , then that of the solution is also in R + R+ . The proof is based on a contraction argument applied to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation and the analysis of a solution as a boundary characteristic function.},

In numerical experiments, an influence of radiation effects on the temperature field and its stabilization is studied.},

This allows us to construct the optimal policy in terms of the solution to a stochastic backward equation under the worst-case scenario. In a time-homogeneous setting – where risk is driven by a geometric Brownian motion and Knightian uncertainty is realized through a so-called “ κ -ignorance” – we are able to provide the explicit form of the optimal irreversible investment plan.},

On the same page, Ramanujan also recorded the series, 1 r exp ⁡ ( 1 s x ) − 1 + 2 r exp ⁡ ( 2 s x ) − 1 + 3 r exp ⁡ ( 3 s x ) − 1 + ⋯ , 1rexp⁡(1sx)−1+2rexp⁡(2sx)−1+3rexp⁡(3sx)−1+⋯, where s is a positive integer and r − s r−s is any even integer. Unfortunately, Ramanujan doesn&#39;t give any formula for it. This series was rediscovered by Kanemitsu, Tanigawa, and Yoshimoto, although they studied it only when r − s r−s is a negative even integer. Recently, Dixit and the second author generalized the work of Kanemitsu et al. and obtained a transformation formula for the aforementioned series with r − s r−s is any even integer. While extending the work of Kanemitsu et al., Dixit and the second author obtained a beautiful generalization of Ramanujan&#39;s formula for odd zeta values. In the current paper, we investigate transformation formulas for an infinite series, and interestingly, we derive Ramanujan&#39;s formula for ζ ( 1 / 2 ) ζ(1/2) , Wigert&#39;s formula for ζ ( 1 / k ) ζ(1/k) as well as Ramanujan&#39;s formula for ζ ( 2 m + 1 ) ζ(2m+1) .

A block partition of X is a partition of a maximal set of mutually orthogonal elements of X , and a decomposition of X is a collection of subsets of X each of which is the orthogonal complement of the union of the others. ( X , ⊥ ) (X,⊥) is called normal if any block partition gives rise to a unique decomposition of the space. The set of one-dimensional subspaces of a Hilbert space equipped with the usual orthogonality relation provides the motivating example. Together with the maps that are, in a natural sense, compatible with the formation of decompositions from block partitions, the normal orthogonality spaces form a category, denoted by N O S NOS . The objective of the present paper is to characterise both the objects and the morphisms of N O S NOS from various perspectives as well as to compile basic categorical properties of N O S NOS .},

  abstract     = {We define and study two new kinds of “effective resistances” based on hubs-biased – hubs-repelling and hubs-attracting – models of navigating a graph/network. We prove that these effective resistances are squared Euclidean distances between the vertices of a graph . They can be expressed in terms of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of the hubs-biased Laplacian matrices of the graph. We define the analogous of the Kirchhoff indices of the graph based of these resistance distances. We prove several results for the new resistance distances and the Kirchhoff indices based on spectral properties of the corresponding Laplacians . After an intensive computational search we conjecture that the Kirchhoff index based on the hubs-repelling resistance distance is not smaller than that based on the standard resistance distance, and that the last is not smaller than the one based on the hubs-attracting resistance distance. We also observe that in real-world brain and neural systems the efficiency of standard random walk processes is as high as that of hubs-attracting schemes. On the contrary, infrastructures and modular software networks seem to be designed to be navigated by using their hubs.},

However, for surfaces with codimension bigger than 1, bilinear and multilinear generalizations of restriction estimates are more involved and effectiveness of these multilinear estimates is not so well understood yet. Regarding the restriction problem for surfaces with codimensions bigger than 1, the current state of the art is still at the level of the ⁎ T T ⁎ TT⁎ method which is known to be useful for obtaining L q Lq – L 2 L2 estimates. In this paper, we consider a special type of codimension 2 surfaces, given by the graphs of complex analytic functions, and attempt to make progress beyond the L 2 L2 restriction estimates.},

The first part of the paper is devoted to the existence and the uniqueness of solutions for general mean-field BDSDEs under the Lipschitz conditions . We emphasize that in the mean-field BDSDEs we study, from Pardoux-Peng&#39;s pioneering work [17] the expected condition that the Lipschitz constant of the coefficient for the backward integral with respect to z is strictly less than 1 is considerably weakened for the Z -component of the law variable of the coefficient. We also establish higher order moment estimates and obtain a comparison theorem of one dimensional general mean-field BDSDEs. Furthermore, we study an existence theorem and a comparison theorem for general mean-field BDSDEs with a continuous coefficient f . Finally, we investigate uniqueness theorems for general mean-field BDSDEs with a uniformly continuous coefficient f .},

While many works on rough paths study the Large Deviations Principles (LDPs) for stochastic processes driven by Gaussian rough paths, it is a noticeable gap in the literature that SBPs have not been extended to the rough path framework. LDPs provide macroscopic information about a measure for establishing Integrability type properties. SBPs provide microscopic information and are used to establish a locally accurate approximation for a measure. Given the compactness of a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) ball, its metric entropy provides invaluable information on how to approximate the law of a Gaussian rough path. As an application, we are able to find upper and lower bounds for the rate of convergence of an empirical rough Gaussian measure to its true law in pathspace.},

It is clear that C ( A ; M ) C(A;M) is a closed linear space of operators, however it is not an algebra, in general. For a given A , we show that C ( A ; M ) C(A;M) is an algebra if and only if the largest subspace M A MA of X X such that C ( A ; M ) = C ( A ; M A ) C(A;M)=C(A;MA) is invariant for every operator in C ( A ; M ) C(A;M) . We say that a closed subspace M ⊆ X M⊆X is ultrainvariant for A ∈ B ( X ) A∈B(X) if it is invariant for every operator in C ( A ; M ) C(A;M) . For several types of operators we prove that they have non-trivial ultrainvariant subspaces. For a normal operator on a Hilbert space , every hyperinvariant subspace is ultrainvariant. On the other hand, the family of all ultrainvariant subspaces of a nilpotent operator can be a proper subset of the lattice of all hyperinvariant subspaces.},

It is well-known that the modulus of the far field pattern is invariant under translations of the scattering obstacle if only one plane wave is used as the incident field, so it is impossible to reconstruct the location of the underlying scatterers. Based on some new research results on the impenetrable obstacle and inhomogeneous isotropic medium, we develop four methods to break the translation invariance property . In the first part, we obtain two uniqueness results by the superposition of two plane waves as the incident field. Then we establish another two uniqueness results by taking the superposition of a plane wave and point sources with different scattering strengths as the incident field.},

Similar famous unsolved problems are connected with f K ( n ) fK(n) , the number of integral ideals of norm n in an algebraic number field K . In this paper we establish Riesz sum identities containing an “extra” parameter and involving f K ( n ) fK(n) , or divisor functions associated with K . Upper bounds for the sums as the upper index tends to infinity are also established.},

Notice that the nonlinearity appearing in the principal operator brings new difficulties, which are different from the semilinear case essentially. Unlike the controllability of a free-boundary problem for the linear and semilinear heat equations, we need to use a delicate Carleman estimate and solve the controllability problem in the frame of classical solutions. We prove that for any initial state that is sufficiently small, there exists a control that derives the state exactly to rest at time t = T t=T .},

Based on an entire function, a lower bound for the distance between exponential functions and the closed span of the remaining elements of the system E Λ EΛ is derived.

By rigorous analysis on the one-resource and two-consumer model with Holling-type I response, we show periodic oscillations and tri-stability in the mutualism system: when their initial densities decrease, the consumers&#39; interaction outcomes would change from coexistence in periodic oscillation, to persistence at a steady state, and to extinction. Under certain conditions, we also show two types of bi-stability in the system: the consumers would change from coexisting in periodic oscillation (resp. at a steady state) to going to extinction when their initial densities decrease. Then we analyze a modified system with Holling-type II response. Based on theoretical analysis and numerical computation, we show that there also exist tri-stability and two types of bi-stability in this system. Moreover, it is shown that varying the degree of obligation can lead to transition of interaction outcomes between coexistence in periodic oscillation (resp. at a steady state) and extinction of both consumers. These results are important in understanding complexity in mutualism.},

We present the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 associated with the coupled system, as well as the existence and uniqueness of the positive equilibrium when R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 . We also analyze the asymptotic behaviors of the basic reproduction number with respect to the diffusion coefficient D , the advection constant ν and the release rate β of Wolbachia -infected male mosquitoes. In addition, we consider the effects of the parameters D , ν and β on the dynamic behaviors of the main model. Finally, we compare the suppression effects in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, and prove that the release proportion threshold in homogeneous environment is smaller. This suggests that the release amount of infected male mosquitoes derived in a homogeneous environment may lead to the failure of mosquito suppression.},

Moreover, we show the existence of a unique H m Hm -solution if the coefficients and the data are sufficiently regular and satisfy certain compatibility conditions.

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the convergence behavior as α → 2 α→2 of the solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with Lipschitz and Hölder drifts, and driven by α -stable Lévy processes . First, we prove that the solution of an SDE driven by an α -stable Lévy process converges weakly to that of an SDE forced by Brownian motion in the Skorokhod space. We mainly employ Aldous&#39; criterion and martingale characterization. Then, by using an abstract result given by Gyöngy and Krylov, we prove that the solution of an SDE driven by the subordinated Brownian motion via an α / 2 α/2 -stable subordinator strongly converges to that of an SDE forced by Brownian motion. Based on uniform estimates of the mean exit times and related probabilistic representations , we also present an α -dependent result for fractional diffusion equations . Finally, given ⁎ α ⁎ α⁎ in ( 1 , 2 ) (1,2) , we discuss the α -continuity of the solution to an SDE driven by an α -stable Lévy process at ⁎ α ⁎ α⁎ .},

We present new conditions for general block Jacobi matrices to be self-adjoint and have discrete spectrum. In the second part of the paper a special classes of block Jacobi matrices J X , α JX,α are investigated. Our approach here substantially relies on a close connection between Jacobi matrices J X , α JX,α from this class and symmetric 2 p × 2 p 2p×2p Dirac operators D X , α DX,α with point interactions in L 2 ( ( a , b ) ; C 2 p ) L2((a,b);C2p) established in our previous papers. In particular, their deficiency indices are related by n ± ( D X , α ) = n ± ( J X , α ) n±(DX,α)=n±(JX,α) and under a simple additional assumption they are discrete only simultaneously. For block Jacobi matrices of this class we present several conditions ensuring equality n ± ( J X , α ) = k n±(JX,α)=k with any k ≤ p k≤p . It is worth mentioning that a connection between Dirac and Jacobi operators is employed here in both directions for the first time. In particular, to prove the equality n ± ( J X , α ) = p n±(JX,α)=p for J X , α JX,α it is first established for Dirac operator D X , α DX,α . We also find several conditions for matrix Schrödinger and Dirac operators with point interactions on finite or infinite intervals to have discrete spectrum.},

We consider the special case in which there is a critical relation between the coefficient of the reaction, the size of the particles and the dimension of the space. This gives rise to a “strange term”, which is not occurring for other scales, and thus the limit cost functional must be suitably defined. In a last section, we use this type of technique to prove a similar “energy convergence” result (improving the H 0 1 ( Ω ) H01(Ω) -weak convergence) for the problem without control for the critical scale case.},

Following [9] we say that an operator T from a Banach lattice F into a Banach space E is DNS, if no restriction of T to a subspace generated by a disjoint sequence is strictly singular. We partially answer a question from [9] by showing that this class of operators forms an open subset of L ( F , E ) L(F,E) as soon as F is order continuous. Moreover, we show that in this case T is DNS if and only if the norm topology is the minimal topology which is simultaneously stronger than the unbounded norm topology and the topology generated by T as a map (we say that T “complements” the unbounded norm topology in F ). Since the class of DNS operators plays a similar role in the category of Banach lattices as the upper semi-Fredholm operators play in the category of Banach spaces, we investigate and indeed uncover a similar characterization of the latter class of operators, but this time they have to complement the weak topology .},

  abstract     = {A long-standing problem raised by Shapiro and Sundberg in 1990, the characterization for compact differences of composition operators acting on the Hardy space over the unit disk, has been recently obtained in terms of certain Carleson measures ( [4] ). The function theoretic characterization for compact differences still remains open in the Hardy space case even on the unit disc and the situation is much more complicated for the several variables case. In this article, we investigate a function theoretic characterization of the compact difference on the Hardy or the Bergman spaces over the unit ball. The condition ρ ( φ ( z ) , ψ ( z ) ) → 0 ρ(φ(z),ψ(z))→0 as max ⁡ { | φ ( z ) | , | ψ ( z ) | } → 1 max⁡{|φ(z)|,|ψ(z)|}→1 is shown to be sufficient for the difference, C φ − C ψ Cφ−Cψ , of two composition operators to be compact on the Hardy or the Bergman spaces over the unit ball when each single composition operator is bounded. We show that this condition is also a necessary condition if the symbols are of class Li p 1 ( B ) Lip1(B) .},

First we show that the class of cw-expansive measures contains properly the expansive measures. Next a homeomorphism of a complete separable metric space is cw-expansive in the sense of Kato [9] if and only if every Borel probability measure is cw-expansive. We shall characterize the cw-expansive measures for equicontinuous homeomorphisms on compact metric spaces as those supported in the non-locally connected points. We also prove that there are no cw-expansive measures for homeomorphisms of the interval. We then derive an alternative proof that there are no cw-expansive homeomorphisms of the circle or the interval (compare with Remark 2.3.6 in [2] ). In the circle we prove that the cw-expansive measures are precisely the ones supported in the minimal set of a Denjoy map. In particular, the cw-expansive and expansive measures coincide in dimension one . We also define cwN-expansive measure for a given nonnegative integer N and prove that a homeomorphism is cw N -expansive in the sense of Artigue [2] if and only if every Borel probability measure is cw N -expansive. Moreover, every N -expansive measure in the sense of [13] is cw N -expansive.},

In this article we extend and improve classical estimates for linear damped wave equations obtained by Matsumura. Our main tool is the decay character of initial data , which has been used to prove similar results for other dissipative equations. We then apply these estimates to recover and improve decay results for the damped wave equation with absorption for initial data in different function spaces.},

This work is dedicated to proving a new type of controllability for a dispersive fifth order equation that models water waves, what we will now call the overdetermination control problem . Precisely, we are able to find a control acting at the boundary that guarantees that the solutions of the problem under consideration satisfy an overdetermination integral condition. In addition, when we make the control act internally in the system, instead of the boundary, we are also able to prove that this condition is satisfied. These problems give answers that were left open in [6] and present a new way to prove boundary and internal controllability results for a fifth order KdV type equation.},

Based on a theory of partial differential equation (PDE), we analytically characterize a variational inequality arising from the optimal stopping problem. We provide a verification theorem that the value function for the original agent&#39;s problem is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the integral of the value functions for the optimal stopping problems.

Under certain sufficient conditions, we first establish a few global existence results corresponding, respectively, to the cases of bounded rates and non-monotonic per-capita growth rates as well as to that of unbounded flocculation rates by using Monod-type growth functions . We then focus on the behaviour of the time-dependent solutions, and prove the stability of the trivial solution and the existence of a non-trivial, positive steady state. We also examine the role played by the parameters of the model. Our arguments rely on the invariant region method, fixed point theory , and spectral theory . Finally, we provide some numerical simulations for different values of the diffusion coefficients to show that the competition between species does not depend on the diffusion of nutrients.},

By applying elementary energy method, we prove the solution of the above equation tends to the planar diffusion wave v ¯ ( x 1 1 + t ) v¯(x11+t) time-asymptotically, where v ¯ ( x 1 1 + t ) v¯(x11+t) is a self-similar solution of the one dimensional equation v ¯ t + C 0 v ¯ x 1 2 = v ¯ x 1 x 1 , v ¯ ( ± ∞ , t ) = v ± , v + ≠ v − v¯t+C0v¯x12=v¯x1x1,v¯(±∞,t)=v±,v+≠v− , with C 0 = 1 2 ∂ 2 f ( ξ ) ∂ ξ 1 2 | ξ = 0 C0=12∂2f(ξ)∂ξ12|ξ=0 .

Firstly, we prove the global existence, uniform boundedness and ultimate boundedness of solutions as well as the existence of a global attractor for the equivalent model. Secondly, we investigate a limiting system to establish the threshold dynamics for the model in terms of the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 by using the theories of monotone dynamical systems and chain transitive sets. More precisely, we show that if R 0 ≤ 1 R0≤1 , then the infection-free steady state is globally stable; and if R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 , then the system has a globally stable endemic steady state. Finally, we use the numerical method to explore the influence of different diffusion coefficients on R 0 R0 . In the case where the transmission rate is independent of diffusion coefficient, the numerical results indicate that R 0 R0 is decreasing with respect to the diffusion rate. In the case where the transmission rate is a function of diffusion coefficient, we find that in a less polluted environment, R 0 R0 is a decreasing function with respect to the diffusion rate, which implies that the diffusion of bacteria is beneficial for patients; while in a more polluted environment, R 0 R0 may increase with increasing diffusion rate, which means increasing diffusion of bacteria is harmful for the elimination of disease.},

More precisely, we show how to characterize the properties of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients in the presence of high-order poles; Further the initial value problem is formulated into an appropriate enlarged RH problem, which is transformed into a solvable model after a series of deformations. Finally, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the fNLS equation in any fixed space-time cone: S ( x 1 , x 2 , v 1 , v 2 ) : = { ( x , t ) ∈ R 2 : x = x 0 + v t , x 0 ∈ [ x 1 , x 2 ] , v ∈ [ v 1 , v 2 ] } . S(x1,x2,v1,v2):={(x,t)∈R2:x=x0+vt,x0∈[x1,x2], v∈[v1,v2]}. Our result is a verification of the soliton resolution conjecture for the fNLS equation in the solitonic region with the presence of high-order discrete spectrum. The leading order term of this solution includes a high-order pole-soliton whose parameters are affected by soliton-soliton interactions through the cone and soliton-radiation interactions on continuous spectrum. The error term is up to O ( t − 3 / 4 ) O(t−3/4) which comes from the corresponding ∂ ¯ ∂¯ equation.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide; it emerges as a result of multiple dynamical cell processes including hemodynamics, endothelial damage, innate immunity and sterol biochemistry. Making matters worse, nearly 21 million Americans have diabetes, a disease where patients&#39; cells cannot efficiently take in dietary sugar, causing it to build up in the blood. In part because diabetes increases atherosclerosis-related inflammation, diabetic patients are twice as likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Past work has shown that hyperglycemia and insulin resistance alter function of multiple cell types, including endothelium, smooth muscle cells and platelets, indicating the extent of vascular disarray in this disease. Although the pathophysiology of diabetic vascular disease is generally understood, there is no mathematical model to date that includes the effect of diabetes on plaque growth. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for diabetic atherosclerosis; the model is given by a system of partial differential equations with a free boundary. We establish local existence and uniqueness of solution to the model. The methodology is to use Hanzawa transformation to reduce the free boundary to a fixed boundary and reduce the system of partial differential equations to an abstract evolution equation in Banach spaces , and apply the theory of analytic semigroup.},

In this paper, we show that such log-factors are not necessary. We derive upper bounds for the L 2 L2 minimax risk in nonparametric estimation . Sufficient conditions on network architectures are provided such that the upper bounds become optimal (without log-sacrifice). Our proof relies on an explicitly constructed network estimator based on tensor product B-splines. We also derive asymptotic distributions for the constructed network and a relating hypothesis testing procedure . The testing procedure is further proved as minimax optimal under suitable network architectures.},

For example, ∑ k = 0 p − 1 ( α ) k ( 1 − α ) k ( 1 ) k 2 ⋅ z k ≡ ∑ k = 0 p − 1 ( 1 2 α ) k ( 1 2 − 1 2 α ) k ( 1 ) k 2 ⋅ 4 k z k ( 1 − z ) k ( mod p 2 ) , ∑k=0p−1(α)k(1−α)k(1)k2⋅zk≡∑k=0p−1(12α)k(12−12α)k(1)k2⋅4kzk(1−z)k(modp2), provided that the least non-negative residues of α modulo p is even. In particular, we discuss the connection between the elliptic curves and some truncated hypergeometric functions modulo p 2 p2 . Furthermore, we confirm a conjecture of Deines et al. by using an identity of Kummer.},

  abstract     = {The history of Bergman spaces goes back to the book [4] in the early fifties by S. Bergman, where the first systematic treatment of the subject was given, and since then there have been a lot of papers devoted to this area. Some standard works here are [5] , [8] , [15] , [28] and the references therein, which contain a broad summary and historical notes of the subject, that frees us from referring to missing details. In their recent works González-Cervantes, Luna-Elizarrarás and Shapiro [11] , [12] , laid the foundations for the generalization of the theory of Bergman spaces induced by Laplacian (sometimes called solenoidal and irrotational, or harmonic) vector fields by taking advantage on the intimate connections between harmonic vector fields theory and quaternionic analysis for the Moisil-Theodorescu operator (MT-operator for short). A deeper discussion of the last mentioned relation can be found in [1] . On the setting of general bounded domains in R 3 R3 , we extend the aforementioned study in a very natural way to the case of an introduced v -MT-operator for v ∈ R 3 v∈R3 , proving several properties of induced Bergman spaces and some relative results about Stokes and Borel-Pompieu formulas for v -MT-hyperholomorphic functions, i.e., functions which belong to kernel of the v -MT-operator. In addition, we show that this v -MT operator satisfies a conformal co-variant property. Application of all the above allows to study of Bergman type spaces induced by v -Laplacian vector fields theory, which represents the main goal of this paper.},

  abstract     = {Predation-driven Allee effects play an important role in the dynamics of a small prey population; however, such effects cannot occur for the model with type I functional response. Predator-driven Allee effects generally occur when a generalist predator targets some specific prey. However, apart from the lethal effects of predation, there are some non-lethal effects in the presence of a predator. Due to the fear of predation, positive density dependence growth of prey may be observed at low population density because of reduced foraging activities. Moreover, such a non-lethal effect can be carried over through generations or seasons. In the present manuscript, we investigate the role of predation fear and its carry-over effects in the prey-predator model. First, we study the single-species model from a global perspective. We have shown that depending on the birth rate; our single-species model describes three types of growth dynamics, namely, strong Allee dynamics, weak Allee dynamics, and logistic dynamics. Then we include the explicit dynamics of the predator, with type I functional response. Basic dynamical properties, as well as the global stability of each equilibrium, have been discussed. From our analysis, we can observe that both the fear and its carry-over effects have a significant role in the stability of the coexistence equilibrium, even for the model with type I functional response. The phenomenon ‘paradox of enrichment’ can be observed in our model, which cannot be observed in the classical prey-predator model with type I functional response. However, we can see that such a phenomenon can be ruled out by choosing suitable non-lethal effect parameters. Therefore, our study shows how non-lethal effects change the dynamics of a prey-predator model and has powerful biological insights, especially for understanding the dynamics of small populations.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) are complex oscillatory patterns in which large-amplitude oscillations (LAOs) of relaxation type alternate with small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs). MMOs are found in singularly perturbed systems of ordinary differential equations of slow-fast type, and are typically related to the presence of so-called folded singularities and the corresponding canard trajectories in such systems. Here, we introduce a canonical family of three-dimensional slow-fast systems that exhibit MMOs which are induced by relaxation-type dynamics, and which are hence based on a “jump mechanism”, rather than on a more standard canard mechanism. In particular, we establish a correspondence between that family and a class of associated one-dimensional piecewise affine maps (PAMs) which exhibit MMOs with the same signature. Finally, we give a preliminary classification of admissible mixed-mode signatures, verifying results of (Rajpathak, Pillai, and Bandyopahdyay (2012) [29] ) in the process, and we illustrate our findings with numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {We study the classification of invariant solutions of a class of nonlinear wave equations using Lie symmetry analysis and the underlying optimal systems of subalgebras . We propose a classification of Lie generators via optimal systems for four cases that arise therein. These optimal systems are presented in a convenient tree leaf diagram. Corresponding to each class, complete symmetry reductions and the invariant solutions are presented. To the best of our knowledge, this classification of optimal systems is new and do not appear in the literature. Our results also lead to the establishment of the local conservation laws corresponding to each conserved vector via the multiplier approach.},

Our purpose is to establish the existence of a local-in-time solution to this coupled problem. Firstly, fixing the temperature distribution , we study the resulting Maxwell system, a nonautonomous system due to the dependence of the permittivity on the temperature and consequently on time, by using the theory of evolution systems. Next, we return to our coupled problem, introducing a fixed-point problem in the closed convex set K ( 0 ; R ) : = { z ∈ B ¯ ( 0 ; R ) ; z ( 0 ) = 0 } K(0;R):={z∈B¯(0;R);z(0)=0} of the Banach space C 1 ( [ 0 , T ] ; C 1 ( Ω ¯ ) ) C1([0,T];C1(Ω¯)) and proving that the hypotheses of Schauder&#39;s theorem are verified for R sufficiently large.

A saturated incidence rate is also considered which is more realistic than the bilinear rate. The characteristics method reduces the model to a coupled system of a reaction-diffusion equation and a continuous difference equation with a time-delay and a nonlocal spatial term caused by individuals moving during their protection phase. We study the existence and non-existence of non-trivial traveling wave solutions . We get almost complete information on the threshold and the minimal wave speed that describes the transition between the existence and non-existence of non-trivial traveling waves that indicate whether the epidemic can spread or not. We discuss how model parameters, such as protection rates, affect the minimal wave speed. The difficulty of our model is to combine a reaction-diffusion system with a continuous difference equation. We deal with our problem mainly by using Schauder&#39;s fixed point theorem . More precisely, we reduce the problem of the existence of non-trivial traveling wave solutions to the existence of an admissible pair of upper and lower solutions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a variational formulation for the Dirichlet problem of the wave equation with zero boundary and initial conditions, where we use integration by parts in space and time. To prove unique solvability in a subspace of H 1 ( Q H1(Q ) with Q being the space–time domain, the classical assumption is to consider the right–hand side f in L 2 ( Q ) L2(Q) . Here, we analyze a generalized setting of this variational formulation, which allows us to prove unique solvability also for f being in the dual space of the test space, i.e., the solution operator is an isomorphism between the ansatz space and the dual of the test space. This new approach is based on a suitable extension of the ansatz space to include the information of the differential operator of the wave equation at the initial time t = 0 t=0 . These results are of utmost importance for the formulation and numerical analysis of unconditionally stable space–time finite element methods, and for the numerical analysis of boundary element methods to overcome the well–known norm gap in the analysis of boundary integral operators.},

When the vector lattice has an order dense ideal with a separating order continuous dual, it is always possible to supply it with such a topology in this fashion, and the restriction of this topology to a regular sublattice is then also a Hausdorff uo-Lebesgue topology. A regular vector sublattice of L 0 ( X , Σ , μ ) L0(X,Σ,μ) for a semi-finite measure μ falls into this category, and the convergence of nets in its Hausdorff uo-Lebesgue topology is then the convergence in measure on subsets of finite measure. When a vector lattice not only has an order dense ideal with a separating order continuous dual, but also has the countable sup property, we show that every net in a regular vector sublattice that converges in its Hausdorff uo-Lebesgue topology always contains a sequence that is uo-convergent to the same limit. This enables us to give satisfactory answers to various topological questions about uo-convergence in this context.},

We show that the well-known Spectral Gap Condition, which was used in the theory of inertial manifolds by C. Foias, R. Temam and G.R. Sell, is a particular case of some frequency inequality, which arises within the Frequency Theorem. In particular, this allows to construct inertial manifolds for semilinear parabolic equations (including also some non-autonomous problems) in the context of a more general geometric theory developed in our adjacent works. This theory is based on quadratic Lyapunov functionals and generalizes the frequency-domain approach used by R.A. Smith. We also discuss the optimality of frequency inequalities and its relationship with known old and recent results in the field.},
