  abstract     = {This study investigates the effect of polyurea coating on the ballistic resistance of polyurea-steel laminate plates. Ballistic tests are carried out to compare the residual velocities and failure modes of the monolithic steel plate and polyurea-steel laminate plates on an equal mass basis. Experimental results show that polyurea coating could lead to an enhanced ballistic resistance of the laminate plate (with 5.2\% greater ballistic limit velocity), but only when applied at the impact-receiving face. Finite element simulations are performed to provide insights into the penetration process and the energy partitioning to reveal the enhancing mechanisms of the frontal polyurea coating. Excellent agreement was obtained between the numerical simulations and the experimental results. Simulation results suggest that the frontal polyurea-coating has a cushioning effect to alleviate and redistribute the total contact force acting on the substrate steel layer, which helps to spread the local impact to a far-field response. The polyurea-coating on the impact-receiving face provides additional ballistic resistance by promoting greater energy dissipation of the steel layer through global deformation.},

  abstract     = {Cellulose nanofibril (CNF) has become a renewable and sustainable building block for functional and structural materials. In this study, combining chemical structure analyses, mechanical experiments, and first principle calculations, we elaborate on the strengthening and toughening mechanisms for the wet-drawn bacterial cellulose (BC) films that contain metal ion crosslinks. Wet-drawing assists the alignment of CNFs, and multivalent metal ion cross-linking further improves the inter-fibril interactions. BC films cross-linked with Na + , Ca 2+ , Cu 2+ , Al 3+ , and Fe 3+ all demonstrate improved mechanical strength than the as-received samples. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that besides the electrostatic forces between the metal ions and the adjacent carboxylate oxygen atoms, Cu 2+ and Fe 3+ can also form coordination bonds with the adjacent carboxylate oxygen atoms. Among all the five metal ions tried herein, Fe 3+ introduces the strongest cross-links between nanofibrils through coordination bonds and electrostatic forces. The BC films cross-linked with Fe 3+ exhibit high tensile strength and toughness of 451.51 MPa and 8.19 MJ∙m −3 , respectively. The underlying mechanisms discovered herein open new possibilities for utilizing natural fibers.},

The development of multifunctional nanozymes that combines the physiochemical properties of nanomaterials ( e.g. special optical transformation properties) and catalytic activities of enzymes (mainly including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and oxidase) can provide promising weapons for enhancing antitumor efficiency. Importantly, some types of nanozymes can also act as ideal nanocarriers for improving therapeutic reagent delivery, especially in tumor immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in multifunctional nanozymes with an emphasis on their applications in catalytic therapy combined with immunotherapy, phototherapy, sonodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. We believe this review will provide theoretical and technical support for the subsequent development of nanozyme-based antitumor reagents and inspire novel therapeutic strategies for efficient tumor therapy.},

Although this can be achieved by the wet chemical and template strategies, the uncertainty of reaction process inevitably results in the difficulty of the repeatability of product synthesis. Herein, we present the rationally designed 3D Ni-Mo with a typical hierarchical structure on Ni foam by combing ‘hydrogen bubble template’ and ‘tip effect’ via one-step electrodeposition. This 3D Ni-Mo/NF has both regular columnar structures of micron level and widespread pyramidal-like nanoparticles, which only needs an overpotential of 53 mV and 161 mV to afford 10 mA cm −2 and 100 mA cm −2 for HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. In addition, a small Tafel slope (42.6 mV dec -1 ), and long-term operational stability are achieved on the catalyst. The excellent performance can be traced to the amorphous and hierarchical structure with favorable active sites. Furthermore, the network structure of the nickel foam substrate can promote the diffusion and infiltration of electrolyte. Impressively, this electrode exhibits super hydrophilic, which facilitates the detachment of bubbles. The free-standing 3D catalysts in this study can be synthesized in a facile and viable way, indicating their promising tactic for scaled-up water electrolysis.},

In this study, nano-needle-like structures were prepared on titanium by hot alkali treatment and then coated with uniform silver (Ag) and strontium titanate (SrTiO 3 ) through magnetron sputtering. The results of ion release showed that the SrTiO 3 outer coating reduced the release of Ag ions by 30\% and 15\% respectively on the 4th and 7th days, thus effectively improving the bioactivity of the Ag-modified substrates. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the Ag/SrTiO 3 -coated specimens (AH-Ti/Ag/Sr) had an excellent effect on the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and exhibited antibacterial function against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (percentage of dead/total bacteria: ∼93\% and ∼88\%). Moreover, the in vivo results further confirmed that the Ag/SrTiO 3 bilayer coating significantly promoted osteogenesis around the AH-Ti/Ag/Sr implant (the new bone volume and the number of trabeculae: 1.5 and 1.4 fold of the control group) and enhanced the bonding strength between implant and surrounding bone (about 1.9 fold of the control group). All these findings indicate that AH-Ti/Ag/Sr can substantially improve osteogenesis in complex oral microenvironment, and thus has potential applications in oral implantology.},

  abstract     = {High-integrity welds found in safety–critical industries require flaw-free joints, but automation is challenging due to low-volume, often-unique nature of the work, alongside high-uncertainty part-localisation. As such, robotic welding still requires tedious manually taught paths or offline approaches based on nominal Computer-Aided-Design (CAD). Optical and laser sensors are commonly deployed to provide online adjustment of pre-defined paths within controlled environments. This paper presents a sensor-driven approach for defect-free welding, based on the as-built joint geometry alongside the requirement for no-accurate part localisation or CAD knowledge. The approach a) autonomously localises the specimen in the scene without CAD requirement, b) adapts and generates accurate welding paths unique to the as-built workpiece and c) generates robot kinematics based on an external-control strategy. The proposed approach is validated through experiments of unconstrained placed joints, where the increased accuracy of the generated welding paths, with no common seam tracking, is validated with an average error of 0.12 mm, 0.4°. Coupling with a multi-pass welding framework, the deployment of fully automated robotic arc welding takes place for different configurations. Non-Destructive-Testing (NDT) in the form of Ultrasound-Testing (UT) inspection validates the repeatable and flaw-free nature of the sensory-driven approach, exploiting direct benefits in quality alongside reduced re-work.},

  abstract     = {Although magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) is an efficient surface finishing technique, its promotion and use in the precise polishing of high-hardness objects are constrained by the poor finishing performance and short service life of magnetic abrasive powders (MAPs). In this study, a double-stage atomization technique is employed to successfully manufacture MAPs with a polycrystalline diamond (PCD) as an abrasive phase. Analysis was performed on the graphitization of PCD abrasive and the circularity of the created MAPs as a result of cooling temperature. Therefore, the pressure ranges of the first-stage atomizer are suggested based on the theoretically designed kinetic model of PCD abrasives&#39; penetration behavior into liquid metal. As revealed in the preparation experiment findings, PCD abrasives with their original crystal structure were deeply embedded on the surface of a spherical iron matrix. The generated PCD MAPs with smaller particle sizes exhibited better soft magnetic characteristics due to the atomization process’ quick cooling. The MAF results implied that PCD MAPs curtailed the roughness of cemented carbide from 302 nm to 85.2 nm, and their service life exceeds 60 min. The findings of this research can provide technical assistance for the creation of high-performance PCD MAPs.},

The single-crystal repair is characterised by a fine columnar dendritic substructure, limited in-grain misorientation over tens of millimetres in height, and strong deposit-to-substrate bonding. The brighter contrast region of 300 to 400 μm thick, formed by the cellular solidification front, sits above the melted back region with a horizontal low-angle boundary (4° misorientation) in-between. Its higher hardness of 450 HV is attributed to the fine cuboidal primary γ′ of 135 ± 7 nm. Their presence is a combined effect of high cooling rate and limited local compositional difference. The Scheil-Gulliver predicted solute partitioning of Ta and Hf to the inter-dendritic region agrees well with the MC carbides appearing at the columnar dendritic and cellular boundaries. Computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) simulations, combined with the minimum undercooling criterion, helps to determine the vertical distance between the melt-pool bottom and the oriented-to-misoriented transition borderline, providing a convenient guideline to assess the single-crystal likelihood, in a sense that this distance needs to be larger than the hatch depth. The CFD-calculated solidification velocities and thermal gradients agree with the columnar-to-equiaxed transition curve and the experimental observation.},

To address this problem, a warm isostatic press (WIP) process was adopted to control the temperature and isostatic pressure in the chamber. When only the temperature was applied (annealing), the tensile strength increased, but the elongation at break decreased in specimens fabricated with powders of polyamide 12 (PA12) because of the increase in crystallinity without a decrease in porosities. However, when temperature and pressure were simultaneously applied, the tensile strength increased compared with tensile strengths of specimens treated with and without post-processing. The elongation at break compensates for the reduced value obtained by annealing. To identify the effect of the WIP process on the specimens fabricated by the PBF process, mechanical properties were quantitatively investigated. Additionally, tightness and injection moulding tests were performed to qualitatively estimate the effect. These tests verified the effectiveness of the WIP process in the PBF process.},

MAPs are able to form drug depots in the viable skin from where poorly soluble drugs dissolve in a long-acting fashion, showing promise in the management of multiple diseases. The manufacture of these systems can present some challenges, including the presence of bubbles in the baseplates and consequent lack of uniformity in microneedle formation and drug content. Here, we present a simple method based on ring inserts to produce tip-loaded MAPs using the antiretroviral drug cabotegravir sodium (CAB). The obtained MAPs presented a high uniformity in terms of microneedle formation, and a suitable insertion capability, as per the mechanical characterisation performed. An optimisation based on design of experiments revealed that centrifugation parameters had a significant impact on the skin deposition of the MAPs in excised neonatal porcine skin using Franz cells, with values ranging from 62.24 ± 47.13 µg to 174.13 ± 41.10 µg of CAB. Pharmacokinetic studies carried out in rats evidenced the capacity of the MAPs to maintain therapeutic plasma levels of CAB for 14 days, with T max values reached between 5 and 8 days.},

CRISPR is one such valuable genetic editing tool with extensive therapeutic appliances but with a major challenge in terms of delivery. Herein, we have strived to exploit a synergy of nanocarriers and CRISPR against the aforementioned diseases for their medical applications and explicated their clinical significance including the enhanced delivery via endosomal escape and environmental factors such as light, pH, and stimuli.

This study used algorithms based on scaling factors to design Voronoi scaffolds (pore sizes 600–1200 μm). Scaffolds were prepared from β-tricalcium phosphate slurry and 3D printed using stereolithography. Characterization analysis revealed that the microporous structures were correctly processed. Computational fluid dynamics indicated that scaffold permeability increased and the specific surface area decreased with increasing pore size, and the wall shear stress was highest in P800 scaffolds (pore size-800 μm). In addition, MC3T3 cells were dynamically seeded and were more evenly distributed and showed higher proliferation and differentiation on the P800 scaffold than the other three scaffolds in vitro . For in vivo experiment, scaffolds were implanted into rabbit femur to analyze the degradation and osteogenesis. Histological and imaging examinations revealed that new bone formation was more abundant on the surface and inside of the P800 scaffold than the other three scaffolds, which was explained by the hydrodynamic response. This study optimized a controllable method for designing Voronoi scaffolds and indicated that the pore size distribution of the P800 scaffold (458.8–989.1 μm) is an optimal choice for trabecular scaffolds.},

This study proposes a novel design methodology to functionally grade the morphology of a TPMS channel for enhancement of the fluid flow performance. Mathematical filtering was performed to change the SDF distribution through various combinations of multiple sigmoid functions, thus locally changing the TPMS geometry. The proposed local filtering was then implemented in the design of a TPMS flow channel to reduce the flow resistance in the inlet and outlet regions. Pressure drop tests were conducted using additively manufactured TPMS channels, and the results showed that the pressure drop decreased by 20\% for the filtered design with a volume change of only 2.6\%. Numerical simulations were performed to analyze the cause of reduced flow resistance in the locally filtered regions, and the results were verified through flow visualization experiments. Considering that a TPMS structure has a complex geometry and thus its manual modification is very difficult, the proposed filtering method offers an efficient approach for functionally changing the morphology of the TPMS structure.},

  abstract     = {Additive friction stir deposition has been proposed as a disruptive manufacturing process; involving complex thermo-mechanical mechanisms during multilayer material deposition. The current efforts have attempted to develop a FEM based pseudo-mechanical thermal model accounting for heat generation due to friction and plastic dissipation during multilayer additive friction stir deposition. The primary motivation for development of the model was to seek an understanding of thermo-mechanical mechanisms and their impact on microstructural evolution during additive friction stir deposition. The predicted temperature–time profiles agreed well with the experimentally derived ones. The computational predictions indicate rise of the peak temperatures up to 0.8 times the melting temperature of Mg-alloy. In addition, the Zener-Holloman parameter, Ze evaluated using the computational model was correlated with the microstructural evolution during the deposition process. The unique thermo-mechanical processing conditions during additive friction stir deposition led to dynamic recrystallization followed by grain coarsening. A significant extent of texture strengthening was observed in the AFSD processed samples. The already established phenomenological relationship between Ze and grain size was used to predict the grain size in the present work. The computational predictions indicate that the recrystallized grain size ranged from 4 to 6 µm, and the post deformation grain coarsening varied in the range of 4–24 µm, thereby providing reasonable agreement with the experimental observations.},

Systematic tilting high-resolution transmission electron microscopy patterns were applied to study the interfacial microstructure. A nanoscale (&lt; 250 nm) interfacial layer was found at the 6061/FeCoCrNiMn interface and the phase formed in this layer was identified as Al 13 Fe 4 -type intermetallic compound (IMC) with the Fe-sites occupied by HEA elements. Microsegregation of HEA elements was observed in this Al 13 Fe 4 -type IMC in two different modes: 1) co-segregation of Cr and Mn and co-depletion of Co and Ni, for the majority of the interfacial layer, and 2) co-segregation of Co and Ni and co-depletion of Cr and Mn, mainly in regions adjacent to the Al alloy side and sporadic in the middle. The maximum tensile lap shear strength reached 151 MPa, which was approximately 73\% of the shear strength of 6061 base material. The joint fracture occurred within Al alloy nearby the interface rather than right along the interfacial layer, suggesting high interfacial metallurgical bonding achieved in this study.},

However, optimisation of scanning strategy would result in improved material properties. Here, the optimal scanning strategy for fatigue-loaded high-performance aluminium alloys, such as Scalmalloy®, was investigated. This study demonstrates how to reduce uncontrolled interactions of the laser with the distinct weld plume, created by highly volatile alloying elements such as Mg. Tensile and fatigue testing were used to assess the structural integrity of specimens, in which different welding modes had been used. It is shown that a combination of: scan vector angle restriction; reduction of the scan vector length; and laser spot adjustments reduce the overall defect size and improves the build quality in Scalmalloy®. A bimodal microstructure with outstanding mechanical properties was observed: an ultimate tensile strength of 524 MPa was achieved with 17\% elongation at fracture. In order to evaluate the influence of the defect size, fatigue tests were performed at a stress ratio of R = 0.1 R=0.1 . Under optimal processing conditions, fatigue strengths of up to 360 M P a 360MPa at 3 · 10 7 3·107 cycles were obtained, significantly outperforming both conventionally and additively produced aluminium alloys.},

  abstract     = {Laser truing has broad application prospects, but the problems of thermal damage and the metamorphic layer of diamond have not been well solved, which significantly affects the quality and precision of truing. To address these problems, we propose a novel laser truing method with a spray-mist assistant (SMA) for an electroplated diamond grinding wheel. First, the action mechanism of SMA laser truing is analysed. Subsequently, the effects of the truing parameters, including the spray pressure and laser truing iterations, on the SMA laser truing quality are studied. Next, a new analysis method is proposed to describe the SMA laser truing effect and thermal damage based on the fractal theory. Finally, the laser truing of an electroplated diamond grinding wheel based on SMA is described. The results show that the SMA laser truing effect is closely related to the spray pressure and truing iterations. The influence of the SMA laser truing iterations on the height of the abrasive grains on the surface of the grinding wheel can be divided into three key stages: rapid decrease stage, slow decrease stage, and stable stage. The inhibition of diamond graphitisation by SMA laser truing is remarkable, and the graphitisation phenomenon is completely eliminated.},

Quantitatively analyzed the protective performance of helmets show that wearing ACH can’t reduce the severity of brain injury, but rather increased about 5\% compared to without wearing helmet. Wearing fully-covered helmet with same thickness as ACH can reduces the degree of brain injury by about 5\%. Fully-covered helmet with same weight as ACH provides better protection, which can reduce the degree of brain injury to 65\% than without wearing helmet. Research show that optimizing the shape and thickness of helmet can greatly reduce the brain injury, lighter fully-covered helmet can provide better protection for the brain under blast wave environment.

Herein, we observe sustainable and self-recoverable NIR ML emission in pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method grown ZnS:Mn film, for the first time. ML emission in ZnS:Mn can be explained by the piezoelectricity-induced detrapping model. Broad ML emission covering both red and NIR ranges arises from the presence of (Mn) n clusters, which facilitates the energy transfer from excited Mn 2+ ions to them. During the PLD growth, high laser fluence and deposition rate contribute to the formation of (Mn) n clusters, which was verified by electron paramagnetic resonance EPR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS analysis. The device exhibits durable NIR ML over 10 5 repeated mechanical stresses, suggesting new possibilities aiming for constructing self-recoverable NIR ML materials.},

In this paper, nano-composite EuBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ -BaHfO 3 (EuBCO/BHO) films were deposited by the ultra-fast pulsed laser deposition technique. All nano-composite films exhibited high-quality orientation under the growth rates up to 100 nm/s. TEM cross-sectional analysis reveals that the EuBCO/BHO films have a distinct lamellar structure, which is related to the periodic change of growth conditions during the multi-turn dynamic deposition. In addition, the morphology of BHO varies with dopant content, which suggests a strong correlation between dopant content and the BHO self-assembly mechanism. Consequently, the vortex behavior shifts from giant-flux creep to vortex-glass formation at the thermally activated flux flow region as the dopant content increases. The primary flux pinning behaviors change from random to correlated pinning with the increase of dopant content at 4.2 K. Due to the larger contribution of the correlated pinning machinimas, the 8\% BHO-doped EuBCO film exhibits the highest J c value at 4.2 K, with moderate fields (below 8 T) among all the three films. At 4.2 K and 14 T, the 6\% BHO doped EuBCO film has the highest F p value attributing to the predominate random pinning mechanism.},

In this study, Alginate (ALG) membrane and Pluronic® F-127(P) hydrogel incorporated with alpha-tocopherol (AT) and TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCN) were designed. The ALG-TOCN-AT membrane was prepared using the casting method and P-TOCN-AT thermos-sensitive hydrogel was prepared using the cold mixing method. The gelation time of the P-TOCN-AT hydrogel was 45 ± 1.2 s at 37 °C and the viscosity of the hydrogel at 37 °C was higher than the viscosity measured at 25 °C. Further, the addition of TOCN and AT significantly improved the tensile strain of the membrane. An immediate release of AT was achieved in P-TOCN-AT gel while the ALG-TOCN-AT membrane released AT in a sustained manner. Cell proliferation study revealed the nontoxic nature of the hydrogel and membrane. Full-thickness skin wounds of diabetic rats were better healed by combined use of membrane and hydrogel compared to individual application of membrane or hydrogel. The highest neoepithelialization and angiogenesis was confirmed through CD31, CD105, and CD34 gene expression analysis.

  abstract     = {Nanomedicine delivery systems combined with photodynamic therapy, improve targeted cancer enrichment, reduce side effects, and enhance anticancer efficacy. Additionally, ferroptosis has emerged as a novel cancer-killing mechanism, with great potential in cancer treatment. The study aimed to treat head and neck cancers by manufacturing ZIF-8@ssPDA as a drug carrier for the chlorin e6 (Ce6) photosensitizer in response to dual stimuli of the tumor microenvironment. The ZIF-8 structure can efficiently load Ce6, and polydopamine modified with a disulfide bond (ssPDA) is evenly and densely distributed on the ZIF-8 surface. In tumor microenvironments where glutathione (GSH) concentrations are high, the ssPDA structure ruptures, directly consuming GSH and further inactivating GPX4, thereby establishing a specific anticancer effect through the ferroptosis pathway. Furthermore, the Ce6@ZIF-8 structure responsively collapses in the acidic tumor microenvironment, releasing loaded Ce6. Under the excitation of a 660-nm near-infrared laser, large singlet oxygen can be generated from released Ce6 within a short period, exerting a strong photodynamic anticancer effect. Depending on the characteristic tumor microenvironment with high GSH level and acidic environment, this dual-responsive strategy combines a photodynamic and ferroptotic effect; it might improve the treatment efficacy of head and neck cancers.},

  abstract     = {Rotator cuff tear of shoulder is a common tendon injury. Current therapeutic strategies are unsatisfactory because of poor biomechanical properties of the repaired rotator cuff tendons. To solve this problem, a newly biofabricated tenogenic patch by uniaxial cold-drawing technology was applied for the treatment of acute rotator cuff tear and its therapeutic effects were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The cytocompatibility results indicated that the engineered patch was capable of promoting the spreading, migration and proliferation of tendon fibroblasts in vitro . Stress–strain curves of the sutured patch indicated improved elasticity followed by the yield phenomena, nonlinear plasticity and obviously delaminated rupture. The tenogenic patch also showed significantly enhanced collagen I deposition and better tendon-to-bone healing in the rat rotator cuff tear models in vivo . Furthermore, implantation with the tenogenic patch also promoted the fibrocartilage formation in Safranin-O/Fast green-staining. The analysis of biomechanical properties showed that the tenogenic patch is capable of improving the ultimate load of the repaired tendon. Therefore, the tenogenic patch may constitute an efficient strategy to enhance tendon-to-bone healing for clinical repair applications of rotator cuff tear.},

  abstract     = {Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by bacteria. The prolonged and repeated occurrence of this disease results from immune system disorders and leads to the destruction of surrounding tissues. Research on new antibacterial materials that can regulate autoimmunity and promote repair can effectively treat periodontal inflammation. Hence, metal–phenolic networks (MPNs) were loaded onto the surface of branched AuAg nanoparticles (NPs), denoted as AuAg@PC-Fe. The procyanidin (PC)-Fe network not only enhanced the photothermal properties of AuAg NPs to achieve effective photothermal antibacterial activity against periodontal pathogens but also alleviated oxidative stress and excessive inflammation. The mechanism of action is as follows: AuAg@PC-Fe promotes the polarisation of alternatively activated macrophages by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway and upregulates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, scavenging reactive oxygen species and subsequently inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway to regulate immunity. The ability of periodontal inflammatory tissue to repair was improved in vivo. This design provides new ideas for applying MPNs to photothermal therapy and immunotherapy. It presents a new therapeutic platform for treating periodontitis and other infectious diseases.},

The results show that the RFW processing evolves from the heat stage to the quasi-steady stage with a trade-off of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and grain boundary sliding (GBS). From 0 s for the base metal (BM) to 3.6 s, the DRX intensity changes from strong to weak relative to the GBS intensity, resulting in the non-monotonic evolution of the microstructure, e.g., the texture, the average grain size and the geometrically necessary dislocation, with welding time. The evolution results in non-monotonic evolution of the fatigue properties: specimens with welding time of 0.8 s, 1.2 s and 3.6 s, have fatigue lives of approximately 150,000, 200,000, and 100,000 cycles, respectively. The microstructure evolves with the welding time through the texture strength, grain size, and dislocation density, affecting the dislocation and slip mobility. This evolution not only directly affects the rates of crack initiation and extension, but also makes the initiation point of fatigue crack change on the fillet, which affects the fatigue life.},

However, there is a need to understand the interactions between: (i) the material architecture, (ii) the AM process parameters, and (iii) the as-built geometry, microstructure and energy absorbing properties. In this work, we investigate the quasi-static and dynamic behaviour of cellular materials manufactured from 316L stainless steel using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Four cellular architectures are considered (octet lattice, lattice-walled square honeycomb, origami and square honeycomb), as well as three sets of AM process parameters, characterised by laser powers of 50, 125 and 200 W. The exposure time is adjusted to deliver the same total heat input. The 125 W case leads to material with the highest strength and ductility. The cellular materials with this process variant match their nominal densities most closely, and have the highest strength and energy absorption. Either reducing (50 W) or increasing (200 W) the power leads to a significant increase in porosity, reducing strength and energy absorption. However, we find that changes due to process-induced porosity have a smaller influence than those resulting from the choice of cellular architecture.},

Based on the calculation results, the relationship between the geometrical parameters of the periodic arch structure and band gap frequency are analyzed, and an empirical correlation is formulated for the generation of a training database for a machine learning optimization model. The geometrical parameters of the metamaterial were optimized using the machine learning model based on an autoencoder architecture with supervised learning.

  abstract     = {The Powder Bed Fusion-Laser Beam\Metals (PBF-LB\M) is a promising additive manufacturing process that can be used to directly produce functional components with a complex shape for a wide variety of applications. However, the layer-by-layer scanning and high cooling rates result in a high thermal gradient and thus, in thermally induced stresses. The stresses developed during the additive process could lead to undesirable cracking and delamination phenomena that can seriously affect the performance of the final component. The alloy composition can exacerbate crack and delamination formation, however, the need to expand the portfolio of high-strength materials processable for PBF-LB\M makes the resolution of these undesirable phenomena a primary challenge in the additive manufacturing field. This works aims to systematically investigate some strategies to make processable non-standard compositions. As no standard compositions, the promising pre-alloyed AlSi10Cu8Mg composition was chosen for the present work. Based on the results obtained from a condition of severe delamination, the synergetic use of appropriate process parameters and support structures can lead to crack-free and fully dense specimens also when platform heating is not allowed. The developed approach could also be applied to adapt other cracking-sensitive alloys for PBF-LB\M production.},

The SPH–FE model could accurately describe the damage morphology and contribution of the ceramics in terms of the energy dissipation. The damage radius of the ceramic layer was effectively constrained by the design of the columnar ceramic. The maximum error of the SPH–FE model was 6.41\%.

Refurbishing the dies by depositing new material instead of replacement is a promising method to reduce the cost. For this reason, a newly developed maraging steel (NMS) was cladded on a hot work tool steel by means of directed energy deposition. After an optimized tempering, exposures at high temperatures were carried out on the cladded NMS in order to examine the softening resistance. The microstructural evolution of the material was systematically characterized using a combination of optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The precipitate in the cladded steel was identified as Laves phase. The coarsening of this phase is considered as the main reason for the thermal softening of the steel at high temperatures. The coarsening behavior was also simulated by using the revised Langer-Schwartz-Wagner (LSW) model, which was in good agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, a mathematical model of precipitate strengthening was successfully applied to evaluate the softening behavior of the steel. This model can be used to predict the hardness/strength evolution of the investigated tool steel during its high-temperature service.},

  abstract     = {Supersaturated (Ti,Al)N materials with face centered cubic (fcc) structure offer unique combinations of thermal stability and mechanical properties. However, their thermally-induced decomposition processes are crucial for extracting their full potential. Detailed experimental studies by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy reveal that the formation of the thermodynamically stable wurtzite-type w-AlN starts with 1000 °C at 100 °C lower annealing temperatures (T a ) when applying a multilayer-concept with TiN to form (Ti,Al)N/TiN multilayers. Nevertheless, the hardness of (Ti,Al)N/TiN multilayers peaks with 32.3 ± 1.0 GPa at a 100 °C higher T a (900 °C) than the (Ti,Al)N coating, and the hardness declining trend with increasing T a is milder. This is because the (Ti,Al)N decomposes towards a layered structure of Al-rich and Ti-rich regions, when coherently grown with fcc-TiN. Ab initio calculations highlight that Al within the (Ti,Al)N layers preferentially diffuses away from the coherent interface with the TiN layers. Thus, out of one (Ti,Al)N layer more layers form, and even upon the phase-transformation of the Al-rich layers to w-AlN, their layered structure remains. Together, the computational and experimental results suggest that the layered arrangement provides a higher resistance against dislocation glide and is beneficial for the coating integrity.},

  abstract     = {To develop alloys with high strength and reasonable ductility, CoCrFeNi-based metastable complex-concentrated alloys were designed using composition–property contour maps. The map was constructed by exploring the phase stability and mechanical behaviors of a series of CoCrFeNi alloy thin films synthesized via solid-state alloying of multilayer thin films. The concentrations of Co and Ni were key to activate metastable deformation behaviors by reducing the stacking fault energy of alloys and improve solid-solution strengthening, as expected from the atomic-level complexity related to the electronegativity difference. By optimizing the Co and Ni concentrations based on the composition-phase/mechanical property contour maps, we activated the combined deformation behavior of mechanical twinning and phase transformation. This resulted in a Co 33 Cr 25 Fe 25 Ni 17 metastable complex-concentrated alloy with excellent tensile properties—yield strength of 234 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 720 MPa, and elongation to failure of 80\%. The proposed approach provides a useful guideline for the design of complex-concentrated alloys with customized properties through property predictive control.},

Results show that precipitation occurs with 1 wt\% Ti addition and above, whose diameter gradually increases as Ti concentration rises. Vickers hardness and tensile strength increase with increasing Ti concentration. Moreover, strengthening mechanisms consisting of solid solution strengthening ( σ SS ), grain boundary strengthening ( σ GB ), and precipitation strengthening ( σ P ) are theoretically estimated. The strength contribution sequence is σ SS &gt; σ GB &gt; σ P . Solid solution strengthening from Ti increases with increasing Ti concentration, and precipitation strengthening is not significantly dependent on Ti concentration. Additionally, 1 wt\% Ti is probably sufficient to scavenge the interstitial impurities and provide comparable precipitation strengthening with V-4Cr-4Ti alloy.},

The effect of the metallization layers by three deposition technologies on the Ag joint structures was systematically investigated during an extreme thermal shock test (TST) ranging from −50 to 250 °C. The mechanical behaviors and interface evolution considerably varied depending on the metallization layer used. Both ENPA and E-ENPA substrates provided a more robust initial shear strength of approximately 60 MPa. More importantly, both metallization layers were productive in restraining interfacial deformation owing to the effect of the thick Ni plating. A better performance was derived from the electroplated Ni in E-ENPA metallization with crack-less and deformation-resistant, because of electroplated Ni possessed a suitable hardness and toughness, thus the optimal stress-relaxation capability. This study provides insights to the properties of Ag-sintered joints on three metallization layers, where the metallization, mainly by electroplating, exhibited superior reliability beyond that of sputtered and electroless depositions in both strength and microstructure maintenance.},

This study investigates the growth mechanism and mechanical properties of CrFeCoNi/TiNbZrTa multilayers grown by magnetron sputtering. Multilayers of bilayer thickness (Λ) from 5 nm to 50 nm were grown on Si(1 0 0) substrates. Images taken by transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping revealed that the layers were well defined with no occurrence of elemental mixing. Multilayers with Λ &lt; 20 nm exhibited an amorphous structure. As Λ increased, the CrFeCoNi layer displayed a higher crystallinity in comparison to the amorphous TiNbZrTa layer. The mechanical properties were influenced by the crystallinity of the layers and stresses in the film. The film with Λ = 20 nm had the highest hardness of approximately 12.5 GPa owing grain refinement of the CrFeCoNi layer. An increase of Λ ≥ 30 nm resulted in a drop in the hardness due to the increase in crystal domains of the CrFeCoNi layer. Micropillar compression induced shear in the material rather than fracture, along with elemental intermixing in the core of the deformed region of the compressed micropillar.},

A four-layer oxide scale was formed on the both sides of grain boundary in the inner layer, and a Cr-depletion and metallic Ni layer were formed at the oxide/matrix interface. The upper part of inner layer had many cavities. Al 2 O 3 protective layer appeared in the inner oxide layer and the corrosion degree of the underlying material was reduced. Grain boundary migration was also induced by the element diffusion. The structure surrounding Y 2 O 3 particles in the inner layer was affected slightly by Y 2 O 3 particles. Y 2 O 3 particles at the oxide/matrix interface could promote the corrosion and caused the sunken corrosion pits because the element could diffuse easily through the interface between Y 2 O 3 particles and the material. However, with the addition of Al, Al could diffuse into the sunken pits and wrapped Y 2 O 3 particles, which inhibited the further development of the sunken pits.},

In this work, the hybrid crystalline-amorphous Co-P coating (Co-9.1 at.\% P) was fabricated and applied on the Cu/Sn interface by controlling the crystallinity through compositional design. Combining the advantages of crystalline and amorphous Co-P, strategies for solder joints with high shear strength, ductile intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and slow interface consumption was proposed. The evolution, microstructure, phase, and mechanical properties of the Co-Sn, Co-Sn-P and P-rich layers in solid-state diffusion were systematically characterized and tested by means of SEM, EPMA, EBSD, TEM, nanoindentation, and shear test. It was found that the hybrid Co-P coating achieved a low consumption rate, 14.2 nm/h, attributing to the partially crystalline structure and the Co-Sn-P exfoliation behavior. In addition, solder joints containing large-thickness ductile Co-Sn IMCs, 3.2–3.6 GPa of hardness, was established. The shear strength after aging reached 75.4 MPa relying on the large thickness of Co-Sn IMCs. Severe mechanical loads would be able to be withstand by virtue of the plastic deformation of ductile IMCs. Hybrid crystalline-amorphous Co-P would be a promising interface material in microelectronic packaging.},

  abstract     = {Corrosion is a common degradation problem in engineering structures. The unified mechanics theory (UMT) was used to develop a model to predict the fatigue life of pre-corroded steel samples with BCC structure. The model was also verified experimentally. For this purpose, A656-grade steel samples were immersed in a 5 wt\% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution at a pH of 7. Electrochemical measurements were made with a potentiostat to monitor corrosion. Then, a series of ultrasonic vibration fatigue tests were conducted on these corroded samples at 20 kHz. UMT is ab-initio unification of the laws of Newton and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Hence no empirical degradation/dissipation function is needed. However, the thermodynamic fundamental equation for metal corrosion and ultrasonic vibration must be analytically derived. The thermodynamic fundamental equation formulates all the entropy generation mechanisms during the corrosion and then during ultrasonic vibrations. The cumulative entropy generation was then used to calculate the Thermodynamic State Index (TSI), which starts at zero and asymptotically approaches one at failure. Hence, TSI predicts the life span. The proposed model results agree well with the experimental results, thus proving that the UMT-based model can predict the high cycle fatigue life of previously corroded samples accurately.},

The effect of strut diameter, strut length, and strut inclination angle on the compressive properties was explored. From the results obtained, the slenderness ratio of struts significantly influenced failure modes of structures and a densification stage occurred only when the slenderness ratio was greater than 0.175. The factors that showed the largest influence on strength and specific strength were strut length and strut inclination angle and the highest strength and specific strength were 8.57 MPa and 53.6 MPa/(g/cm 3 ), respectively. In addition, theoretical analysis and finite-element method simulations are performed to investigate the compression performance of the 3D-printed structures and a post-failure model is proposed.

  abstract     = {We designed a composite filler beginning with becoming light elements to be the main diffusing elements and (ii) controlling the diffusion of the light elements. It was achieved by establishing chemical potential and supercooling gradients and shortening the diffusion distance. As a result, a transient liquid phase bonding (TLP) composite joint with hedgehog-like reinforcements and a ductile matrix was obtained. The room-temperature (RT) shear strength of the joint produced at 460 °C for 30 min was up to 84 MPa, and it had a strength of 30 MPa at 600 °C. The hedgehog-like” reinforcements with finer or longer whiskers can provide a better load transfer effect. The progressive phase formation around NiTi was induced by the large supercooled liquid, wherein either the fastest-solidified region or the deepest-supercooled liquid served as a barrier for metallic atoms. Consequently, the lower supercooling and higher Si chemical potential in the farther region enable Si to directionally diffused towards the NiTi. This study offered a novel filler feasible for most ceramic/metal systems with the goals of low-temperature joining and high-temperature using and controllable product distribution; and this idea can be extended to develop other systems.},

  abstract     = {Solid state phase reactions are complicated and sometimes a black box because of the copious reactants and versatile pathways. In this work, the phase relationship in W-Fe-C ternary system is systematically studied by means of the symmetry principles in crystal chemistry and first-principles thermodynamics. According to group-subgroup relation, ternary carbides Fe x W x C (x = 6, 3, and 2) are likely to form via the intermediate W 2 C and FeW 3 C phases at C-rich condition. At C-poor condition, those ternary carbides are prone to be transformed from Fe 7 W 6 with residual C element in the matrix or C from Fe 3 C in steel. Based on percolation theory, we find the direct phase transition from Fe 6 W 6 C to Fe 3 W 3 C undergoes with transient Fe 2 W 2 C. The calculated Gibbs reaction free energy is in good agreement with various experimental observation and clarifies the discrepancies and controversaries among different experiments in the literature. The success in predicting the phase relationship of W-Fe-C ternary system suggests that the symmetry principles in crystal chemistry combined with first-principles calculations not only unravel the intrinsic mechanism behind the phase reaction, but also should be incorporated into future designs of covalent materials, such as carbides, nitrides, and oxides.},

However experimental trial and error to optimize deposit quality indexes, that rely on powder characteristics, can be costly and tedious. In this research, multiple finite element modelling approaches were compared regarding their capability and shortcomings to analyze the role of major powder features on deposit properties. Lagrangian and CEL methods were selected as the most robust approaches for analyzing the single/multi-particle impact condition, respectively. An intricate algorithm was introduced to accurately evaluate the effect of parameters including particle size, shape, oxidation extent, and impact angle on the deposition indicators such as critical velocity, particle flattening, and deposit porosity. The results exhibited a good agreement with the reported experimental data, confirming the capacity of the proposed numerical framework to tune the deposit properties as a function of a wide range of feedstock characteristics. It was concluded that for successful deposition, the effect of various powder properties and their respective effect and contribution towards plastic deformation should be taken into account. The results indicated that for a given particle velocity, smaller particle, more irregular morphology, thicker oxide layer, and smaller impact angle will result in limited particle deformation and a lower possibility of successful adhesion.},

The as-synthesized silicalite film was first modified by alkaline etching and by subsequent treatments in oxygen radiofrequency ( O 2 RF) plasma , by calcination at 500 °C, and by processing the calcinated samples in the O 2 RF plasma . The chemical composition, crystallinity, topography and wettability of samples were characterized using angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and sessile water drop contact angle measurements. We have discovered the presence of a non-zeolitic defective SiO x phase ( NZP ) with coordinated hydrocarbon chains. The NZP can be removed by the exposition to the O 2 RF plasma. The metabolic activity tests done on human osteoblast line Saos-2 revealed that the NZP can influence cell proliferation; however, all studied modifications of silicalite film can be considered biocompatible. The osteogenic differentiation was studied on human mesenchymal stem cells under static conditions and under dynamic (pulsatile and shear) stress. The results obtained by the real-time qPCR and immunofluorescence microscopy suggest that etched , plasma-treated and calcinated + plasma-treated samples are the most promising for osteogenic cell differentiation.},

Separate Al and C additions and the resulting precipitation of hard phases are commonly used to strengthen CoCrFeMnNi-type alloys. However, the combined alloying effect and especially the high hardening potential of C in solid solution of mpea s are rarely investigated, but the few existing investigations reveal a high potential. Therefore, the properties of the Al 0−22.1 C 0−2.3 (CoFeMnNi) 100−75.6 (at.\%) system were comprehensively investigated, where Cr was intentionally removed to keep C in solid solution. For theoretical and experimental screening of the system, a custom calphad database was extended, samples were manufactured by additive manufacturing ( am ) and annealed between temperatures of 1150 and 550 °C. Detailed microstructural and mechanical analysis on 40 different revealed the properties of the equiatomic CoFeMnNi alloy and the effect of the separate and combined additions of Al and C, including comprehensive precipitate characterization. The system was especially potent in its room temperature tensile properties in the Al- and C-added fcc -based region, where it caused the activation of twinning-induced plasticity ( twip ) and combined high strength and ductility increases.},

This interval cannot be fully treated using a quasistatic-based electromechanical machine nor a high-speed test relying on the Kolsky bar method. This paper presents a uniaxial compression test set-up to cover the aforementioned range providing robust stress–strain measurements up to 100 s −1 . This set-up is assessed at room temperature with a semi-crystalline polymer (SCP) polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) KT880-NT and a toughened thermoset epoxy PR520. High-speed 3D stereo digital image correlation (DIC) and an infra-red camera are used for data acquisition. The macroscopical true stress–strain curves demonstrate the importance of the thermal softening effect taking place in this range, accompanied with a temperature rise. In terms of characterization, an advanced unified SCP (USCP) model is employed to quantify the rate- and temperature-dependence for both polymers. A straightforward FEM-based parameter identification procedure is proposed requiring only two compressive stress–strain curves. The USCP model is further applied to PEEK 450G from literature to highlight the features of SCPs. The comparison of PEEK and PR520 is discussed pointing out the characterization challenges due to the transitional quasistatic-to-dynamic testing regime.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, two magnolol based main chain benzoxazine polymers (MCBPs) are designed, synthesized and formulated into thiol-ene resins to develop high-performance polymer dielectrics. Initially, the thiol-ene thermoset films, Mag-M-4SH-80 and Mag-E-4SH-80, are obtained respectively using click chemistry. Being post cured via progressive temperature stage, Mag-M/E-4SH-80 performs complete ring opening polymerization and forms dual-cure polybenzoxazine (PBZ) products with excellent thermal and mechanical performances such as a high T g of 236 °C and a flexure modulus of 2.5 GPa. Moreover, the thiol component of the resin introduces numerous dipoles to the resultant polymer networks, resulting in promising dielectric performances of the resin at both room temperature and elevated temperature. For instance, the Mag-M-4SH-80 film demonstrates a superior energy density ( U e ) of 7.0 J/cm 3 @25 °C, which is among the top reported dielectric thermosets having same efficiency, and Mag-M-4SH-150 film reveals a U e of 1.1 J/cm 3 @150 °C, significantly higher than the reported values of a great number of commercial heat resistant polymers. Herein, our findings not only expand the library of high-performance thiol-ene benzoxazine resins but also present their potentials as flexible dielectrics for energy storage for the first time, thus advance the functionality and capability of benzoxazine based materials in modern electronics.},

  abstract     = {We developed and applied a model-driven feedforward control approach to mitigate thermal-induced flaw formation in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process. The key idea was to avert heat buildup in a LPBF part before it is printed by adapting process parameters layer-by-layer based on insights from a physics-based thermal simulation model. The motivation being to replace cumbersome empirical build-and-test parameter optimization with a physics-guided strategy. The approach consisted of three steps: prediction, analysis, and correction. First, the temperature distribution of a part was predicted rapidly using a graph theory-based computational thermal model. Second, the model-derived thermal trends were analyzed to isolate layers of potential heat buildup. Third, heat buildup in affected layers was corrected before printing by adjusting process parameters optimized through iterative simulations. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated experimentally on two separate build plates. In the first build plate, termed fixed processing , ten different nickel alloy 718 parts were produced under constant processing conditions. On a second identical build plate, called controlled processing, the laser power and dwell time for each part was adjusted before printing based on thermal simulations to avoid heat buildup. To validate the thermal model predictions, the surface temperature of each part was tracked with a calibrated infrared thermal camera. Post-process the parts were examined with non-destructive and destructive materials characterization techniques. Compared to fixed processing, parts produced under controlled processing showed superior geometric accuracy and resolution, finer grain size, increased microhardness, and reduced surface roughness.},

Cyclic point bending tests were performed on three types of CFRPs. The damage severity identification and localization were classified and investigated using four different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Electrical resistance images were used to train each CNN architecture for damage analysis. An optimized CNN architecture for the damage analysis of CFRPs using electrical resistance data was proposed and compared with traditional damage analysis CNN architectures. The applicability of the proposed SHM methodology was verified by analyzing unseen damage in the CFRPs. This study addresses the limitations of previous self-sensing methods by reducing the number of electrodes, which reduces data complexity and increases the sensible area of CFRPs. Thus, this study successfully designed an efficient SHM methodology with a high accuracy of over 90\% for analyzing CFRP damage, including the severity and location, regardless of the type of carbon fiber and stacking sequence of composite structures that showed high applicability.},

This paper compares the mechanical properties of the stainless steel 420 (SS420) parts produced by the several variations of this new protocol against commercially available cold rolled SS420 parts with and without the heat-treatment under the similar sintering condition used in the new protocol. The mechanical properties examined include elastic modulus and both static and fatigue strengths. The only minor drawback of the new protocol is the dimensional shrinkage occurring during sintering. However, this can be easily compensated by printing the part geometry about 15\% larger in the linear dimension with the starting powder used in this study. The final results showed the excellent static and fatigue strengths of the SS420 specimens produced with the new BJP protocol, implicating the potential structural applications of the BJP parts.},

In this study, peritectic solidification was introduced to HEAs by designing novel W x NbTiZr peritectic high-entropy alloys (PHEAs). The phase constitutions and solidification microstructure evolutions of W x NbTiZr were clarified by combining experiments and thermodynamic simulations. Grain refinements were achieved in W x NbTiZr, which should attribute to the high growth restriction factors introduced by W solute and the segmentations of the primary phase during peritectic transformation. The significantly refined grains can simultaneously enhance the strength and ductility of the alloy.

  abstract     = {The morphology and crystal structure of borides in Ti-45Al-2Mn-2Nb- x B (at.\%) alloys containing different amount of B have been investigated to reveal the relationship between B content and boride formation. In alloys containing 0.25 at.\% and 0.5 at.\% B, boride particles are curved and flake-like, and are distributed at β dendrite boundaries, resulting from late nucleation and constrained by matrix during growth. Curved, ribbon-like boride particles are observed to randomly distribute in alloy containing 0.75 at.\% B, and insufficient behind-time supply of B atoms to the growth front is believed to be responsible for their irregularity and large curvature bending and branching. In alloys containing 1.0 at.\% or higher B, straight needle/rod-like boride particles dominate, and a small number of blocky particles appear in alloys containing 1.25 at.\% and 1.5 at.\% B. Most boride particles are of C32-TiB 2 and have their major axes along [0001] or [ 1 2 ¯ 10 12¯10 ] in all alloys studied in this work, and B f -TiB and D7 b -Ti 3 B 4 randomly appear in conjunction with C32-TiB 2 to form intergrowths, while B27-TiB particles are free standing and only appear in alloys containing 1 at.\% or higher B.},

The ventilation enables cross flow of powder within the lattice structure, resulting in easy and complete removal of entrapped powder. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to understand the flow paths in various surface based lattice structures. An experimental setup was also designed to calculate the powder flowability from these lattices. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method and compression tests of various lattice structures were done to benchmark the strength of newly designed lattice structure.

This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of using hydroxyapatite (HAp) granules derived from planktonic exoskeleton bone in the ocean (OceanBone-HAp) as a bone graft substitute. The morphology and physiochemical properties of the OceanBone-HAp were evaluated using SEM, XRD and FT-IR. In addition, the absence of heavy metals and abundance of trace elements in OceanBone-HAp was confirmed using ICP-OES analysis. Moreover, in vitro results showed that OceanBone-HAp improved cell proliferation, adhesion, differentiation, and infiltration, compared to stoichiometric synthetic HAp granules (pure HAp). Additionally, OceanBone-HAp improved the expression of osteogenic related markers, by upregulation of ALP, collagen type-1αI(Col1αI), osteocalcin (OCN), and bone sialoprotein (BSP), which was confirmed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, in vivo bone regeneration was also evaluated using a rabbit calvarial defect model, and the results showed that the area of mature bone formation was significantly higher for OceanBone-HAp than pure HAp. These results demonstrated that OceanBone-HAp granules have good potential for use in bone healing as a bone graft material.},

In order to improve the overall strength of the artificial structure, inspired by the layered structure of nacre, a nacre-like steel-polyurea composite plate was designed as a new impact-resistant structure. On this basis, the damage deformation of three different layered steel-polyurea composite plates with nacre-like structure under different projectile velocities was simulated. The damage failure morphology of nacre-like composite plates with different layered numbers was analyzed, and consequently, five failure toughening mechanisms of nacre-like composite plates were summarized. Then, the fitted ballistic performance curves were used to compare the ballistic performance of nacre-like composite plates with different delamination, and it was found that the composite plates could reduce the residual ballistic velocity by 24.58\% and increase the ballistic limit by 27.86\%, and the energy dissipation mechanism of the composite plates was explained by the energy release of steel and polyurea layers. Finally, the theoretical analysis reveals that the increase in the delamination number can effectively increase the equivalent modulus of the nacre-like composite plate, thus enhancing the penetration resistance of the composite plate.},

This work proposes a method for designing triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice structures that achieves precise and large-scale control of their mechanical properties by varying their frequency, and unifies the design of solid and shell structures based on the double surface creation strategy. To verify the proposed method, a series of lattice structures with different frequencies in the bearing direction ( ɷ z ) and offset values were designed and fabricated, and the effects of ɷ z on the failure mode, mechanical properties, and energy absorption capacity of the structures were studied. The results show that, by varying ɷ z , the performance and failure mode of the structures can be adjusted, and a rapid design of structures with a wide range of mechanical properties can be realized, reaching elastic moduli of 546.15–4264.56 MPa, and compressive strengths of 42.75–143.23 MPa. As a result, the proposed design method can be considered a reference for designing lattice structures with a wide range of control under various requirements, which provides new ideas in the research on TPMS lattice structures.},

However, little is known about the deformation behavior and mechanisms of composite solder joints. In this study, sandwich joints are prepared using graphene nanosheets-reinforced Sn-Ag-Cu composite solder (GNSs/SAC) by transient current bonding technology in order to obtain dispersed graphene. Interrupted shear tests combined with orientation image microscopy are conducted at different strain to observe the morphology and crystal orientation evolution of solder joints in situ. Some twins rotate, and the orientation begins to spread during shear, while the orientation of large Sn grain shows a minimal change. Cracks tend to initiate and propagate along the boundary. The failure mechanisms of the solder joint is determined. Molecular dynamics results show that the strain concentration at the boundary. Continuous shear tests show that the shear strength was improved by approximately 50.7\% with the addition of 0.1 wt\% graphene. Based on microstructure analysis and calculation, load transfer is identified as the dominant strengthening mechanism for GNSs/SAC alloys, followed by Orowan system. Graphene does not refine the grain size of solder joints, and dislocation multiplication from thermal mismatch does not strengthen them.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant brain tumor. It expresses high levels of heat shock protein (HSP60), which is associated with poor prognosis. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) can be improved by photothermal therapy (PTT) and facilitate tumor eradication. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel agents that synergize with the tumor killing effects of PTT/CDT by downregulating HSP60. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases and clinical cases, this study determined that HSP60 was upregulated and associated with reduced overall survival (OS) in GBM patients. Herein, TA-VO x nanobranches (TA-VO x NBs) were successfully synthesized by a one-step self-assembly procedure, which had excellent photothermal conversion characteristics and improved peroxidase-mimicking activity at elevated temperatures. Moreover, TA-VO x NBs can degrade to VO 2+ in a slightly acidic tumor microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that TA-VO x NBs synergized with PTT/CDT and improved glioma eradication under 808 nm irradiation due to the heat-induced ROS generation and the inhibition of HSP60. Furthermore, TA-VO x NBs were rapidly cleared by the kidney and showed good biosafety. Combined with the ease of fabrication, this is a promising nanomaterial that can be introduced for clinical translation in cancer therapy.},

In this work, we engineered a methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)- block -poly( l -alanine) (mPEG − PLAla)-based thermo-sensitive hydrogel by ring-opening polymerization as a vehicle for locally sequential delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and palbociclib (PAL) to induce the antitumor immunity in osteosarcoma.

Meanwhile, the superior rheological properties, the uniform morphology and the suitable biodegradability were also investigated in the hydrogel. Interestingly, codelivery of gel and DOX + PAL displayed sequential drug release behavior and exhibited improved antitumor effect toward the K7 orthotopic osteosarcoma mouse model. The DOX-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) and PAL-mediated suppression of regulatory T cells jointly facilitate antitumor immunity in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, the dual drug codelivery hydrogel showed reduced lung metastasis and enhanced biosafety than free drugs in mouse models of osteosarcoma. Therefore, the locally sequential drug delivery system to induce antitumor immunity will have great potential in future tumor therapy.},

The disadvantages of traditional treatment of psoriasis are poor efficacy, recurrence of the condition, long treatment time, and systemic side effects due to a lack of an appropriate drug delivery system. A liposome-in-Microneedles (MNs) based transdermal drug delivery system had been developed to provide efficient site-specific drug delivery, stable drug release and enhanced permeability. Firstly, liposomes were loaded with Ginsenoside Rg3 (a small molecular compound with anti-inflammatory and immune regulation functions), then Rg3-liposomes (Rg3-Lipo) were successfully loaded into MNs. Rg3-Liposome-MNs (Rg3-MNs) with the mechanical property of 0.59 N/needle, could easily penetrate the epidermis and release Rg3-lipo to regulate the immune response. The efficacy of Rg3-MNs was evaluated by IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis in mice. Rg3-MNs significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased the epidermal thickness, dermal papillary edema, and the possible mechanism was to markedly reduce (p &lt; 0.01) the levels of IL-17, IL-23, and TNF-α. In addition, we found that Rg3-MNs might improve psoriasis by inhibiting the activation of the STAT3/p-STAT3 signaling pathway.

This composite gel material is porous and consists of a sericin protein network, agarose molecular network, and sericin-agarose crossing (by hydrogen bond linkage) network; a complex structure that improved the stability and mechanical performance of the final material by approximately 2-fold. Moreover, the composite material showed to efficiently and gradually release the active cytokines FGF-1 and FGF-2 for up to 3 weeks, thereby promoting significant fibroblast proliferation by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Notably, this composite gel caused no obvious cytotoxicity or severe inflammation responses in vitro nor in vivo .

The tribological properties and vibration behaviors of TPU composites were synthetically analyzed to reveal the effects of T-ZnOw and MoS 2 on the friction excitation force and vibration reduction properties. The results showed that T-ZnOw enhanced anti-deformation property, and MoS 2 weakened the friction excitation force in the friction process, which resulted in a lower coefficient of friction (COF) with a small amplitude, and eliminated the high-frequency vibration amplitude. In addition, the particle composition of 6\% T-ZnOw and 9\% MoS 2 was controlled to obtain a low COF and the best vibration reduction properties. The knowledge obtained herein contributes to the understanding of the synergistic effects of T-ZnOw and MoS 2 on COF and vibration reduction behaviors, and the development of a water-lubricated TPU composite stern tube bearing with low COF and good vibration reduction properties.},

  abstract     = {Iron-nitrogen-carbon catalysts are promising non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) used in fuel cells. However, the rational design and fabrication of iron–nitrogen-carbon catalysts with tunable ORR activity remain challenging. Herein, iron–nitrogen-enriched carbon materials (FeNCs) were produced using the precursor of pyridyl conjugated microporous polytriphenylamine with the impregnation of FeCl 3 via two cycles of high-temperature pyrolysis with acid leaching in-between. The Fe doping content and pyrolysis temperature were varied to manipulate the state of active sites, the degree of graphitization and electrocatalytic performance. The optimized FeNCs exhibit enhanced stability, methanol tolerance and superior ORR activity in alkaline media with a higher onset potential (0.990 V vs RHE), half-wave potential (0.878 V vs RHE) and diffusion current density J L (5.95 mA cm −2 ) compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.974 V, 0.860 V, 5.10 mA cm −2 ). The excellent electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the co-existing highly active sites of Fe 4 N and Fe 3 C, the hierarchical porous structures for full action of active sites and a high surface area (1397 m 2 g −1 ) with defect engineered graphitic and amorphous carbon for efficient electron conduction of ORR. Accordingly, the high-performance FeNCs can become an alternative low-cost catalyst to precious Pt/C catalyst for fuel cells.},

  abstract     = {In the microstructure characterization of metallic materials, the intercept method is one of the most widely accepted approaches to determine average grain size due to its simplicity, accuracy, and the ability to handle both equiaxed and non-equiaxed grain structures . However, its manual implementation is relatively time-consuming and error-prone, and the design of automated implementations is challenging due to the requirement of recognizing, classifying, and scoring different types of intersections (between test patterns and grain boundaries) by international standards such as ASTM E112 and EN ISO 643. In this research, a novel algorithm is proposed to automate the intercept method for grain size measurement from microscopic images. Building on topological skeletons, the algorithm is able to extract continuous and closed grain boundaries from the raw image, and determine the average grain size by recognizing and classifying different types of intersections in accordance with international standards. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated on metallographic microscope images from both high-purity iron and stainless steel. Additionally, our algorithm has been extended to automate other standard grain size measurement methods such as the planimetric method and the whole grain area method.},

  abstract     = {Imine compounds have been proved to possess great potential in the design and preparation of sustainable epoxy thermosets. However, it is still a great challenge to develop imine-containing hardener with definite structure due to the randomness of condensation reaction between aldehydes and primary amines. Herein, a novel amine hardener containing imine bond is synthesized successfully by selecting 4-imidazole formaldehyde and 3-aminobenzylamine as raw materials. The asymmetric structure of raw material can avoid uncontrollable reaction and ensure that this hardener possesses definite chemical structure. Due to high activity of hardener, the resultant epoxy thermosets with high cross-linked density exhibit excellent thermostability and fine hydrothermal aging resistance. Furthermore, such thermosets show good mechanical properties (tensile strength of ∼76 MPa), which are comparable to that of commercial Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A epoxy resin cured by 4,4-Diaminodiphenyl methane. More interestingly, increasing the equivalent ratio of active hydrogen to epoxy can introduce more dynamic covalent C=N linkage into the cross-linked network, thus the epoxy thermoset further achieves the decomposition within 3 h and the corresponding composite laminates also are recycled efficiently under mild condition. This work demonstrates the feasibility and potential of preparing high-performance degradable epoxy thermoset and corresponding recyclable composites based on well-designed imine-containing hardener.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the influence of selected alloying variations on Zn-assisted liquid metal embrittlement (LME) susceptibility of Zn-coated advanced high strength steels (AHSS) is investigated. Cold-rolled AHSS alloys of different carbon (C), manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), and aluminum (Al) concentrations were continuous-annealed to generate a third generation AHSS microstructure (composed of martensite and retained austenite) via quenching and partitioning. High temperature tension tests using simulated spot-weld thermomechanical cycles revealed no significant influence of C and Mn variations on the Zn-LME susceptibility of AHSS. On the other hand, Zn-LME susceptibility was strongly correlated with the Si content of AHSS. A direct comparison of the (reacted) coating microstructures of the Si-alloyed and Low-Si AHSS variants revealed that Si in the AHSS substrate suppresses Fe–Zn alloying reactions and retards the nucleation and growth of Fe-Zn intermetallic phases at the coating-substrate interface in these spot weld simulations. The suppressed intermetallic formation at elevated Si concentrations is consistent with phase equilibria considerations in the Fe-Zn-Si ternary system. In the context of Zn-assisted LME, therefore, Si is hypothesized to aggravate LME behavior by increasing the liquid Zn availability for embrittlement and promoting direct contact between liquid Zn and the AHSS steel substrate.},

For this study, wires were produced with different diameters of up to 0.2 mm via direct one-step extrusion as a hot forming route and were directly compared to conventional cold drawing manufacturing routes with diameters up to 0.3 mm and associated heat-treatment. The alloy dependent microstructure development is resolved with respect to the underlying recrystallization mechanisms, which determines the texture development and concurrently the strength and ductility properties of the wires. The experimental results clearly show that the manufacturing process, the degree of deformation (wire diameter) as well as the alloy itself have a major impact on the texture development and mechanical properties of the wires. While AZ31, does not enable a strong impact on the microstructure development, ductility in ZX10 is enhanced with a concurrent weak texture development due to adjusted dynamic recrystallization during hot forming. In contrast, such microstructures cannot be adjusted in the cold forming routes due to static recrystallization. However, it is possible to improve of the properties significantly by drawing, which is limited by the first two drawing passes.},

The angle-dependency for the geometric defect distribution characteristics is verified through X-ray tomography. The mathematical relationship between the parent material’s properties and the build angle is established. A numerical model is developed for predicting the mechanical performance of laser powder bed fusion fabricated lattice structures proposed by using the experimental results. The positioning geometric defects are introduced into this model to achieve higher predicting accuracy.

Based on the metasurfaces with multiple degrees of freedom, multiplexing meta-holograms are experiencing the research upsurge because of enormous application potential. However, existing multiplexing meta-holograms cannot tailor the amplitude information, and possess limited imaging channels and high channel crosstalk, which hinder the improvement of information capacity and imaging quality of multiplexing meta-holograms. Herein, an innovative multiplexing meta-hologram based on the helicity-assisted meta-atoms is proposed, which can perfectly reconstruct four independent images by altering the working frequency, polarization state and propagation direction of incident waves, and theoretically realize the holography in sixteen different channels by easily rotating, mirroring, and arranging the structures of meta-atoms. Numerous simulations and experiments collectively corroborate the feasibility of our methodology, and the quantitative analyses verify the high fidelity of the reconstructed images, which results from the low crosstalk between the amplitude modulation and phase modulation in different imaging channels. This inspiring strategy of multiplexing meta-hologram with large channel capacity and high imaging quality will have promising application prospects in information display, storage and encryption, and provide an alternative path for the design of multifunctional microwave devices.},

In this work, we demonstrate a Helmholtz-resonator based acoustic metagrating for high efficient beam wavefront steering in transmissive configuration. The complex meta-unit of the metagrating made of three Helmholtz-resonators combines traditional diffraction and interference theory with the free phase modulation ability of local resonant periodic structure to coherently control the acoustic wavefront steering. We show numerically and experimentally the anomalous refraction can be acquired with the designed metagrating of subwavelength thickness. By properly designing the geometric parameters of the meta-unit, the −1st order diffraction can be retained, and the unexpected diffraction orders are eliminated through destructive interference for a high efficient anomalous refraction. The anomalous refraction performance of the proposed metagrating is achieved over a wide incident range. The reported structure is promising for high efficient and wide angle complex wavefront engineering in e.g. encryption or communications.},

Using criteria driven by the requirements of specific space-based mechanisms, BMG alloys were selected from the literature for processing and performance evaluation. Alloys particularly suited for gearing applications and flexure-based compliant mechanisms were identified and standard test specimens produced. Four Zr-based BMG alloys were selected for analysis: Zr 53 Al 16 Co 23.25 Ag 7.75 , Cu 47 Zr 46 Al 5 Y 2 , Zr 49 Ti 1.96 Cu 37.24 Al 9.8 Y 2 , and Zr 60 Ti 2 Nb 2 Al 7.5 Ni 10 Cu 18.5 , with compositions in at.\%.

The designed surface profiles were fabricated using femtosecond laser treatments, and the adhesion strength between copper and the EMC was evaluated. The results show that deep microgrooves improved the adhesion strength owing to the anchor effect. However, the aspect ratio between the pitch and depth of the microgroove had a limitation in enhancing the adhesion strength. The formation of LIPSSs on the mountaintop of the microgroove was very effective; however, an LIPSS on the valley of the microgroove was ineffective. Numerical analyses revealed that LIPSSs suppressed the shear deformation of the EMC and worked as resistance to interface delamination. Based on the findings obtained in this study, combining micro- and nano-scale surface structure formation with femtosecond laser treatments is an effective and eco-friendly method for improving adhesion strength.},

Results reveal that reducing average size of the waste coffee grounds from 46 µm to 16 µm, using freeze-milling or filtering, can reduce peak heat release rate and total heat release of their epoxy composites by 52.0\% and 33.7\% respectively, exceeding the effectiveness of other bio-based flame retardants such as chitosan, lignin and seashell. More importantly, the fine coffee grounds can achieve the same performance as aluminium trihydrates, the most widely used non-bio flame retardant. Furthermore, the burning rates and emissions of toxic gas have also been greatly reduced, almost entirely suppressing the highly toxic NO 2 gas.

The conditions required for producing uniform and compact layers of Nb 2 O 5 from powder material have been studied and optimized . It has been established that ultrafast-laser irradiation, performed in air at room temperature, leads to the formation of dense Nb 2 O 5 layers with the high temperature monoclinic crystal structure (H-Nb 2 O 5 ) but oxygen deficient. The layers show a preferential crystal orientation with the short axis of the monoclinic structure lying in the structure plane. This preferential orientation can be controlled by the laser irradiation conditions. Anisotropic resistivity has been observed as a consequence of the induced microstructure, while the overall material resistivity is decreased by more than eight orders of magnitude due to the oxygen deficiency. These results indicate that it is feasible to use ultrafast laser processing to promote high-temperature non-stoichiometric niobium oxide phases in a few seconds and with low energy consumption. The highly improved electrical properties of the laser irradiated Nb 2 O 5 layers are extremely interesting for different electronic and sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {High-melt-strength (HMS) polypropylene (PP) has enabled easy supercritical-CO 2 (scCO 2 ) foaming of PP. However, producing microcellular PP foams via simple scCO 2 extrusion foaming still remains challenging, whereas macrocellular PP foams with high expansion ratios (ER) generally exhibit poor mechanical strengths. In this study, to simultaneously enhance both ER and compressive strengths of macrocellular PP foams, a type of low-cost Janus molecules, heptaisobutyl open-cage silsesquioxane (HOS), is incorporated into HMS-PP. Since HOS has PP-philic groups and a partially condensed silsesquioxane cage that is relatively CO 2 -philic, it could diffuse like a surfactant to the PP-CO 2 interface during scCO 2 extrusion foaming to stabilise the cells in their growth stage and reinforce the cell surface upon solidification. The surfactant effect is validated via X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Moreover, with 1 wt\% HOS, the PP/HOS foam could offer 38\% ER improvement, 23\% density reduction, and 20\% compressive strength increase over the neat PP foam. HOS could also slightly improve the extensional viscosity and melt strength of PP at ≤1 wt\% loadings and reduce the shear viscosity of PP by acting as a lubricant. This approach provides a simple and economically viable materials design guideline for alleviating ER-compression strength trade-offs for macrocellular polymer foams.},

  abstract     = {Porous ceramics are favored in a multitude of applications, such as filters, catalyst supports, and tissue engineering scaffolds. However, conventional fabrication techniques find it particularly challenging to preserve sufficient mechanical strength in highly porous ceramics. Although unidirectional freeze casting can fabricate porous ceramics with high strength vertically, the strength in other directions is inadequate due to a lack of lateral structural control. Herein, inspired by the cancellous bone, we propose a novel multi-directional freeze casting technique to prepare highly mechanically efficient porous ceramics. A multi-directional temperature field is ingeniously designed to mimic the stress-responsive growth pattern of the cancellous bone. To further the lateral structural control, ceramic fibers are incorporated to form mineral bridging. In this process, alumina-mullite composite ceramics are prepared with hierarchical structures, including micro-level multi-oriented struts, sub-micro-level interlamellar bridges and nano-level eutectic phases. They endow the ceramics with high porosity (∼75\%) and high strength in all 3D spatial directions (8.4–20.1 MPa), while effectively preventing the catastrophic brittle failure. Therefore, the mechanically enhanced porous ceramics demonstrate the remarkable controllability of multi-directional freeze casting in hierarchical structures. Also, our work opens up a new horizon for fabricating highly mechanically efficient porous materials, including hierarchically structured biomimetic ceramics.},

However, there is no consensus on the mechanism of lamellar formation. Here, we propose a new mechanism that is dominated by spinodal decomposition, in which compositional transformation occurs prior to structural transformation during lamellar formation.

This study for the first time develops a machine learning-assisted model, which aims at predicting the transverse mechanical properties of unidirectional (UD) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with microvoids. To this end, the stochastic microstructures are generated by random sequential expansion (RSE) and hard-core model. And the transverse elastic modulus, transverse tensile strength and transverse compressive strength are computed by micromechanics-based finite element (FE) method. Then, the reduced order representation of microstructures is determined using 2-point spatial correlations and principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimized back propagation (BP) neural network is implemented to capture the potential nonlinear relationship between microstructure and transverse mechanical properties. The presented data-driven techniques can reproduce the FE simulation results with an R-value of 0.89 or greater. The excellent agreement between the predicted results and test datasets verifies the successful application of data science methodologies in elucidating the microstructure-property linkages of UD-CFRP composites with microvoids, and thus provides a promising tool for accelerating the smart design and optimization of composites.},

To address these challenges, the solder evolution at the microscale and the corresponding mechanism should be addressed. In this study, by considering the anisotropy of β -Sn in the electrical, thermal, mechanical and diffusional characteristics, the current-induced solder evolution of a typical solder bump was comprehensively explored over time. The results confirmed that the anisotropy of β -Sn aggravated the nonuniform distribution of current-induced stresses, further causing multiple migration modes coupled in the solder bump. The spatial inconsistency between the distribution of β -Sn unit cells and the bump geometry led to accumulation of torsion forces, which became the direct reason for solder rigid rotation. The electron-dislocation interaction promoted dislocation slip, leading to lattice rotation and homogenization of intragranular deformation. In addition, current-induced grain merging via detwinning was observed, and its velocity was faster than imagined. Our study is conducive to thoroughly understanding anisotropic evolution and establishing accurate damage mechanisms for micro solder bump design under current stressing.},

However, the inferior bond strength between waste plastic aggregates and cement matrix greatly limits the uses of waste plastics for engineering designs and applications. Herein, ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) and nanosilica (nS) were jointly employed to enhance the matrix-aggregate interactions in cementitious composites with recycled waste plastics (RWPs). Waterproof properties of the cementitious composites with EVA and nS hybrids were measured. A non-destructive test using micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (µ-XCT) with contrast enhancing technique followed by microstructural tests (SEM/BSE and EDS) were conducted to in-situ trace liquid migration in the composite specimens. The single addition of EVA into the cementitious composites increased the porosity and depressed the compressive strength, but greatly decreased the water sorptivity by nearly 50\%. The organic–inorganic (EVA-nS) hybrids enhanced the recycling potential of the waste plastics in terms of the mitigated strength reduction and improved waterproofing performance. The coupled polymerization of EVA and nanofilling of nS effects were resolved to account for the recyclability improvement. The findings would shed light on design and fabrication of cementitious materials towards large scale recycling methods and technologies of waste plastics.},

In all Al-Mg alloys, the impact toughness is improved at higher temperatures. The Al-6 Mg alloy exhibits the largest impact toughness, whereas the lowest impact toughness is observed in AA5083 over the temperature range. Beyond the Mg content of 6 wt\%, the impact toughness of Al-Mg alloys decreases with increasing Mg. The planar anisotropy (Δr) is low in Al-Mg alloys of higher impact toughness. The largest amounts of coarse inclusions (&gt;10 µm) are present in the AA5083, providing favorable cracking sites and thereby its poor impact toughness. The grain size and intergranular Mg segregation do not appear to influence the toughness of Al-Mg alloys. Weaker texture in the most ductile Al-6 Mg appears beneficial to gain more homogeneous deformation and lower Δr.

Herein, a strategy to widen the complexity space of 3D shapes and functions achievable is demonstrated, by enabling a controlled sequential folding while incorporating nano-reinforcements. Sequential folding was successfully achieved and a honeycomb structure was developed by designing multilayer polymer films with different kirigami patterns - each responding at a different rate upon heating. A finite element method (FEM) model was developed to better understand the main underlying physical mechanism as well as to feedback into materials and structure design. Moreover, a shape-programmed CNT veil-based honeycomb structure was developed, triggered remotely by thermal stimuli, with capability to self-sense the folding state through the electrical resistance change (ΔR/R 0 = 100–300\%). Overall, it was demonstrated that designing layered nanocomposites with different 2D patterns allows an accurate sequential folding into 3D structures, with bespoke physical properties and integrated sensing–actuating functionalities.},

  abstract     = {The stiffness of extracellular matrix is dynamically stiffened during bone formation. Paracrine of angiogenic factors in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) plays an essential role during tissue regeneration. Whether the paracrine of angiogenic factors in MSCs is influenced by the mechanical microenvironment of materials, especially dynamic matrix mechanics of materials largely remains unknown. A matrix dynamic stiffening material previous designed was used here to explore whether matrix dynamic stiffening could influence paracrine of angiogenic factors in MSCs. The cytoskeleton polymerization, chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation in MSCs were analyzed using phalloidin staining, chromatin condensation parameter analysis and immunofluorescent staining. The results found that the paracrine of MSCs cultured on dynamic stiffening material was higher than that on static stiffness materials. The cytoskeletal polymerization and nuclear deformation degrees of MSCs seeded on dynamic stiffening material were significantly higher than those seeded on materials with static stiffness. The dynamic stiffening substrate could promote the cytoskeletal polymerization to increase the nuclear deformation of MSCs and further induce the paracrine of MSCs. These findings will help to provide clinical guidelines for designing vascularized bone repair materials with appropriate mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {Although titanium nitride (TiN) is among the most extensively studied and thoroughly characterized thin-film ceramic materials, detailed knowledge of relevant dislocation core structures is lacking. By high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of epitaxial single crystal (001)-oriented TiN films, we identify different dislocation types and their core structures. These include, besides the expected primary a/2{110} 〈 1 1 – 0 〉 〈11–0〉 dislocation, Shockley partial dislocations a/6{111} 〈 11 2 – 〉 〈112–〉 and sessile Lomer edge dislocations a/2{100}〈011〉. Density-functional theory and classical interatomic potential simulations complement STEM observations by recovering the atomic structure of the different dislocation types, estimating Peierls stresses, and providing insights on the chemical bonding nature at the core. The generated models of the dislocation cores suggest locally enhanced metal–metal bonding, weakened Ti-N bonds, and N vacancy-pinning that effectively reduces the mobilities of {110} 〈 1 1 – 0 〉 〈11–0〉 and {111} 〈 11 2 – 〉 〈112–〉 dislocations. Our findings underscore that the presence of different dislocation types and their effects on chemical bonding should be considered in the design and interpretations of nanoscale and macroscopic properties of TiN.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloy (HEA) FeCoNiAlTi (FCNAT) systems have been demonstrated to provide high strength while sustaining good ductility, which is of particular interest for the fabrication of structural components with complex geometries. Meanwhile, selective laser melting (SLM) technology that fabricated metallic material using layer-by-layer melting strategy can meet this demand. However, SLM fabrication technology has not yet been applied in conjunction with FCNAT-HEA systems, and the optimal SLM processing parameters and the microstructural characteristics of the resulting components remain unknown. The present study addresses this issue by fabricating highly dense (&gt;99.9\%) cubic (FeCoNi) 85.84 Al 7.09 Ti 7.07 FCNAT-HEA samples. The results demonstrate that the as-fabricated FCNAT-HEA samples possess highly non-equilibrium microstructures that form under the rapid heating and cooling cycles of the SLM process, and include typical overlapping between semi-elliptical melt pools, widely varying grain morphologies with coarse columnar grains and typical equiaxed grains with 〈0 0 1〉 growth orientation, dislocation network structures with elemental Ti and Al segregation, high-density L2 1 -phase precipitates with sizes on the order of 200–300 nm, and near-spherical nano-sized Al-oxide particles. This research confirms the feasibility of fabricating FCNAT-HEA components by SLM, and therefore provides guidance for fabricating such HEA components with complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the viability of fabricating Ti-3Al-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr (Beta-C TM ) using laser-based and powder-fed directed energy deposition. To determine an appropriate ageing strategy, heat treatments were conducted at 440 °C and 480 °C over different periods of time and their effectiveness were determined through hardness testing. After identifying an optimal ageing treatment, tensile properties were investigated on the samples in the as-built and aged conditions. The microstructure, hardness and tensile properties of the as-built sample was found to resemble that of a conventionally-manufactured and solution-treated alloy. However, as compared to conventionally-manufactured Ti-3Al-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr subjected to the same ageing temperature, the ageing process was much quicker with the DED-processed alloy because of its high dislocation density. Furthermore, the latter can also achieve much higher strength while also having comparable ductility. To achieve a similar ageing response and tensile behavior, conventionally-manufactured Ti-3Al-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr would require cold-working prior to ageing. Carbon additions were also investigated to further accelerate the ageing response and to refine the β grain size. While the ageing response was much quicker and a much harder alloy can be produced, the carbon amount added was insufficient for β grain refinement, which resulted in reduced ductility without a change in strength.},

Under this testing condition, the yield strength (YS) of the HEAs amounted to 665 MPa. Regardless of the testing temperature, the deformation mechanism of all investigated HEAs was dominated by a synergistic effect consisting of deformation twinning and dislocation pile-up around twins. The fraction of twin boundaries and dislocation density within the deformed microstructure of the HEA correlated with the test temperature. At 77 K, the formation of nanotwins together with dislocation slip prevailed and contributed to pronounced twin-twin and twin-dislocation interactions which effectively restricted the dislocation movement and, hence, contributed to a higher YS as well as strain hardening rate in comparison to that of the HEAs at room temperature of 298 K. The LPBF-fabricated HEAs showed unpronounced thermal softening even at a high testing temperature of 1073 K. Continuous dynamic recrystallization was restricted in the HEA because of its inherent sluggish dislocation kinetics and low stacking fault energy.},

Multi-element ceramic carbide (Hf-Nb-Ta-Zr)C coatings with excess carbon, synthesized by DC co-sputtering is presented in this study as a promising candidate to achieve this objective. The specific roles of microstructure and residual stress are decoupled in order to understand their influence on the mechanical properties. Extensive mechanical characterization through in situ testing of focused ion beam fabricated microcantilevers and nanoindentation based approaches are adopted to quantitatively separate the effect of residual stresses on the fracture toughness of the (Hf-Nb-Ta-Zr)C coatings. Residual stress free, microcantilever testing in notched and unnotched conditions, in combination with microstructural characterization unambiguously reveals the intrinsic mechanical behavior of coatings, which solely depend on the microstructure. On the other hand, nanoindentation based testing techniques probe the influence of residual stress and microstructure on the measured mechanical properties. The segregation and thickening of carbon-rich clusters, especially to the grain boundaries with increasing deposition temperatures is speculated to lead to substantial degradation in all mechanical properties measured. An easier fracture path through grain boundaries leads to a reduction in fracture resistance, which is possibly related to carbon enrichment.},

While the co-segregation of Zn and Ce is revealed in the Mg-Zn-Ce alloy, only the segregation of Zn is observed in the Mg-Zn-Ca alloy. The co-segregation of Zn and Nd in Mg-Zn-Nd alloy is demonstrated to lead to the relatively large solute drag pressure at grain boundary, which in combination with the Zener pressure emerging from nanoscale (Mg, Zn) 3 Nd precipitates significantly refines the grain size. The grain refinement in combination with the bimodal microstructure significantly contributes to the increased strength of the designed ternary alloys. Furthermore, the addition of Ca and Ce are found to simultaneously improve the strength and ductility, which is closely correlated with the segregation of alloying elements at the grain boundary. Among the considered alloying species, Ce is shown to efficiently improve the mechanical properties of Mg-Zn alloy.},

In this study, detailed evidence was provided that linear defects were formed by the motion of Shockley partial dislocation on a close-packed plane and usually could be in the form of faulted austenite, twins and ɛ-martensite, defined as faulted bands. Faulted bands were formed prior to martensitic transformation at a starting transition temperature higher than M s . They can provide nucleation sites for α′-martensitic transformation but can act as an effective barrier to limit the growth of α′-martensite laths. In addition, the same plane was found between the formation plane of the faulted band and the habit plane of α′-martensite, which indicates that the variant types of α′-martensite were decided by the variant types of faulted bands.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development in the advanced manufacturing industry asks for better tempering softening resistance (TSR) of Hot work die steels. In this work, a modified H13 steel (CXN03 steel) with additional tungsten, molybdenum, and lowering chromium was prepared. The TSR of CXN03 is significantly better than H13. After quenching at 1040 °C, the hardness and strength of H13 were larger than those of CXN03. However, the hardness and strength of CXN03 exceeded those of H13 after 2 h tempering at 600 °C. A mathematical model was utilized to correlate microstructural characteristics with yield strength during tempering. The calculated results indicated that the superior tempering softening resistance of CXN03 steel mainly results from the excellent stability of dispersive nano-sized M 2 C, which could prevent dislocation recovery. Recrystallization softening was observed in H13 but not in CXN03. The recrystallization of H13 is driven by dislocation movement, and the rearrangement of dislocations contributed to the formation of sub-boundaries. These sub-boundaries could divide martensite lath as well as form sub-grains. As the tempering time increased, sub-boundaries transformed into high-angle grain boundaries by absorbing the vicinal dislocations. Therefore, martensite lath collapsed, and massive recrystallized grains occurred. The massive stable M 2 C in CXN03 hindered the dislocation rearrangement, thus preventing the recrystallization.},

  abstract     = {Ceramic coatings are in general a kind of brittle material because they are predominantly made up of ionic crystals that avoid dislocation motion caused by lattice distortion. In this regard, a remarkable toughened ZrO 2 /MgO nanocomposite coating is obtained by the plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process and in-situ synthesized ZrO 2 with quantitative control approach. It is revealed that the toughening behavior of the ZrO 2 /MgO coating is related to the coordination and diversion of lattice distortion at the metallic oxide interface, which induces distinct dislocation motion at the interface. The semicoherent interface between m-ZrO 2 and MgO is verified to act as a buffer to realize toughening of the nanocomposite coating through dislocation slipping induced by lattice coordinated distortion. Simultaneously, significant interfacial lattice distortion transfer and dislocation pinning are discovered at the semicoherent interface between t-ZrO 2 and MgO, which are beneficial to toughness enhancement of the nanocomposite coating. The results indicate that the toughening effect occurs along with dislocation slipping and pinning caused by lattice distortion of the ZrO 2 /MgO semicoherent interface, which enables the toughness of novel nanocomposite coating to reach 2.7 times of the traditional PEO coating.},

  abstract     = {Metallic materials have long been used in a wide range of industrial applications due to their outstanding physical and mechanical properties as well as high process latitudes. Mechanical machining is one of the important steps in manufacturing of metallic components because it directly influences the surface quality of the final products. To date, extensive studies have been conducted on the investigation of factors affecting the machinability of metallic materials, such as cutting parameters, cooling conditions and material micro/nanostructures. Contributory factors of cutting parameters and cooling conditions have been extensively reviewed in previous studies, but there is still a lack of a fundamental review to clearly understand the effects of material micro/nanostructures on the machining. Therefore, this review highlights the influences of different micro/nanostructures on the machinability and discusses the materials deformation mechanism in machining of metallic materials. The micro/nanostructures mainly include crystalline anisotropies of single crystals, grain sizes of polycrystals, phase compositions of single/multiphase materials, layer-by-layer structures of additive manufactured materials, amorphous structures of bulk metal glasses, micro reinforcements of metal matrix composites, and porosities of porous metal foams. Besides, the challenges and opportunities faced in machining of metallic materials are discussed from the perspective of micro/nanostructures.},

Numerical analysis of this process can improve dimensional accuracy of molded sealing products. In this study, a stress–strain relationship model that considers thermal expansion, cold contraction, and shrinkage caused by a crosslinking reaction under the constraint of a mold boundary was established, a transient analysis method for thermal–mechanical–chemical coupling of the process from rubber seal vulcanization to mold opening was developed, and dimensional changes of the rubber seal in the mold and after cooling were predicted. Results calculated by the model were verified by the production of typical seals. The influences of vulcanization process parameters on changes in molded seal size were numerically analyzed. The numerical results showed that the dimensional shrinkage ratio increased nonlinearly from 3.2\% to 3.8\% when the vulcanization temperature increased from 165 to 185 °C, i.e., an increase of 0.206\% for every 1\% increase in shrinkage caused by the vulcanization reaction. These research results can be utilized in the design of vulcanization molds for high-precision rubber seals.},

The resulting alloys consisted of 50 wt\% − 50 wt\% and 25 wt\% − 75 wt\% non-gradient bronze-steel parts and sandwich structures of alternating 250-μm-height steel and bronze layers. The alloy based on aluminum bronze demonstrated the highest ultimate tensile strength (838.6 MPa). Its yield stress amounted to 665 MPa, strain-to-fracture – 0.035, Poisson’s ratio – 0.23, and modulus of resilience – 1.03 MJ/m 3 . A digital image correlation approach was applied to study the character of major strain distribution in the fabricated specimens and localizations of strain concentrators and compare them with all specimens’ failure areas.

The coating made it possible to apply anodic oxidation, by which a surface with defined nanoscale topography was obtained. Thus, a material with a gradient surface topography and suitable chemical composition was prepared. The properties of the surface were analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition was then evaluated by photoelectron spectroscopy. The roughness, the wettability, and the wear resistance of the surface were observed. The adhesion of the coating and the oxide layer was evaluated. The biological activity of samples was analyzed by seeding them with human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells. The cell adhesion, proliferation, metabolic activity and viability was observed and was statistically evaluated. After this, the functionality of this surface modification was tested by applying it to an implant with a real geometry.

The incremental hole drilling method was used to measure the residual stresses in samples of both the as-deposited and stress-relief annealed variants. Meanwhile, the changes in residual martensite and dislocation density during cycling were examined by quasi-in-situ EBSD observations. The results indicate that the stability of the cyclic process is jointly influenced by the residual stress and dislocation. When the residual stress was 1.6\%, the superelasticity of the specimens increased from 69.81\% to 95.72\%; After releasing the residual stress at a strain of 2.5\%, the superelasticity of the specimens increased from 63.09\% to 73.70\%.

Fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy, nuclear-magnetic-resonance, and scanning-electron- microscope results demonstrated that the PEG-g-sNBR brush was successfully synthesized, and the reactive site was found. Using a tribological test machine with a high-precision vibration acceleration sensor, the tribological behaviors of PEG-g-sNBR were studied under aqueous lubrication. The results showed that the coefficient of friction of PEG-g-sNBR was reduced by 73.4\% at 100 rpm compared to pure NBR, its microscopic wear and vibrational energy were also lower than pure NBR. Moreover, the lubrication states were revealed by friction, wear, together with the complexity of friction-induced vibration signal time series, and a lubricating film was formed on the friction surface of PEG-g-sNBR at lower rotational speed. In addition, the PEG-g-sNBR could work stably for 12 h at 300 rpm, and still maintain good tribological performance.},

Based on this bi-stability study, a typical one-layer of this novel rotational motion actuated bistable structure, which is composed of four pre-shaped beams assembled uniformly inside two circular frames, is proposed and fabricated. The mechanical behaviour of this bistable structure represented in terms of moment-angle curves are analyzed by the finite element method and experiments. A parametric analysis is performed to study the influence of geometric parameters of an one-layer multistable metastructure on its bi-stability performance, which provides the guidance to design multistable structures with more layers. Lastly, multistable structures with two layers and three layers, which can achieve large rotations with controllable angle-step and snapping sequence, are designed and studied. Furthermore, this research demonstrates other as-fabricated beams with bi-stability have prospects to design the rotational multistable metastructures.

Alternating stacks of cast halide layers with controlled concentration and thickness yielded true white luminescence characteristics when the halide layers were combined with a bottom blue chip. Specifically, the adjusted prismatic pattern for the red halide layer was found to effectively strengthen the emission of white luminescence. In particular, a phosphor-stacked structure of green and red layers with a 9-μm-pitch prismatic pattern resulted in an enhanced luminous efficacy of ∼54.4 lm W −1 , which is higher than those of a non-prismatic layer or a larger pitch pattern.

Characterisation of the functionalized CEG indicated a significant oxygen reduction, which gave rise to a restoration of the graphitic structure. The polydopamine functionalized CEG showed an enhanced exfoliation and dispersion in organic solvents and the polymer matrix with respect to the non-modified CEG. The silane functionalized CEG provided a higher affinity towards the matrix with polymer chains covering the CEG sheets on the fracture surfaces. The addition of functionalized CEG enhanced the mechanical properties of the UHMWPE matrix with an increase in micro-hardness of up to 25\% and storage modulus of up to 58\%. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the composites was significantly enhanced with an increase in water contact angle from 98.6° for the pure polymer to 119° for 5 wt\% silane functionalized CEG. Preliminary wear experiments indicated the potential of the composites for tribological applications with a decrease in wear rate of up to 99\% under water lubricated conditions.},

  abstract     = {Membrane E-cadherin is one of the proteins whose expression affects cancer cell migration and adhesion. The design of peptide drugs that target such cancer cell-specific characteristics have received great attention in recent years and cysteine derivatives in particular have been shown to enhance anticancer effects. Herein, we set out to investigate the anticancer activity of a cell adhesion inhibiting peptide comprised of l -lysine (Lys) and Benzyl- l -cysteine (BnCys) and its influence on intestinal microbiota. The peptide inhibits cell migration and adhesion by interfering E-cadherin packaging, perturbing the integrity of cell membrane, and triggering caspase-3 and PARP related apoptotic pathways. It is highly possible that the cationic Lys segment would bind with the negatively charged cadherin molecules and the bulky BnCys segment would act as a spacing moiety to prevent the packing of E-cadherin. The peptide mixed with low-dose cisplatin effectively inhibits tumor growth and metastasis without incurring weight loss, prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing mice. The peptide treatment group increases the relative proportion of intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk), suggesting at prebiotic properties. These results paint a promising picture for designing cell migration/adhesion inhibiting peptides to target membrane E-cadherin for anticancer therapy.},

However, developing simple and effective multifunctional therapeutic platforms remain to be further explored. Herein, we have constructed a hybrid nanoplatform composed of a hierarchically porous porphyrinic coordination network (HP-PCN) as the core and copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles (NPs) as the satellites to realize combined chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer. HP-PCN exhibits excellent photodynamic properties but its antitumor effect is limited by the insufficient penetration depth of laser and hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome the shortcomings of photodynamic monotherapy, we introduce negatively charged CuS NPs on the HP-PCN surface taking advantage of its porous structure and positive surface charge to fabricate core-satellite HP-PCN@CuS nanoplatform. CuS NPs have excellent photothermal performances and additional CDT function by reacting with hydrogen peroxide in the TME. The integration of HP-PCN and CuS NPs enables the hybrid nanosystem more potent antitumor efficiency. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that HP-PCN@CuS presents an combined CDT/PDT/PTT effect to significantly inhibit tumor growth with low systemic toxicity. This study provides a promising strategy to fabricate multifunctional therapeutic nanoplatforms for effective and combined antitumor applications.},

Then two types of osteogenic-related peptides were respectively covalently bound with the eight kinds of carriers with the same molar amount. Subsequently, performances of the MWCNTs/Peptides and GP/Peptides composites were evaluated using ectopic osteogenesis model in rats and calvarial defect model in rabbits respectively. The results showed that the ability of inducing osteogenesis and repairing bone defect of the peptides covalently bound with the MWCNTs was better than that of the peptides covalently bound with the GP, and that the positive effect order of the four covalent binding modes on bioactivities of the peptides was for the first time announced. Furthermore, the possible mechanism was proposed and discussed.

Permeability of graded scaffolds increased with increasing porosity that all fall in the range of the permeability for human bone.

Our results confirmed that the Cur/PCL possessed similar porosity with the PCL alone scaffold. The Cur loaded within the Cur/PCL scaffold exhibited sustained release kinetics, stability and a favorable anti-inflammation property in vitro . Moreover, The Cur/PCL scaffold displayed gratifying biocompatibility and supported ring-shaped tracheal cartilage regeneration. In addition, the engineered ring-shaped tracheal cartilage in the Cur/PCL group showed a potent anti-inflammatory effect on maintaining the cartilaginous phenotype and enhanced tracheal cartilage regeneration when subcutaneously implanted into an autologous rabbit. Furthermore, the engineered cartilage in the Cur/PCL group exerted a favorable anti-inflammatory capacity to significantly suppress fibrogenesis and granulation hyperplasia, enhancing tracheal cartilage regeneration and elevating survival rate of experimental rabbits after orthotopic transplantation.

This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterisation of a highly sensitive and robust 3C-SiC/Si pressure sensor. The sensor utilises a stress amplification structure consisting of four Si pillars built up from the 3C-SiC/Si membrane, supporting a series of released n -type 3C-SiC sensing elements. When pressure is applied to the diaphragm, the pillars act to locally concentrate and amplify strain in the 3C-SiC sensing elements, resulting in over 7 times higher stresses/strains in these sensing elements compared to a traditional structure. Additionally, the front side of the sensor is fully covered by a 3C-SiC thin film, which provides a strong chemical protective capability, allowing the sensor to operate in harsh chemically corrosive environments. The robust device utilises the full Wheatstone bridge to negate the effects of temperature. Experimental results show that the fabricated sensor is highly stable, repeatable, has a high sensitivity of 0.276 mV/V/kPa and a maximum non-linearity of 2.2\% in the 0–100 kPa region. The results indicate that this smart-structure pressure sensor is promising for applications that require highly precise pressure sensing in aggressively corrosive environments.},

ZHN can efficiently adsorb MO pollutant. Specially, the adsorption capacity per unit mass of ZHN synthesized by FSP and CCM can reach 732.72 mg/g and 611.76 mg/g. ZHN synthesized by FSP possesses faster initial adsorption rate, larger adsorption capacity per unit mass and better adsorption characteristics for MO solution which may be due to the more voids between the lamellar of ZHN synthesized by FSP and the fact that the grain size, lamina thickness, and specific surface area of ZHN synthesized by FSP are 1/2, 1/6 and 4 times of those of ZHN synthesized by CCM, respectively. The adsorption kinetics of ZHN on MO is conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetic equations. Moreover, at a low equilibrium concentration of MO, the adsorption behavior of ZHN is closer to the monolayer surface adsorption. When the adsorption on the ZHN surface tends gradually to the saturation with the increase of the equilibrium concentration, it will show the characteristics of interlayer adsorption.},

In this work, an H13 tool steel was processed by selective laser melting (SLM) followed by heat treatments and the thermal and mechanical properties in relation to microstructure were investigated. The as-built H13 showed lower thermal conductivities compared with conventional counterparts and exhibited anisotropy with a lower thermal conductivity along the building direction. Heat treatments generally increased the values of thermal conductivities and largely reduced anisotropy, but the final thermal conductivity differed when using different heat-treating schedules. It was found that porosity, retained austenite, the melt-pool structure and the ultra-fine cellular-columnar microstructure, which were functions of SLM and heat-treating parameters, were factors determining the thermal conductivity of H13. Based on the present study of SLMed H13, it is proposed that a trade-off is necessary between thermal and mechanical properties when designing the processing route.},

The behavior of the base material under identical microstructure and test conditions was also investigated using dedicated LPBF-manufactured specimens with single strut gauges. Irrespective of topology, precipitation led to a transition in the lattice mechanical behavior from bending-dominated to stretch-dominated, which was associated to a change in the strut deformation mode from plastic hinging to elastic buckling, as well as to a decrease in the base material strain to fracture. For all topologies investigated, precipitation led to lattice strengthening, consistent with particle-strengthening of the base material. Additionally, high temperature straining resulted both in a decrease in the lattice yield strength, consistent with softening of the base material, and in a reduction in the width of the stress oscillations in the stretch-dominated lattices, which is associated to the decrease in the base material ductility. This work proves that material microstructure influences strongly the behavior of additively manufactured architectured structures and that it must be considered as a design criterion for performance optimization.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel methodology to design a family of strut-based lattice structures derived from isosurfaces. Here the methodology is applied on isosurfaces obtained from Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMSs). A Schoen’s Gyroid TPMS morphology was employed to generate an isosurface strut lattice structure (ISLS). The structural element of ISLSs were modeled as solid tetrahedral and beam elements. Finite element simulations were performed to compute the effective mechanical properties such as stiffness, anisotropy index and fatigue properties for range of relative densities, i.e., 5\% to 35\%. An isosurface strut mesh sensitivity study was performed to determine number of mesh points required for consistency in mechanical properties. Stretch dominated sheet Gyroids are found to be most superior lattices for mechanical properties in literature and hence the truss based ISLS is compared to sheet Gyroids. The scaling laws demonstrated that Gyroid ISLS modelled with both beam elements and solid elements exhibited bending dominated behavior and yet ISLS solid elements show an elastic modulus, bulk modulus, and shear modulus, comparable to stretch-dominated sheet Gyroids. Anisotropy analysis showed that ISLS exhibit near isotropic behavior for all relative densities. Results exhibited that for the same relative density, ISLS modelled with beam elements showed lower elastic modulus, but higher fatigue performance as compared to the solid elements. Highly porous, low elastic modulus and superior fatigue resistance demonstrate suitability of ISLS beam as biomaterial scaffolds whereas ISLS solid having high modulus are useful in applications requiring enhanced mechanical strength.},

  abstract     = {Several factors must be considered within the assessment of parts produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) such as, for example, heterogeneous microstructure, process-induced defects, surface quality, residual stresses, and dependence on the material’s properties with the building orientation. All these factors severely affect the resistance to static and fatigue loadings of AMed components. Among the possible failure mechanisms, the failure promoted by static loadings when cracks are present is one of the most important failure conditions, in particular for the as-built parts, which might have reduced fracture toughness and ductility compared to the wrought alloy counterpart. In this work, we present a comprehensive approach to the static assessment of AlSi10Mg parts manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion. Two benchmark fracture geometries were designed to investigate the typical AM geometrical features: i) thin walls in tension and ii) notched components in bending. Finite Element analyses of the benchmark specimens showed that an approach based on elastic–plastic fracture mechanics parameters is needed to correctly predict the experimental failures, despite the quasi-brittle behaviour shown by the AlSi10Mg alloy. In view of these results, this paper explores the applicability of the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD), a tool used for conventional ductile materials, to static assessment of AMed parts. The results show that the assessment approach based on the FAD makes it possible to properly predict the experimental failures of the benchmark specimens.},

Sustained release of DOX from the drug loaded polymeric micelles was observed and the drug release was accelerated by decreasing the medium pH from 7.4 to 6.8. Cellular uptake by U251 glioma cells showed that GPTD can enhance the accumulation of polymeric micelles inside the mitochondria after charge-mediated cellular internalization and release DOX into the cellular interior. In vivo anticancer activity performed on glioma Balb/c nude mice demonstrated that the DOX-containing GPTD could remarkably inhibit the tumor growth, and displayed a significant reduction of tumor tissue cells and fewer Ki67 positive cells compared to the PBS group.

Inspired by the structure of muscle tissue, a complex structure of layered double hydroxide (LDH) anchored chicken feather fiber (CFF) and tannic acid (TA) was constructed by self-assembly process, forming a novel organic–inorganic hybrid reinforcement structure (CFF-LDH-TA). CFF-LDH-TA was closely combined with soybean meal (SM) through covalent and hydrogen bond multiple interactions. TA simulated the function of connective tissue around fibers, significantly improving the cohesion of SM based adhesive through effective energy dissipation and load transfer. Due to the increased crosslinking density, the dry and wet shear strengths of SM/CFF-LDH-TA reached 2.12 and 1.60 MPa, respectively, which were 50\% and 214\% higher than original SM adhesive, and significantly exceeded the strength of several commercialized formaldehyde adhesives. The existence of bridging effect and sacrificial structure improved toughness of the adhesive, the work of adhesion increased by 802\%, reached 830 mJ. In addition, the SM/CFF-LDH-TA adhesive had better anti-mold and flame retardant ability. More importantly, the cost was lower than the commercial SM based adhesive.

Herein, we fabricate a multifunctional scaffold with controlled dual-stage drug release to achieve antibacterial and osteogenic therapy during infected bone reconstruction. Water-in-oil (w/o) β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) nanoparticle/ poly(Lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA)/dichloromethane composite emulsion inks containing the antibacterial chlorhexidine (CHX) loaded graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and osteogenic peptide (p24) was produced through cryo-3D printing. A biphasic drug release profile is achieved via a rapid CHX release from CHX@GO on scaffold surface to kill the bacteria, and a sustained release of CHX and p24 from the scaffold matrix to prevent the recurrence of infection and induce bone regeneration. Interestingly, the GO nanosheet increased the antibacterial sensitivity through its direct physical contact which destroyed the bacteria membrane. Furthermore, the p24 and phosphate ions derived from dissociated TCP nanoparticles could induce the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived stem cells. Eventually, the designed scaffolds effectively eliminated the bacteria, alleviated the accompanying inflammation, and improved bone regeneration in a rat model. The present study provides a facile strategy to treat bone defects with infection.},

In this study, on account of the penetration ability through tissues of near-infrared (nIR) lights and the nIR-absorption ability of graphene oxide (GO), the GO-based milli-capsule is constructed, with controlled drug release ability by photomechanical deformation and wireless nIR manipulation. When radiation powers increasing from 0.1 to 0.5 W, drug dosages are in the range of 0 μg (0 drop) to 225 μg (five drops). The cytotoxicity of GO-based capsules in vitro is evaluated by embedded GO as drugs and released GO in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). When the capsules irradiated under 0.5 W and released different amounts of GO-drops in ccRCC, GO-concentrations increase from 0 to 80 μg∙mL −1 and the proportions of apoptotic cells increase 2.85 times, which proves milli-capsules inhibit ccRCC cells proliferation in a GO-concentration-dependent manner by accurate GO-dosing control.

Among the proposed strategies, a promising one is the development of tubular scaffolds, in particular exploiting electrospinning technique. In this work, antibacterial electrospun polycaprolactone/rifampicin (PCL/Rif) membranes were prepared and characterized. The membranes are characterized by randomly oriented nanofibers with a homogeneous diameter, as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical characterization, performed with uniaxial tensile tests, showed a suitable stability over time and a proper deformability. The rifampicin release, investigated by UV spectrophotometry, showed a burst release in the first part of the experiment and a sustained release over time . The membranes are biocompatible and able to support the adhesion and proliferation of urotheliocytes. Moreover, PCL/Rif membranes showed an antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and other bacterial strains belonging to the “ESKAPE” group . Considering the possibility to use the electrospinning for the production of tubular scaffolds, the described membranes represent a promising starting point for the preparation of ureteral scaffolds with antibacterial properties.},

However, no study has been conducted on the effect of conductive materials on local immunity. To this end, this study designed a graphene oxide-based conductive hydrogel to repair infected diabetic wounds. Self-healing injectable conductive hydrogels were synthesized by dynamic Schiff-base reaction and electrostatic interactions between oxidized hyaluronic acid, N -carboxyethyl chitosan, graphene oxide , and polymyxin B. The study found that the hydrogel has good biocompatibility and antibacterial properties. In addition, in vivo experiments confirmed that the hydrogel could modulate macrophage polarization to improve the local inflammatory microenvironment, promote neovascularization, and significantly accelerate the healing of diabetic wounds. Most notably, graphene oxide-based conductive hydrogels can modulate local immunity in diabetic wounds to promote healing. This study provides new guidelines for expanding research on conductive materials and new directions for promoting healing in infected diabetic wounds.},

Aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is highly wear-resistant, while hydroxyapatite (HA) is a biologically active. However all previous biocomposites made via mechanical mixing of these two bioceramic materials have not been able to meet clinical standards. The aim of this work is to resolve these problems by using newly synthesized bioceramic hybrids. In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that these new biomaterials have significantly improved biocompatibility and biomechanical properties when compared to neat PEKK. Surface sulfonation of the hybrids also leads to further improvements of these two properties. S-PEKK/Al 2 O 3 and S-PEKK/HA promote MC3T3-E1 adhesion. PEKK/HA and S-PEKK/HA significantly promote cell proliferation by upregulating both mRNA and protein levels of cell cycle genes to facilitate cells shift from G0/G1 phase to S phase. PEKK/HA hybrids and S-PEKK/Al 2 O 3 promote cell differentiation by upregulating the expression of osteogenic differentiation genes and proteins. PEKK/HA, S-PEKK/Al 2 O 3 and S-PEKK/HA are able to strongly bind to the new bone and exhibit good in vivo osseointegration properties.

Very recently, oxygen-independent free-radical generation based on thermodynamic therapy (TDT) has emerged as a potential powerful therapeutic strategy for hypoxic cancer therapy. Herein, in this work, an intelligent hypoxia-independent free radical nanogenerator (CuS/AIPH@MnO 2 , denoted as CAM) was fabricated by in situ coating manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) shell onto the surface of as 2,2-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH)-loaded mesoporous hollow mesoporous copper sulfide (CuS). The local hyperthermal generated by CAM upon NIR laser irradiation not only permitted PTT, but also promoted the disintegration of AIPH for generation of oxygen-independent free radicals, exerting the advantages of combination therapy of PTT/TDT for effective tumor ablation. Simultaneously, both in vitro and in vivo results have demonstrated the synergistic therapeutic efficacy of PTT/TDT for remarkable tumor growth inhibition. In addition, the favorable biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity of the as-synthesized nanoparticles were verified both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this work proposed an attractive and promising strategy in cancer therapy based on generation of oxygen-irrelevant toxic free radicals, which exhibits great potential for clinical translations in hypoxic tumor therapy.},

  abstract     = {Promoting refractory wound healing remains a challenging issue. Currently, dressings with intelligent infection management functions built on infection eradication and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging abilities are lacking. In this study, an approach based on Cu2 + -imidazole coordination cross-linked histidine grafted chitosan (CS-His) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) was developed to engineer superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimicking centers with photothermal anti-infection and intelligent anti-infection abilities, beyond typical ROS scavenging activity. The cross-linked coordination network was further promoted with tanshinol-encapsulated ZIF-8 frameworks (ZIF-8@Ts) to achieve intelligent infection management behaviors. These designs generate a refractory wound-healing hydrogel with integrated functions of photothermal anti-infection, SOD mimicking activity, and intelligent infection management. In response to infection exacerbation, the SOD mimicking centers and ZIF-8@Ts nanoparticles could release CQDs for anti-infection and Ts for antioxidation, respectively. In vitro results revealed photothermal anti-infection, ROS scavenging, and intelligent infection management capacities of the hydrogel.

  abstract     = {The effect of intrinsic heat treatment (IHT) induced by cyclic heat input in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. Herein, the feasibility of tailoring the microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 625 alloy to improve material properties and help achieve part quality consistency by controlling IHT in directed energy deposition (DED) is demonstrated. In this study, thermal monitoring was used to obtain thermal histories of as-built specimens to reveal the differences in thermal characteristics under different IHT. The results show that the variation of IHT has an important effect on the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), the temperature and cooling rate of the molten pool, the morphology and content of Laves, and can initiate unusual δ precipitation in the interdendritic region which may be related to the dissolution of Laves. And this time-position-dependent IHT effect results in a hardness fluctuation of about 23.6\% in the bottom and top of the as-built specimen with a dwell time of 1 s, while the hardness is relatively uniform in the specimen with a dwell time of 10 s. Furthermore, by simulating the IHT variation process, its effect on precipitate and hardness was further confirmed.},

However, the existing conjunctival reconstruction methods are still unable to achieve satisfactory functional replacement of conjunctiva. Scaffold materials that provide a more stem-cell-friendly microenvironment are in urgent need of improvement. Herein we reported a functional conjunctival reconstruction scaffold constructed from decellularized matrix derived from rabbit subconjunctival fibroblasts (DM-SCF) loaded with conjunctival epithelial stem cells (CjESCs) for ocular surface repair. The DM-SCF had a thickness and mechanical strength close to that of normal conjunctiva and showed excellent biocompatibility. CjESCs inoculated on DM-SCF maintained good stem cell properties, which showed long-term maintenance of low differentiation and good proliferation activity. DM-SCF transplantation with CjESCs showed satisfactory results in rabbit models of a large conjunctival defect. The conjunctiva was reconstructed with abundant goblet cell expression and regular fiber arrangement. Protein mass spectrometry revealed the active extracellular matrix components of DM-SCF, regulating the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and Notch pathways for stem cell maintenance. Overall, our study developed a promising new strategy for ocular surface reconstruction by optimizing bioactive scaffold and providing functional stem cell niche, so as to achieve long-standing and superior functional repair.},

Our research shows that the silk fibroin/collagen type II scaffold has good performance and can meet the special requirements of cartilage repair. 10\% compressive strain is the optimal compressive loading in vitro . Under optimal compression loading in vitro , chondrocytes can proliferate and grow rapidly on the scaffold to achieve better “maturation”. The in vitro cultured chondrocyte/scaffold complex effectively improves the cartilage repair effect after implantation. The compressive elastic modulus of the new tissue reached 0.682 ± 0.010 MPa after 12 weeks of repair (0.714 ± 0.011 MPa for the surrounding host cartilage).

  abstract     = {Vertebrate bones are made of a nanocomposite consisting of water, mineral and organics. Water helps bone material withstand mechanical stress and participates in sensation of external loads. Water diffusion across vertebrae of medaka (bone material lacking osteocytes) and zebrafish (bone material containing osteocytes) was compared using neutron tomography. Samples were measured both wet and following immersion in deuterated-water (D 2 O). By quantifying H + exchange and mutual alignment with X-ray µ CT scans, the amount of water expelled from complete vertebra was determined. The findings revealed that anosteocytic bone material is almost twice as amenable to D 2 O diffusion and H 2 O exchange, and that unexpectedly, far more water is retained in osteocytic zebrafish bone. Diffusion in osteocytic bones (only 33\% – 39\% water expelled) is therefore restricted as compared to anosteocytic bone (∼ 60\% of water expelled), presumably because water flow is confined to the lacunar-canalicular network (LCN) open-pore system. Histology and Raman spectroscopy showed that anosteocytic bone contains less proteoglycans than osteocytic bone. These findings identify a previously unknown functional difference between the two bone materials. Therefore, this study proposes that osteocytic bone retains water, aided by non-collagenous proteins, which contribute to its poroelastic mechano-transduction of water flow confined inside the LCN porosity.},

The component of the extracellular matrix, sodium hyaluronate, or natural biopolymers (sodium alginate or chitosan) were employed, and, subsequently, the cytocompatibility of the native and functionalized alumina scaffolds were determined. Both the absence of cytotoxicity and the cytocompatibility that were revealed demonstrate the application potential of these composites. The scaffolds with pore size greater than 250 µm were more cytocompatibility than those with pores size between 125 and 250 µm. The cytocompatibility was confirmed under in vivo -mimicking dynamic cultivation conditions which further improve the cell distribution and growth.},

Soft X-ray ptychography data was then reconstructed with a pixel size of 8 nm. The two dimensional variation in chemistry and structure of carious enamel was revealed at the nanoscale, namely, the organisation of hydroxyapatite nano-crystals within enamel rods was imaged together with the inter-rod region. Correlative use of electron and X-ray scanning microscopies for the same sample allowed visualisation of the connection between structure and composition as presented in a compound image where colour indicates the relative calcium concentration in the sample, as indicated by the calcium K α fluorescence intensity and grey scale shows the nanostructure .

  abstract     = {Lubricant has been well-recognized in reducing friction/wear resistance and subsequently facilitating the movement of objects. However, the so-called lubricant inclines to increase the transverse dynamic piercing resistant properties of laminar aluminum over a wide range of high-velocity from 60 m/s to 230 m/s. The underlying mechanism in the high-speed perforation process of laminar structural raises confusion about the traditional concept that the lubricant did not act in reducing the frictional effect. Lubricant, such as high vacuum grease, smeared on the thinner metal laminar show the ‘slippery but bulletproof’ behavior. A specially designed dynamic sliding experiment provides further evidence that the lubricants act as a strengthening factor under the lower normal load state, but have no significant effect under a heavy normal load during the sliding initiation stage. The lubricant film avoids direct metallic contacting, reducing the stress concentration, postponing the failure displacement, and increasing the dissipated energy. This abnormal lubricant phenomenon in terms of strengthening and toughening should be taken into consideration as the thickness of the anti-bullet protective structure has been decreasing. These findings provide physical insights into the evolution of friction and fracture for developing membrane-like protective structures.},

A laser thermal affected zone, which is composed mainly of surface oxide layer, near-surface softening layer, and subsurface metamorphic layer, was produced in laser heating. The relationship model between surface energy density and the thickness of laser thermal affected zone was determined. On this basis, a microstructure-based selection approach of the LAMM conditions, such as laser power and the depth of cut, was adopted to achieve a high-performance surface. Results indicated that a nanometer-level roughness surface, Sa = 57.03 nm, with no apparent residual thermal affected layer and newly generated subsurface damage layer were identified while suppressing flank wear.

The unit cells of the lattices consist of six stiff inclined struts that together form the edges of two stacked tetrahedra. The central plane (between the two tetrahedra) contains elastomeric elements that stretch when the lattice is compressed. The geometric configurations of the elastomers examined here include: (i) straight struts between each node pair within the central plane, (ii) multiple struts between each node pair, including one straight strut and one or more curved struts, and (iii) flat sheets, either uniform or graded in thickness, connected at the mid-plane nodes. Assessments of the concepts are made using analytical models, finite element simulations, and experiments on lattices fabricated by 3D printing. The experimental results affirm the understanding of mechanical response gleaned from the models and highlight the importance of joint design in attaining large straining capacity and strain reversibility. They also demonstrate a nearly twofold increase in load bearing capacity when straight struts are replaced by graded sheets. The work also raises the prospects for computational design optimization for maximum efficiency in material use.},

Such cycling leads to different thermal signatures and associated heterogeneities in solidification, solid-state transformation, microstructure, and properties of the printed part. There is, therefore, a need to develop methods to compare thermal signatures in a part with reference to part qualification criteria. In this work, we have developed and demonstrated a similarity analysis procedure to meet this need. Thermal signatures are extracted from in-situ infrared (IR) thermography during a part built using a laser powder bed fusion ( l -PBF) machine. Layer-wise variations in thermal signature as a function of part geometry were revealed. Ex-situ microstructure characterization was used to validate the results from similarity analysis. Results and analysis confirmed that our similarity analysis is indeed a useful tool for rapid comparison of thermal signatures, i.e., heterogeneity within the part. Similarity analysis was also useful in identification of anomalous thermal signatures. The analysis method paves the way for deploying in-situ monitoring of AM parts for qualification of AM components.},

Benefiting from the independent control of phase and amplitude on orthogonal base, the orthogonality-simplified machine learning framework is employed to assist vectorial metasurface holography design. As a proof-of-concept, a vectorial metasurface holography carrying multi-polarization information was designed, simulated and measured. All the results exhibit a high degree of consistency, which fully demonstrates the effectiveness of our design.

  abstract     = {The determination of the relationships between rolling parameters and mechanical properties by high-precision deep learning is important for predicting and controlling the yield strength (YS) of hot rolled steels, however, for most steels, their YS-labeled samples are insufficient for the modeling. In this study, a YS-labeled small dataset and an unlabeled big dataset were firstly collected and then reconstructed the rolling parameters to be microstructures by the physical metallurgical principles. Before being used to label the unlabeled dataset with calculated YS, the strengthening mechanism-based compositions-microstructures-property linkage was optimized by combining the labeled dataset and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. To precisely predict YS, the deep neural network (DNN) was initially pre-trained by the big dataset labeled by calculated YS, and then fine-trained by the small dataset labeled by measured YS. Based on it, the effects of compositions, microstructures, and rolling parameters on YS were analyzed, and the results proved to be in good agreement with experimental observations, which presents the solution to implement deep learning by using physical metallurgical principles with a small dataset.},

  abstract     = {Both scale and temperature field effects have a considerable impact on polymer melt viscosity during thin-wall/micro injection molding. In this work, an in-line rheological test with similar dynamic test conditions to thin-wall/micro injection molding was adopted to further analyze the rheological properties and improve the simulation accuracy. An injection mold with rectangular slit cavity and storage region was designed to obtain a steady flow. The effects of factors such as the cavity size, viscous dissipation and melt temperature on polymer melt viscosity were studied. The results demonstrate that the injection molding conditions have a significant influence on the in-line rheological properties. When the cavity thickness (h) was 0.5 mm, the average percentage reductions of viscosity were 8.86\% (200 to 220 °C) and 4.07\% (220 to 240 °C) as the melt temperature rose. They were 57.13\% (200 to 220 °C) and 38.86\% (220 to 240 °C) when the cavity thickness was reduced to 0.2 mm. The test results show that the average prediction errors of pressure drop based on the capillary rheometer viscosity and in-line viscosity are 29.78\% (die: 5/0.2 mm) and 16.61\% (slit:h = 0.2 mm), respectively. In-line rheological viscosity shows potential for application in mold flow simulation.},

  abstract     = {Metasurface with simultaneous control of amplitude, phase, and polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves has drawn great attention in modern optics and photonics. However, conventional metasurfaces are mainly designed for single frequency and functionality. Here, we proposed a simple yet powerful methodology for the design of a dual-frequency multifunctional Janus metasurface. The designed transmissive device with sub-wavelength thickness is not only able to achieve completely independent phase modulation at two preset frequencies, but can also realize efficient asymmetric transmission of EM waves. On the other hand, the out-of-plane symmetry breaking also enables the realization of different functions for opposite propagation directions. As a proof of concept, a Janus beam deflector and a Janus metalens with direction- and frequency-controlled functionalities are demonstrated numerically. A dual-frequency Janus metasurface for direction-dependent meta-holograms is validated both numerically and experimentally. Therefore, we believe the proposed metasurfaces with direction- and frequency-dependent versatile functionalities may have great potential in the fields such as polarization manipulation, chiral sensing and information encryption.},

Briefly, the UCNPs capture the S protein of lysed SARS-CoV-2 in the swabs and subsequently they are bound with the anti-S antibodies modified AuNRs, resulting in significant nonradiative transitions from UCNPs (donors) to AuNRs (acceptors) at 480 nm and 800 nm, respectively. Notably, the specific recognition and quantitation of S protein can be realized in minutes at 800 nm because of the low autofluorescence and high Yb-Tm energy transfer in upconversion process. Inspiringly, the limit of detection (LOD) of the S protein can reach down to 1.06 fg mL −1 , while the recognition of nucleocapsid protein is also comparable with a commercial test kit in a shorter time (only 5 min). The established strategy is technically superior to those reported point-of-care biosensors in terms of detection time, cost, and sensitivity, which paves a new avenue for future on-site rapid viral screening and point-of-care diagnostics.},

One stability-based unit cell type that comprises slender beams can experience geometrical nonlinearities under small forces. Although reusability provided by these materials is attractive to engineering applications, the intrinsic drawback of this mechanism is the low load-carry capacity. Here, we attempt to increase the capacity of instability-based architected materials by inducing material nonlinearity of metallic materials. Through experimental tests and numerical simulations, this work investigates the plastic deformation of metallic architected materials using curved beams (MAM-CB) and their resulting energy dissipation capacity. We first investigated the mechanical properties of various MAM-CB unit cells, and finally studied the tradeoff between energy dissipation and fatigue life by embedding a geometrical gradient. In addition, we presented a method to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of a conventional structure by adapting MAM-CB units to form a new hybrid structural device. Furthermore, this method is showcased by using MAM-CB units under a possible scenario in seismic engineering, aimed to develop novel damping components with enhanced and customizable energy-dissipating properties. Our study paves the way for applying architected materials as augmented structures to strengthen the performance of the existing structures.},

The SRR was transformed into a thermally activated attenuator by depositing a 120 nm VO 2 thin film between the two gold rings of an SRR. We achieved an obvious attenuation (about 18 dB) at 3.55 GHz when the temperature increased from room temperature to 100 °C due to the dielectric constant drop and wide resistance variation of VO 2 thin film during the phase change process. At the same time, we observed a hysteresis property on the S parameters due to the resistance hysteresis of VO 2 during the heating and cooling process both in the theoretical and experimental results. Finally, considering the resistance of the VO 2 thin film between two gold rings, we proposed a modified lumped RLC circuit model for the VO 2 -based RF attenuator.},

The PVD technique enabled the formation of a compositional gradient across a thin-film sample. Specifically, a 10 cm wafer was used to manufacture a continuous set of 80 HEA compositions within the Nb-Ti-V-Zr family using a single deposition cycle. By using the solid-solution strengthening theory and estimated parameter properties, the strength and ductility of these HEA compositions were quantitatively determined/predicted and then experimentally verified by nano-indentation hardness test. Consequently, 7 refractory HEA compositions were successfully down-selected, which has a high propensity to have a balanced mechanical property.},

But to exploit the potential of CSs for novel applications, extensive understanding of the physics of these systems is needed and, so far, the shear response of CSs has not been studied. Here we study the shear response of CSs via short/large amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS/LAOS) while investigating the effect of several parameters. The training of crumpled paper reduced long-range correlations and resulted in an increase of the shear modulus with compaction, not observed for untrained paper. The presence of stacked layers parallel to the shear direction, in contrast to those positioned perpendicularly, resulted in lower shear storage modulus and increased energy dissipation through layers sliding. Reducing the surface friction allowed for easier internal rearrangements during shear deformations. In general, the shear resistance increases less with the increasing level of compaction than the compaction stiffness. However, it can be tuned by friction between the layers and their orientation. The estimated Poisson’s ratio of CSs reveals their auxetic nature. Our results pave the way to better understand the full mechanical response of CSs and tune their desired properties for practical applications.},

Digital image correlation (DIC) and finite element analysis (FEA) were applied to explore the compression behavior of NL-TPMS. The strain of the plateau end of homogenous TPMS decreases as the porosity increases, and the DIC results show that homogenous TPMS deformed with a 45° diagonal shear band. The compression results show that anisotropy of mechanical properties exists in NL-TPMS. The length of the first plateau and compressive proof strength increase as the number of cycles of porosity increases. The cycle of gradient porosity also influences the compression behavior of NL-TPMS, and a periodic failure deformation was observed in the NL-TPMS rather than a layer-by-layer compression deformation in normal gradient porous structures. The maximum principal strain of NL-TPMS detected by DIC presents a periodic distribution, which corresponds to the sinusoidal period designed function of NL-TPMS.},

A significant refinement in grain size to (∼2.8 µm) compared to the base metals (16.6 µm for MEA and 12.2 µm for SS) was observed arising from the co-occurrence of continuous and discontinuous dynamic recrystallisation where grains nucleated at triple grain boundaries, twin boundaries as well as low angle grain boundaries. A relatively strong brass texture {1 1 2} 〈1 1 0〉 appeared in the layer after recrystallisation, which was attributed to the grain growth behaviour under large deformation. The formation process of the interfacial layer from mesoscale to nanoscale was then postulated. Nanoindentation test indicated that the grains in the layer showed hardness between two base metals, but the interfacial layer demonstrated much higher yield strength (632 ± 14 MPa) and tensile strength (916 ± 4 MPa) than base metals, being higher than the relevant values reported in the literature. It was further clarified that the grain boundary strengthening mechanism rather than dislocation strengthening or solid-solution strengthening was mainly responsible for the strength enhancement.},

In this work, we decompose the large-scale design domain into several mesoscale subregions and propose an artificial intelligence-aided design method that can automatically control the anisotropic properties of the mesoscale design domain. First, a 3D convolutional neural network is proposed to replace the time-consuming homogenization computation process, thus enabling fast prediction of equivalent mechanical properties of lattice structures with arbitrary geometrical and material parameters. Then, inspired by the encoded metaplot, the mesoscale design domain is divided into several subunits with certain encoding. Finally, the combination type of the lattice structures of the subunits is adjusted automatically by a genetic algorithm according to the given target anisotropic properties. Furthermore, the effects of the lattice types, subunit numbers, and species number of subunits contained in the subregion on the accuracy of the inverse design are discussed. The results show that the proposed intelligent design method can effectively control the anisotropic properties of the mesoscale design domain.},

As the load increased from 2 N, 5 N, 10 N, and 20 N at room temperature, the friction coefficient decreased due to the oxidation lubrication triggered by heat accumulation, which was calculated via the simulation; the wear volume decreased; and the decrease in wear volume rise rate was a result of dynamic recrystallization and grain rotation. Observing the grain rotation and analyzing the texture evolution law during wear tests with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) was an innovation. To support the rotation behavior, a method for calculating the Schmid factor of rotating grains was developed. As the load rose, the R-Cube {0 0 1} 〈1 1 0〉 texture rotated to the rotating cube {0 0 1} 〈3 1 0〉 texture towards the α-fiber line. The modification decreased the maximum Schmid factor along the sliding and rolling directions, indicating an increase in initial strength and wear resistance. In addition, at a 2 N load, the TRC-3 sample with higher substructure and deformation texture exhibited less wear volume than the TRC-6 sample.},

  abstract     = {The strength-ductility trade-off severely limits the extensive application of particle-reinforced aluminum matrix composites mainly owing to the critical issues of local particle agglomeration and poor interfacial characteristics. The present work concentrates on these intractable puzzles and proposes Mg-Ag microalloying TiB 2 /Al-4.5Cu composites fabricated by an optimized salt-metal reaction method and multistage heat treatment. The resulting microstructure evidence that this new tactic synergistically ameliorates the detrimental agglomeration of TiB 2 particles by Mg and Ag doped at the TiB 2 /α-Al interface， meanwhile promoting the formation of nanosized Ω-Al 2 Cu and σ-Al 5 Cu 6 Mg 2 phases. The mechanical property experimental results indicate that the Mg-Ag microalloyed TiB 2 /Al-4.5Cu composites exhibit an accredited combination of the tensile strength (ultimate tensile strength is 496.3 ± 15.0 MPa) and ductility (uniform elongation is 12.8 ± 1.4\%). We emphasize the reciprocal effect between TiB 2 particles and the precipitated phase associated with unrelaxed misfit strains. Close attention is also paid to the interface binding characteristics and semi-coherent interphase boundary to evaluate their contribution to the ductility. The microalloying strategy can potentially be applied to many other metal matrix composites and boost analogous approaches for designing ultrahigh yet ductile materials for technological applications.},

In this paper, three kinds of ultrathin 2D metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with different metal ions (Ni 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Cu 2+ ) were successfully synthesized by ultrasonic assisted self-assembly under appropriate solvent ratio. Ni-MOF nanosheets as a new additive in 500 N system exhibit the best dispersion stability and lubrication performance, which is related to its maximum absolute value of Zeta potential. Compared with pure 500 N, the best tribological properties were obtained with the addition of 0.1 wt\% Ni-MOF nanosheets, reducing friction by 33.2 ± 12.4\% and wear by 98.7 ± 0.14\%. The excellent performance originates from interlayer sliding effect, polishing effect, and tribofilm with concrete structure. The iron oxide particles embedded in the tribofilm play a supporting structrue for the whole tribofilm. The carbonaceous and nitrogenous compounds are filled around the iron oxide particles, which makes tribofilm denser and more smooth. The further friction tests under higher sliding velocity and longer term reveal the potential industrial use of Ni-MOF nanosheets.},

In the present work, we report the thermal softening-suppressed inter-granular fracture, accompanied with enhanced stacking fault formation, increased healing ability of grain boundaries and promoted ductile material removal, in diamond cutting of polycrystalline 3C-SiC at elevated temperatures by multi-scale simulations. Molecular dynamics simulations and experiments of high temperature nanoindentations are performed to derive the temperature-dependent mechanical properties of bulk polycrystalline 3C-SiC. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of Mode I (tension) and Mode II (shearing) loading of a Σ9{1 2 2} symmetric tilt grain boundary at elevated temperatures are performed to extract the temperature-dependent mechanical properties of grain boundaries in polycrystalline 3C-SiC. A novel finite element model of heat treatment-assisted diamond cutting of polycrystalline 3C-SiC with the comprehensive consideration of thermal properties of both grains and grain boundaries at elevated temperatures is established to reveal the transition of material removal mode, grain boundary failure behavior, cutting force characteristics and chip profile with temperature.},

For an accurate early diagnosis of COVID-19, a multiplexed detection strategy is required to avoid false negatives with the existing gold standard assay. Nb 2 CT x nanosheets were found to efficiently quench the fluorescence emission of lanthanide-doped upconversion luminescence nanoparticles at wavelengths ranging from visible to near-infrared spectrum. Using this broad-spectrum quencher, we developed a label-free FRET-based biosensor for rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To target ORF and N genes, two types of oligo-modified lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles can be used simultaneously to identify-two sites in one assay via upconversion fluorescence enhancement intensity measurement with detection limits of 15 pM and 914 pM, respectively. Moreover, with multisite cross-validation, this multiplexed and sensitive biosensor is capable of simultaneous and multicolor analysis of two gene fragments of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant within minutes in a single homogeneous solution, which significantly improves the detection efficiency. The diagnosis result via our assay is consistent with the PCR result, demonstrating its application in the rapid and accurate screening of multiple genes of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases.},

The i-TS calculations combined with molecular dynamics simulations are compared with the experimental observations, revealing the inner track fine structures from individual spherical defects to continuous ion tracks with core–shell morphologies, and a quantitative relationship, including the melting (0.42 eV/atom), damage (0.75 eV/atom), and amorphous (1.71 eV/atom) thresholds, is established to successfully predict the inner disorder/amorphous proportions and track damage morphologies. The surface nanostructures of nanohillocks (isolated or partial overlaps) and nanopits (serious overlaps) directly depend on the combined action of the deposited potential and kinetic energies of incident ions, which induce local melting and sublimation in the near-surface region. Owing to the decreased recombination and the increased separation efficiency between electrons and holes, the higher photogenerated charge carrier mobility enhanced the photocurrent effect, further optimizing the photoconductivity performance in Xe 35+ -irradiated KTaO 3 . Therefore, controlled defect engineering using the ion irradiation technique, as an effective strategy, could design tailored nanostructure systems and regulate photoelectric properties, further promoting the development of novel technological applications.},

However, fragile hierarchical structures, fluorine-containing chemicals usage, and strict requirements for substrate scopes remain thorny challenges. Herein, we constructed a mechanical robust superhydrophobic ZnO@STA@PDMS coating with fluorine-free reagents through wide-applicable and substrate-independent spray-coating method. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and contact angle meter were used to assess the surface micro-nano structures, chemical compositions, thermal stability and wettability variations. The corrosion resistance of the developed superhydrophobic ZnO@STA@PDMS coating was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The corrosion current density ( I corr ) of the substrate reduces by two orders of magnitude after being spray-coated with superhydrophobic ZnO@STA@PDMS coating, indicating excellent corrosion resistance in marine submerged zone. In simulated marine atmospheric conditions with high relative humidity, the salt-deliquesce behaviors of single and double NaCl particles on bare and coated Q235 carbon steel surfaces were recorded. In a high humidity atmospheric environment, the instantaneous salt-deliquesce self-coalescence phenomena provides a new type of anti-corrosion mechanism. Furthermore, the prepared superhydrophobic coating can withstand more than 30 tape-peeling cycles and 400 cm abrasion distance, demonstrating good mechanical stability in prospective real-world applications.},

Besides its advantages, challenges remain in metal AM, especially for printing complex alloys such as superalloys. These challenges are often linked to heterogeneity in the as-fabricated parts and continue to limit the practical applications of AM products. A thorough understanding of the relationship between the complex AM process and the resulting microstructure heterogeneity needs to be established before mitigation strategies can be developed. The ability to fabricate more homogeneous Ni-based superalloy parts is expected to unlock not only better mechanical properties but also additional fields of applications. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of heterogeneities in the microstructure and mechanical properties of AM Ni-based superalloys. Microstructure heterogeneities discussed include heterogeneity in the chemical composition, phase constitution, porosity, grain and dendrite morphology, and solid-state precipitates. Related heterogeneities in hardness, tensile, creep, fatigue, and residual stress are discussed to represent mechanical properties, and mitigation strategies are summarized. The origins of heterogeneity in the as-fabricated parts are linked to the variations in AM thermal conditions caused by the complex thermal histories.},

There are many ways to improve the hardness of austenitic stainless steel such as cold rolling or grain refinement. Herein, we explore the possibility of improving the hardness of AISI316-Ti stainless steel by generating an amorphous-nanocrystalline microstructure. First, we have utilized our modified melt-spinning technique to fabricate AISI316-Ti stainless steel microfibers with a fully amorphous structure. Formation of a fully amorphous structure was confirmed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal analysis revealed a glass transition temperature of 437˚C followed by a crystallization peak of 573˚C. Nanoindentation analysis showed a fourfold increase of hardness from the initial value of ≈2.5 ± 0.1 GPa the starting AISI316-Ti stainless steel rod to the hardness of ≈8.2 ± 0.5 GPa for the amorphous AISI316-Ti structure. Further step-size heat treatment on melt-spun (amorphous) stainless steel microfibers generated a microstructure compromising adjacent nanocrystalline and amorphous grains as observed by TEM. Nanoindentation analysis of those fibers has shown an even greater increase in hardness, reaching an average value of ≈14.2 ± 1.0 GPa. We believe that both the confinement of dislocation movement in the nanocrystalline grains as well as the absence of dislocations in the amorphous grains contribute to this tremendous increase of hardness in stainless steel.},

  abstract     = {Fe-XMn-5Si-10Cr-0.9C (X = 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt\%) medium entropy alloys (MEAs) with different Mn contents were prepared by magnetic suspension melting in a water-cooled copper crucible, and casted in a negative pressure suction copper mould. The modified Warren–Averbach equation and the thermodynamic model were used to calculate the alloy dislocation density and stacking faults, respectively. The effects of the Mn content on the phase structure, stacking fault energy (SFE), dislocation density, and mechanical properties of the alloy were investigated. The results indicate that the MEAs possess a low stacking fault energy (∼8.50–14.44 mJ/m 2 ) and a unique high as-cast dislocation density (up to 4.8 × 10 15 m −2 ). The microstructure of the as-cast alloys consisted of austenite phase. As loading, the γ → ε martensite transformation occurs and is accompanied by obvious work-hardening behaviour. A low SFE and high ΔS mix improved the storage capacity of the dislocation density, promoted the formation of ε-martensite, and improve the strength and plasticity. Both the SFE and ΔS mix increased with an increase in the Mn content, and the dislocation density initially increased and then decreased. Optimising the Mn content and coordinating the balance between the SFE and ΔS mix can regulate the optimal dislocation density.},

In this work, distinctive dual-stage heat treatments were proposed for improving the microstructure and properties of the laser powder bed fusion processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The effects of the heat treatments on phase transformation behaviors, microstructural characteristics, mechanical and tribological properties of the alloy were investigated systematically. The dual-stage heat treatments combined with salt bath quenching proved to be an effective approach for obtaining fine lamellar α/β microstructures through the introduction of martensitic and massive phase transformations, as well as achieving optimized strength and ductility. The grain boundary populations of the alloy were strongly influenced by the phase transformation behaviors. Moreover, high-density dislocations were introduced during the dual-stage heat treatments, and the  type dislocations were dominant. The nonadditive strengthening mixture rule between obstacles and dislocations was substantiated in this alloy. Different wear mechanisms were found in the dual-stage heat-treated alloys depending on their microstructural characteristics. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of phase transformation, strengthening and toughening are also discussed.},

However, most RHEAs have high density (&gt;10 g/cm 3 ) and exhibit limited ductility at low temperatures and softening at high temperatures. In this study, we show that oxygen-doping can be used as a new alloy design strategy for tailoring the mechanical behavior of the TiZrHfNbTa alloy: a novel low-density (7.98 g/cm 3 ) ductile RHEA . Even though the material is a single-phase BCC with some oxides at room temperature, secondary BCC and HCP nano-lamellar structures start to form above 600 °C in addition to the nano-twins which are shown to be stable up to 1000 °C. This alloy shows superior strength and compressive ductility due to the nanoengineered microstructure. The present study sheds light on tailoring the strength-ductility balance in RHEAs by controlling the microstructure of novel RHEAs at the nanoscale via oxygen-doping.},

  abstract     = {Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), including high entropy alloys, show exceptional mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. These unusual properties are mostly attributed to their particular diffusion behaviors, such as sluggish diffusion. However, this phenomenon is still controversial. Although state-of-the-art simulations report that the percolation effect plays a crucial role in triggering sluggish diffusion in binary alloys, whether this correlation could be generalized to a broad class of MPEAs is unknown. In this work, we combine machine learning (ML) with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) to accurately determine the diffusion coefficients in ternary CoCrNi MPEAs. Special care is taken to understand the effects of percolation on diffusion. We find that percolation does not always lead to sluggish diffusion. Instead, the diffusion properties are exclusively governed by the potential energy landscape (PEL) that the diffusing objects experience. By comparing the reduced systems of CoNi and FeNi, we reveal that the percolation effect on triggering the sluggish diffusion strongly depends on the diffusion properties of the slow-diffuser in these systems. These results shed light on the understanding of the complex diffusion behaviors in MPEAs, highlighting the importance of tunning species-dependent PEL in order to tailor their diffusion properties.},

Multiple fibers are often required to play different roles in the structure, making it difficult to fully exploit the advantages of auxetic materials in real-world applications. Here, a single fiber-composed textile structure that can be stretched in various directions to produce auxetic behavior was developed. The single-layer structure was successfully fabricated using a three-dimensional (3D) printing method and evaluated by finite element analysis (FEA). The tensile deformation behavior of the 3D structure was simulated, and Poisson’s ratio (PR) values of the single-layer and 3D structures were obtained. There was good agreement between the FEA and experimental results, and the proposed structure can exhibit auxetic behavior when stretched in three orthogonal directions. With tensile displacements of 4 mm in the X and Z directions, the 3D structure was able to achieve maximum negative Poisson&#39;s ratio (NPR) values of −0.26 and −0.43, respectively. In particular, the diameter ratio of the fibers in each direction is an influential factor in terms of the degree of auxetic deformation of the textile. Thus, the results of this study could inform the development of novel multi-directional auxetic textile composites.},

Firstly, the architecture of a convolutional autoencoder is designed for the compact representation of microstructural images. The designed autoencoder achieved a high image compression ratio of 32 without loss of important information. Secondly, an in-home developed model agnostic sensitivity analysis using complex step derivative approximation is implemented on convolutional autoencoders to identify regions of the microstructure that are important for reconstruction. Finally, saliency maps that highlight the importance of pixels for reconstruction are generated for three grades of dual-phase structural steels. The saliency maps indicated secondary phase regions and grain boundaries are important for microstructure image reconstruction. The proposed approach produces more tenable saliency explanations compared to guided backpropagation and layer wise relevance propagation methods. The decoder part of the convolutional autoencoder can be used as a key that could be used to reconstruct the actual microstructure from encoded image information contributing to secure and efficient sharing of microstructure data. The proposed framework is generic and can be extended to identify important microstructural regions for other metals, composites, biomaterials, and material systems.},

Here, the alloys AZ31 Mg and 6061 Al are soldered together with Sn and Sn–9Zn solders though different cooling rates via ultrasonic-assisted soldering to control IMC formation and growth. Results show that this prevents formation of Mg–Al IMCs such as Al 3 Mg 2 and Al 12 Mg 17 ; however, Mg 2 Sn forms in the soldered joints. The Mg 2 Sn thickness increases with soldering temperature, which reduces joint strength. The thickness is reduced using the Sn–9Zn solder, and the effect of Zn is analyzed. With the use of water-cooling, the Mg 2 Sn formation and growth are inhibited, the Mg 2 Sn thickness is kept below 5 μm, and the shear strength peaks at 53.2 MPa. A soldering model of Mg 2 Sn formation is proposed to reveal the evolution and inhibition mechanism of Mg 2 Sn. This study well controls IMC thickness and improves joint strength, thus expanding industrial application of Mg–Al dissimilar metals and providing a feasible method for controlling IMCs in dissimilar metal joining.},

Yet, structuring and patterning ceramics is challenging and often relies on conventional soft-lithography or molding processes that can introduce defects and cracks leading to a decrease in the device’s performance. Herein, we report on the design for the first time of SiBCN ceramic micro-components (in the 20–200 µm range) from direct patterning of “tailor-made” UV-curable boron-modified polyvinylsilazane preceramic (polyborovinylsilazane) resins. This approach first involves a two-step chemical synthesis of patternable preceramic polymers through acrylate or methacrylate grafting onto polyborovinylsilazane followed by subsequent crosslinking under UV light. FTIR and NMR spectroscopies confirmed the successful grafting of boron and photocurable units on the preceramic polymers while thermogravimetric analysis was used to monitor the polymer-to-ceramic conversion. SiBCN micro-objects obtained after pyrolysis were thoroughly characterized by SEM, AFM, nanoindentation and profilometry techniques. The Young’s modulus results for such microstructures (∼60 GPa) are characteristic of good mechanical properties making these ceramic microstructures promising materials for MEMS applications.},

Electrically conductive particles, initially dispersed in a nonpolar and weakly conductive liquid, are pulled out of the liquid using an electric field supported by capillary action. We study in detail how capillary and electric interactions, viscosity and ionic conductivity of the dispersing phase, particle shape, size and density, and pulling rate affect the general performance of our method. Our experimental results reveal that different types of microparticles can be assembled within seconds to form long chains. We found that capillary forces help aligning particles and creating single particle–resolution structures. The results show that dispersing liquids with large viscosity and low ionic conductivity are preferred as they reduce the negative effect of ionic screening. In the second part of our research, we investigate the physical properties of the produced beaded structures that we deem intriguing for both fundamental and applied research. We finally demonstrate that 1D particle structures can be used to design electrically conductive micropaths.},

However, chemical segregation influences the homogeneity of the bainitic structure, which is seminal to exploit the advantages associated with austenite reversal. It is therefore important to understand the influence of chemical segregation on bainite formation , which is investigated in this work. Characterizations were performed on the microstructures obtained from the case and core regions of a carburized steel after 30 h of bainite treatment at 320 °C for two carbon compositions: 0.85 wt\% C ( z case ) and 0.16 wt\% C ( z core ). The microstructure of z case is shown to contain bands with bainite in alloy-lean regions and martensite/austenite in alloy-rich regions. For z core , although the chemical bands are not composed of different phases, the alloy-rich regions have a fraction of martensite-austenite (MA) islands that is twice the fraction in alloy-lean regions. Despite this difference, the austenite phase fractions in the chemical bands of z core are low and almost similar, indicating that the MA islands are mostly martensite. From experimental results and thermodynamic and kinetic simulations, it is elucidated that a different rate of phase transformation in the chemical bands is the cause for the observed microstructural inhomogeneities.},

We pose a specific deep integration challenge beyond the ordinary multidisciplinary modelling/characterization research approach in this short communication with research and innovation as drivers for scientific excellence. Full integration can be achieved by developing common ontologies across different domains, enabling meaningful computational and experimental data integration and interoperability. On this basis, fine-tuning of adaptive materials modelling/characterization protocols can be achieved and facilitate computational and experimental efforts. Such interoperable and meaningful data combined with advanced data science tools (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) become a powerful asset for materials scientists to extract complex information from the large amount of data generated by last generation characterization techniques. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant collaborative actions are needed to develop common, usable, and sharable digital tools that allow for effective and efficient twinning of data and workflows across the different materials modelling and characterization domains .},

  abstract     = {Silica aerogels have a unique structure that makes them promising materials for variable applications. However, they are brittle due to weak inter-particle necks, and also expensive. Combining aerogel with fibers can not only enhance the mechanical/insulation properties, but also reduce dust release, and ease practical application. The majority of review articles in this field have been on the aerogel/textile systems&#39; application or on textile impregnation in silica sol utilizing the sol–gel technique, with a few papers also addressing the use of aerogel as filler. This review for the first time highlights all strategies to assemble silica aerogel with textile materials. For sol–gel approaches, the fibers can be impregnated in a silica precursor sol to form the aerogel in situ between the fibers, but the sol itself can also be spun into aerogel fibers. Other strategies employ pre-formed silica aerogel, mixed in polymer or solvent matrices/slurries, to form aerogel injected blankets, aerogel-filled material coated fibers, and aerogel-filled composite fibers. Aerogel particles-filled textile packages have also been proposed. The emerging activities on simulations of aerogel-fiber combinations are reviewed. The advantages/disadvantages of various approaches are evaluated, and the current market situation and an outlook for the future of the field are summarized.},

  abstract     = {Birch plywood exhibits outstanding mechanical properties with regards to tensile, compressive, and shear behaviors, making this engineered wood product promising in timber connection applications. However, the edgewise bending strength and stiffness, which are often critical for the design of gusset plates, have not been investigated thoroughly. Moreover, in engineering applications, the size and moisture content of the plywood plate are in general very different from those adopted in laboratory testing according to current standards. This paper aims to investigate the influence of face grain angle, size, and moisture content on the edgewise bending strength and stiffness of birch plywood. In total, 288 birch plywood specimens were tested in three-point bending at five different face grain angles to the beam longitudinal axis (from 0° (parallel) to 90° (perpendicular), with an angle step of 22.5°), with four different sizes (with the nominal depth of 20 mm, 30 mm, 40 mm, and 50 mm) and three different moisture contents (7.2\%, 11.9\%, and 21.8\%). Analytical and numerical models, both taking non-linear elasto-plastic compressive behaviors into account, were developed for the prediction of the ultimate moment capacity based on different failure definitions. Lastly, the relationships between the bending strength and elastic modulus were analyzed.},

The results reveal that the critical water pressure first increases and then decreases with the increase in immersion time, which is consistent with the tensile strength evolution. The tensile stress promotes the occurrence of hydraulic fracturing. Next, a critical water pressure model is proposed, in which the critical water pressure is expressed as a linear function of tensile strength and nominal tensile stress. Moreover, a theoretical formula is established to reveal the critical water pressure evolution mechanism of cement mortar exposed to sulfate attack. The evolution of critical water pressure depends on the porosity, matrix tensile strength, and expansion stress. Furthermore, a semi-empirical function is proposed to predict the critical water pressure evolution, which exhibits good accuracy. To avoid hydraulic fracturing, decreasing the porosity and tensile stress, increasing the matrix tensile strength, and releasing the expansion stress are effective strategies.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the oxidation reaction mechanism of asphalt is critical to improving its aging resistance. Here, quantum chemistry (QC) was used to study the oxidation reaction mechanism of 12 typical asphalt molecules. On this basis, the molecular models of aged asphalt were established, and the aging resistance optimization strategies of asphalt were proposed. The results show that the oxidation sites for oxygen-containing or heteroatoms-free molecules are on aromatic carbons ( I I molecules). Reducing hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals can improve its aging resistance. The oxidation sites for sulfur- or nitrogen-containing molecules are on heteroatoms ( I I II molecules). Reducing oxygen free radicals content can improve its aging resistance. The molecules containing sulfur and cata-condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (such as R5) have the strongest oxidation reactivity. Reducing its content can improve asphalt aging resistance. Combining the QC and experiment results, LH90 contains more I I molecules, while UP70 and MM70 contain more I I II molecules (especially As3 and R5). The aging resistance of UP70 and MM70 is poor than LH90. Reducing the content of As3 or R5 molecules or the content of oxygen radicals can improve the aging resistance of UP70 and MM70. These findings lay a foundation for designing and preparing asphalt with excellent aging resistance.},

The distribution of the fragment velocity from uncoupled charge structures with segmental shaped explosive were studied. Numerical calculation research was carried out based on the CEL method. The X-ray photographic images of fragmentation were obtained from explosion experiment, which provided experimental support for numerical simulation research. The results show that the fragmentation and velocity distribution of the charge structure with segmental explosive show obvious segmental characteristics compared with the traditional cylindrical shell charge. The explosive loadings of the shell under uncoupled conditions is not only determined by the detonation wave and the static pressure of the detonation products but by the impact dynamic pressure of the detonation products at low pressure and high speed and the static pressure generated by the detonation products expansion and convergence, leading to the significant difference among the coupled side, the uncoupled side and the transition area. In this paper, the fragmentation and velocity distribution of the charge with segmental explosive was obtained, the uncoupled explosive driving mechanism was investigated and verified. The conclusion provides a foundation for exploring and establishing the uncoupled explosive driving theory.},

Although numerous methods have been established for designing deterministic (periodic) or stochastic microstructures, a systematic design approach that allows the unified treatment of both deterministic and stochastic microstructure design domains has yet to be created. The proposed methodology resolves this issue by learning a unified feature space that embodies diverse structural patterns with continuously varying stochasticity levels. A highly diverse microstructure database is established to incorporate various types of deterministic and stochastic microstructure patterns. A property-aware deep generative model is proposed to learn a unified feature space of the structural characteristics, as well as the relationship between structure features and properties of interest. Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) are compared to understand their relative merits in the property-aware learning of the unified feature space. Microstructural designs with tailorable stochasticity and properties are obtained by searching the unified feature space. Multiple design cases are presented to demonstrate the capability of designing microstructures for structural stochasticity and properties. Furthermore, the proposed method is employed to create stochastically graded structures, which manipulate the mechanical behaviors by varying the local stochasticity of the structure.},

However, it is difficult to extract sufficient spatial information to describe the variation in the irregular and non-periodic solid-liquid interface domains, resulting in a challenge remaining in quantifying analysis by a quick and low-dimensionally visualized way. We proposed an interface-oriented two-point statistics method to solve the unbiassed statistics of the spatial information in these irregular and non-periodic interfaces. The challenge was successfully overcome by a carefully designed data-driven scheme, which has the advantages of easy to operate, high accuracy and efficiency. Taking the eutectic microstructure evolution simulated by phase-field method as an example, we also obtained novel insights on tailoring eutectic patterns, that is, the transformation of four patterns (lamellar elimination, regular lamellae, oscillatory eutectics and branching lamellae) depends on initial lamella spacing whether the interface energy is isotropic or anisotropic. Additionally, interfacial energy anisotropy, compared to the isotropic case, not only prolongs the time of patterns transformation, but also narrows the spacing range between elimination and creation of lamellae. Our proposed scheme is also able to be applied into more occasions about microstructure evolution in different materials systems.},

However, the instability and ease of inactivation of growth factors under certain physiological conditions limits their effectiveness. In the present study, a bifunctional laponite (LAP) with potent ability to induce both osteogenesis and angiogenesis was incorporated into poly(lactide-coglycolide)/β-tricalcium phosphate (PLGA/β-TCP) composite to form a porous scaffold through micro extrusion-based cryogenic three-dimensional printing. The hierarchically porous PLGA/β-TCP/LAP composite scaffold exhibited favorable initial mechanical strength and displayed a promoted effect towards cell adhesion of rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells. Enhanced in vitro angiogenesis and osteogenesis were simultaneously achieved due to the proangiogenic and osteoinductive ions released from LAP. Furthermore, the PLGA/β-TCP/LAP scaffold promoted the generation of type H vessel and bony regeneration in vivo. Overall, the impartment of inorganic LAP into 3D printed PLGA/β-TCP scaffold provides a simple and efficient way to realize the treatment of critical-sized bone defects via improved angiogenesis and osteogenesis.},

Considering the tumor cell-killing ability and poor bioavailability of PA in vivo , Prussian blue nanoparticles with dopamine surface modification were applied to enhance its therapeutic efficacy against breast cancer by combining with photodynamic agent of indocyanine green. The hybrid-cell membrane (microphage and erythrocyte membranes) camouflage of the nano-delivery system significantly improved the solubility and targeting ability to tumor regions with increased immune evasion. This Prussian blue nanoparticle-based biomimetic formulation, introduced via tail vein administration, was validated as an efficient PA delivery vehicle for inhibiting the growth of breast cancer xenografts in nude mice.

Porphyrin MOFs (PCN) were selected as a nano-photosensitizer and then an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor l -arginine ( l -Arg) was loaded into the framework to obtain PA nanoplatforms; Subsequently, glucose oxidase (GOx) was coated on the surface through the interactions between protein and polyphenol and the purified murine breast cancer cell membrane was further decorated to form the resulting nanoplatforms mPAGT NPs. The prepared nanoplatforms exhibited an excellent drug loading capability (9.59\% for l -Arg and 33.75\% for GOx) and homologous targeting ability. Meanwhile, the mPAGT NPs could initiated a cascade reaction included GOx catalyzed oxidation of glucose, nano-photosensitizer based 1 O 2 -producing, and ROS-mediated the release of NO, and induce an obvious apoptosis with the highest apoptotic ratio of 86.2\%. Moreover, the in vivo experimental results further confirmed that our multifunctional nanoplatforms possessed negligible systemic toxicity and promising potential for the treatment of tumor through the catalytic cascades-enhanced synergistic therapy.},

  abstract     = {Zirconia (ZrO 2 ) is widely used in the dental implant industry, due to its good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However, the bioinert nature of ZrO 2 may hinder osseointegration. This study investigated the responses of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to sandblasted ZrO 2 surfaces immobilized with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) using the natural crosslinker genipin. The immobilization of BMP on sandblasted ZrO 2 surfaces increased the surface roughness but did not alter the wettability. The focal adhesion activation and later-stage mineralization of hMSCs were higher on BMP-2-modified ZrO 2 surfaces than on untreated surfaces. The BMP-2-modified ZrO 2 surfaces with low (100 ng/mL) and high (500 ng/mL) concentrations showed no significant difference in later-stage osteogenic response. However, ZrO 2 surfaces with low BMP-2 concentration earlier stimulated the p38 (mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway) protein expression, osteogenic early marker osteopontin expression, and later-stage mineralization. This simple but effective process to immobilize BMP-2 on rough ZrO 2 surfaces can benefit future dental implant applications.},

The present simulations well predict the interface instability of the 5-layered polycrystalline Cu-Nb composites arising from the onset and aggregation of the non-crystallographic bandlike concentrated strain. Meanwhile, by changing the grain orientation, the suppression or promotion of plastic shear localization can be realized, where the occurrence of interface instability depends not only on inhomogeneous stress fields, i.e., a single thermodynamic factor, but also on an implicit kinetic factor, i.e., misorientation. On this basis, a so-called artificial “coding” strategy by translating orientation-inhibited strain localization into implicit thermodynamic and kinetic information is presented to tailor the Cu-Nb MMCs, i.e., triggering as much plastic slip as possible from a thermodynamic perspective, while narrowing the misorientation as much as possible from a kinetic selection.},

However, the study of the effect of SRO on Al 0.3 CoCrFeNi properties is insufficient. In this paper, the effect of SRO on the mechanical properties of Al 0.3 CoCrFeNi was investigated by molecular dynamics (MD). Melting/quenching and hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/MD optimization were used to order the random distribution model. The effects of SRO on tensile and shear properties, stacking fault energy (SFE) and dislocation slip were comparatively analyzed and systematically discussed. The results show that the SRO inhibited the propagation of SFs and enhanced dislocation storage capacity. The ordering of the single crystals promoted the formation of deformation twins. The ordering of the polycrystals leads to martensite, BCC phase transformation, and activation of the sub-slip planes. SRO resulted in more severe SFE fluctuation, a more tortuous dislocation path, and a stronger pinning effect. The strength and toughness enhancement resulted from plane slip, multi-system slip, deformation twins, and nanoscale precipitates.},

However, in many applications, it is often more appropriate to impose constraints on other physical quantities of interest. In this paper, we consider such generalized microstructural optimization problems where any of the microstructural quantities, namely, bulk, shear, Poisson ratio, or volume, can serve as the objective, while the remaining can serve as constraints. In particular, we propose here a neural-network (NN) framework to solve such problems. The framework relies on the classic density formulation of microstructural optimization, but the density field is represented through the NN’s weights and biases. The main characteristics of the proposed NN framework are: (1) it supports automatic differentiation, eliminating the need for manual sensitivity derivations, (2) smoothing filters are not required due to implicit filtering, (3) the framework can be easily extended to multiple-materials, and (4) a high-resolution microstructural topology can be recovered through a simple post-processing step. The framework is illustrated through a variety of microstructural optimization problems.},

In this work, the coherent precipitation strengthening of L1 2 phase and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) - Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) type martensitic transformation are combined in a single alloy. With the synergistic effect of both sides, the yield strength of aged Co 52 Cr 30 Ni 12 Al 3 Ti 3 alloy is increased from 437 MPa (annealed alloy with TRIP effect only) to 715 MPa, while retaining a uniform elongation of more than 50\% at room temperature. Further research shows that whether L1 2 phase exist will directly affect its deformation mode. In the tensile process of aged Co 52 Cr 30 Ni 12 Al 3 Ti 3 alloy, the deformation mode of grains without L1 2 phase will change from previous stacking fault-predominant deformation to the final transformation-induced plasticity. For the regions where L1 2 phase exists, martensitic transformation is difficult to occur due to the blocking effect of L1 2 on stacking fault.},

However, its limitations including a high threshold for high-precision preparation and poor surface roughness in metalworking impede further development, such as metallic pentamode metamaterials (PMs) due to the special structural regimes and extremely strict size requirement at the intersection nodes. Herein, a novel electropolishing-enhanced 3D printing method is proposed to fabricate high-precision metallic PMs with improved precision and surface smoothness. Experimental results evince that this hybrid additive-subtractive method can fabricate PMs with much smaller critical size and smoother surface, which cannot be achieved by the same-level 3D printing methods. The minimum processable size can reach ∼ 100 μm that greatly breaks through the limitation of initial additive manufacturing (EOS M280 SLM, ∼ 200 ± 50 μm). A ∼ 100 μm intersection can support 10 7 times its own weight. Moreover, the D / d of elementary biconical rods can be refined from an initial 6 to an astounding 52, which is beyond the scope of conventional 3D printing. This proposed hybrid additive-subtractive method, namely electropolishing-enhanced 3D printing, breaks the limits of conventional 3D printing by significantly improving the precision and shows great potential in low-cost but high-precision manufacturing.},

In this paper, a method of combining process, structure and performance was proposed to control the forming quality, and the brake disc for high-speed railways was chosen as a validation example. Meanwhile, multi-laser selective laser melting (ML-SLM) was adopted to prepare large-sized products. Research mainly includes process parameters optimization, mechanical properties distribution, and structural design. Process parameters of 24CrNiMo were optimized by exploring the influence of laser power and scanning speed on porosity, pore characteristics, and forming efficiency. Results show excessive heat input could reduce forming quality, causing an increase in either porosity or pore size. Mechanical properties research reveals that 24CrNiMo parts fabricated by ML-SLM have good consistency and overcome the strength-toughness tradeoff. The ultimate tensile strength reached 1255.25 MPa and impact energy was 101 J for single-laser regions. Furthermore, the new brake disc was redesigned with an innovative hollow self-supporting heat rib structure to enable a lightweight design and simplify post-processing. Finally, the qualified product was produced, and bench tests showed SLM-disc had higher performance. The work shows this method is effective and provides an engineering example for large-sized parts fabricated by ML-SLM.},

The manufacture of bionic porogen was structurally inspired by the Chinese traditional food Matuan, which is a glutinous rice ball stuck with sesames. Spherical-shaped NaCl@HA microspheres with a uniform size facilitated the generation of an interconnected porous PEEK@HA scaffold with a HA coating layer on the pore surface. And the mechanical properties of PEEK@HA scaffolds were not affected by the coating layer of HA compared with PEEK porous scaffolds. After immersing in simulated body fluid and transplanting in rat proximal tibia, the PEEK@HA porous implants possessed superior in vitro biomineralization and in vivo osseointegration due to the favorable environment of the HA layer for bone ingrowth. This facile manufacturing strategy provides a unique perspective to integratedly fabricate bionic porous PEEK scaffolds with a mineralized coating layer enhancing the osseointegration of PEEK materials with bony tissue interfaces in orthopedics and stomatology. It also presents a general platform for further creating multifunctional porous PEEK implants, such as antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and photothermal therapy, by coating various inorganic nanoparticles with desired characteristics on the pore wall surface.},

Here, gas tungsten arc welding was performed for the first time on an as-cast AlCoCrFeNi 2.1 alloy. The microstructural evolution of the welded joints was assessed by combining electron microscopy with electron backscatter diffraction, synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis and thermodynamic calculations. Microhardness mapping and tensile testing coupled with digital image correlation were used to investigate the strength distribution across the joint. The base material, heat affected zone and fusion zone are composed of an FCC + B2 BCC eutectic structure, although the relative volume fractions vary across the joint owing to the weld thermal cycle. The BCC nanoprecipitates that existed in the base material started to dissolve into the matrix in the heat affected zone and closer to the fusion zone boundary. Compared to the as-cast base material, the fusion zone evidenced grain refinement owing to the higher cooling rate experienced during solidification. This translates into an increased hardness in this region. The joints exhibit good strength/ductility balance with failure occurring in the base material. This work establishes the potential for using arc-based welding for joining eutectic high entropy alloys.},

As a combination of dissimilar materials to be co-processed, CuCrZr and nickel are of particular scientific and technological interest. For the processing of complex 3D multi-material geometries made of highly dissimilar materials, the sintering behavior of each individual material should however be as identical as possible. Since both materials have different physical and mechanical properties, the sintering behavior of the two individual powder materials is first characterized at different uniaxial pressures, heating rates and holding times. A strategy to determine optimal sintering conditions for the processing of multi-material structures is then developed, based on representation of the densification data of each material in the form of master sintering curves (MSC) and surfaces (MSS). From the MSS, an optimal uniaxial pressure of 35 MPa was determined and the holding time to achieve dense multi-material structures at a temperature of 1223 K was estimated. Different configurations of CuCrZr-Ni multi-material samples were successfully sintered using these parameters and microscopic analyses showed that the relative density in these parts is &gt;99.8, in both CuCrZr and Ni.},

  abstract     = {The development of next-generation electrodes is key for advancing performance parameters of lithium-ion batteries and achieving the target of net-zero emissions in the near future. Electrode architecture and design can greatly affect electrode properties and the effects are sometimes complicated. The architecture of current electrodes is designed mainly based on empirical studies by making trade-offs between battery performance parameters. Thus, a holistic understanding of the relationships between electrode architecture-property-performance is urgently needed. Additionally, the implementation of next-generation electrodes with optimised architectures also relies on manufacturing capability. Various manufacturing processes have been proposed to produce electrodes with characteristic architectures. Nevertheless, the merits and limitations of the manufacturing processes are not well understood and selecting appropriate manufacturing processes is challenging. Herein, ten manufacturing processes are illustrated, which have been classified into four categories of slurry casting, templating, additive manufacturing, laser ablation. The overall performance of all the manufacturing processes is first qualitatively compared from five different aspects of architectural controllability, scalability, sustainability, simplicity and cost, followed by a quantitative comparison using a Weighted Manufacturing Score method. This work provides a guideline for future electrode architectural design illustrating the limitations and potential advantages of different methodologies to stimulate the development of the next-generation LIB electrodes.},

However, the weak interaction between fibers limits the performance of the fabrics, and researchers are still seeking a suitable solution and easily scalable production methods. Here a green and novel wet-assembly approach is proposed for producing non-woven MXene fiber fabrics (MFFs) constructed by random-oriented and well-connected interfused MXene fibers. The as-prepared fabrics are porous and lightweight while exhibiting high electrical conductivity (708 S cm −1 ). A maximum specific electrical conductivity is achieved with a relatively low density (0.24 g cm −3 ), even superior to individual MXene fibers. Moreover, the MFFs exhibit outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of 75.0 dB at a thickness of 107 μm, exceptional Joule heating (up to 370 °C at a voltage of 3.5 V), and excellent photothermal conversion abilities, showing their great potential as high-performance and multifunctional fabrics in EMI shielding, wearable intelligent garments, and personal heating applications.},

Herein, we present interpenetrating phase composites (IPC), based on the combination of additively manufactured alumina microlattices and infiltrated epoxy, that display an excellent combination of such characteristics. Experimental and simulation studies on the compressive behaviours of different truss-microlattices and their functionally-graded variants have been carried out. Lengthened stress plateau up to −0.6 strain and co-enhanced strength up to 65\% higher than the linear sum of their constituents have been observed. This constitutes a simultaneous high specific strength and specific energy absorption up to 113.5–142.6 MPa/(g/cm 3 ) and 25.3–35.6 J/g, respectively, for the IPCs, at low densities of around 1.8 g/cm 3 . The mechanism of the co-enhanced strength attribute to the improved alumina fracture toughness whilst the lengthened plateau attributes to the progressive material failure and strain energy relaxation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of using a strong ceramic and epoxy to achieve simultaneously high specific strength and energy absorption.},

The mechanical behavior of these structures was studied under quasi-static and high strain rate compression.

Stress–strain curves were obtained and the effect of phase composition, microstructure, and strain rate was analyzed and discussed. Current results were compared with previous studies conducted on homogeneous MMCs and Ti64 alloy tested in similar conditions. The deformation mechanism evaluated from the microstructure analysis of the samples was verified using in-situ high-speed camera recordings. Numerical simulation based on Finite Element Analysis was conducted to further investigate the behavior of the samples during the SHPB trials.

Therefore, it is essential to develop bonding technology to realize highly thermally conductive and reliable high-temperature joints. In this study, we propose a novel anisotropic microcomposite (AMC) joint that integrates a lotus-type porous Cu (LPC) sheet and Sn-based solder for high-temperature electronic applications. The AMC joint was successfully fabricated by infiltrating the molten solder into the unidirectional pores of the LPC sheet during a simple reflow process. Steady-state thermal conductivity measurements for a uniquely designed specimen revealed its equivalent thermal conductivity (142.4 W/m·K), 2.5 times higher than the solder. Finite element simulations supported its excellent thermal performance by investigating the heat flux distribution and thermal conductivity prediction that utilize a three-dimensional image-based constructed model. In addition, the aging test at 200 °C for 1008 h clarified a stable shear strength of over 46 MPa. This indicates a reliable mechanical performance at 200 °C, which is only 20 °C below the melting point of the solder. These experimental and numerical studies proved the potential of the novel joint as a high-temperature electronics joint and offered possible mechanisms for its thermal and mechanical property enhancement.},

In order to investigate the effect of the infill density on the performance of a 3D-printed compliant finger, this study performs experimental and numerical investigations in order to develop empirical equations for estimating the output force, the output displacement, and the input force corresponding to given values of the input displacement and infill density of the compliant finger. A commercially available thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) filament, Filastic™, manufactured by BotFeeder is used in this study. Prototypes of four compliant fingers with infill densities of 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% are produced. A two-fingered gripper is also developed and the relationship between the infill density and the maximum payload is investigated. In addition, a finite element model taking into consideration the hyperelasticity of the TPE is developed to analyze the behavior of compliant fingers with different infill densities. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimental data and with the curves for the empirical equations.},

However, deciphering the pores evolution mechanisms is exceedingly challenging and heretofore this problem has yet been unequivocally understood. To address it, 3D X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is herein employed to perform this investigation. It is found that three types of pores encompassing branch-like pores (type Ⅰ), flat pores (type Ⅱ), and snatchy spherical pores (type III) form in the green compacts after the cold isostatic pressing, which is fundamentally governed by the irregularity of powder profiles. During sintering, type I pores are first to be decomposed at the junctions where pores branch triggered by stress concentration and subsequently undergo splitting and spheroidizing, till converting to (near) spherical pores. Type II and III pores are basically showing analogical behavior excluding the branch break-up step. Moreover, pores orientation distribution is turned out to be temperature independent, nevertheless, pores connectivity and localized porosity are closely related to the sintering temperature. Besides, a spot of pores is inspected inside partial large-sized master alloy powder particles, i.e., at 1200 °C, which possibly originates from the Kirkendall’s effect between the alloying elements and the Ti matrix.},

To overcome this limitation, we ice-templated hydrogels with high concentrations of CNFs and CNCs by using a specific setup that enabled their unidirectional solidification. The microstructure and the mechanical properties of the freeze-dried foams were investigated using SEM, X-Ray nanotomography and compression tests, respectively. Increasing the content of nanofibers yielded to drastic shifts of (i) the foam microstructures from highly anisotropic (columnar with CNFs, lamellar with CNCs) to more isotropic ones (ii) the mechanical properties towards isotropy together with a significant increase of the foam stiffness, yield stress and absorbed energy. In addition, due to the high aspect ratio of the CNFs, CNF foams with elevated relative densities exhibit noteworthy specific mechanical properties.},

Subsequently, wave propagation within the EMM is analyzed using the wave finite element method via dispersion curves , which suggest that the EMMs fabricated using molded pulp can attenuate wave propagation in wide frequency ranges by combining the effects of geometrical periodicity (i.e., band gap) and the material damping of the molded pulp. Further, the effects of geometrical parameters on band gaps are investigated; the results indicate that the proposed EMMs can open up band gaps in frequency ranges lower than 1000 Hz for thin plates used in engineering products. Finally, the frequency response functions of the EMMs are experimentally measured; the results confirm that EMMs can suppress vibrations in wide frequency ranges corresponding to the wave attenuation obtained by the dispersion analysis.},

  abstract     = {A number of designs have been used in the field of tissue engineering for the purposes of bone biomimicry (e.g.) triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), honeycomb lattice, and face centered cubic (FCC). While the usage of these structures was met with some success, the results were not optimal due to factors such as lack of localized porosity control and stress concentration at nodes of gradient scaffolds. This led to a push for novel designs, such as, stochastic scaffolds with locally tunable porosity as well as anisotropically varying mechanical properties. A number of methods exist for generating these stochastic structures, such as, random set method, stochastic optimization method, iterative non-linear transformative method and others, but while these techniques led to a greater approximation of the bone microstructure, they did not help in the creation of a structure with controlled modulus along different directions. The novelty of the method used in this paper is that it not only helps in generating stochastic structures in a computationally inexpensive and non-complex way, but also generates a porosity gradient along three different axes in a controlled manner. Various additive manufacturing techniques have been successfully utilized for fabricating these structures at different scales, using different materials, thus, proving their versatility. The proposed design approach was implemented in the case of a 3D reconstructed rabbit model. Magics software was used to extract the internal microstructure of the rabbit model and our design approach was used for generating a stochastic scaffold which accurately mimicked the porosity gradient of the rabbit model in all the three directions. On comparing the mechanical properties of the rabbit microstructure and the gradient mimicking scaffold, the variations were significant as the properties depend not only on the porosity gradient but also on the internal microstructure, which warrants further multi-property optimization.},

Recently, it arouses increasing interest of researchers in both basic research, material design and clinical transformation area, because of its potential pharmacological activities. More importantly, BSP as promising biomaterials exhibits distinct physicochemical properties (e.g. solubility, viscosity, film-forming ability), biocompatibility, biodegradability and structural modifiability. Unmodified BSP is usually made into hydrogels, sponges, microneedles, films and lyophilized wafers alone or composed with other materials, whereas chemical modified BSP is mainly prepared into micelles, microspheres, nanoparticles, nanofibers and biological scaffolds. The diverse BSP-based biomaterials can be broadly used in wound healing, targeted drug delivery, and tissue engineering, having great research and application values in material science and biomedical engineering. Herein, the research is started with the preparation, characterization and structure properties of BSP. With perspectives for their potential applications, BSP-based biomaterials before and after modification are summarized and emphasized. Besides, the current challenges and future perspectives of BSP-based biomaterials are also highlighted.

The PFix leads were tested to reassure the implantation feasibility before implantation via standard surgery operation procedure. Then the leads were implanted into dog’s endocardium. The animal study showed the degradable tines could accomplish fixation stability and were with less manual extraction forces comparing with traditional silicon fixation tines in 7-month’s observation time. Tines made of PLGA25-PLCL75 blends were almost degraded totally only few remnants observed under microscope comparing with intact silicon materials at the tine-myocardial interfaces.

  abstract     = {Nanocarriers have been recognized as an effective strategy for developing novel boron-containing delivery agents for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) of refractory tumors. Herein, a chitosan-lactobionic acid-thioctic acid-modified hollow mesoporous silica composite loaded with carborane was prepared to achieve effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma by BNCT. Notably, the composite remained stable under physiological conditions and exhibited high selective uptake in liver cancer cells. In the tumor microenvironment, the composite could effectively release carborane into the tumor tissue under the dual stimulation of pH and redox. The composite showed excellent efficacy in BNCT treatment of liver cancer cells. Meanwhile, the composite could exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects to reduce the toxic side effects during BNCT. In tumor-bearing mice, the composite could accumulate in tumor tissue with high selectivity. In addition, the composite could be effectively cleared from the normal tissues and could overcome the inflammatory response generated in vivo by the materials in biological applications. Overall, the composite is a promising boron-containing delivery agent in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma by BNCT, and can facilitate the biological applications of the silica-like materials in BNCT.},

  abstract     = {An artificial graft inserted in the vascular system can cause thrombosis, which may lead to catastrophic consequences. New intelligent vascular prosthetics that can recognize the presence of clots are urgently needed. For this purpose, a novel biocompatible piezocomposite is designed for self-monitoring smart vascular grafts. The new insight of this work involves the fabrication of a composite with low filler content (5\%v) and high piezoelectric sensitivity ( g 33 ∼ 130 mV m N −1 ) suitable for biosensors. The composite is produced by structuring fibers (NaNbO 3 fibers ) in elastomeric matrix via dielectrophoresis. The matrix with low elastic modulus offers great stretchability to prevent graft performance deterioration. Numerical simulation together with experimental characterizations confirm the improvements in terms of electric field distribution, dielectric and piezoelectric properties. The new composite, integrated on a graft and placed into a motorized cardiovascular simulator performs successfully online monitoring of the blood pressure, identifying anomalies related to a thrombus. The composite coupled with an inductive coil forms a resonant sensor, whose resonance frequency shifts when an occlusion develops. In the future, this system could be implemented using radio frequency identification tags (RFID-tag) to wirelessly supervise the condition of the graft, paving the way to a next generation of self-monitoring grafts.},

  abstract     = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer (HNC). Conventional treatment of HNSCC involves surgical removal, together with or without chemoradiotherapy. Because of the special location of head and neck tumors, trauma of surgical intervention often impairs physiological functions and causes disfigurement, seriously affecting the quality of life of HNSCC patients. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to cause cancer cell death by inducing apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis and ferroptosis. Based on this, some non-invasive nanotherapeutics have aroused considerable attention, which could promote the generation of ROS with or without external stimuli, damaging biological macromolecules to kill cancer cells. Herein, the authors present the mechanisms of ROS-based cancer therapy and summarize different nanotherapeutics against HNSCC, including photodynamic therapy (PDT), sonodynamic therapy (SDT), radiation therapy (RT), and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Furthermore, ROS-sensitive drug release nanosystems and some synergistic therapeutic modalities for HNSCC are reviewed. Finally, challenges and future perspectives of these treatments are also discussed for further research directions, which can facilitate the development of ROS-based nanotherapeutics for clinical application.},

However, current designed DNN architectures are not specifically tailored for grid composites and thus show weak generalizability in exploring unseen configurations that stem away from the training datasets. Here, a multiscale kernel neural network (MNet) is proposed that can efficiently predict the strain field within a grid composite subject to an external loading. Predicting the strain field of a composite is especially important when it comes to understanding how the material will behave under loading. MNet enables accurate predictions of the strain field for completely new configurations in unseen domain, with a reduced mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 50\% compared to a benchmark, U-Net as current state-of-the arts DNN architectures. In addition, results showed that MNet maintained superb performances with less than one-third of dataset, and can be applied to grid composites larger than the composite configurations used for the initial training. By investigating the inference mechanisms from the kernels of multiple sizes, our work revealed that the MNet can efficiently extract various spatial correlations from the material distribution.},

The rapid cooling rate favors the precipitation of the secondary α s . And the low cooling rate is conducive to the epitaxial growth of the primary α p . One key finding is that once the grain boundary (α GB ) nucleated on the α p could grow forward without maintaining the Burgers orientation relationship (BOR) with adjacent β grains. What’s more, HADDF and Fourier-filtered HRTEM images elucidated that two adjacent α p particles share a common plane but not the same atomic arrangement direction in crystal spatial. Three precipitation types of the α s were discussed through EBSD and 3D spatial crystalline orientation. Specifically, the α s shares common {1 1 2 ¯ 2¯ 0} plane with the α p grains respectively in Type-I and Type-II, but displaying different c axis angle (60° in Type-I and 80° in Type-II). For the Type-III, the secondary α s shares common {1 0 1 ¯ 1¯ 0} plane with the primary α p , and the angle of c axis between them is 60°. Moreover, the primary α p do not maintain the BOR with the pre-existing β, except for Type-I.},

One notable example is the layered architecture of nacre , which possesses toughness an order of magnitude higher than its constituent parts. Man-made nacre-like ceramic/polymer composites obtained through direct infiltration of polymer in ceramic scaffolds have been shown to produce improved mechanical properties over other composite architectures. Replacing the polymer phase with metal could provide higher damage tolerance but the infiltration of metal into complex ceramic scaffolds is difficult due to the surface tension of molten metal. To address this, bioinspired nacre-like micro-layered (µL) alumina scaffolds with different ceramic fractions from 18 to 85\% were infiltrated with aluminium alloy 5083 via pressureless and squeeze casting infiltrations techniques. The scaffolds were created using a bi-directional freeze-casting and one-step densification method. As a result, the µL alumina/aluminium composites displayed significant extrinsic toughening mechanisms with both high strength and toughness. The mechanical performance was highly dependent on the interface, microstructure, and composition. The nacre-like composites with 18\% alumina and AlN interface displayed a maximum resistance‐curve toughness up to around 70 MPa.m ½ (35 MPa.m ½ at the ASTM limit) and a flexural strength around 600 MPa.},

Herein, we present a facile approach to rapidly fabricate sintered liquid metal submicron particles (LMSPs) films in combination spray-coating with direct nanosecond ultraviolet (UV) laser sintering. High conductive, μm-thick sintered LMSPs films were prepared owing to the self-limited penetration depth of UV laser, and their sheet resistances are easily tuned at least seven orders of magnitude by the laser processing parameters. A calculated parametric map upon particle diameter and laser fluence whether or not a liquid metal particle is ruptured has been obtained and it is quite well in accordance to the experiment results. Such laser-sintered LMSPs films are finally utilized to fabricate shielding films with superior EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of ∼33 dB and specific EMI SE over thickness (SSE/t) of ∼27500 dB•cm 2 •g −1 , and flexible electromagnetic metamaterials with a high absorption above 99.9\% at resonance frequency of 12.9 GHz and 14.3 GHz, showing their high potential for flexible EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave absorption applications.},

Here, a new solution is proposed for mass-producing an ultra-thin multilayer clad steel sheet using an additive manufacturing process without changing the superior mechanical property of the high-Mn steel. Functionally graded multilayers from high-Mn steel to high-strength low-alloy steel have been deposited onto a high-Mn steel slab by a powder-fed type additive manufacturing process to improve its surface properties. During the deposition at high laser intensities, solidification cracks appeared in the first and second layers.

  abstract     = {Constitutive modeling of sheet metals under plane strain state is important but challenging. Recent studies report that the yield strength and plastic strain rate of sheet metals in the plane strain mode exhibit strong anisotropy. To address the plane strain anisotropy, fourth-order polynomial functions (Poly4) of the stress tensor were applied to the yield stress and plastic potential functions under the non-associated flow rule (NAFR-Poly4). The yield stresses under near-plane strain (NPS) measured along three angles from the sheet rolling direction were used for an analytical determination of the parameters of the yield stress function and the commonly applied yield stresses under uniaxial tension (UT) and equi-biaxial tension (EBT). In addition, the plastic strain rates under UT, NPS, and EBT were used to determine the parameters of the polynomial plastic potential. Compared with experimental results under a wide range of loading conditions, the proposed NAFR-Poly4 model predicts the anisotropic NPS deformation of a dual-phase steel and an aluminum alloy with remarkably improved accuracy over the other existing models. The NPS yield stresses of the dual-phase steel are accurately predicted with a reduced average plastic flow deviation of 2.8° by NAFR-Poly4 compared to 7.1° by the Yld2k-2d model under AFR.},

In this study, an impact ignition experiment is designed using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar to quantitate the continuum deformation and reaction responses of a high-ductility CEM sample undergone periodic impact loading pulses. The relation between macroscopic shear deformation rate and localized viscous shear flow heating, melting, and reaction is further investigated utilizing a macro-mesoscopic thermomechanical model. The results show that CEM sample is severely crushed to 2\% of the original thickness and laterally extruded with a high shear rate (∼10 5 s −1 ). High shear deformation rate contributes to the localized viscous shear flow heating, thereby inducing temperature rise spike (∼200 K) and following ignition. Ignition of CEM sample occurs in the third compression pulse because the thinner sample exhibits a high velocity gradient, which causes a high viscous shear flow heating rate.},

Mechanical performance, extrusion window, and shape stability of several AAM formulations containing various dosages (0.5 wt\% to 5 wt\%) of the NH and CH additives were evaluated. The best-performing mixtures in terms of fresh and hardened properties namely, NH-1.5 and CH-1.5 mixtures (containing 1.5 wt\% of NH and CH additives, respectively) were then selected for 3D printing. The results showed that the CH-1.5 mixture exhibited enhanced shape stability, buildability, and mechanical properties as compared to the control mixture. The flexural and compressive strengths of 3D printed CH-1.5 samples were 88\% and 40\%, respectively higher than those of the printed control samples. Using the CH-1.5 mixture, a twisted column with an intricate shape was printed to verify the suitability of the developed CH-modified AAM for the construction of complex structures.

  abstract     = {Dislocation is the primary carrier for accommodating plastic deformation in metals. It is generally envisaged that metals with low initial dislocation density have high strain-to-failure and good formability, and vice versa . However, contrary to most metals, body-centered-cubic pure tungsten becomes brittle after reducing its dislocation density by recrystallization, while its formability increases after heavy deformation. To elucidate the mechanism of this counterintuitive mechanical behavior, by combining ex-situ indentation tests and dislocation reconstruction techniques, we find that tungsten’s deformation and failure processes are accompanied by the formation of a specific dislocation pattern. Dislocation networks are governed by a mechanism similar to the weaving process of the spider’s orb web. After heavy deformation, subgrains are generated due to the weaving process. The recurring weaving of dislocations reduces the mean free path for crack propagation, which is considered as the main reason for the increased formability of tungsten after deformation.},

With the brazing temperature increased from 850 °C to 1000 °C, the phenomenon of “infiltration induced separation of adjacent W grains” was intensively expanded, which was addressed in view of the Marangoni convection effect, atom diffusion, internal reaction, and grain boundary wetting. The maximum shear strength of the joint brazed at 925 °C for 20 min reached 366.6 MPa. This first detailed study on wettability, interfacial microstructures, and joining mechanism of WHAs brazed joints can benefit an in-depth understanding in joining process of WHAs, which can also provide guidance for joining of sintered dual/multi-phase refractory composites.},

After screening numerous compositions, Fe-13.2Cr-9.1Ni-1.1Al-0.6Mo-0.5Nb-0.23Ti-0.5Mn-0.5Si (wt.\%) was selected. This composition showed excellent printability with low porosity levels. The precipitation strengthening response was evaluated by aging at 500 °C for 15 min, 3 h and 18 h, measuring hardness, tensile strength, and by characterization using atom probe tomography. After 15 min of aging, 90\% of the maximum hardness was reached, thanks to formation of (Ni, Al, Nb, Ti, Mn, Si) clusters with a density of 1.5 × 10 24 m - 3 . Between 15 min and 3 h, distinct precipitates formed with a radius of ∼1.4 nm. The precipitates underwent a splitting phenomenon after 18 h, forming several unique Ni-rich precipitates including Ni 16 Si 7 (Ti, Nb) 6 and Ni 3 (Al, Ti, Nb, Si). The splitting can be a reason for the slow coarsening rate, as the average precipitate radius after 18 h was only 2 nm. Simulations of the precipitation sequence using PRISMA indicated very rapid and dense precipitation of L1 2 -Ni 3 X precipitates with a slow coarsening rate, in agreement with experimental observations.},

In this paper, the microstructure evolution and plastic deformation mechanism of as-rolled rare earth (Mg-8Gd-4Y-Zn) and rare earth-free (AZ31) magnesium alloy sheets during room temperature deformation were investigated by in-situ tensile EBSD observations. The results show that the tensile twin in AZ31 alloys exhibits various evolutionary behaviors to adapt to crystal deformation, however, the twin boundaries in Mg-RE alloys cannot move during deformation due to the pinning effect of the precipitates. In addition, the slip between adjacent grains in Mg-RE alloys is difficult to transmit and multiple penetrating slips are prone to occur in the same grain, resulting in the generation of ledges. In AZ31 alloys, the slip variants between adjacent grains are strain compatible, and in addition to the contribution of twinning to coordinated plastic deformation, twinning stimulates the generation of slip to coordinate deformation. Cracks in AZ31 alloys tend to occur around grains with severe dislocation accumulation due to twinning and a few adjacent grains with incompatible strains, and crack in Mg-RE alloys are easily generate at the strain incompatibility between grains with multiple penetration slips and adjacent grains.},

Nevertheless, a potential reinforcement mechanism at the atomic level urgently needs to be revealed. In the present work, through the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the friction and wear behavior of Gr coating reinforced HEA matrix composite on the basis of various normal loads and the number of Gr layers during scratching were analyzed. The coating effect of Gr was demonstrated to induce a substantial enhancement of anti-friction and wear resistance of HEAs matrix. Specifically, the narrowed distribution range of atomic forces combined with the counteraction between local pinning force and actuation force significantly weakened the friction. Meanwhile, the Gr coating-dependent inhibition of the pile-up effect was verified to substantially enhance the wear resistance. Especially, the increased Gr layers were validated to further reduce the friction and wear damage, attributing to the interlayer repulsion effect. Additionally, the experimentally detected reduction in scratch depth and inhibition of bulge behavior effectively supported our simulation findings. The analysis provides a theoretical insight to achieve superior surface performance and facilitates to prolong the service life of friction pairs.},

  abstract     = {Optically transparent ceramics were traditionally only viable using optically isotropic materials and limited birefringent materials with small Δ n Δn such as alumina ( Δ n ≈ 0.008 Δn≈0.008 ). Thus heavily birefringent materials such as AlN ( Δ n ≈ 0.045 Δn≈0.045 ), polycrystalline ceramics are usually not considered for optical applications due to their high scattering loss, despite its exceptionally appealing thermal conductivity, mechanical stiffness/toughness and relatively low density—attributes that are ideal for light weight optical windows for harsh environments. To further improve the transparency over coarse grain AlN ceramics that have been reported, subwavelength grain size is desired. Here we present significant improvements in visible, NIR and mid-IR transparency in AlN ceramics by reducing the average grain size to 230 nm. A newly developed, non-carbon thermal reduction for producing clean powders at low temperatures is key to the success. The nanocrystalline AlN ceramics reach full density at a densification temperature as low as 1500 °C and showed an in-line transparency of over 55\% at 2.5 μ m μm and over 70\% in the mid-IR which is the highest transparency in AlN ceramics reported. The successful demonstration of transparent nanocrystalline AlN ceramics makes it the ideal choice for optical windows in quickly fluctuating temperature environments where weight is a consideration such as air and space vehicles.},

The exploration of their full design-space is hampered in practice by a lack of a systematic method to represent their topologies. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that graph models provide an effective representation of shell-lattices. This new graph representation is then leveraged to obtain deep learning-based structure–property models. Using finite element simulations, the stiffness and heat conductivity tensors are established for more than 40,000 microstructural configurations. We find that a modified crystal graph convolutional neural network model provides an accurate description of the structure–property relations. We anticipate the proposed graph-based modeling framework to be applicable to any man-made periodic microstructure, thereby enabling the design and discovery of new materials exhibiting exceptional mechanical, thermal, electrical or magnetic properties.},

Additive manufacturing of thin-walled gas-tight structures with complex shapes can fulfil requirements for a wide range of applications, such as process equipment for the chemical industry. The requirement to be gas-tight makes the manufacturing process very fault-sensitive as even a single open pore in the submicron range can lead to an impermissible leak of hazardous gases. Further, it has always been a challenge to make thin walls using Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Metals (PBF-LB/M). We explore the key design limit of inclined overhanging gas-tight thin walls made from 316l. A double pass scan strategy is presented to realize these structures along with guidelines to be followed when attempting to print these structures. The paper reports the common failure modes where leaks occur and lessons learned to successful design and printing of gas-tight walls. The results show that fabrication of gas-tight walls is feasible even for a 30° inclination angle to the horizontal and wall thicknesses in the range of 200–300 µm. A case study shows the successful the application of the findings to the production of modular distillation devices.},

The interaction between the reinforcement phase and the matrix has a major impact on the micro and macroscopic properties of these materials. This interaction is fostered by the exposition of the materials to high temperatures. Hence, it is highly influenced by the thermal cycle of the manufacturing process. In this work, an experimental approach is adopted to determine the influence of the main process parameters on the properties of metal-matrix composites. Statistical regression models are employed to consider the role of the most relevant parameters, from exploration to exploitation. The obtained trends are further corroborated by the corresponding microstructural, SEM, and EDS analyses. In terms of surface hardness, the DOE reveals different trends of the response depending on the composition of the feedstock employed. It is concluded that the strengthening behaviour of the material varies throughout the experimental domain studied. When high WC\% feedstocks are employed, the main strengthening mechanism responsible for the increase of hardness is the solid-solution of tungsten and carbide precipitation. On the contrary, when low WC\%s are employed, grain refinement becomes the main strengthening mechanism.},

The agreement with numerical data is very good, showing the potential for next experimental applications in predicting some very important and useful quantities, such as the extrusion force, which is critical for a wide range of 3D printing processes.

The microstructure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Cu separation occurred first, needle-like Cu rich precipitation in the BCC matrix formed the nucleation sites of Al-Ni rich decomposition, while fine lath separation and Cu rich decomposition region surrounding the FCC matrix were formed in the FCC matrix, and the remaining FCC matrix formed L1 2 order. Ordered Al-Ni rich decomposition in BCC matrix appeared after 1000 ℃ sintering. As sintering temperature increased, Al-Ni rich decomposition increased and coarsened and length–width ratio increased. σ phase precipitated after 950 ℃, 1000 ℃ and 1050 ℃ sintering, and disappeared as sintering temperature was higher than 1100 ℃. Yield strength of sintered alloy decreased from 1445.9 MPa to 1151.5 MPa, and hardness decreased from 714.2 HV to 536.3 HV as sintering temperature increased. The significant increase in plasticity after 1100 ℃ and 1150 ℃ was due to dissolution of σ phase. Dislocation accumulation around σ phase caused development of micro cracks and reduced the plasticity.},

  abstract     = {A series of duplex fcc + hcp Co-based entropic alloys are being discovered as a new category of entropic alloys with outstanding mechanical properties, especially to overcome a typical mechanical trade-off between strength and ductility. In this work, CALPHAD-based (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) thermodynamic calculations were performed to facilitate alloy design and to understand corrosion behaviors. The kinetics of the electrochemical corrosion for designed alloys in typical aggressive anion Cl - was investigated by electrochemical tests, including open circuit potential (OCP), polarization and cyclic polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The valence state and the surface morphologies of the passive films were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscope (AFM). High corrosion resistance materials with high strength and ductility performances were discovered in the present work. Except for Ni-oxides, various spinel compounds and many other oxides including Co 2 O 3 , Cr 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , MnO, MoO 3 , CoCr 2 O 4 , FeCr 2 O 4 , CoFe 2 O 4 , and CoMoO 4 were observed in the passive films. The adsorbed and penetrated corrosive anion Cl - will be prone to breakdown the passive films with less Cr 2 O 3 , CoCr 2 O 4 and MoO 3 to form pitting corrosion (also include other localized corrosion, such as intergranular corrosion and crevice corrosion). The microstructure of the hcp martensite with the fcc matrix has played an important role in the propagation of the localized anodic dissolution in the form of cleavage and quasi-cleavage. The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental observations. This paper paves a way for the future development of high-performance Co-based entropic alloys served in some harsh environments.},

  abstract     = {Oxide dispersion strengthening (ODS) is an effective way to optimize mechanical performance, radiation tolerance and wear resistance in alloys. Therefore, in this research, lightweight and oxyphilic element Ti was utilized to induce oxides particles for in-situ fabricating ODS alloys. We investigated systematically the influence of Ti content on the phase evolution and mechanical behaviors of Ni 1.5 Co 1.5 CrTi x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, molar ratio) multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) fabricated by mechanically alloying and high-pressure sintering (HPS). The Ni 1.5 Co 1.5 CrTi x powders presented BCC phase, FCC phase and few additional oxides. Following HPS, the BCC phase transformed to FCC phase in these MPEAs. Ni 1.5 Co 1.5 Cr MPEA was composed of FCC, Cr 7 C 3 and Cr 2 O 3 phases. As Ti content increased, Cr oxides or carbides gradually transformed into Ti oxides or carbides. The Ni 1.5 Co 1.5 CrTi x (x = 0.2, 0.4) MPEAs after HPS displayed ultrafine grained FCC matrix and uniformly dispersed ultrafine/nano Cr-C or Ti O C complex compounds. With Ti content increasing, the grain sizes of FCC matrix and precipitates had a tendency to decrease. Quantitative increment of precipitation-strengthening and fine-grain-strengthening clarifies the influence of Ti content on MPEAs. The investigations may provide key insights into tuning Ti content into the MPEAs for being available structural materials.},

A noncontact optical measurement procedure to assess this ratio (η f ) - for concrete reinforcement - by a modified 2D Digital Image Correlation method is presented in this paper. This ratio (η f ) has influence on the matrix-fibre interaction and, thus, on the post-cracking tensile response of the concrete composite. Details on the definition, implementation and validation of this measurement procedure are presented. Additionally, an experimental program on 20 selected lab grade and commercial fibres was carried out to analyse the consistency of the measurements and the influence of the fibre’s geometric characteristics (flat, curved, embossed or crimped) on the η f . The outcomes of this research and the experimental procedure proposed are meant to assist fibre producers on the design process of optimized fibres to be used in structural concrete.},

Abundant catechol groups on SD enhance the interfacial interaction between the adhesive and wood, and the topological entanglement of SD and the SM/PAE covalent network enhances the cohesion of the adhesive, synergistically endowing the adhesive with excellent prepressing intensity (0.83 MPa) and wet shear strength (1.09 MPa). Simultaneously, the improved initial adhesion and the suitable viscosity result in its excellent coating performance. The combination of ZnSO 4 endows the adhesive with satisfactory antibacterial activity and mildew resistance. This method exhibits considerable potential for application in bio-based adhesives, hydrogels, and composites.},

This work dedicates to establishing an efficient and self-adaptable materials structure descriptor based on the graph attention network (GAT). In the GAT descriptor generation, the concrete structure is represented by graphic atomic clusters (atoms as nodes, edges as bonds) consisting of one central atom and the surroundings. A multi-head-GAT is applied to gather the short- and long-distance topological information from the graphical atomic clusters to generate dimension-flexible descriptors regardless of atom number; the GAT descriptors are contracted and help avoiding overfitting during the training process theoretically. Further verification of the GAT descriptors is carried out by performing the phase classification, energy prediction, and potential energy surface (PES) prediction task for Al-Cu alloys with complex precipitates and defects. The GAT descriptors adapt themselves for cross tasks without manual intervention and produce accurate predictions that agree with the density functional theory (DFT) results. The GAT descriptors are also testified as differentiable, universal, and precise on structural characterization containing point-, line-, and planar- defects. Further applications will be found for the materials design field demanding accurate structure descriptions.},

In this work, the effect of a coaxially coupled alternating magnetic field (AMF) on surface morphology and mechanical properties of plasma arc-based additively manufactured Inconel 718 deposit were investigated. Results exhibit that the Lorentz force induced by AMF strongly alters the flow behavior of the plasma jet and the molten pool, suppressing the tendency of the liquid metal in the molten pool to flow down on the two sides face of the deposit, which in turn remarkably improved the surface accuracy of the thin-walled deposit. Furthermore, the electromagnetic stirring induced by AMF can effectively enhance the convection between the dendrites, which could not only contribute to the formation of finer dendrites but also alleviate the enrichment of the elements (i.e., Nb and Mo) at the solid–liquid interface and inhibits the precipitation of Laves phases. The smallest primary dendritic arm spacing (∼13 μm) and lowest Laves phases area fraction (3.12\%) were witnessed in the bottom region of the AMF-assisted deposit. The mechanical test confirmed that the deposit&#39;s microhardness and tensile properties were moderately improved compared with the counterpart without AMF.},

The results show that two basic micro-delamination growth modes, which are separately dominated by opening and sliding microcracks, can be distinguished according to the fracture morphologies of the delaminations along the 0° fibre direction. Both are driven by the out-of-plane shear stress σ 13 , and the corresponding delamination failure threshold is the out-of-plane shear strength S 13 . Based on these results, a concise Hashin-type delamination-propagation criterion containing only a single stress component and single strength parameter is proposed, which, by incorporating it into the finite element model, the delamination growth along the fibre directions of multidirectional CFRP laminates can be precisely predicted; the prediction error is less than 10\%.},

However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the ineffective tumor-associated antigen (TAAs) presentation of DCs have hindered the efficacy of immunotherapy. Herein, we developed an immunostimulatory nanosphere by direct self-assembly of cyanine5 labeled CPG oligodeoxynucleotide and doxorubicin (Cy5-CPG/DOX). The introduction of Cy5 into CPG could increase the interaction of Cy5-CPG and DOX, accelerating the formation of Cy5-CPG/DOX nanosphere. In vivo , DOX can effectively downregulate the level of regulatory T cells to reverse and abrogate immunosuppressive. Meanwhile, DOX induce immunogenic cell death to produce TAAs, which combined with Cy5-CPG promote the maturation of DCs, improving the TAAs presentation ability of DCs. Thus, the Cy5-CPG/DOX could awaken the innate immune system, sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors mediated by the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody. In this way, the Cy5-CPG/DOX combined with PD-L1 can decrease the exhaustion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, eliciting a durable systemic anti-tumor immunity to eradicate cancer.

Using two types of sheet metals, a steel and an aluminium alloy, experiments with Arcan tests were performed, and the difference in the crack paths were observed and analysed. The strategy for simulating ductile fracture proposed by the authors was successfully validated with the experimental Arcan test results, and it was applied to a parametric study based on the numerical simulations for clarifying the governing factors for ductile crack propagation paths in sheet metals. The two factors, strain hardening ability and ductility diagram parameter, were confirmed to be dominant in controlling the ductile crack propagation. The findings in the parametric study explain the difference of the crack paths as observed in the experimental Arcan tests for the two materials, thus elucidating the inverse design philosophy that facilitates material design to achieve desired performance metrics in enhancing the integrity of engineering structures.},

In the synthetic process, L/ d -tartaric acid (L/ d -TA) self-assembled with branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) to endow chirality and synergistic promoted silica deposition, while 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) polycondensated with the silica source to form aminoated mesostructure.

In vitro, physical characterization, cytotoxicity, osteogenic ability and ICT release of scaffolds were assessed. Furthermore, osteogenic and angiogenic abilities of IT scaffolds and MFIT scaffolds, as well as their biocompatibility after implantation, were determined in ONFH rabbits. Results showed both scaffolds remained well-designed in structure and mechanical properties after coating. ICT release on MFIT scaffold was more sustained than on IT scaffold. Analysis of calcium nodules at 28 days indicated that degradation of Mg-CaF film promoted bone formation. Correspondingly, Micro-CT and histological staining suggested MFIT scaffold possessed similar osteogenic and angiogenic abilities compared with IT scaffold at 6 weeks and significantly better at 12,18 weeks. In addition, MFIT scaffold supported the weight-bearing area effectively throughout the observation period. Therefore, MFIT scaffolds provided stable support along with persistent osteogenesis and angiogenesis, which had potential applications in ONFH.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis (AS) as a chronically inflammatory disease is the mainly cause of mortality worldwide. Porphyromonas gingivalis ( P. gingivalis , Pg), one primary pathogen in periodontitis (PD), has been reported to promote the progression of atherosclerosis via inducing infectiously triggered immune response, thus accelerating atheromatous plaque formation. However, limited therapeutic potency has been achieved using traditional drug treatment due to the existence of Pg and low concentration of drug reached in AS, reminding us to develop a new drug delivery strategy. In this study, to simultaneously realize the pathogen elimination and inflammation resolution in Pg-infected region, the PLGA-simvastatin-chitosan-metronidazole nanoparticles (STNPs) were coated with Pg-treated macrophage membranes (MM/STNPs). These nanoparticles obviously eliminated the amount of Pg and effectively switched the activation of macrophages from an inflammatory M1-like state to a more immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype. Using Pg-treated macrophage membrane (MM), the MM/STNPs were efficiently targeted in both atheromatous plaque and periodontal tissue in vivo . Importantly, MM/STNPs injection simultaneously diminished the atheromatous plaque formation in AS and rejuvenated the alveolar bone loss in PD. Based on this specific Pg-targeted delivery, the biomimetic nanoparticles provide a new approach for the targeting strategy in the treatment of Pg-accelerated AS.},

Considering that scaffolds play a fundamental role in many tissue engineering strategies, it would be interesting to count with an internationally accepted set of geometries, acting as a library of lattices, porous materials and scaffolding structures, which could be employed for comparative purposes among materials and manufacturing technologies under development. To this end, an open-source library of tissue engineering scaffolds has been implemented. This library stands out for providing a comprehensive collection of scaffolds blueprints, designed considering the specific features of most additive manufacturing technologies applicable to tissue engineering and biofabrication. Besides, the library has been developed focusing on FAIR data principles along the development, for promoting: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability. The scaffolds are shared as open-source medical devices with the necessary documentation for facilitating their application. Similar initiatives may be synergically integrated towards an ISO standard on tissue engineering scaffolds.},

In this study, novel composite fibers (PLLA/Dex/Ag fibers) with light-responsive rapid antibiosis and osteogenesis were obtained by mixing the photothermal agent silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) and the osteogenic drug dexamethasone (Dex) in polylactic acid (PLLA) using electrospinning, which can simultaneously kill multidrug-resistant bacteria and accelerate bone tissue healing due to the photothermal effect and release of Dex. Ag-NPs can act as antimicrobial agents released from the fibers and as photothermal agents to generate local high temperature and singlet state oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) under 808 nm light radiation, thereby killing the bacteria. The antimicrobial tests in vitro showed that PLLA/Dex/Ag fibers had an excellent antimicrobial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under NIR light radiation, shortening the effective antimicrobial time from 24 h to 6 h and achieving light-responsive antibiosis rapidly. Meanwhile, the released Dex could induce the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, thus promoting the healing of bone defects. In conclusion, this study provided a simple and effective strategy for the clinical treatment of bone infections.},

For heterogeneous tissue development, the printing approaches permitting controllable deposition of multicellular components in a flexible manner are urgently needed. Here, a facile dot-extrusion printing (DEP) system for one-step generation of cell-laden gelatin methacrylate (GelMa) hydrogel beads (GHBs) is developed, which allows size-tunable GHBs programmable positioned into complex 3D constructs. The GelMa is in situ semi-gelled at the printhead , thus enabling one-step generation of GHBs onto the platform, as a result of improved printing simplicity, fidelity and flexibility. The size and spatial position of the GHBs are adjustable by programming G-code parameters. Further, by integrating multiple printheads, GHBs encapsulating different cellular components can be printed to fabricate heterogeneous tissue constructs, and maintain the post-printed cell viability over 95\%. As an example of application, two different tumor-stroma spatial phases were developed through spatial regionally printing tumor cells and normal fibroblasts into juxtapositional or overlapping microcapsule structures, giving an access to study the complex tumor-stroma interactions in different microenvironments. The developed DEP system thus holds promise for creation of complex and heterogeneous tissues toward various biology studies.},

Here, the degradable poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) nerve guide conduits (NGCs) with microgroove or smooth inner surface were fabricated using a phase inversion-based dry-jet wet spinning method for RLN regeneration. The morphology and mechanical properties of NGCs were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a universal testing machine, showing that the porous NGC has good mechanical properties and is suitable for implantation. Further, in vitro PC12 cells cultured on the NGCs showed that microgroove conduit (GNGC) exhibited better cell adhesion, proliferation, and cell orientation. Both smooth and microgroove conduit (SNGC and GNGC) were transplanted into Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat models for assessing the repair effect on the 5-mm RLN gap. The results showed that GNGC was superior to SNGC in nerve regeneration and had similar effects to the autograft group in reducing muscle atrophy and restoring target organ function. Therefore, the degradable NGCs combined with groove structure could guide the regeneration of injured RLN, promote the partial functional recovery of target organs and prevent secondary surgical injury. This study contributes to the design and fabrication of nerve guide conduits and the application of tissue engineering in the field of RLN injury repair.},

The deformation-induced dislocations were found severely accumulated within the continuous GB-α with the transverse loading direction, which corresponds to the strain localization, while uniformly distributed between the continuous GB-α and surrounding grains with the perpendicular tensile loading. In contrast, discontinuous GB-α could fully accommodate uniform deformation with the matrix microstructure under both loading directions.

This paper explores the underwater operation potential of an emerging solid-state additive technology: additive friction stir deposition, wherein material feeding and bonding are enabled by mechanical forces with minimal influences from water. It is demonstrated that additive friction stir deposition of 304 stainless steel can be successfully performed with the print head and substrate immersed in water. High temperature is reached in the deposition zone (&gt;60\% melting temperature); the material deposition behavior is similar to that in typical open-air operation. The as-deposited material is fully-dense, having fewer annealing twins and a substantially smaller grain size than the feed material (4.98 μ m μm vs. 31.44 μ m ) μm) . Such microstructural changes stem from dynamic recrystallization caused by the large strain and high temperature introduced during deposition. In addition to grain refinement, small equiaxed dispersoids (∼2–3 μ m μm or less) are formed and evenly distributed in the austenite steel matrix. Rich in Cr, Mn, and O, these particles likely result from the reaction between the elements in stainless steel and water at elevated temperatures.},

This study developed a physics-based crystal plasticity finite element framework to evaluate multiple-laser-peening impacts on enhancing the high-cycle fatigue properties of AA2195-T6 friction stir welded joints. For this purpose, different contributions of laser peening effects were quantified on the variations of fatigue indicator parameters in the joint region. Extreme-value fatigue indicator parameters evaluated the laser peening effects in decreasing the driving force for fatigue crack initiation at near-surface grain boundaries. Moreover, grain-average fatigue indicator parameters investigated the fatigue property modification trends with depth. Experimental high-cycle fatigue tests were applied to validate the related modeling outputs. According to the crystal plasticity model, the improvement in joint near-surface fatigue properties majorly stemmed from cyclic mean stress alleviation under laser-peening-induced compressive residual stresses. This effect was followed by the increased resistance against cyclic plastic deformation under the growth in dislocation density and crystallographic texture intensity and the reduction in texture heterogeneity under the crystal morphology homogenization effects after laser peening. Fatigue tests revealed the enhancement in the joint fatigue life under the relocation of fatigue crack initiation regions to depth after LP and validated the numerical approaches.},

The principle of the transition from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic during heat treatment process was revealed, and how organic adsorption temperature and time affect water contact angle and slide angle was clarified. We found that nano-particles can drastically reduce the solid–liquid fraction of the surface after analysis. The parameters including laser scanning space, organic adsorption time and heat treatment temperature were optimized to realize high-efficient and energy-saving production.

  abstract     = {Over the last years, research on the design of dental self-healing polymers has grown dramatically. It is related to the promising potential of maximizing the clinical lifespan of dental restorations that this strategy holds. In this manuscript, the microcapsule-based strategy is innovated by incorporating the high toughness component N, N -Dimethylacrylamide (DMAM) into the healing agent systems and analyzing in-depth the change in crack propagation behavior induced by the addition of microcapsules into the highly crosslinked polymeric network. In general, the addition of the hydrophilic and high vapor pressure DMAM into the healing agent systems imposed a challenge for the microencapsulation, which highlighted the importance of tailoring the properties of the capsules’ shells according to the core composition. The addition of DMAM as cushioning agent proved to be a successful strategy since it resulted in increased G’/G” crossover time from 0.06 (control) to 0.57 s and decreased storage modulus from 8.0 (control) to 0.5GPa. In addition, the incorporation of microcapsules within the polymerized networks provided obstacles to crack propagation, which translated to an overall reinforcement of the polymeric network, as evidenced by the increase in toughness up to 50\% and energy required to propagate cracks up to 100\% in systems containing DMAM at 20 wt\%.},

This study aims at estimating the efficiency of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in predicting the compatibility between rejuvenators and aged bitumen, and exploring the influence of rejuvenator type, aging degree of bitumen, and temperature on the compatibility potential. The thermal storage stability of rejuvenated binders is evaluated to validate the compatibility prediction. Afterward, the underlying mechanism for the storage stability difference between rejuvenators and aged bitumen is explained with the atomic-scale parameters. The results revealed that the ranking on predicted compatibility and experimentally measured thermal storage stability for four rejuvenators is the same as AO &gt; BO &gt; NO &gt; EO. Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters of solubility parameter difference Δδ, Flory-Huggins parameter χ, and mixing free energy ΔGm are efficient for estimating the compatibility potential of various rejuvenators with aged bitumen. Moreover, the separation index (SI) parameters based on rheological and chemical indices are available to assess the phase stability of rejuvenated bitumen. At the molecular scale, the compatibility and phase stability issues between rejuvenators and aged bitumen are complicated and related to different aspects of intermolecular interaction, dispersion degree, and molecular mobility.},

This paper aims to fill the gap on the effectiveness of GFRP bars on the blast response of UHPC beams. The blast resistance of UHPC beams built with GFRP bars (UHPC-GFRP beams) is experimentally and numerically investigated in this paper. In the experimental scheme, twelve beams strengthened with various types of concrete and reinforcement are tested under near-field explosions. The properties of UHPC beams reinforced with GFRP bars are compared with specimens reinforced with normal-strength steel (NSS) and high-strength steel (HSS) bars. GFRP bars reduce the maximum displacements, which enhances the blast performance of UHPC beams. However, reinforcing UHPC beams with GFRP bars results in large rebound displacements. In addition, the coupled finite element model is adopted to predict the response of test beams. The numerical method using LS-DYNA achieves reasonable accuracy. Moreover, the damage process, energy characteristics, reaction forces, stress response and the effect of the compressive reinforcement are examined to better depict the damage mechanism of the UHPC-GFRP beams.},

Excluding Cu, Ni or Be, which are essential for Ti-based bulk MG production, on the other hand, confines the glass-forming ability of novel alloys to a moderate level. In this study, toxic-element free MG alloys with significant metalloid (Si–Ge–B, 15–18 at.\%) and minor soft element (Sn, 2–5 at.\%) additions are produced in ribbon form using conventional single-roller melt spinning technique. Their glass-forming abilities and their structural and thermal properties are comparatively investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), synchrotron XRD and differential scanning calorimetry. Their corrosion resistance is ascertained in a biological solution to analyze their biocorrosion properties and compare them with other Ti-based bulk MGs along with energy dispersive X-ray. Ti 60 Zr 20 Si 8 Ge 7 B 3 Sn 2 and Ti 50 Zr 30 Si 8 Ge 7 B 3 Sn 2 MG ribbons present a higher pitting potential and passivation domain compared with other Ti-based MG alloys tested in similar conditions.

The as-received TNM alloy billets with nearly and fully lamellar structures were prepared by forging and casting processes (named M1 and M2), respectively. For the as-rolled sheets from M1, the fraction of recrystallization increased gradually with the decrease of reduction per pass based on GOS analysis. Compared with M1, M2 required a larger deformation to achieve complete recrystallization. Meanwhile, the as-rolled sheets from M2 possessed a smaller grain size than that from M1. In addition, the γ-DRX behavior during the multi-pass hot rolling was discussed, and the DDRX was found to play the dominant role in this process. The phase transformation of β/β 0 → α occurred in the 1200 °C rolling process. It was presumed that this transformation was promoted by increasing the rolling temperature, therefore, the volume fraction of the β 0 phase decreased. The α 2 lath decomposed gradually with the increasing of rolling temperature from 1200 °C to 1250 °C, simultaneously, the combination of the adjacent γ laths resulted in the coarsening of γ lath.},

Quantitative descriptions extracted from the microstructure parameters further revealed the separated strengthening contributions and mechanism. Pre-deformation prior to the NIA significantly accelerated the aging kinetics and improved the strength, and yet showed a limited benefit due to the generally decreased precipitation strengthening. Elevated pre-deformation in conjunction with the NIA process reduced the T 1 diameter and interprecipitate spacing, the interprecipitate diffusion was gradually activated, responsible for the undulatory mean thickness. The experimental yield strength was successfully described by invoking the shearing mechanism in the pre-deformed samples (4–20\%). However, the strengthening transition from shearing to by-passing occurred in the 0\% sample, the by-passing model should be considered simultaneously owing to the larger diameter T 1 precipitates. The critical diameter of the T 1 precipitate for this transition ranged from 84 to 117 nm and was approximately 100 nm.},

  abstract     = {A wide variety of today’s engineering material systems consist of multiple layered constituents to satisfy varying demands, e.g. thermal barrier- or hard coatings, thermal- or electrical conduction or insulation layers, or diffusion barriers. However, these layers are commonly only of the order of a few hundred nanometers to microns thick, which renders conventional mechanical investigation of interfacial failure quite challenging, especially if plastically deforming constituents are involved. Herein, we present an in situ study of the mechanical deformation of a WTi-Cu model interface, commonly encountered in the microelectronics industry, utilizing transmission scanning electron microscopy. This approach elucidated the interplay between plastic deformation and fracture processes when loading either perpendicular (mode I) or parallel to the interface (mode II). Under mode I purely ductile failure in the Cu phase, exhibiting dislocation slip facilitated void nucleation and coalescence, was observed with an initiation value for dislocation propagation of J dislocation ≈15 J/m 2 . Mode II loading exhibited nucleation and propagation of an interface crack, with the initiation value for crack extension as J crack ≈8.8 J/m 2 . The results are discussed with respect to the frameworks of classical fracture mechanics and dislocation plasticity, providing fundamental insight into the failure behaviour of elastic–plastic interfaces with respect to loading orientation.},

Three alloys with varying pre-precipitations are designed by carrying out different heat treatment processes to explore the effects of precipitation on the recrystallization behavior of an Al–Cu–Li alloy during compression. It is indicated that the recrystallization behavior of the as-extruded alloy is quite sensitive to the precipitation. Precipitation does not change the recrystallization mechanism, but it could significantly affect the recrystallization volume fraction (V DRX ). Meanwhile, the diverse extruded texture fibers coordinate deformation through different softening mechanisms during compression, which stimulates the nucleation of the lamellar grain in R–cube textures. Furthermore, the influence mechanism of microstructure on the material flow behavior is also discussed for the three heat-treated alloys. Therefore, this work is expected to provide new insights for Al–Cu–Li alloy to design high-performance products through grain refinement and texture modification in the subsequent processing.},

However, conflicting results have been reported regarding the dependence of cavity swelling under irradiation on Cr level and temperature. Here, we have performed a comprehensive set of simultaneous dual-ion (Ni + He) irradiations to high dose (∼30 displacements per atom, dpa) at 400–550 °C on a series of ultra-high purity Fe and Fe-Cr binary alloys (3–14 wt.\%Cr). Helium co-implantation rates of 0.1 and 10 appm He/dpa were selected to examine He synergistic effects relevant for fission and fusion reactor conditions, respectively. Cavities were observed in all irradiated samples by transmission electron microscopy. The results show that higher He implantation rate causes a shift in the swelling peak to higher temperatures in both Fe and Fe-Cr alloys. When assuming smaller cavities as biased sinks, the non-monotonic nature of the cavity swelling behavior is related to the ratio of biased to unbiased point defect sink strengths. Cr-enriched precipitates were observed in Fe-14Cr irradiated at 400 °C by atom probe tomography. Our analysis suggests the formation of Cr-enriched precipitates could suppress cavity swelling for Fe-Cr alloys with Cr content above 10 wt\%.},

Current treatments commonly use steroids/retinoids in mouthwashes, films, or ointments. However, conventional drugs/formulations have significant side effects/limitations. Herein, astaxanthin-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin (GT) nanofiber-based mucoadhesive patches (PGA) with the water‐insoluble PCL nanofiber backing (PCL/PGA) are developed via electrospinning for the management of OPL. The saliva-insoluble PCL backing could greatly prevent drug loss after application in the oral cavity. The prepared PCL/PGA patches exhibit a suitable astaxanthin release rate for achieving high local drug concentration, which permeated into buccal mucosa. In addition, the developed thin patches display excellent wet tissue adhesion and great air permeability due to their high porosity. Notably, the in vivo experiment shows that the bioactive mucoadhesive patches significantly promote the recovery of OPL by suppressing the expression of Ki67 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), comparable to clinical tretinoin cream formulation. Also, the patches did not induce any side effects (i.e., hair loss and oral ulcers) compared to clinical tretinoin cream formulation. The results demonstrate that this novel electrospun mucoadhesive bilayer patch holds great potential for the treatment of OPL.},

The primary reason for adopting gold and silver nanoparticles as nanomaterials for drug delivery is because they exhibit potential drug transport and imaging properties. The temperature and the velocity of the blood gradually decline as increment the size of the nano particles of gold. Furthermore, the effects of heat source-sink and thermal radiation are considered. To convert the partial differential equations (PDEs) into dimensionless ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a method of suitable similarity transformations has been utilized and then solved by using the bvp4c built in solver in MATLAB mathematical software to get the numerical solutions as well as the graphical results. Higher order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are than tackled via shooting scheme. The outcomes of physical controlling parameters via temperature and velocity profiles are elaborated through graphs. The thermal distribution profile shows increasing behavior for the raising variations of Biot number and thermal radiation parameter. The current approach has the potential to be highly beneficial for efficient drug delivery in blood.},

  abstract     = {Composite micro-alloying is an important technique for developing cost-effective, high-performance aluminum alloys. Here, the effect of combined addition of Zr, Ti and rare-earth Y on the microstructure and tensile properties of an Al-7.6Zn-1.6 Mg-2.1Cu (wt.\%) alloy is systematically investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and room-temperature unixal tensile tests. After adding 0.12\%Zr, 0.04\%Ti and 0.28\%Y, L1 2 -Al 3 Zr/(Al,Zn) 3 Zr, AlMgZnTiCuFe and (Al,Zn) 8 Cu 4 Y phases were induced; the as-T6 treated microstructure of the base alloy changed from fully recrystallized to fully unrecrystallized, accompanied by strong 〈1 0 0〉 + 〈1 1 1〉 fiber textures along extrusion direction. As a result, the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr-Ti-Y alloy with low Zn and Mg contents exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of 692 MPa, yield strength of 647 MPa (∼36\% higher than the base alloy) and 6.8\% elongation. The main strengthening mechanisms responsible for this high yield strength are Orowan dislocation bypassing strengthening (∼449 MPa), fiber texture strengthening, and dispersion strengthening. Moreover, the synergistic strengthening effect of rare-earth Y and transitional element(s) Zr and/or Ti was revealed, which may be related to the formation(s) of nanoscale network-structured Al 8 Cu 4 Y and/or L1 2 -Al 3 (Zr,Y) phase(s). The massive formation of the Al 8 Cu 4 Y network structure requires a narrow process window.},

Self-lubricant films have been seen as the sustainable solution to achieve a long-term lubrication under high temperature-cycling conditions. In this manuscript, multilayer Mo 2 N-Ag/SiN x films with a fixed modulation ratio (thickness of Mo 2 N-Ag to SiN x ) of 3:1, with changing modulation period (Λ, thickness of Mo 2 N-Ag and SiN x ) from 8 to 200 nm were produced to achieve an effective balance between the lubricious phase diffusion control and the adequate formation of the low friction tribo-layers. Results showed that a dual-phase of fcc-Mo 2 N and fcc-Ag co-existed in Mo 2 N-Ag layers, while the SiN x layer exhibited an amorphous character. Both room temperature (RT) lubricant and wear-resistance properties of the films were improved by increasing Λ from 8 to 64 nm, while a further increase of Λ degraded the wear-resistance properties. The multilayer film at Λ = 64 nm exhibited an excellent RT-500 °C temperature-cycling tribological properties. Mechanical properties and the synergistic effect of both modulation layers were the cause for the improvement of the tribological properties.},

However, the brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formed during welding of steel and Ti alloys are prone to cracks, which limit the preparation of high-strength steel/Ti joints. In this work, CoCrNi powder was used as an intermediate alloy to reduce the tendency of these brittle phases to produce cracks. The addition of this CoCrNi powder ensured that good quality joints were obtained and no cracks were observed. Three elements of CoCrNi are capable of infinite solid solution with Fe, so the alloy powder does not form a large amount of brittle IMCs with Fe by laser melting. A region of Fe-Ti IMCs formed at the steel/Ti interface due to the mixing of Fe and Ti. Moreover, the diffusion of CoCrNi from the melt pool into the Fe-Ti IMC interface layer reduced the interface layer brittleness, decreased the interface layer cracking tendency and improved joint performance. The plastic toughness of the interface layer of Fe-Ti compounds significantly improved after the addition of Co, Cr, and Ni alloying elements, which fully demonstrated the effectiveness of CoCrNi powder incorporation.},

AlSi10Mg products manufactured using the LPBF process allow tailoring the dynamic properties to the needs of applications. Hence, we created a design of experiments based on the Taguchi method to study the effects of the most influential LPBF process parameters. The chosen parameters were laser power, scanning speed, hatching distance, scanning pattern, and fabrication orientation. Using a split Hopkinson pressure bar experimental system, the maximum dynamic stress (MDS) and elongation until fracture were characterized. The dynamic properties were significantly affected: up to a 30\% increase in the MDS, without a reduction in elongation was observed. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the fabrication orientation significantly influences the dynamic properties. This study quantitatively correlates the macrostructure of the melt pools and their dynamic properties. There is a close to linear dependency between the crack path following the melt pool boundaries to the MDS. The results obtained from this study can assist engineers in estimating their dynamic response to materials by analyzing the LPBF AlSi10Mg macrostructure.},

Although photothermal therapy (PTT) is promising, most photothermal agents lack good photothermal conversion performance which restrains their application. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) nanosheets can exhibit many advantages in antibacterial applications due to their unique two-dimensional structure with larger specific surface area and higher near-infrared (NIR) absorption. Here, we prepared two-dimensional NbS 2 nanosheets (NbS 2 NSs) with good biological stability and high biocompatibility through a high-temperature reduction reaction. NbS 2 NSs exhibited excellent and stable photothermal properties, which were capable of killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) under 5 min of 808 nm laser irradiation. In addition, the morphological characterization of bacteria showed bacterial cell membrane destruction. Furthermore, NbS 2 NSs under NIR irradiation inhibited the formation of biofilms and quickly eradicated S. aureus from an infected wound to promote wound healing through a hyperthermia effect. Overall, this work provides an attractive strategy for synthesizing and applying two-dimensional NbS 2 NSs with significant implications for bacterial eradication and future biomedical applications.},

The elastic performances were investigated using representative elementary volume model and examined by quasi-static compression tests. The plastic performances and energy absorption behaviors were experimentally calibrated. Meanwhile, elastoplastic simulations were adopted to study the deformation mode on the structural strengthen mechanism. The results demonstrate that the reduced elastic-anisotropy can be achieved without complicated regulation process. Under the same material volume fraction, the stiffness, yield strength, and energy absorption capability were respectively increased about 30\%–60\%, 30\%–150\%, and 70\%–280\%, for most of crystal sheet lattices in comparison with their truss-based counterparts. Being open type cellular materials, the crystal sheet lattices are of high mass-specific mechanical performances. Due to the smooth profiles, large surface volume ratios, and enhanced mechanical performances, CSLs also have potentials to be utilized in lightweight and heat transportation fields.},

In order to identify the influence of plate holes on the programmable mechanical properties of thin-walled crystal plate lattices, numerical simulations as well as experimental tests were conducted. Without breaking the original symmetry features, the increasing size of plate holes only results in slightly increased elastically-anisotropy. Quasi-static uniaxial compression tests and simulations demonstrate the stiffness, yield strength, and energy absorption capability can be accurately regulated by plate holes. Elastoplastic finite element simulations are employed to reveal the mechanisms responsible for the mechanical response of thin-walled crystal plate lattices. All simulations are verified by mechanical tests of 316L stainless steel crystal plate lattices.

We developed an efficient coupled process model for a steel wall to simulate the interaction between WAAM deposition and rolling. The predicted RS distributions and wall dimensions agree well with experimental results. Cyclic variation of longitudinal tensile RS occurs during WAAM deposition and inter-layer rolling in clamped condition. The influence depth of deposition and rolling is characterised by the number of the underlying layers that are plastically deformed after each process cycle. For the inter-layer rolling with a flat roller, the rolling has smaller influence depth than the deposition; consequently, the rolling does not eliminate but rather contains the regeneration of WAAM tensile RS after thermal cycles. Rolling with a slotted roller introduces more tensile plastic strain and thereby more effectively reduces WAAM tensile RS and unclamping distortion. Compared to the inter-layer rolling, stacked-four-layer rolling has larger influence depth and hence achieves similar RS mitigation efficacy with fewer rolling operations, while post-build rolling has lower efficacy due to insufficient penetration. Therefore, stacked-layers rolling with slotted roller is recommended for an optimal hybrid process of WAAM and rolling.},

After cryoprinting, the silk fibroin-based cryogels could be printed to a variety of shapes and sizes and allow rapid volumetric recovery after injection through a needle. These cryogels encapsulating laponite nanoparticles provided enhanced proliferation, spreading, and osteogenic differentiation of the seeded bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). In addition, the integration of implanted hydrogels with host tissues and the cell invasion within the hydrogel was found with no obvious inflammatory response after subcutaneous injection. These findings showed that the printed nanoparticle-enhanced cryogels could promote the seeded stem cells to actively participate in bone regeneration. In short, this work not only offered a feasible and effective platform to print customized cryogels, but also provided an injectable cryogel for bone tissue engineering via this advanced printing platform.},

Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is increasingly being used to produce advanced bone tissue engineering scaffolds with a bionic structure and optimal mechanical strength to promote bone regeneration. However, in addition to excellent osteogenic induction, angiogenesis is also essential for bone reconstruction. Therefore, we constructed a 3D-printed composite porous titanium scaffold system equipped with a thermosensitive collagen hydrogel loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor and bone morphogenetic protein-9 (VEGF/BMP-9). In vitro , the composite system showed great biocompatibility, and both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells showed high viability when grown on the composite scaffold; In vivo, this system continuously provided angiogenic and osteogenic growth factors at the site of a lateral epicondyle osseous defect in a rabbit femur, thus promoting angiogenesis and osseointegration.

It is found that the tooth-like interface with tooth angle of 45° increases the interlayer tensile and shear strengths by 294\% and 89\% respectively, and shifts the failure mode from pure adhesive failure to a mixture of adhesive and cohesive failures. Moreover, a theoretical model is developed for the relationship between the interlayer strength and interfacial tooth angle, and then validated by the experimental data with a relative error of about 5\%.

  abstract     = {Powder hemostatic particles have no limitation on wound type and a wide application prospect in the treatment of wound hemostasis. In this study, bioactive glass-based membrane-like structure camouflage composite particles (MBG@BSA/CS) were prepared by Layer-by-layer (LBL) method to coat bovine serum albumin (BSA) and chitosan (CS) on the surface of the synthesized macroporous and mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG). The results showed that MBG@BSA/CS particles significantly improved the coagulation effect of MBG and could activated both endogenous and exogenous physiological coagulation pathways. MBG@BSA/CS had the excellent water absorption quality and could immediately release Ca 2+ to participate in the coagulation pathway. The main hemostatic mechanism of MBG@BSA/CS was that the membrane-like of BSA/CS could form a fibrin network by aggregating erythrocytes and activating platelets, thus rapidly aggregating coagulation factors. In addition, MBG@BSA/CS particles had a significant hemostatic effect on surface bleeding (tail-amputation model) and internal bleeding (liver injury model) in SD rats, which could shorten the bleeding time and reduce the amount of blood loss effectively. This research work stated that the MBG-based membrane-like structure camouflage composite particles might be with the potential applications as a hemostasis biomaterial for the emergency bleeding.},

The model takes into account the effects of grain size evolution, phase change and plasticity-induced twinning. Here, the deformation parameters were firstly modeled using the expanding cavity model and theory of incremental plasticity. Then, the strengthening mechanism are identified based on developed physics based material model. Series of experiments were carried out to confirm the hardness values obtained from the model. Finally, the developed multiphysics model were utilized to identify the influence of burnishing parameters on hardness distribution and contributed mechanisms. The obtained results indicated that the there is good agreement between the measured and predicted values of hardness. On the other hand, it was found that the twinning-induced plasticity followed by phase change (from austenite to ferrite) have more dominant influence on hardening compared to grain size evolution; however, the latter only affects the hardening up to limited depth. In addition, the burnishing depth has been identified as most influential parameter that affects hardness and hardened depth.},

In this research, pulsed magnetic treatment was applied to the thermal spraying WC-10Co4Cr coating with a 17.7\% improvement in its fracture toughness, and the strengthening mechanism was further investigated. Microstructure characterization indicates that structural relaxation took place in the amorphous Co binder, and the annihilation of some free volume holes mainly contributes to the mechanical property enhancements. Atomic migration related to the structural relaxation was further explained in terms of the magnetic field induced intersystem crossing. Improvement of both the nano-hardness and elastic modulus of the Co binder was also observed as a result of structural relaxation. This work provides a possible non-thermal post-treatment method for not only the different kinds of cemented carbide coatings but also other amorphous functional materials sensitive to crystal defects.},

Understanding their mechanical response under various strain rates is essential to design and optimise them. Currently, the strain rate influence on the behaviour of AM materials is still not fully elucidated, nor is the corresponding metallurgical aspect. This research presents a comprehensive study on the influence of the microstructure and anisotropy of AlSi10Mg specimens made by Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( l -PBF) on their behaviour under various strain rates. Tensile specimens were fabricated in three orientations and tested at 0.001 s −1 , 1 s −1, 500 s −1 , and 1000 s −1 strain rates using a universal testing machine, intermediate strain rate mechanical device, and Split Hopkinson Pressure bar, respectively, combined with Digital Image Correlation. Fractography analysis revealed how the various dynamic loadings affected the failure modes and the corresponding microstructural evolution. Despite presenting low strain rate sensitivity and no evidence of strain hardening, the strain rate influenced the fracture response and elongation to failure. For higher strain rates, microstructural changes were captured on the fracture surfaces, suggesting a localised in-situ thermal treatment due to the adiabatic effect of high velocity loadings.},

To explore the underlying causes, a challenging phase-field simulation was performed, supported by a semi-solid experiment. The simulation managed to couple dendritic growth with melt flow and solid deformation, a process that few existing models or in situ experimental techniques could analyze. This study found that under deformation, grain boundary formation and wetting play a pivotal role in the formation of non-dendritic structures: it is the grain boundary formation and wetting that split the bending side-branch from dendrite trunk; the detached side-branch could then evolve into a non-dendritic morphology. The simulation showed that wetting could finish almost immediately after a moderate bending. This process appears similar to but is essentially distinct from the conventional explanation that describes dendrite fragmentation as mechanical breakage.},

However, anodization optimizations have been restricted to polished flat Ti foils, while clinical implants are often micro-rough with curved geometry. To enable anodization optimization of Ti implants, we performed short-time anodizations (10 s–600 s) on implant relevant micro-rough Ti wires (D: 0.8 mm) and rods (D: 5 mm) to understand the nanostructure self-ordering. We also studied the influence of electrolyte aging (repeated use of an electrolyte to tune its chemical balance) on implant anodization. Results revealed a higher electric field around Ti in aged electrolytes promotes the vertical elongation of nanotubes/pores. In comparison, fresh electrolytes established a lower electric field that limited the tube/pore elongation and caused cracks on the anodic film after an extended anodization time. We report an efficient implant nano-engineering protocol (PBR value of 2.7–3.0) for Ti rods (mimicking dental implants/abutments) via tailored anodization parameters. Further, reduced anodization voltage is proposed for anodizing Ti wires (mimicking orthopaedic fracture pins) to minimize excessive TiO 2 dissolution. The current study evaluated nanostructure self-ordering on clinically relevant curved/micro-rough Ti, towards an improved understanding of implant nano-engineering.},

The optimized interface generated by the interaction between SO 3 H groups of SPG layer and CF 2 dipoles of PVDF layer integrates graphene onto the surface of PVDF/Al particles. Due to the effect of graphene on the interfacial thermal resistance, the enthalpy of SPG coated PVDF/Al particles is about 1.5 times higher than that of uncoated particles. The existence of SPG improves the heat transfer efficiency of MICs. For comparison, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has also been introduced as an additive. Graphene is introduced to linearly affect(R 2 = 0.9865) the main oxidation enthalpy by lifting the surface oxidation heat release of the Al core. Therefore, graphene is a new strategy for increasing the energy release rate while improving the energy output.},

  abstract     = {High-quality internal experimental materials data are often “small data.” Using external datasets, e.g., data from the literature and other groups, to expand the “small data” to relatively “big data” is particularly important for improving the prediction accuracy of machine learning models. However, the most critical issue is how to use a small amount of internal reliable data to filter external data extracted from multiple sources and obtain optimal datasets with a distribution similar to that of internal data. This is called the multi-source materials data problem. This question was addressed by designing an active learning-based data screening (ALDS) model that is suitable for small material samples. This study used negative expansion materials as subjects. The results show that ALDS can be used to screen the external multi-source dataset and far exceeds traditional outlier filtering methods. The average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the predictive key target property of the negative thermal expansion coefficient (NTEC) was reduced from 4.301 4.301 to 0.056 0.056 . Furthermore, reverse design experiments were conducted on anti-perovskite manganese nitride (AMN), a type of negative thermal expansion material, to prove that the ALDS model can guide the reverse design on a small AMN dataset using the MAPE between ALDS prediction and the ground truth of samples’ three property indicators. This achieves high confidence levels with values of 0.203 , 0.126 0.203,0.126 , and 0.115 0.115 . This verifies that the ALDS proposed method improves the effect of ”materials small internal data” in guiding material design and property prediction.},

Specifically, we consider the Rosenthal solution for a moving point heat source in steady state on a semi-infinite solid. Firstly, we analyze the feasibility of the thermal problem while constraining the melt pool size and aspect ratio. We then express the maximum allowable velocity and the corresponding power as explicit functions of the constraints and material properties. Finally, we examine a wide range of melting processes within a dimensionless framework derived from the above solution. The paper concludes with an application example concerning lack of fusion porosity in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, which shows the reliability of analytical estimates despite the complexity of the underlying physics. This makes it possible to outline a direct procedure for optimizing the main process parameters given a few basic requirements. Ultimately, the proposed methods are not intended to replace other modeling and experimental approaches, but rather to complement their capabilities and encourage more efficient use of available resources. In addition, reframing seemingly different problems within a common perspective can improve understanding, reveal new levels of similarity, and sometimes even allow for global solutions.},

The trained machine learning model can precisely predict local porosity caused by lack of fusion and keyhole with multi-layer monitoring images. It also indicates the optimal processing window. It is impossible to be sure about the occurrence of defects in a layer based only on the abnormality of a single layer, and vice versa. Defects in a layer can be caused by improper parameters or anomalies in current layer or subsequent layers; defects in one layer can also be eliminated by proper parameters in the following layers.

In this paper, gelatin grafted protocatechuic acid (GT-PCA) and oxidized-dextran (Odex) were used to engineer GT-PCA/Odex composite hydrogels via Schiff base reaction. The in vitro experimental results show that the hydrogels not only are injectable, self-healing, hemostatic, antioxidant, but also have good degradability, adhesion and biocompatibility. Further, the hydrogels can promote wound healing in full-thickness mouse skin defect models by reducing inflammation and increasing angiogenesis, collagen deposition and granulation tissue formation. Notably, the preparation method of GT-PCA/Odex hydrogels is gentle and simple, the hydrogel system has bright prospects in the treatment of acute skin injury and is expected to be applied in clinical trials.},

The results revealed that yarn densities and loading directions significantly influenced the compression strength. It increased as yarn densities increased, and the weft compression strength was almost the largest in all directions and reached the maximum value of 634.8 MPa. In this case, it was 16.9\% and 166.9\% higher than that of the warp and Z-directions. Damage evolutions demonstrated that the damage of yarns and matrix occurred separately at the intersection of yarns and yarns, and yarns and matrix. The damage patterns of small warp and large weft yarn densities composites included yarn buckling, the interfacial debonding between yarns and matrix, and matrix cracking. Yarn kinking and fracture were the two main damage patterns of large warp and small weft yarn densities composites, while composites with large warp and large weft yarn densities were more prone to matrix cracking.},

  abstract     = {This study is aimed to develop a new criterion to predict the solid-state welding quality of magnesium alloy during the porthole die extrusion of hollow profiles. In this criterion, the mechanism of interfacial void shrinkage of magnesium alloy during the extrusion welding is considered, including the plastic deformation of rough interfaces and the atomic diffusion driven by the hydrostatic pressure gradient. The developed criterion is validated by the combined extrusion-welding experiments of magnesium alloy and the corresponding numerical simulations. The results indicate that the bonding strength of magnesium alloy increases with growing billet temperature and decreasing the extrusion stem speed. A sound weld seam with a strength higher than 316 MPa is formed by the porthole extrusion when the billet temperature of Mg-Al-Zn-RE alloy is above 350 °C (623 K) and the extrusion speed is below 16.67 mm/s. Compared with other existing criteria, the developed criterion is more reliable in predicting the extrusion-welding quality of magnesium alloy.},

The fracture forms of the laminates with different IMCs distributions are analyzed via in-situ tensile–shear experiments, and the shear stress distribution in the regions adjacent to the bonding interface during the tensile–shear process is investigated via finite element modeling using Abaqus. Results show that granular IMCs can change the direction of cracks and limit crack expansion during the tensile–shear process. The location of the maximum shear stress shifts from the interface to the aluminum matrix, causing fracture to be generated in the Al matrix. When an approximate IMC layer is formed at the bonding interface, the maximum shear stress occurs at the IMC–Al interface. Additionally, Kirkendall voids, which are the source of cracks, are observed at the IMCs–Al interface. They expand along the IMC–Al interface during the tensile–shear process, thus reducing the bonding strength. This study shows that granular IMCs are beneficial for improving the bonding strength, and that the bonding strength begins to deteriorate when the IMCs accumulate to form a layer.},

  abstract     = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) is a constantly developing approach utilized in many novel applications. Most metal AM techniques utilize alloys designed for traditional processing conditions, such as casting, whereas implementing alloys designed for AM may prove useful. Given the proven utility of the Al-Mg-Zr-Si Addalloy 5T® in melt-driven AM, this study investigated the use of this alloy in cold spray (CS), as minimal research has explored alloy design for use in solid-state processing. The as-atomized powder and CS samples were evaluated microstructurally and mechanically to determine suitability for CS. Premature brittle fracture were seen in the deposits, necessitating processing improvements for enhanced deposit performance. Feedstock thermal pre-processing was explored, guided by thermodynamic modeling, to improve spray-ability. Heat treatments resulted in generalized powder softening, suggesting improved processability using a CS gas-particle dynamics model. This model allowed for theoretical tuning of processing parameters, predicting improved deposition using a specific configuration with He gas. The through-process model-informed experimental approach emphasizes the potential of using Addalloy 5T® powder in CS when coupling heat treatment with processing parameter optimization. Results suggest that the CS community may benefit from alloy design specifically for solid-state processing, tailoring powder chemistry and microstructure for enhanced properties and processability.},

The rheology can aid understanding of the slurry structure, as well as optimisation of the process conditions to create electrode coatings with the desired microstructure. The shear rheology is typically measured, however the mixing and coating steps contain significant extensional flows, this omits a significant part of the rheological response. Here the extensional properties of battery electrode slurries are quantified using a miniature extensional rheometer. This requires tiny samples (&lt;1 ml) and provides rapid capture of the extensional properties, allowing easy repetition. The extensional behaviour varies significantly between different formulations and binder systems. The additional extensional rheometry measurements are key for understanding flow in a coater and the underlying slurry structure, and are not predicted by shear rheology. This novel extensional rheology technique, applied to battery electrode slurries, provides key rheological parameters, rapidly, and is essential to understanding the precise rheological properties and control for coating depositions.},

Nonuniform creep deformation/damages in this service-aged multi-pass F91-P91 welds were quantified and characterized. The in-situ DIC strain measurements reveal the nominal creep strain averaged over the gauge length was consistently below 3\%, and the localized creep strain value at failure in the HAZ was ∼10\%. Advanced metallurgical characterization was executed in the as-received and posttest conditions to determine the contributions of preexisting creep damage, the so-called “soft zone” in the HAZ, and microstructural variations in the HAZ to the observed Type IV failure. Creep failure occurred in the most predamaged region and this location is adjacent to, but not inside, the documented soft zone before the test. The higher fraction of inclusions in F91 steel contributed significantly to the lower creep resistance observed in both base metal and HAZ.},

  abstract     = {The robust and reliable joining of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites and metals has important application value in the aerospace field. However, the low interface bonding strength when joining the two dissimilar materials remains a persistent problem and leads to low joint strength. In this work, a novel interface strengthened brazing process has been developed for joining a C/C composite and a nickel-based superalloy (GH3044). Before joining, high-strength molybdenum (Mo) fibers are planted on the surface of the C/C composite, then the fiber-treated C/C composite is brazed to the GH3044 superalloy using a BNi-2 filler. The results show that a sound joint with robust Mo fibers crossing the interface between the C/C substrate and the brazing layer is obtained. Owing to the pinning effect of the Mo fibers, the joining interface area is increased and cracking is effectively prevented. As a result, the bonded joint exhibits excellent mechanical properties. The maximum shear strength of the joint was measured to be 60 MPa, which is 2.14-times that of the joint without fiber-planting. The maximum three-point bending strength of the joint was measured at 31 MPa, which is 2.58-times that of the joint without fiber-planting.},

Based on experimental results and a physics-derived model description of the drying process we developed a phase diagram, offering a guideline to make WG foams with customised porosity. Combining X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography, we deduced relations between processing parameters, pore size, and pore size distribution. Pore diameters span 10 to 1000 μm, which is in the range required for the ingrowth of healthy bone. The compressive strength is equal or higher than the values reported for similar bioactive glass foams. The degradation tests in simulated body fluid showed promising bioactivity and biodegradation. Together with the purity of the material, lacking any additives, the WG foams are attractive for biomedical applications.},

High-temperature resistojets improve the economics of small satellites and are an attractive technology for auxiliary propulsion on all-electric geosynchronous satellites. Additive manufacturing was used to economically produce the geometrically complex heating element. Endurance tests were performed on heaters and full thruster assemblies. Eight engineering model thrusters were tested, with five manufactured from Inconel 625, and three having a tantalum heater and nozzle operating at higher temperatures. The eight units were operated in vacuum to determine their endurance. The Inconel thrusters were operated at 30 W electrical power, while the tantalum thrusters were operated at 60 W, representative of intended operating conditions. Measurements of temperature and electrical resistance throughout the tests were used to infer the condition of the thrusters. Following a retrofit of two of the Inconel 625 thrusters with a modified component to mechanically support the heater, they completed 6000 heating cycles without failure. The tantalum thrusters, equipped from the outset with the modified component, completed 10000 heating cycles. Both variants exceeded the minimum cycle requirement of 4000. This work demonstrates the operational feasibility of additive-manufactured, high-temperature resistojets.},

A subset of experimental data is employed to fine-tune the DL model. The presently developed DOE-informed DL model is validated via single-track deposition of stainless steel 316L, in which the cross-section dilution shape (including depth) and the geometrical characteristics of beads, including the width, height, area, and wetting angle are predicted accurately. The prediction of the porosity and hardness are acceptable for single-track deposition, since variations of both the experimental porosity (from 0.04\% to 0.30\%) and hardness (from 168 HV to 182 HV) are quite small for the single-track deposition, especially predicted ranges for the porosity (from 0.05\% to 0.25\%) and hardness (from 170 HV to 180 HV) are the subset of the experimental results.

The hardness and elastic modulus of all multilayers are greatly improved by introducing an AlN-Ni modulation layer. When the modulation-layer thickness is 2.4 nm, and the hardness and elastic modulus are the highest at the value of 39 GPa and 447 GPa, respectively, which is ascribed to Koehler strengthening and alternating stress hardening. Meanwhile the fracture toughness reaches the maximum, namely 5.49 MPa·m 1/2 . It is attributed to the indentation-induced phase transformation of c-AlN to w-AlN and the formation of a good coherent interface.

By efficient LPS neutralization and elimination, FB@NPs inhibit the production of a number of cross-regulated pro-angiogenic factors, and thereby greatly block inflammatory neovascularization. Besides, due to the self-recognition capability and inherent remarkable biocompatibility of these endogenous biomimetic nanoparticles, FB@NPs show highly desirable biosafety during the antiangiogenesis process in inflammation treatment.

Herein, we developed a facile bottom-up approach to synthesize a novel and sophisticated Co 3 O 4 -based thin-film material with a tailored nanostructure that is crucial for catalytic properties. The films were produced using a low-pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process that was thoroughly analyzed. The as-deposited films, in the amorphous form composed of Co, O, C, and H atoms (called CoO X -based films), were thermally treated (calcined), transforming them into films containing Co 3 O 4 nanocrystallites. For a fundamental understanding of the transformation process, the calcination was performed in a controlled manner by Raman spectroscopy using the Raman laser as a heat source. An original model to describe the formation of Co 3 O 4 nanocrystallites was proposed. We have shown that the concentration of Co 3 O 4 and also the number and size of its nanocrystallites in the films can be rationally tailored to the specific needs by selecting the parameters of the PECVD and calcination processes. Our research provides a practical strategy for the molecular design of nanostructured thin-film catalysts in a controllable way using the PECVD process.},

  abstract     = {Fast proton conductors are important materials for catalysis and energy conversion applications. The glassy coordination polymers are an important class of proton conductors due to their good mechanical moldability; however, their conductivity has been limited to ca. 10 mS cm −1 at 100 °C. The systematic design of coordination polymers with fast proton conduction requires an atomistic simulation method that can describe long-range proton diffusion within an affordable computational time. The methodologies of atomistic simulations are separately limited and cannot fairly describe the long-range proton conduction in non-crystalline materials. In this work, we develop a hybrid approach that combines the molecular dynamics based on a conventional force-field and the kinetic Monte Carlo method, which allows for the large-scale (thousands of atoms) and long time (few nanoseconds) simulation of the long-range ionic diffusion in non-crystalline materials. Based on the developed approach, we propose and confirm a design concept for a fast proton-conducting coordination polymer based on Zn 2+ ions and phosphoric acid.},

However, the mechanism behind grain refinement is not fully understood for conventional casting, nor for PBF. In this work, a high throughput method have been used to produce Al-2 wt\%Cu alloys with additions of Ti 1-x M(Zr,Ta,V,W) x B 2 , Al 3 Ti 1-x M(Zr,V) x or AlB 2 grain refiners for 0.1 &lt; x &lt; 0.9. It was found that grain size varied with x, M and the sum of Ti + M. Ti 1-x M x B 2 grain refiners offered no advantage over Al 3 Ti 1-x M x . Overall, Ti and Zr provide the best grain refinement, both as Ti 1-x M x B 2 and Al 3 Ti 1-x M x . However, Ti 1-x Zr x B 2 had a grain refinement minimum around x = 0.65–0.70. The behavior was similar with Ta, but to a lesser extent. V and W had detrimental effects on grain refinement. Despite the fact that no AlB 2 particles were observed, additions of B provided excellent grain refinement and was more efficient than Ti below 0.5at\%. Ti 1-x M x B 2 lattice parameters varied with x and followed Vegard’s law, however, a clear relationship between grain size and epitaxial strain/lattice match could not be established. Similarly, the growth restricting factor alone was not a predictor of grain size.},

A variety of composite materials have been investigated to overcome this barrier. Silica-based multifunctional hybrid composite aerogels have attracted considerable attention as they inherit the advantages of both organic and inorganic components. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of organic–inorganic hybridization strategies to strengthen silica aerogels using various polymers, biopolymers, and nanocarbon materials. The inclusion of polymers can enhance the mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposite aerogels. Furthermore, the properties of composite aerogels can be tuned by modifying the composition on the molecular scale. The interfacial interaction between silica and polymers and strengthening mechanism for enhancing the material properties are discussed. Moreover, synthesis strategies and technical challenges are highlighted to promote the design and application of aerogels with improved mechanical properties.},

Bismuth oxyhalides have emerged as a typical ternary 2D layered material recently. However, the studies focusing on the RS behaviors in 2D bismuth oxyhalides are still limited. Herein, the RS behaviors in 2D BiOX (X = Cl, Br and Cl + Br) nanosheets have been systematically studied. 2D BiOX nanosheets are exfoliated from their bulk materials which are synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Vertical memristors with Pt/BiOX/Pt sandwiched structures have been fabricated for RS measurements. Among them, 2D BiOCl nanosheet has no RS behaviors. BiOBr nanosheet demonstrates non-volatile bipolar RS behaviors with a large ON/OFF ratio (∼10 5 ), long time retention (10 4 s) and good endurance (280 cycles) as well as good environmental stability, suggesting potential applications in non-volatile memory. Furthermore, BiOBr 0.7 Cl 0.3 nanosheet shows volatile threshold switching (TS) behaviors with the ON/OFF ratio up to 10 5 . The device with TS behaviors can be utilized to emulate the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) functions in biological synapses.

  abstract     = {Defects in additively manufactured materials are one of the leading sources of uncertainty in mechanical fatigue. Fracture mechanics concepts are useful to evaluate their influence, nevertheless, these approaches cannot account for the real morphology of defects. Preliminary attempts to exploit a more comprehensive description of defects can be found in the literature, by using Machine Learning. These approaches are notoriously data-hungry and neither physics laws nor phenomenological rules are introduced to assess the soundness of the outcome. Hereby, to overcome this limitation, an approach to predicting fatigue finite life of defective materials, based on a Physics-Informed Neural Network framework, is presented for the first time. The training process of a Neural Network is reinforced by introducing novel Fracture Mechanics constraints. Experimental results obtained from the literature, including detailed defect analysis from computer tomography and fractography, were used to check its accuracy. The proposed predictive tool fully exploits the advanced capabilities of machine learning to account for morphological aspects of defects that could not be accounted for otherwise, while at the same time obeying fracture mechanics laws and requiring a smaller experimental dataset . The approach paves the way for new structural design approaches with an unprecedented degree of accuracy.},

Unlike previous studies, we designed surface-type conformal cooling channels (CCC) based on the design concept for additive manufacturing, at a constant depth corresponding to the casting part. Pin fins were installed inside the surface-type cooling channels and aligned through numerical analysis to induce the turbulence of the coolant uniformly through the cooling channel while generating less thermal stress during solidification of the as-cast Al-Si alloy-based product, which increased the cooling efficiency of the proposed ECO mold. Moreover, the ECO mold was utilized to cast an automobile piston to demonstrate its feasibility at an industrial level. The results showed that, the casting process decreased significantly from 133 to 105 s per piston (21\% reduction) compared to the conventional mold with a single columnar cooling channel. Additionally, the average grain size of the ECO mold decreased from 502 to 398 µm. The ultimate tensile strength and Rockwell hardness increased by 12.5\% and 5.5\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Hyperinflammation can lead to tissue injury, organ failure, and even fatalities by overproducing proinflammatory cytokines. The long-term safety and outstanding anti-inflammatory ability of natural products have attracted much attention, but the low solubility and bioavailability limit their application. In this study, PGDE was conjugated with aromatic hydroxy groups of curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin to prepare polyphenolic nano-assemblies. The nano-assemblies showed a comparable capacity for scavenging DPPH and ABTS free radicals with curcumin. The modification not only decreased the cytotoxicity of curcumin but also the anti-inflammation activity was preserved successfully. In vivo tests, NCAs were preferentially located at the inflammatory sites and performed effective therapeutic effects on acute and chronic inflammation models including sepsis, IBD, and liver fibrosis models. The anti-inflammatory activities were primarily realized by suppressing the overproduction of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-β cytokines, and down-regulating the ROS-related NOX-1 and NOX-4. Additionally, NCAs inhibited the activation of the TGF-α/Smad pathway and decreased the production of α-SMA to alleviate collagen deposition in fibrosis mice. This study described a simple method for preparing nano-assemblies of insoluble polyphenols via the carrier-free self-assembly method, which improved the therapeutic effect on inflammatory diseases and broadened the application field of insoluble natural active polyphenols.},

We previously identified a pro-regenerative agent, i.e., hollow dopamine nanoparticles (HPDA) loaded with potent pro-healing peptide RL-QN15 (HPDAlR), with significant skin wound healing activity. In the current study, in consideration of clinical application, we successfully prepared a new zinc alginate hydrogel embedded with HPDAlR (HPDAlR&amp;ZA) to treat diabetic wounds. HPDAlR&amp;ZA exhibited no obvious toxicity against keratinocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human skin fibroblasts (HSFs), and mice. HPDAlR&amp;ZA significantly promoted keratinocyte, HUVEC, and HSF proliferation, as well as HUVEC migration and angiogenesis. HPDAlR&amp;ZA also modulated the expression of cytokines from macrophages. Diabetic mouse full-thickness skin wound and diabetic patient in vitro skin wound models showed that HPDAlR&amp;ZA resisted the inflammatory response by rapidly polarizing M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages, thereby reconstructing blood supply, increasing collagen deposition, and accelerating diabetic wound repair and skin regeneration. In summary, HPDAlR&amp;ZA is a biodegradable hydrogel wound dressing and an efficient treatment strategy for diabetic wound repair, with strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic features.},

Thus, a Janus fibre/sponge composite combining iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs, γ-Fe 2 O 3 ) was fabricated to prevent epithelial invasion and promote alveolar reconstruction. In the scaffold, a poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/polycaprolactone (PP) electrospun layer was covalently bound with a chitosan sponge containing γ-Fe 2 O 3 by polydopamine. The resilient chitosan sponge can easily adhere to the wound surface and encompass haemostatic capability by swelling and forming blood clots to block bleeding. The introduction of IONPs promoted the osteogenesis of rBMSCs, as shown by ALP analysis and cytokine assay. The PP layer maintained its structure integrity and prevented epithelial cells from invading into blood clots or fibroblasts from penetrating through the critical pore size. Assessment with a rat model having one-sided calvarial bone injury further confirmed the effectiveness of Janus scaffolds in facilitating the bone regeneration in the postoperative areas.},

However, this technology still requires more development in order to enable the application of lattice structures in lightweight load bearing structures. The main challenge lies in the structural integrity of additively manufactured lattice structures which holds back exploiting their lightweight potential. While recent research focuses on the influence of process parameters on the mechanical behaviour of lattice structures, less attention is given to geometrical notches issued from sharp edges induced by the structural design. This contribution handles the effect of geometrically induced notches in truss lattice structures. The static mechanical properties of truss-like unit cells are compared to, on the one hand, the common design solution which consists in implementing a fillet radius and, on the other hand, two notch stress optimization methods inspired from existing methods for two-dimensional notches. The comparison encompasses the analytical development of the aforementioned methods as well as their numerical verification and experimental validation for additively manufactured lattices made of AlSi10Mg. Resulting recommendations on design guidelines for improved mechanical properties of truss lattice structures are then discussed.},

In this study, poly(methyl methacrylate-acrylic acid)-alendronate [P(MMA-AA)-ALN] drug-loaded nanoparticles with anti-osteoporosis function were synthesized and introduced into the gentamicin sulfate (GS) loaded PMMA bone cement. The rapidly expandable bone cement with water absorption pathways was constructed by adjusting the particle size of P(MMA-AA)-ALN nanoparticles. More importantly, the sustained release of GS and ALN were creatively achieved by their migration through the water absorption pathways composed of P(MMA-AA)-ALN nanoparticles. The results showed that the cumulative release ratios of GS and ALN in the composites were up to 74.67 ± 1.02\% and 75.23 ± 1.96\%. Meanwhile, the release cycles of GS and ALN were extended to 4 weeks and 15 weeks, effectively preventing infection, and matching the normal bone healing cycle. In addition, the swelling and dual drug release bone cement (SDBC) displayed superior antibacterial activity and biocompatibility.},

To that scope, experimental and simulation analyses have been conducted for Al alloys (AA7075-T6 and AA2017-T4) and dissimilar Friction Stir Welded (FSWed) AA7075-AA2017 joint, under shock pressure of 4.5 GPa (laser power density of 3.5 GW / cm 2 GW/cm2 ). In order to perform proper in-depth material model simulation of these alloys and dissimilar pairs, Johnson–Cook (J-C) material model has been coupled with Grüneisen equation of state using the non-linear explicit code LS-DYNA. For the first time, we provided a way to differentiate between material behaviour in the cross-section and the in-plane rolling and welding direction. What is more, we have provided the link between microstructural features and mechanical properties such as microhardness, residual stresses and the identified material parameters. By achieving this goal, the bigger difference between studied planes was confirmed for strain hardening modulus, strain hardening exponent and strain rate sensitivity parameters. Obtained results and proposed methodology indicate high potential to predict material properties and behaviour of dynamically stressed parts and at the same time can be used for optimization of LSP process.},

  abstract     = {Protecting human body from electromagnetic radiation and enhancing the robustness of wearable devices in complex environments become increasingly important. To address this, a flexible embroidery-based metamaterial absorber (MA) which can absorb electromagnetic waves of specific frequency was proposed in this paper. The MA consists of embroidered frequency selective surface (FSS), scuba knitting fabric and metallized fabric. We firstly propose a simplified simulation model to precisely represent the real-world prototype. Then, the parametric effects on the absorption performance were analyzed using equivalent circuit model and full wave simulation. By comparing the power loss density and the power loss rate of each layer, we discover that the resistive loss of the embroidered FSS plays a dominate role in consuming electromagnetic energy. For in-depth investigations, three prototype samples with high-to-low embroidery densities were fabricated and tested. It was found that the peak absorptivity of second sample (with a medium density of 0.70 mm) can reach up to 99\% at 2.39 GHz, which verifies the effectiveness of embroidery-based MAs. Moreover, the comparable absorption performance of diverse prototypes shows that a suitable embroidery density is the premise for effective electromagnetic energy absorption, which provides a measurable design guideline for the future research in this area.},

However, the lattice cell design of architected cellular materials is highly arbitrary, making the design of architected cellular materials very difficult. In order to overcome these problems, an innovative triple period minimal surface (TPMS) lattice type distribution algorithm based on the maximum strain energy principle is proposed in this paper to optimize the stiffness of the structure. The algorithm establishes the mapping relationship between the relative density of TPMS lattice cells and the surface bias parameter t by generating a voxel model, obtains the equivalent mechanical properties of lattice cells as a function of relative density by homogenization algorithm and function fitting, establishes a TPMS lattice database, and innovatively distributes the TPMS lattice types by selecting the maximum strain energy lattice cells on the basis of the topology optimization results. The experimental results show that the stiffness of the multi-TPMS lattice structure is improved by 55.89\% and 30.15\%, respectively, compared with the two single lattice structures.},

Spurred by the deformability and structural stability provided by veins in insect wings, microscale liquid-core fibers were created, comprising of a polymeric sheath and a liquid core. A microfluidic co-extrusion spinneret was designed, assisted by computational fluid dynamics studies, to achieve such unique liquid-core fibers. Hydraulic pressure transfer tests were successfully applied on fine, up to 10 m long, oil-filled polyamide fibers. The results showed a pressure transfer with a fiber length-dependent delay of ∼ 20–100 s for fiber lengths of ∼ 1–10 m, and a viscoelastic behavior with relaxation times that behave linearly with fiber length. These findings enable the development of resilient and deformable microhydraulic systems within restricted available space, predestined for applications in soft robotics.},

An auxetic behavior with a negative Poison’s ratio is observed for specimens with low helix angles (0°–12°), while specimens with higher helix angles (30°–90°) exhibit a typical buckling behavior and those with intermediate helix angles (13.85°, 16.36°) demonstrate a hybrid helical-like buckling mechanism. Finite-element simulations are performed to elucidate the deformation behaviors and stress distributions under compression. Experimental results show that the helically oriented tubular samples with 90° helix angles yield maximum energy efficiency and compressive strength of 440\% and 124\%, respectively, higher than for the helically oriented tubular samples with 0° angles. Cyclic tests further show that the 0° sample can almost recover to its original shape, while cracks and delamination are observed for the 30° sample after 200 cycles.

  abstract     = {Single-crystal Ni-based superalloys are currently the material of choice for turbine blade applications, especially with the emerging additive manufacturing (AM) that facilitates the manufacture/repair of these single crystals. This promising AM route, however, comes with a dilemma: in the fusion and heat affected zones after e-beam or laser induced melting, one needs a solutionizing annealing to relieve the residual stresses and homogenize the chemical/microstructure. The super-solvus solutionizing temperature is usually adopted from the protocol for the cast superalloys, which almost always causes recrystallization and stray grain growth, resulting in a polycrystalline microstructure and degrading the high-temperature mechanical performance. Here we demonstrate a custom-designed post-printing heat treatment to replace the conventional super-solvus one. The recovery and relatively low temperature diminish the driving force for recrystallization and the movement of stray grain boundaries, without suffocating the chemical/microstructural homogenization thanks to the narrow dendrite width and short element segregation distance. The optimal duration of the heat treatment is proposed to achieve atomic-diffusion mediated chemical homogenization while limiting γ′-particle coarsening in the interdendritic regions. Our strategy makes it practically feasible to resolve several bottleneck problems with one processing/treatment, removing a seemingly formidable obstacle to effective additive manufacturing of superalloy single crystal products.},

Pronounced β -relaxation peaks locating at 643 and 693 K were observed after CTC treatment with diverse thermal temperatures. Specifically, the CTC treated samples exhibiting most remarkable β -relaxation showed tensile plastic strain of 5.2\% at 643 K and 4\% at 693 K, while the as-quenched sample only showed tensile plastic strain of 3\% at 643 K and 2.1\% at 693 K. The pronounced β -relaxation and enhanced tensile plasticity are considered to be originated from the increased structural heterogeneity. The separate β -relaxation peaks result from the different sizes/types of shear transformation zones induced by oscillatory (rejuvenation-relaxation) behavior during thermal cycling. Our results indicate that the CTC treatment has a significant impact on the energy states and structural heterogeneity, which makes it a powerful means to modify the mechanical properties of MGs.},

In present study, a CaCO 3 coating on Mg alloy is developed via hydrothermal method to control the corrosion of Mg2Zn0.2Ca alloy. The morphology and anti-corrosion property of the CaCO 3 protective coating are adjusted by the concentration of MgSO 4 in coating preparation electrolyte. The results reveal that the presence of MgSO 4 stabilizes the precipitation of metastable CaCO 3 crystalline (aragonite and vaterite) and affects the structure and growth rate of the middle calcite layer on Mg alloy surface, which leads to the transformation of cubic calcite into small rhombohedral aggregates in the middle layer as the concentration of MgSO 4 increases. Consequently, the corrosion protection property of the coating is significantly enhanced due to the increased compactness of the coating as the concentration of MgSO 4 increases from 0 mM to 20 mM. Whereas, with further increase of MgSO 4 concentration, the spindle-shaped calcite crystalline formed in the middle layer provides more penetrable boundaries, leading to a lower resistance for Mg substrate. Long-term immersion tests indicate the transformation of CaCO 3 into calcium phosphate, which exhibits a great prospect for Mg alloys as orthopedic implants.},

The morphology and chemical composition of the coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The superhydrophobic coating can withstand at least thirty sandpaper abrasions and sixteen washing treatments without losing its superhydrophobic properties. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic coating demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) (with log reduction = 1.73) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) (with log reduction = 1.74) and effectively prevented biofilm formation. Besides, the excellent biocompatibility of the superhydrophobic coating was verified by hemocompatible and cytotoxic assays. Finally, it was confirmed that the superhydrophobic coating can reduce blood loss and allows for high air permeability in in vitro tests.

For a comprehensive study on the heat treatment effect and the mechanism for developing high-strength CFs, electrical transport properties were measured for the CFs. The transport behaviors in temperature-dependent conductivity and magnetoresistance were also significantly modified, which led to crossover from strong localization to weak localization due to sp 2 carbon ordering. Interestingly, in samples that were subjected to intermediate heat treatment temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1600 °C, anomalous metallic temperature-dependent behavior was observed at low temperatures of below 40 K. This unusual charge transport was analyzed further with a pertinent heterogeneous model employing three-dimensional variable range hopping, weak localization, and linear metallic transport. The results suggest that mixed noncrystalline and crystalline structures with sp 2 /sp 3 carbons, oxygen, and quaternary N groups in CFs enabled the transition behavior at such low temperatures.},

The well-designed biohybrid scaffold exhibited not only a micro/nano fiber-like porous architecture (pore size: 100–200 μm; porosity: 80–90\%), high specific surface area (≈20 m 2 /g), vastly improved mechanical performance, tunable swelling and degradation behaviors but also a sustained release profile of bioactive Si ions up to 21 days. In vitro experiments revealed the excellent biological performance of the resulting biohybrid scaffold, including good biomineralization capacity and biocompatibility, establishing a favorable microenvironment for facilitating cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, osteogenic differentiation, and vascularization. In rat calvarial critical-size defect models, the newly developed biohybrid scaffold could potentially trigger a chain of biological events: stimulating the polarization of M2 macrophages, recruiting endogenous stem cells and endothelial cells at the injury site to enable a suitable regenerative microenvironment for accelerating coupled osteogenesis and angiogenesis, and eventually promoting vascularized bone regeneration.},

In this study, copper (Cu), a multi-functional bioactive ion, is incorporated into the polydopamine (PDA) coating on PEEK surfaces using a metal-catecholamine assembling strategy. This DA-Cu II coating induces a spatial distribution of Cu, exerting biological functions simultaneously through passive contact and active release of Cu. DA-Cu II coated PEEK surfaces exhibit not only superior abilities of osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibiosis but also possess immunomodulatory effects to enhance macrophages-mediated osteogenesis and antibacterial activity. Moreover, the DA-Cu II coated PEEK induces a mild and necessary inflammatory response, exhibiting excellent antibacterial ability and superior osseointegration.

  abstract     = {Hypothermal photothermal therapy, as a non-invasive therapy method, is becoming ever more prevalent. However, due to cellular heat resistance from the generation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the monotonicity of therapeutic modality, the antitumor efficacy is severely restricted. Herein, a self-supplied O 2 multifunctional nanoplatform mediated by glucose oxidase (GOx) is developed, which may combine starvation therapy (ST) and hypothermal photothermal therapy (HPTT) for tumor therapy. The obtained nanoplatform, UM@ICG@GOX@HA (UMIGH), was assembled by the UIO-66 core, MnO 2 , indocyanine green (ICG) and hyaluronic acid (HA). GOx was introduced to decrease the ATP level thus alleviating the HSPs-mediated heat tolerance, while the loaded MnO 2 could decompose intratumoral H 2 O 2 into O 2 , which enhanced the effect of HPTT and ST. Due to the coated HA, UMIGH could target the high expressed CD44 in CT26 tumor cells. The active targeting and NPs-associated passive targeting promoted the uptake of nanoparticles. Furthermore, ICG encapsulated in UMIGH NPs could also accurately image tumors. This synergistic treatment strategy of HPTT and ST exhibited an excellent anti-proliferation effect on colon cancer cells in vitro and mouse xenograft model in vivo , which might bring an informatic strategy for future investigations.},

  abstract     = {The advent of novel processing technologies such as wire-arc additive manufacturing, distinguished by high cooling rates, requires the development of adapted feedstock materials. Here, the advantageous solidification behavior of an Al-Ni-Mg alloy was employed, whereby hot cracking can be omitted through dominant amounts of eutectic solidification. Specimens of this new alloy processed by wire-arc additive manufacturing were investigated in-depth to study the phenomena of microstructure formation and the phenomena governing the mechanical characteristics. For this purpose, the deposits were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, hardness, tensile and fracture toughness testing. Results of microstructure investigations were compared to thermodynamic calculations. The microstructure consists of α-Al/Al 3 Ni colonies separated by α-Al intercolony regions. Minor amounts of Al 3 Zr and Mg 2 Si second phase particles were observed. Mechanical characterization reveals ductile failure after pronounced hardening and substantial isotropic fracture toughness. The mechanical properties are discussed based on the prevalent microstructural characteristics. The presented results provide the basis for future, novel and advanced alloys dedicated for their use in wire-arc additive manufacturing.},

The microstructure and mechanical properties of Al-Mg-Mn-Er-Zr alloy of as-built and heat treated samples have been characterized, which shows: the precipitation of Al 3 Zr primary phase at the boundary of molten pool promotes heterogeneous nucleation and refines the grains, which suppresses the formation of solidification cracking in Al-Mg alloy. To bring the Er-Zr synergistic effect into play during the aging heat treatment, the nano-scale precipitation phase of Al 3 Er that diffuses nucleation at an earlier stage promotes the precipitation of Zr, leading to the formation of Al 3 (Er,Zr) core-shell structure and enhancing precipitation strengthening effect. Under the combined effects of multiple strengthening mechanisms, the yield strength could reach 440 ± 3 MPa; tensile strength, 520 ± 2 MPa and elongation 15.5 ± 1.0\%.},

Monitoring and control of AM processes in real-time can help achieve process stability and repeatability to produce high quality parts. By applying in-situ monitoring methods to the AM process, defects in the printed parts can be detected. In this review, application of both imaging and acoustic methods for the detection of sub-surface and internal defects is discussed. Imaging methods consist of visual and thermal monitoring techniques, such as optical cameras, infrared (IR) cameras, and X-ray imaging. Many studies have been conducted that prove the reliability of imaging methods in monitoring the printing process and build area, as well as detecting defects. Acoustic methods rely on acoustic sensing technologies and signal processing methods to acquire and analyze acoustic signals, respectively. Raw acoustic emission signals can correlate to particular defect mechanisms using methods of feature extraction. In this review, representation and analysis of the acquired in-situ data from both imaging and acoustic methods is discussed, as well as the means of data processing.

A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that γ-Fe 2 O 3 @PSAE has excellent stability in biological medium and inappreciable cytotoxicity. Moreover obvious tumor magnetic resonance imaging contrasts were observed based on response of γ-Fe 2 O 3 @PSAE. Under an alternating magnetic field, the heat generated by the magnetic microspheres γ-Fe 2 O 3 @PSAE thermally ablated H 22 hepatoma cells from Kunming male mice, thereby inhibiting tumors.

The effects of refractory elements on the phase structure, microstructure and mechanical properties of high entropy alloys (HEAs) were systematically studied by means of XRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that the phase composition of all alloys is the face-centered-cubic (FCC) + L1 2 dual-phase structure, and the addition of refractory elements has not changed the phase structure of the alloys. The tensile results show that the yield strength and elongation of the matrix HEA are 750 MPa and 18\%, respectively. The strength of HEAs is improved variously by adding refractory elements. The HEAs with Ta element have the best comprehensive mechanical properties, exhibit excellent strength-ductility combination, with the yield strength and elongation of 950 MPa and 20\%, respectively, and the fracture mechanism changes from complete ductile fracture to mixed brittle-ductile fracture mode. In addition, the HEAs have multi-stage strain-hardening behavior, which has higher strength when the strain-hardening curve has larger fluctuations, which indicates that the HEAs can improve the strength-plasticity matching relationship by a multi-stage strain hardening behavior.},

With a solid solution design on M-site, we demonstrated that the hardness of the Cr 2 AlC MAX phase coating was enhanced by 34.3\% when Cr was partially substituted with V (47 at.\%), and the coating toughness was improved simultaneously. Furthermore, according to the high-temperature tribometer test, both the friction coefficient and the wear rate of the coatings at 900 °C against Al 2 O 3 balls were significantly reduced at 47 at.\% V. This could be attributed to the formation of a large number of molten V 2 O 5 wrapped (Cr, Al) 2 O 3 hard crystal grains, which not only provided a wide range of liquid-phase lubrication, but also prevented the coating from being apt to wear out. Different from the multi-phase compositing, this study suggested a promising strategy to enhance the combined mechanical and tribological performance of MAX phase coatings by M-site V solid solution for harsh applications at a high temperature of 900 °C.},

The consideration is the local distortion propagates from the lattices containing substitution atoms to the bulks. Specifically, the local anisotropic lattice distortion is described by the atomic model based on the minimum energy principle, the non-uniform propagation of the local distortion is expressed by the one-dimension atomic chain model, and the whole-field distortion of SSSs is predicted by superimposing the distortion in the independent atomic chains. The framework is applied not only to predict the lattice constants, track each atoms equilibrium position, but also to estimate the distortion resistance of SSSs, and is validated via ab initio simulations of various SSSs with different types and contents substitution atoms. The research clarifies the origin mechanism and the universal laws of dilatation and lays the fundament for revealing the strengthening mechanism of SSSs.},

  abstract     = {A key aspect in the design of deployable space structures comprising slender elements such as booms is their deployed bending stiffness. In space, due to zero gravitational loading, a high level of bending stiffness is not required to support neighbouring structures, but instead is desirable to resist vibrations generated by the attitude control system. The morphing composite cylindrical lattice that is under development is a structure with significant potential for deployable applications in space, however, concepts developed so far may lack sufficient bending stiffness. Therefore, current work focuses on developing a method of increasing the lattice bending stiffness, while minimising any increase in both mass and stowed volume. These goals are achieved by using additional composite strips mounted adjacent and concentric to pre-existing strips. These strips are attached using pre-existing fasteners, thus, only increasing the weight of the structure by the mass of the composite strips. A finite element model of the new lattice configuration is developed and validated by comparison to experimental results. For this comparison, three different lattice configurations were manufactured, two lattices with a conventional strip configuration, an eight-strip lattice and a four-strip lattice, and a third using a new lattice configuration developed in this work. In comparison with the eight-strip lattice, the new lattice configuration is 32\% less stiff, however it weights 33\% less and stows to approximately half the stowed height. Compared to the four-strip lattice, the new configuration weighs 75\% more, but it is 281\% stiffer while stowing to the same volume. By increasing the deployed bending stiffness, this work makes the morphing cylindrical lattice a more viable candidate for deployable space structures.},

The substantial cost implications of empirical testing has led to industrial demands for reliable and representative wrinkle models. This paper presents a novel modelling method for laminates with wrinkle geometries measured from non-destructive testing and/or sample cross-sections. The resulting finite element modelling pre-processor offers a self-contained system of mesh generation, local material orientation calculation, material assignment, boundary condition selection and solver specification. The approach was validated by comparison with pre-existing analytical models and experimental data. Through the resulting rapid model generation, the influence of various physical wrinkle parameters were assessed at an unprecedented rate and sensitivity. For example, this highlighted the dominant dependence of wrinkle angle on the laminate’s compressive strength. Additionally, increases in wrinkle extent and reductions in amplitude decay rate were shown to be detrimental to mechanical properties. The model was then validated against an experimental study on industrially relevant carbon-epoxy laminate samples to understand the effect out-of-plane waviness on compressive properties. The model results showed good agreement to the experimental values ( &amp;lt; 15\% error) and at least a 32\% reduction in compressive strength.},

In this report, we designed Al 1.5 Co 3.5 Fe 3.5 and Al 1.5 Co 3 Fe 3 Cr MEAs with prominent soft-magnetic property and high resistivity. It is contributed to the special coherent microstructure with ultrafine magnetic body-centered-cubic nanoprecipitates uniformly-distributed into the L2 1 matrix, which could not be changed by ball-milling. Thus, alloy powders possess excellent EM properties, as evidenced by the minimum reflection loss of −42.2 dB at 14.52 GHz and the largest Δf = 7.01 GHz in 5 h-milled Al 1.5 Co 3.5 Fe 3.5 , better than existing alloy powders.

In this study, a composite of silk fibroin and poly(L-lactic acid) was electrospun together to form a porous nanofiber biomaterial with 11 blending ratios to tune the porosity of the single fibers (19.3–49\%). This is highly advantageous as porous fibers effectively promoted cell attachment and proliferation while also manipulating cell growth. The protein-polymer molecular interactions, structures and crystal contents, as well as the melting and glass transition behaviors of the composites were determined. Results reveal that varying silk fibroin content can directly tune the nanopore structure of each individual fiber. The composite nanofibers have a much higher thermal stability when compared to the pure silk or PLA nanofibers. Besides, as the SF concentration increased from 0\% to 100\%, the hydrophilicity of the electrospun composite fibers increased (contact angle decreased from 135° to 103°), and the enzymatic degradation residues also increased from 20\% to 95\%. This study provides a unique method for tuning nano-fabrication properties of electrospun protein-polymer fibers that can be widely useful in the fields of biomedicine and sustainable materials.},

  abstract     = {AA7050-T7451 is a heat-treating aluminum alloy with high mechanical strength, ideal for producing lightweight structural components. Common types of welding lead to structural changes in the material that could decrease their mechanical properties affecting the fatigue life of the joints; however, a solid-state process known as friction stir welding (FSW) have been increasingly used as an alternative solution to reduce these severe effects. This work attempts to study the FSW behavior over 7050-T7451 aluminum alloys through the characterization of the resulting residual stresses and propose a manufacturing quality index based on their magnitude and distribution. An ultrasonic method employing longitudinal critically refracted (LCR) waves was used to determine the longitudinal residual stresses at different distances from the centerline in plates welded with different parameters.The resulting stress distribution is consistent with the literature review, presenting maximum values around 200 MPa at the center of the weld. A quality index was calculated through the average of all stresses in that region. It was found that higher residual stresses are produced with higher traverse and rotational speed (400 mm/min and 908 RPM). Therefore, to improve the process regarding the level of residual stresses, it is recommended to use lower welding tool velocities.},

  abstract     = {Auxetic metamaterials are a type of mechanical metamaterials possessing negative Poisson’s ratios and displaying counter-intuitive deformation behavior, which are useful for a range of potential applications. However, two limitations restrain their further development and practical application. First, most current designs are not isotropic, although isotropic materials offer wide-ranging applications due to their identical properties in different directions. Second, most engineering design problems require multifunctionalities of structures, such as both the auxetic behavior during deformation and thermal stability over various temperatures ranges. To overcome the above two shortcomings, this paper will develop a systematic method for designing novel three-dimensional auxetic microlattices. A density-based topology optimization method will be used to distribute two phases of solid materials within a given cubical design domain, and the optimization is formulated under the assumption that all intermediate designs during the optimization will have at least elastic cubic symmetry. The optimized microlattices will exhibit desired properties, including elastic isotropy, negative Poisson’s ratio, and zero thermal expansion. A newly designed multi-material auxetic microlattice will be numerically demonstrated through finite element analysis to validate its elastic isotropy, auxetic property, and zero thermal expansion for withstanding temperature changes.},

In particular, the influence of the baseplate preheating to 500 °C on microstructure evolution was determined. The microstructure of the as-deposited samples consists of columnar grains orientated parallel to the building direction. Volume fraction of α, β and ω phases, and consequently also microhardness, vary for different positions within the sample due to different thermal history during the printing process. Bottom part of the sample contains increased fraction of α phase due to longer exposure to temperatures favorable for α phase precipitation. Preheating of the baseplate provides additional thermodynamic stabilization of the α phase. Numerical model, predicting the temperature evolution in each layer of the sample during deposition and consequently the ultimate phase composition, was developed.

Additive manufacturing of alloy 718 using Laser Powder Bed fusion (L-PBF) process poses certain challenges pertaining to complex residual stress, micro-segregation of Nb, and undesired Laves phase formation in the as-printed state. The built-up residual stress and undesired brittle phase may lead to cracks and build failures. This article studied residual stress evolution during L-PBF of alloy 718 using Finite Element (FE) thermo-mechanical simulation implemented in Simufact Additive® software. The model adopted the bundling of physical powder in voxel mesh to minimize the computational time and mimic the actual process scenario during part-scale simulation. Experimental flow curves generated from Gleeble 3800® tests at elevated temperatures were utilized to calibrate material property for better accuracy in the FE simulation. The calibrated model was used to study the residual stress evolution during support structure removal. Verification and validation of simulated results were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The simulated value agrees well with the experimental value with a maximum deviation of 7\%. Finally, the experimentally validated model was used to correlate the effect of layer thickness variation on residual stress evolution.},

Optimization of their pore structures is meaningful, whereas it is rarely concerned. This study demonstrates that the pore structure of the perforated cenosphere can be adjusted to achieve a better internal curing performance. Increasing the etching duration can expose the own pores of cenospheres at an etching concentration of 0.7 M, gradually increasing the porosity of the perforated cenospheres. A higher etching solution concentration can significantly increase both size and number of the perforating holes. The results of the desorption properties test showed that more porous perforated cenospheres released up to about 90\% of the carried water to the surrounding environment at a higher rate, thereby achieving better effectiveness in reducing the autogenous shrinkage of low w/b cement mortars. An optimal etching condition that an etching duration of 15 min and a concentration of etching solution of 0.7 M were confirmed to prepare perforated cenospheres to almost eliminate the autogenous shrinkage of cement mortars. In addition, it is confirmed that a non-volatile acid, oxalic acid, can be used to replace hydrochloric acid to prepare the etching solution for cenospheres.},

In-situ Raman investigation and theoretical calculation are conducted to probe into the proton redox process of DPZ organic electrode for the first time. It is demonstrated that three C N electroactive regions in each DPZ molecular unit could be simultaneously coordinated with two protons and the redox reaction between C N and C N bonds is highly reversible upon proton insertion/extraction. As expected, the DPZ organic electrode delivers a large proton-storage capacity of ∼ 218 mAh/g and long-term cycle performance without obvious dissolubility in acidic aqueous electrolyte. For real applications, soft-package and wire-shaped APBs based on such DPZ organic electrode are constructed, and they both achieve outstanding electrochemical characteristics, revealing their great potential applications in low-cost, high-safety, and high-performance energy technologies and portable/wearable electronics.},

The recrystallization features induced by accumulated plastic strain in two temperature ranges (1300–1150 °C and 600–400 °C) are distinctly different from that induced by deformation in one temperature range (1300–1150 °C). The different recrystallized features (area and number of grains) induced by isothermal deformation at temperatures ranging from room temperature to solidus can be attributed to different dislocation features, such as slip band, KW-lock, γ/γ&#39; interfacial dislocations and Low Angle Boundary. Microscopic observations disclose that interactions of multiple slip systems have higher tendency of recrystallization. A close view between deformed and recrystallized samples of different deformation temperatures reveals that the critical kernel average misorientation (KAM) to induce recrystallization is about 0.4°. Furthermore, the number of recrystallized grains is proportional with the average KAM value based on the experimental measurements in a wide temperature range. Isolated recrystallized grains are observed at the stress concentration locations in the low plastic strain zone due to local high misorientation.},

The elastomer with 10\% 4, 4′-diaminodiphenyldisulfide shows tensile strain of 829\% and tensile stress of 5.48 MPa. After introducing 10\% ionic liquid, the ionic conductive elastomer’s conductivity increases to 1.18 × 10 -6 S/cm while still maintaining 580\% break elongation. The elastomers can maintain good stability after cyclic stress–strain test and show high strain sensitivity to small deformation in joint motion signal monitoring. In addition, the elastomers have good shape memory property, cytocompatibility and in vivo biocompatibility. The mechanical response of elastomers was studied by employing the Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic model. Further comparative analysis shows that the local stress concentration is the main factor leading to the failure of the elastomer.

  abstract     = {Intracellular co-delivery of proteins and chemotherapeutics provides a promising strategy for synergistic cancer therapy. However, the lack of delivery systems for controlled intracellular release of both payloads and effective endosomal escape of proteins significantly hinders the anticancer applications of this strategy. Herein, we designed a pH-responsive calcium carbonate mineralization nanoparticle system for concurrent delivery of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and doxorubicin (DOX) into the cytosol. The dual-drug loaded nanoparticles ( Ca NP/DOX/Cyt c) exhibited high stability under physiological conditions but acid-sensitive intracellular release of DOX and Cyt c, and also mediated efficient endosomal escape of Cyt c. As a result, the DOX underwent efficient delivery into the nuclei, and Cyt c successfully got into the cytosol as demonstrated by the confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, Ca NP/DOX/Cyt c mediated enhanced synergistic anti-osteosarcoma effects with significantly improved biocompatibility as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo . In summary, this work highlights the potential of calcium carbonate mineralized nanoparticle system as a universal and potent platform for efficient intracellular co-delivery of proteins and chemotherapeutics.},

  abstract     = {The tumor tissue delivery of nanomaterials and the components’ intracellular location are particularly critical for the effect of tumor treatment. However, the abominable conditions in the tumor microenvironment hinder nanomaterials’ penetration, inducing the therapeutic action only on the surface of tumor tissue. And it is low-efficiency for therapy to spread nanomaterials in relatively expansive cytoplasm or organelles nonspecifically. Herein, we employed a near-infrared (NIR) light-induced self-propelled doxorubicin-loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 capped copper sulfide Janus nanoparticles (CuS-ZIF-8-Dox JNPs) for deep tumor penetration and cancer therapy. The rocket-like Janus structure was rapidly synthesized by a dual-solvent method. Under NIR light irradiation, the rocket-like CuS-ZIF-8 JNPs showed directional wide-range motion. In addition, benefiting from the pH-responsive degradation of ZIF-8, various components were conveyed to the appropriate locations after cell internalization, i.e. , Dox targeted the nucleus, and CuS nanoparticles escaped from lysosomes to the cytoplasm. Taking advantage of the local thermal gradient under the NIR light irradiation and intracellular arrangement for different components, this Janus nanocomposite displayed a deep tumor penetration, and achieved NIR and pH dual-responsive photothermal-enhanced chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo .},

  abstract     = {Particle-reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) with high-volume-fraction of above 40\% are highly attractive in the field of structural materials because they impart enhanced reinforcement properties to metals. However, high-volume-fraction MMCs are not widely used due to their brittleness. Therefore, overcoming the brittleness of the high-volume-fraction composites is the first step to disseminate the high-reinforcement-fraction composites. In this study, the interface bonding of 55 vol\% Al/SiCp composites was strengthened by modifying the interface characteristics to achieve high plasticity of the high-volume-fraction composite. The interface bonding strengthening was conducted by thermal oxidation of SiCp reinforcement. The increased plasticity of the composites was observed as the 62.2\% increased fracture strain in the compression test. The interface modification changed the crack path during a compression test from interface crack to reinforcement particle crack. To investigate the mechanism of interface modification, in-situ neutron diffraction experiments were performed under compression. When the plasticity is enhanced by the interface treatment, most fractures consist of reinforcement fractures rather than interface fractures. Therefore, it is confirmed that controlling the interface treatment is a key factor to improve the plasticity in high-volume-fraction composites. This work shed light on developing new composite material with high-volume-fraction reinforcement.},

It was found that quantitatively correct results are obtained as long as the samples do not exhibit any considerable preferential grain orientation. Optical microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and finite element modeling were used to verify and explain the results obtained by neutron tomography.

Initial research has addressed the influence of process-induced imperfections in lattices, but so far numerical work for TPMS lattices is insufficient. Therefore, in the present study, the structure–property relationships of TPMS lattices, including their imperfections, are investigated experimentally and numerically. The main focus is on a biomimetic Schoen I-WP network lattice made of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processed Ti-42Nb designed for bone tissue engineering (BTE). The lattice is scanned by computed tomography (CT) and its as-built morphology is examined before a modeling procedure for artificial reconstruction is developed. The structure–property relationships are analyzed by experimental and numerical compression tests. An anisotropic elastoplastic material model is parameterized for finite element analyses (FEA). The numerical results indicates that the reconstruction of the as-built morphology decisively improves the prediction accuracy compared to the ideal design. This work highlights the central importance of process-related imperfections for the structure–property relationships of TPMS lattices and proposes a modeling procedure to capture their implications.},

The LP-DED process has been matured for alloys including stainless steels, superalloys, and titanium, but has had very limited research using copper-based alloys, which are important for applications that require high thermal conductivity. This study quantifies the size effects on microstructure, surface metrology, microhardness, and mechanical response to tensile loads for different thicknesses and powder compositions of hot isostatic pressed (HIP) LP-DED Copper-Chromium-Niobium alloy, specifically GRCop-42. To accomplish this, tensile specimens were sectioned from single track build walls in both horizontal and vertical orientations to also investigate possible anisotropic behavior in the part. Results show that microstructure, hardness, surface metrology, and porosity are independent of wall thickness. Uniaxial loading response showed some variations with specimens orientation and size effects. For vertical specimens, thicker specimens showed a 6\% higher elongation than thinner specimens. Horizontal specimens showed close to double the elongation when compared to vertical specimens, where thinner specimens had a higher reduction in elongation than thicker specimens. Additionally, removing the surface effects through polishing practically eliminated the anisotropic behavior between horizontal and vertical specimens along with the observed size effects. To demonstrate size effects dependency on the manufacturing process comparison is made between GRCop-42 alloy produced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) and LP-DED.},

In this study, the newly designed lightweight (ρ ∼ 6.2 g/cm 3 ) Al 0.5 Ti 2 Nb 1 Zr 1 W X (X: 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) RHEAs were prepared. Our results evidence that the microstructure of Al 0.5 Ti 2 Nb 1 Zr 1 W 0.5 RHEA has a BCC structure merged with B2 nano-precipitates, which leads to significant improvement in the specific yield strength (SYS) compared with other RHEAs. Besides, the compressive SYS (σ 0.2 /ρ) of Al 0.5 Ti 2 Nb 1 Zr 1 W 0.5 RHEA at 298 K, 973 K, and 1078 K are as high as 187 MPa g −1 cm 3 , 128 MPa g −1 cm 3 , and 95 MPa g −1 cm 3 , respectively. Interestingly, Al 0.5 Ti 2 Nb 1 Zr 1 W 0.5 RHEA exhibited excellent ductility (greater than68\%) under compression at temperatures from 298 K to 1273 K. The distinct deformation mechanisms at 973 K and 1273 K are discussed as well. Initially, the strain hardening capability is provided by dislocation-dominated deformation. Conversely, with an increase in the strain, the micro-crack development and dynamic recovery (DRX) trigger the conversion from strain-hardening to persistent flow softening when the temperature is raised from 973 K to 1273 K. The persistent flow softening at 1273 K is primarily due to diffusion-controlled dislocation annihilation and continuous (DRX).},

In the present study, the comprehensive properties of an as-cast Cu–Ni–Si alloy were improved by a short process, i.e., continuous extrusion combined with rolling and aging processes, without homogenization treatment. The results indicated that both the mechanical and electrical properties of the alloy at the optimized route were dramatically enhanced. A final microstructure containing fine grain sizes, massive precipitates, and dislocations was obtained, thus contributing to high tensile strength (763 MPa), high electrical conductivity (49.6\% IACS), and good ductility (5.8\% fracture elongation). The strengthening mechanisms were then quantitively calculated. The results showed that the dislocation strengthening, grain boundary strengthening, and precipitation strengthening take 25.2\%, 16\%, and 51.2\% of the total yield strength, respectively. It has also been found that there are two sizes of precipitates and both were identified to be δ 1 -Ni 2 Si. Although the volume fraction of the fine Ni 2 Si is small, it contributes to a large portion of the yield strength. Hence, there is great potential to control the precipitate size to enhance the strength of the Cu–Ni–Si alloy further for this combined technique.},

A novel deep learning model was developed to capture grain growth behavior from training data without making assumptions about the underlying physics. The Physics-Regularized Interpretable Machine Learning Microstructure Evolution (PRIMME) model consists of a multi-layer neural network that predicts the likelihood of a point changing to a neighboring grain. Here, we demonstrate PRIMME’s ability to replicate two-dimensional normal grain growth by training it with Monte Carlo Potts simulations. The trained PRIMME model’s grain growth predictions in several test cases show good agreement with analytical models, phase-field simulations, Monte Carlo Potts simulations, and results from the literature. Additionally, PRIMME’s adaptability to investigate irregular grain growth behavior is shown. Important aspects of PRIMME like interpretability, regularization , extrapolation, and overfitting are also discussed.},

Strategies for the provocation of various inhomogeneities are derived and used to compile datasets comprising the classes balling , incomplete spreading , groove , ridge , spatters , protruding part , scattered powder , and homogenous . A data pipeline is designed to extract image patches ranging up to 6 × 6 mm 2 in size and from 6 µm/pixel to 96 µm/pixel in geometrical resolution.

Seven classes are classified with F1-scores between 97.85\% and 99.71\%. A gradual improvement of the geometrical resolution from 96 µm/pixel to 6 µm/pixel increases the classification performance while requiring smaller patches.

  abstract     = {Moisture in bitumen and at the bitumen-aggregate interface affects the cohesive and adhesive properties of asphalt mixtures, which are critical for the service performance and durability of pavements. This paper aims to investigate the kinetics and thermodynamics of moisture transport in bitumen at various temperatures and relative humidity for different bitumen types. Transport models are introduced to study the moisture transport mechanisms. A parameter optimization approach combined with the finite element method is applied to simulate moisture transport behavior. Results show salient sorption increase at higher relative humidity levels (more than 70\%), indicating the occurrence of clustering of water molecules in bitumen, which can lead to a significant decrease of the diffusion coefficient. Transport models show great quality in simulating experimental results, in which the S-Cluster model provides a detailed explanation of the moisture transport mechanisms and describes better the performance at high sorption levels. The diffusion coefficient, cluster size and activation energy were determined and were found to be linked to the bitumen chemical and structural properties. The transport kinetics and thermodynamics are expected to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of moisture transport behavior in bitumen and further of pavement moisture damage at complex and interacting environmental conditions.},

  abstract     = {Cellular materials and mechanical metamaterials respectively display desirable efficiency and programmability in engineering protection, however, the means to combine their advantages poses a challenge. To break this limit, a universal strategy based on plastic deformation of metals is established to realize flexible, efficient and programmable crashworthiness, which is implemented in three steps. Firstly, cellular material is discretized as multiple self-locked tubes, endowing it with convenient assembling and disassembling processes as well as flexible property tunability to adapt to load characteristics. Then, perforated design is executed mainly to induce efficient progressive buckling mode and superior crashworthiness by creating geometry discontinuities. Finally, nested design is employed to promote space utilization and plateau stress. More critically, multiple step functions with target characteristics can be introduced on stress–strain curve to obtain programmability by controlling parameters of fillers. The windmill-inspired system made of 316L stainless steel is taken as the instance to implement the strategy, and both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions are considered. The strategic feasibility is validated by experiments and simulations, and specific energy absorption, energy absorption efficiency and force efficiency respectively increase by 53.8\%, 13.5\% and 77.9\%. This research opens a new avenue for combing efficient mechanical behavior and flexible property programmability.},

Atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy revealed that a fine distribution of GP-zones, was responsible for the strength after cyclic ageing. Ten days further natural ageing allowed these early-stage clusters to grow into more stable ones, thereby improving the mechanical response. This resulted in similar tensile strength and uniform elongation as for the peak aged condition by artificial ageing. It was found that fracture of cyclic aged samples occurred earlier, in the form of a ductile slant shear fracture without necking in advance. In all cases, the slant fracture started at about the same point as reaching maximum strength, i.e., at the uniform limit. However, by an artificial ageing treatment after the cyclic hardening treatment, an ordinary necking behavior was seen, similar as for the peak aged samples. Natural aged samples had similar GP-zones as the cyclic hardened ones, and the same slant fracture mode, indicating that the precipitation structure controls the fracture type. Similar behavior was observed for two different Al-Zn-Mg alloys, with and without copper.},

The 5Zr alloy exhibits the least drop of tensile strength and it shows the best comprehensive property of the plasticity and the tensile strength. Zr reduces α-Nb 5 Si 3 and weakens the load-carrying capacity at high temperatures. Meanwhile, γ-Nb 5 Si 3 are introduced by the addition of Zr which improve the plasticity and provides a significant work hardening to recover the tensile strength at 1250 °C. New super-dislocations are discovered for the first time with a slip system of ( 11 2 ¯ 0 ) &amp;lt;11¯01&amp;gt;(112¯0) in γ-Nb 5 Si 3 which significantly improve the plasticity and promotes a coordinated deformation between Nb solid solutions and γ-Nb 5 Si 3 . Due to the different phase compositions, two models are derived to discuss the deformation mechanisms at high temperatures. In order to achieve an enough tensile strength at high temperatures, it is suggested that microstructures consisting of two phases is more beneficial to provide a good load-carrying capacity (Nbss/α) or a significant work hardening (Nbss/γ) at high temperatures.},

However, reading and writing information is still a challenge, as external reading/writing heads have to be implemented near the tracks. The writing component should be made of a bilayered soft/hard coupled magnetic system, so that information could be easily written by external magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a Ni 90 Cu 10 /Fe 20 Co 80 segmented NW as the writing element, in which magnetic information is written by applying external magnetic fields. Using low-cost template-assisted electrodeposition methods, single, bi- and multi-segmented NW hexagonal arrays of NiCu and FeCo/Au were fabricated. A throughout magnetic characterization using magnetic hysteresis loops, ferromagnetic resonance and first-order reversal curves (FORCs) revealed that the soft segment (NiCu) induced the reversal of the hard segment (FeCo) in a two-step process, reducing its coercive and effective anisotropy fields when coupled. Finally, micromagnetic simulations certified the experimental observations of a multi-step reversal process. This work demonstrates the important role of interface interactions for the future implementation of an in-line writing component in a 3D racetrack memory device, enhancing their potential applicability.},

Ddensity function theory calculation results demonstrated that the Co 16 X 6 Si 7 -G phase possesses the advantage of good thermodynamic stability and low misfit with the ferritic matrix. On the basis of calculation, we successfully prepared three model alloys, i.e., the Fe20Cr5Co2Si1Ti, Fe20Cr5Co2Si0.75Nb and Fe20Cr5Co2Si1.5Ta (wt.\%), who make a good trade-off between strength, ductility and good oxidation/corrosion resistance. Our observation verified that the Co 16 X 6 Si 7 -G phase can precipitate within 1 h with proper heat treatment, showing a cube-on-cube orientation relationship with its parent matrix. The introduction of G phase precipitates amazingly increases the micro-hardness of model alloys by ∼ 160 HV after aging at 873 K. And the precipitates within the ferrite phase have not been observed to grow coarser even after 96 hrs aging treatment. Furthermore, excellent mechanical properties of ∼ 1.2 GPa tensile strength and ∼ 10\% total elongation have been achieved after 6 hrs aging time at 873 K. These findings indicate the Co 16 X 6 Si 7 -G phase would be a promising candidate as a strengthening medium and provide valuable insight into the screen of precipitates for the development of high-strength and ductile steels.},

However, the understandings on the mechanical responses of lightweight TPMS structures by μLPBF are yet to be updated. Herein, stainless steel 316L TPMS shell lattices (i.e., Primitive (P), Diamond (D) and Gyroid (G)) with different shell thicknesses and cell orientations were fabricated by µLPBF. Low-density TPMS structures with shell thickness as small as ∼100 μm and relative density ∼5\% were realized. Quasi-static compression tests and finite element modelling were conducted to study their compressive responses. Their light-weighting potential related to the scaling behavior of mechanical properties as a function of relative density was analyzed. Results show with increasing relative density, the deformation mechanism transforms from localized collapse to homogeneous bulk deformation. P-type TPMS exhibits the highest anisotropy of stiffness, strength and energy absorption capability, while G-type TPMS is near-isotropic. [1 0 0] oriented d -type TPMS shows the highest strength and best light-weighting potential. Compared with conventional LPBF, the µLPBF TPMS structures demonstrate higher mechanical properties and superior light-weighting potential.

In-situ temperature measurement by a high-speed thermographic camera and part-scale thermal analysis by the finite element method revealed that the constricted geometry suppressed thermal diffusion in the building sample, thereby increasing the sample temperature to over 1000 °C and maintaining the temperature at 700–1000 °C throughout the LPBF process. Multi-track thermal analyses also revealed that both the temperature gradient and solidification rate decreased by more than one digit, leading to a three-digit decrease in the cooling rate. Compared to the parts with the usual thermal history, the parts built at such high temperature had larger crystal grains elongated along the building direction, thicker cellular structures, more carbide precipitates, and a reduction of microhardness. From these results, a solidification map was created based on the correlations between the temperature gradient and solidification rate and the microstructures, and the effects of the elevated temperature on the epitaxial grain growth were also discussed. Consequently, it was demonstrated that the solidification behaviors could be controlled directly during the LPBF process without any additional heating mechanism.},

The mechanical properties under ultrasonic vibration-assisted tension (UVAT) were investigated. Subsequently, the rheological behavior under the effect of ultrasound was analyzed. The influences of the vibration amplitudes and vibration modes on the microhardness and microstructure were explored. The results indicated that Ti 3 Al behaved obviously an acoustic softening after introducing ultrasonic energy, and the degree of softening was positively correlated with amplitude. There was a “competitive” relationship between the acoustic softening and acoustic residual hardening effects. The maximum stress and microhardness reductions were 206.13 MPa and 6\% when the amplitude was 6.55 μm and 1.31 μm, respectively. The fracture mode evolved from ductility dimple fracture to a mixed-mode of cleavage pattern and brittle fracture. The metallographic organization revealed a “defective phase” structure in the α 2 phase and B2 matrix.

Here, an easy sacrificial 3D printing method based on commercial desktop 3D printer and water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to construct effective hydrogel channel networks is introduced. Specifically, i) commercial PVA consumables are printed to be sacrificial templates; ii) gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) solution is cast to encapsulate the sacrificial template; iii) the sacrificial template is dissolved to form channel networks. PVA is a water-soluble sacrificial material with sufficient dissolution time and high mechanical strength, which can avoid the disadvantages of classic sacrificial materials (sugar and Pluronic F127). High roundness of printed PVA filaments results in high roundness of the channel networks. The interconnected channel networks accelerate the supply of oxygen/nutrients and promote cell growth. And with a period of culture, the higher the channel networks density, the better the cell growth. Additionally, PVA sacrificial templates have high stability and long-term preservation, facilitating transportation, circulation and use, which is conducive to the manufacturing and promotion of hydrogel-based constructs with channel networks. Taken together, our easy strategy of manufacturing hydrogel constructs with channel networks has broad application prospects, such as 3D cell culture, construction of functional tissue in vitro or tissue repair in vivo etc.},

Although many potential therapeutic targets have been reported, the therapeutic effect needs to be further improved. Herein, we report a strategy to specifically target inflammation site via anti-ICAM-1 antibody bonded antibacterial peptides polymeric nanoparticle. Antibacterial peptide (KR-12) grafted amphipathic PCL- b -P(OEGMA- co -AMA)- g -Cys-KR-12 block copolymer and PCL- b -P(OEGMA- co -AMA)- g -biotin block copolymer were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization and click chemistry.

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is highly expressed on the surface of inflammatory endothelial cells, and the anti-ICAM-1 antibody can specifically bind to it. To obtain the anti-ICAM-1-AMPNP nanoparticles, biotinylated anti-ICAM-1 antibodies were bonded on the surface of AMPNP nanoparticles through the biotin-avidin system. The anti-ICAM-1-AMPNP nanoparticles had low systemic toxicity and exhibited ideal antibacterial property against drug-resistant bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. The anti-ICAM-1-AMPNP nanoparticles exhibited favorable targeting capabilities to inflammation endothelial cells in vitro and significantly reduced the inflammatory response of CLP mice in vivo .

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has quickly emerged as a promising technology to manufacture Shape Memory Alloy (SMA)-based components of complex geometries. 3D-printed High Temperature SMAs (HT-SMAs) components can enable applications that demand operating temperatures well beyond conventional NiTi SMAs. Here, a detailed printability assessment of NiTiHf HT-SMAs fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM is conducted for the first time. Specifically, the regions associated with lack of fusion, keyholing, and balling regimes are quantitatively classified through an efficient printability assessment framework. Nearly porosity-free specimens are achieved from the predicted good printable region. The effects of key processing parameters (laser power, scanning speed, and hatch spacing) on the microstructure variation and phase transformation characteristics are studied systematically. A positive correlation is observed between the transformation temperatures and volumetric energy density ( E V EV ). Beyond a critical E V EV of 100 J/mm 3 , the transformation temperatures become insensitive to further increases in E V EV . At identical or similar energy density levels, the individual change of laser power, scanning speed, or hatch spacing alters the transformation behavior to a certain extent. It is hypothesized that to a large extent, this behavior is due to the effects that processing conditions have on the differential evaporation of Ni from the melt pool. A model connecting thermal histories, scanning strategy and chemistry changes is found to be consistent with this hypothesis. It is shown that the transformation temperatures in AM NiTiHf HT-SMAs can be varied over a range of more than 160 ° ° C by controlling Ni evaporation through altering processing parameters.},

  abstract     = {A combination of first-principles calculations, Weiss molecular field theory and density functional perturbation theory is combined to systematically evaluate the magnetic-field-induced thermodynamic properties of the alloy carbide M 7 C 3 in steel. Special emphasis is focused on the self-magnetic and the external magnetic-field-induced magnetic contribution determined by extending the magnetic heat capacity. The self-magnetism origins from the 3d orbit contribution of the Fe atoms which constituted the carbon-containing trigonal prism. The magnetic-field-induced Curie temperature which triggers the boundary of the long and short-range magnetic order closely related to the Cr content and the magnetic field strengths. The higher external magnetic-field-induced Gibbs energy change provides a potential precipitation strategy in advance for the alloy carbides M 7 C 3 which is well in agreement with the experimental results. Our insights further will extend the mechanistic understanding of magnetic-field-induced phase transformation in ferromagnetic Fe-based alloys, emphasizing the role of external field in minimizing energy and guiding new alloy design.},

Through innovative designing of the electrode structure, the welding current distribution and the weld structure were optimized to produce a thin and uniform intermetallic layer with its thickness below 1.2 μm. Furthermore, the faying interface morphology of aluminum and steel dissimilar materials was changed from a traditional flat surface to an interface with a deep bulge into the aluminum weld. It was found that resistance spot weld had a considerable tensile-shear load but poor ductility and energy absorption due to the presence of a weak bonding area around the periphery of the joint, where facilitated the crack initiation and rapid propagation. The following laser spot welding process was conducted in the weak bonding area of the resistance spot welding joint, which inhibited rapid propagation of the cracks along the faying interface avoiding the interface fracture. Compared with resistance spot welding joints, the tensile-shear peak load and energy absorption were increased by 18.2\% and 424.8\% for hybrid welding joints, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Interface engineering such as grain refinement, multilayer structure was reported to be efficient strategy to enhance the irradiation tolerance by promoting the defects annihilation. However, rapid accumulation of helium atoms at interface would lead to high density bubbles and induce interface crack. In this study, we propose a new strategy to address the root causes of bubble formation by releasing He through the designed coherent interface (CI) which is formed by epitaxial growth between two sublayers without sacrifice the mechanical properties. To reveal the enhancement of CI on the irradiation tolerance, the mechanical properties and microstructure evolution of TiSiN/CrN multilayers have been investigated before and after He+ irradiation. TiSiN/CrN coatings reveal obvious amorphization at top-surface and large amount of bubbles have been observed at interfaces. The variation of hardness of the irradiated coatings depends on the competition between softening effect and hardening effect, induced by amorphization and bubble respectively. With the formation of CI across the sublayers, He atoms diffuse through the CI to deeper area beyond the ion projected range, decreasing density and size of the bubble at layer interface. Therefore, we present a new strategy of designing protective multilayer coatings for nuclear reactor through the introduction of CI.},

The results reveal that corrosion resistance of four alloys increases following the order LZ116 &lt; LZ113 ≈ L 11 &lt; LZ111. Besides, filiform-like corrosion occurs at early corrosion stage for the four alloys, while additional pitting corrosion preferentially emerges in the L 11, LZ113 and LZ116 alloys with immersion time. The small alloying Zn can reduce corrosion rate of Mg-11Li alloys, and excess Zn will accelerate the corrosion due to the existence of micro-galvanic effect between second phase and matrix. Regarding of the surface film, double layers of considerable thick outer layer and inner layer can be observed on the top of L 11 and LZ111. Nevertheless, small alloying Zn is prone to modify the surface film and contributes to the high corrosion resistance of LZ111 alloy, while high Zn concentration results in the rapid corrosion damage of surface films on the LZ113 and LZ116 alloys and further elevate corrosion rate.},

Several promising attempts have been made to restore the durability of PA wearing courses by using surface treatment (ST) emulsions. However, the working mechanism of the ST emulsion is still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the penetration behavior of the ST emulsion in damaged PA. X-ray CT scanning was performed to monitor the changes in the pore microstructure of PA specimens under three selected ST conditions. The spatial distribution of ST emulsion residue was back-calculated and 3D visualized through image analysis. The coating efficiencies and thickness distributions of ST emulsions were quantitatively estimated to characterize their penetration status. The analysis results showed that the distribution of ST emulsions in damaged PA presents gradient characteristics with a deepest penetration depth of around 20 mm. The ST application reshaped the interconnected-pore microstructure. The PA specimen treated by ST emulsion with best coating efficiency and thickest coating film showed the best performance recovery among the three ST conditions. The outcomes of this study are expected to help optimize the performance of the ST technology for PA, thus contributing to more durable PA pavements.},

Furthermore, calculations based on density functional theory show that the observed microstructure is strongly correlated with changes in the electronic structures of Fe atoms around the Si impurities. In particular, electron localization around the Si impurities significantly alters the stacking fault energy, which promotes the formation of ε-martensite and nanoscale twin boundaries, while the Jahn-Teller splitting caused by Si dopants results in a FCC-to-BCC phase transition with a misorientation angle of 8° between the ( 200 ) γ (200)γ and ( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ) α (1¯1¯0)α .

  abstract     = {Shear assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE) is a solid-phase processing technique that adds an additional shear force as compared with a conventional extrusion approach. Recently, ShAPE has demonstrated the capability of extruding high-performance aluminum alloy 7075 (AA7075) tubes at speeds up to 12.2 m/min without surface tearing. However, the relationship among the ShAPE processing parameters, thermomechanical conditions, contact conditions, heat generation, and microstructure evolution remains primarily empirical because an insightful understanding of the associated physics is still lacking. To help elucidate these relationships, this work proposes a thermomechanical meshfree model for the first time for ShAPE processing of AA7075 using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The meshfree model is first validated thoroughly by experimental data in terms of material flow, die face temperature, and extrusion force with various processing parameters. The validated model is then used to analyze the steady-state contact conditions and heat generation rates during ShAPE processing. Distributions of the average grain size of AA7075 being extruded are calculated using the SPH model output. The meshfree model results reveal that extrusions conducted at lower temperatures and higher strain rates yield more refined grains and possibly higher material strength, which is also consistent with the experimental observations.},

Herein, we report a biomimetic mineralization strategy, based on stoichiometric polyacrylic acid (PAA) complexation-precipitation process, to facilitate the development of nCaP as bioimaging agents. As a result, the monodisperse and sub-10 nm europium-doped calcium phosphate nanodots (PAA-Eu:CaP NDs) is controllably obtained with enhanced fluorescence properties, tumor passive targeting and bioimaging ability. Compared with europium-doped calcium phosphate nanoparticles (Eu:CaP NPs), the fluorescence emission, quantum yield and lifetime of PAA-Eu:CaP NDs are significantly improved up to 3.84, 4.48 and 5.59 times, respectively. Deriving from the synergy of surface effect and organic/inorganic hybrid crystal field effect, such CaP matrix brings to local asymmetry environment and distinguished anti-quenching for Eu 3+ ion. The strongest radiance signal is improved to 117\% for in vivo imaging; moreover, the tumor accumulation is obviously increased to 5.15 times, and 7.09 times for tumor permeability. The accumulation is decreased 80.2\%, 79.4\% and 70.2\% in liver, spleen and lung suggesting lower clearance by mononuclear phagocyte system, while it’s increased up to 15.4 times in kidney indicating higher renal clearance.

We found that the serrated behavior can be dominated by microstructure, not necessarily initiated under the intervention of temperature and strain rate, which stimulated the exploration of the dependence between structural heterogeneity and serrated heterogeneity. The time series of strain and strain rate were used to explain the formation and transformation of Portevin-Le Chatelier types in serrated heterogeneity. Since the time series of strain rate possessed intense periodicity and the peaks were at similar levels, serrated flow was inclined to Type A. Once the periodicity was broke or/and the peaks sharply increased, it would induce the failure of Type A and promote the transformation to the Type B with discontinuous propagation. In addition, we found that the serrated heterogeneity decreased with the increase of texture strength, while the increase of precipitated heterogeneity would strengthen serrated heterogeneity. Ultimately, the dependence between structural heterogeneity and serrated heterogeneity was discussed, which is beneficial to understand the nature of the material within SZ and the uniformity of processing area.},

  abstract     = {Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can harvest various forms of mechanical energy from the surrounding environment and convert them into electrical energy efficiently. Harvesting wind energy from the environment by TENG could be an ideal way to achieve self-powered sensing systems. Herein, a novel calliopsis-inspired biomimetic TENG (C-TENG) was designed for harvesting wind energy and a self-powered wind-parameter sensor. The open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) and short-circuit current ( I sc ) of one unit C-TENG can reach 61.7 V and 0.34μA under a wind speed of 15 m/s at a frequency of 5 Hz, and the peak output power is 11.57 mW/m 2 under a load resistance of 100 MΩ. This not only collects wind energy effectively but also could be utilized to detect wind speed and direction as a self-powered wind sensor. In this study, we demonstrate a novel type of contact-separation mode TENG in calliopsis structure for wind energy harvesting and promote novel self-powered wind sensors for meteorological monitoring, agricultural production, and the nautical industry.},

Due to the high price and scarcity of the noble metal, low-cost and high-efficiency noble-metal-alternative as Ti 3 C 2 MXene is greatly anticipated. Herein, the ReS 2 @Ti 3 C 2 based photodetector is fabricated by liquid-phase exfoliation technique combined with electrophoretic deposited method. The ReS 2 @Ti 3 C 2 photodetector exhibits a high photocurrent density approximately 5.98 μA/cm 2 , wide detection ability in UV–vis region, and outstanding flexibility and folding resistance. The main reasons for the improved photodetection performance in ReS 2 @Ti 3 C 2 composites are the superior electron conductivity and the metallic properties of Ti 3 C 2 and strong charge transportation at the heterostructure interface. This work offers an effective way to improve the performance of 2D flexible optoelectronic devices by doping non-noble metallic conductors.},

  abstract     = {Porous scaffolds can be used for treating bone defects. To manufacture porous scaffolds similar to bone, two types of ceramic scaffolds with different porosity, namely, octagon and rhombus scaffolds were designed and fabricated by Digital Lighting Process technology. Compression test, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and in vitro cell experiment were conducted for systematic investigation of the properties of the scaffolds. The results showed that the elastic modulus of alumina octagon and rhombus lattice structure was within 0.5–4 GPa. Through the CFD simulation, the permeability of the scaffold was found to be in the range of 4.10 × 10 −9 to 2.32 × 10 −8 m 2 and the wall shear stress of different structures ranged from 4.9 × 10 −4 to 84.4 mPa. Live/dead staining and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay showed that all groups were biocompatible and beneficial to cell proliferation except for octagon structure with 1.049 mm pore and rhombus structure with 0.6 mm pore. Analysis of the results of the mechanical properties, CFD simulations, and in vitro cell studies indicated that the porous scaffolds suitable for bone engineering were 0.566 mm-pore-size octagon unit and 1.0 mm-pore-size rhombus unit with elastic modulus of 3834.9 and 599.8 MPa, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Multicomponent carbides have gained interest especially for ultra-high temperature applications, due to their ceramic hardness, good oxidation resistance and enhanced strength. In this study the phase formation, stability and mechanical properties of (HfNbTiVZr)C multicomponent carbide coatings were investigated. Phase stability was predicted by the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) methods. This revealed that the multicomponent solid solution phase is only stable at elevated temperatures, namely above 2400 °C. At lower temperatures a phase mixture was predicted, with a particular tendency for V to segregate. Magnetron sputtered thin films deposited at 300 °C exhibited a single NaCl-type multicomponent carbide phase, which attributes to the kinetic stabilisation of simple structures during thin film growth. Films deposited at 700 °C, or exposed to UHV annealing at 1000 °C, however, revealed the decomposition of the single-phase multicomponent carbide by partial elemental segregation and formation of additional phases. Thus, confirming the CALPHAD predictions. These results underscore the importance of explicitly considering temperature when discussing the stability of multicomponent carbide materials, as well as the applicability of CALPHAD methods for predicting phase formation and driving forces in these materials. The latter being crucial for designing materials, such as carbides, that are used in applications at elevated temperatures.},

In this study, a periodic hybrid method for the TPMS (triply periodic minimal surface) structures is proposed, maintaining the original surface connectivity and structural strength. It is implemented by the combination of implicit function Ψ ( x , y , z ) Ψ(x,y,z) and transition function η x , y , z ηx,y,z of the TPMS governing equation. Furthermore, three classical TPMS, i.e., P (Schwarz Primitive), IWP (Schoen I-WP) and FRD (Schoen F-RD), are represented to study the elastic properties of hybridizations using FE (Finite Element) computational method and experiments. Through the RVE-based (Representative Volume Element) homogenization method, it is demonstrated how hybridization of TPMS expands the designable range of elastic modulus. In addition, the elastic properties of the hybridizations, such as axial modulus, diagonal modulus and anisotropy, etc., can be quantificationally tailored by turning the formal parameters of TPMS.

These alternative fuel blends had previously passed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification process as drop-in fuels with the aim of reducing the environmental imprint of conventional jet fuels. The time-dependent absorption behavior of Jet A and these alternative fuel blends into three different types of carbon/epoxy composites were studied, and no significant differences in fuel absorption were observed for different fuels for a similar composite. The fuel uptakes were low for all three composites, varying from 0.04 to 0.36 wt\%. However, the arrangement of fiber tows and individual filaments within plies appeared to affect fuel uptake. Additionally, the effects of the absorption of all five fuels on the composites&#39; glass transition temperature ( T g ) were investigated. The composite T g values decreased in the range of 3.1–19 °C for T g and 1.8–20.6 °C for T t for all specimens after fuel absorption.

Flat conductor surfaces are ideal for microbump soldering and flip-chip fabrication methods and concave/convex designs increase the number of available electrode reaction sites for sensor applications. 2D/3D multiphysics simulations are performed comprising: (1) electrochemistry modeling with the Nernst-Planck and Butler-Volmer formulations for mass transfer and reaction kinetics, and (2) a deformed geometry physics module to track the growing electrode during electrodeposition. Simulation results are compared to directly corresponding experimental work, with positive correlation.

Unlike conventional nanoindentation procedures for thin films, a deeper indentation depth ( ≈ 30\% of film thickness) is adopted to accurately identify the film properties even with significant substrate deformations. Both sphero-conical and Berkovich tips are employed to ensure unique solutions. A complex mapping function of inverse analysis is replaced by establishing ANN between nanoindentation (features) and material (targets) parameters. The established ANN model is trained with the database generated via systematic finite element analyses (FEA). The trained ANN model is experimentally validated by estimating the material properties of Zr 55 Cu 30 Ag 15 TFMG deposited on two different substrates (Si and soda lime glass). The maximum difference of plastic indentation energy between experiments and FEA values using the estimated film material properties was within 3\%.},

  abstract     = {Grain boundaries (GBs) are microstructures in polycrystalline materials, which influence the mechanical properties of materials significantly. Simulation is an indispensable means to study GBs due to its high flexibility. However, the existing GB simulation models mostly focus on a single simulation scale, lack the consideration of the grain boundary misorientation angle (GBMA) characteristic and fail to describe the coupled elastic–plastic damage behavior between grains and GBs accurately. To describe the influence mechanism of GB on the mechanical behavior of materials accurately, a GBMA-considered multi-scale modeling method for polycrystalline materials is proposed in this paper. The method is based on molecular dynamics (MD), the crystal plasticity finite element method and the cohesive zone model, which considers the GBMA information at grain and atomic scales comprehensively. Firstly, a GB geometric model containing GBMA characteristic is generated at grain scale through EBSD information. Then the GB cohesive parameters are obtained at the atomic scale by MD simulation. Finally, some experiments are performed for verification, which indicates the high accuracy of the proposed method. Furthermore, three models with the same geometric shape and different grain orientation and GBMA are established to study the influence of GBMA on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials.},

This alloy shows high dynamic compressive strength (1583 MPa), high dynamic compressive plasticity (35\%), high elevated-temperature tensile strength (414 MPa at 800 °C), and low elevated-temperature plasticity (6\% at 800 °C). The penetrating experiments showed that the Ti-17Al-29Nb alloy liner penetrated through the 600-mm-thick C40 concrete target, forming large penetration holes. Although the penetration depth was slightly lower than that of the most commonly used pure copper liner, the diameter of the exit hole was 2.1 times that of the pure copper liner. The high jet tip velocity (7651 m/s) and large jet diameter (a maximum of 0.28 CD) were the key factors to form the high penetration depth and large penetration hole. This study not only brings a new type of SCL material with excellent penetration performance against reinforced concrete targets but also provides a new research direction for the design and selection of the SCL materials.},

  abstract     = {A multiscale framework was developed to predict the elastic properties of carbon nanotube (CNT)–epoxy composites. The interfacial vacuum layer between the CNTs and epoxy was equivalent to transversely isotropic elastomer. The elastic constants were calibrated based on the interaction energy density in the molecular dynamics simulations; the results exhibited significant differences between these constants. The out-of-plane shear modulus (46.64 MPa) is four orders of magnitude smaller than the in-plane Young’s modulus (362.68 GPa). Subsequently, representative volume elements containing transversely isotropic interphases were developed using the finite element method and analysed comparatively to models without interphases. The results indicated that their difference in the Young’s modulus enhancement ratio was sensitive to the CNT aspect ratio. The enhancement ratio of the model containing the interphase was lower when the CNT aspect ratio exceeded a certain value. This difference increased with increasing CNT aspect ratio and was significant at high CNT aspect ratios (7.35\% when the aspect ratio reached 30). In addition, shear-lag analysis indicated that the interphase increased the interfacial load transfer length. This framework provides efficient interfacial simulations, giving a more accurate prediction of bulk elastic properties and can be extended to a wider range of nanocomposites.},

One effective strategy is to develop and implement lightweight yet high-performance materials as alternative solutions for conventional automotive materials such as cast iron and steel. Herein, a systematic review of available lightweight materials to produce next-generation automobiles is provided, including light alloys, high-strength steels, composites, and advanced materials in the ongoing research. By investigating the entire life cycle of automotive materials, physical/mechanical properties, characterization, manufacturing techniques, and potential applications of specific lightweight materials are discussed. Both the advantages and drawbacks of the reviewed materials are summarized, yielding the appropriate application scenarios for different lightweight materials. Given the future challenges, on expectations, the development of versatile advanced materials or improvement of the manufacturing/treatment techniques can be rather promising to resolve the possible bottlenecks and, in turn, enables more capable, safer, durable, and environmental-friendly vehicles.},

This can increase the rate of inspection and enable inspection under obstructions. This paper investigates the instantaneous phase characteristics of the shear horizontal guided waves for various defect depths and widths. The Gaussian process regression is then evaluated for estimating the minimum remaining wall thickness between a pair of transducers. A Gaussian process regression model is built using the fusion of large-scale simulated and low-scale real experimental data. For this purpose, a more precise model of an electromagnetic acoustic transducer is initially built by integrating both electromagnetic and elastic wave fields. Then the simulated data set is built after having been calibrated using a genetic algorithm. The examination of an unseen simulated evaluation data set shows that 96\% of data has an error during thickness gauging of less than 10 per cent of wall thickness. Finally, an experimental testing data set containing three different defects with depths of 3.7, 5.7 and 9.2 mm was examined, resulting in a good depth prediction of large defects with less than 1 mm error for defects wider than one wavelength.},

In this study, the TNTZ/Zn micro/nano-composites were prepared by doping Zn nanoparticles onto Ti-35Nb-2Ta-3Zr (TNTZ) surface through the friction stir processing (FSP) technique. The results of material characterization revealed the homogeneous distribution of Zn, the presence of α″ martensite, and the increase in microhardness in the stir zone. Due to the solid metallurgical bonding between Zn NPs and substrate, Zn ions were released slowly and may be biologically responsive through body fluid corrosion. In terms of biological activity, the expression of adhesion-related protein vinculin and osteogenic differentiation genes were up-regulated by TNTZ/Zn, which improved the early adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal stem cells. Besides, TNTZ/Zn presented excellent antibacterial properties, and direct contact with the fine grain surface containing Zn NPs may be the dominant mechanism. TNTZ/Zn micro/nano-composites have excellent mechanical properties, osteogenic differentiation and antibacterial properties, providing an efficient strategy for titanium alloy surface modification and showing tremendous potential in dental applications.},

  abstract     = {Promoting refractory wound healing remains a major therapeutic challenge. Here, a pain reflex-inspired hydrogel responsive to inflammatory microenvironmental conditions was developed and used to treat chronically infected diabetic wounds. This material was produced by reacting ε-Polylysine, which exhibits antibacterial properties, with oxidized hyaluronic acid to yield a dynamic Schiff base-crosslinked hydrogel capable of undergoing triggered dissociation in response to the lower microenvironmental pH found within refractory wounds. This hydrogel exhibited intrinsic antimicrobial activity owing to the incorporation of ε-Polylysine within the hydrogel network. To imbue the hydrogel with low pH-inducible anti-inflammatory and angiogenic activity, Schiff base bonds were used to capture Deferoxamine (DFO)-loaded amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs-NH 2 @DFO) on this hydrogel skeleton. The reflexive behaviors of the hydrogel make it ideally suited to facilitating wound healing in response to excessive local inflammation. The resultant intelligent hydrogel was highly biocompatible and exhibited robust antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo, thus effectively promoting the healing of chronically infected diabetic wounds. This novel hydrogel therefore holds great promise as a tool to promote refractory wound healing.},

  abstract     = {The realisation of sophisticated hierarchically patterned multiphase steels has the potential to enable unprecedented properties in engineering components. The present work explores the controlled creation of patterned multiphase steels in which the patterns are defined by two different crystal structures: face centre cubic or fcc (austenite) and body centre cubic or bcc (martensite). These austenite/martensite mesostructures are generated by solid–solid phase transformations during the application of localised laser heat treatments in a Fe-Ni-C alloy. In particular, four patterned configurations are analysed in this work consisting of one or two horizontal austenite line structures imprinted in a base of as-quenched or tempered martensite. Digital image correlation analysis during tensile testing of the developed materials showed that both the strength of the base martensite and the mesostructure at the gauge have a strong effect on the resulting properties. Clear differences were observed among the configurations in strain partitioning, hardening of the different constituents and failure. The uniform elongation and tensile strength are increased with respect to that of the reference martensite and austenite, respectively. Concepts explored in this work can be extended to more complex patterns and other base microstructures, opening novel strategies to engineer properties in steel and other alloys.},

The investigation focuses on the precipitation, crystallographic texture, grain size, grain morphology and residual stresses utilizing synchrotron X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction and electron microscopy. The heterogeneous microstructure of the sample processed with the concentric laser pattern influences the chemical composition of the matrix, which alters the reference “strain free” interplanar spacing used for evaluating the residual strain. The investigation underlines the significance of the processing parameters on the homogeneity of the microstructure and the effect of the chemical variations on the determination of residual stresses in materials such as Alloy 718, where strong local chemical variations occur because of different types and extent of precipitation.},

However, it is still a great challenge to achieve bright and deep-red/near-infrared (NIR) emissions. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of deep-red/NIR non-conjugated polymers with aggregation-induced emission based on disulfide-linked poly(amidoamine) (S S PAMAM) dendrimers, which exhibit excellent biodegradation for bioimaging. These S S PAMAM dendrimers (G0.5-G2.0) containing disulfide bonds in their backbone were synthesized in high yield by incorporating cystamine instead of common diacrylamide. Unexpectedly, the S S PAMAM dendrimers prepared exhibited bright and excitation dependent multicolor-tunable emission. More interestingly, G2.0 S S PAMAM showed a deep-red/NIR emission (λ em = 625 nm with a shoulder at 800 nm) originated from an extraordinarily rigid and compact conformation via strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, these dendrimers displayed excellent biodegradability because of the large number of disulfide linkages in backbone. Due to the excellent specific cytomembrane location, S S PAMAM dendrimers can be used as a potential cell membrane imaging reagent for multi-color (blue, green, and deep-red) imaging. Furthermore, they could also be used in zebrafish for bioimaging. This investigation has expanded the applications of fluorescent non-conjugated polymers to the field of long-wavelength in vivo biological imaging.},

When colonized with bone marrow stem cells, it also exhibited cytocompatibility to support in vitro cartilage regeneration.

Here, the effect of the content of rare-earth element Y on the deformation mechanism and mechanical behavior of the C/A Mg/(MgCu) 100- x Y x dual-phase Mg alloys under tensile loading is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The results show for the first time that the amorphous phase thickness of the alloys increases obviously after relaxation, which is mainly due to the existence of element Y in amorphous phase. And with the increase of the content of element Y, the thickness of amorphous phase increases. The results indicate that the diffusion of element Y from amorphous phase to amorphous-crystalline interface ( ACI ) promotes the migration of ACI towards crystalline phase (i.e., the amorphization of crystalline phase). The results further pointed out that the amorphization of Mg alloys depends on two factors: one is that the amorphous phase contains a certain concentration of element Y, and the other is the existence of ACI . The results show that there is a critical amorphous phase thickness of the dual-phase Mg alloys, that is, the critical content of Y element, which can make it achieve nearly perfect plasticity.},

  abstract     = {Z3CN20–09M stainless steel, a candidate material for coolant pump shells, experiences cavitation erosion (CE) in nuclear reactor service. Z3CN20–09M steel&#39;s CE behavior is studied using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron back-scatter diffraction, and optical profilometry. The influence of CE on corrosion resistance is analyzed through potentiodynamic polarization tests and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. During the incubation stage, damage occurs primarily in austenite. A higher Taylor factor increases the CE. Slip bands and strain-induced martensite are the main reasons for damage. After the incubation stage, brittle ferrite fracture dominates, which induces large grooves and holes. One hour of exposure improves the corrosion resistance. Slip bands, strain-induced martensite, and stacking faults provide diffusion paths for the Cr and O atoms to form a more compact passive film. Finally, approaches aiming to improve the CE resistance of Z3CN20–09M steel are suggested.},

The results show that Al increases the nucleation rate of the Cu-rich phase, and refines Cu-rich nanoprecipitates after ageing for 1 min. The Cu-rich phase with four crystal structures-BCC, 9R, twin FCC, and non-twin FCC were found in the Al-free sample during ageing. However, only Cu-rich phase with BCC and BCT structures were observed after Al addition. There are high-density edge dislocations in Al-containing Cu-rich nanoprecipitates. These dislocations can be used as a diffusion channel for solute atoms, increasing the coarsening rate of the Cu-rich phase. However, with the extension of the ageing time, dislocations in the Cu-rich phase will be annihilated owing to the thermal activation and the decrease of the Al concentration in the Cu-rich phase, which will lead to a decrease in the dislocation density in Al-containing Cu-rich phase. Finally, the promotion effect of Al on the coarsening of the Cu-rich phase is weakened.},

Focusing on this microstructural feature, we investigated the improvement in the mechanical properties of LPBF-fabricated Scalmalloy by tailoring the volume fraction of UFGs. Our approach was to decrease the laser hatch spacing ( d ) from 0.1 to 0.04 mm, while the volume fraction of UFGs increased from 34.6 ± 0.6\% ( d = 0.1 mm) to 59.5 ± 0.5\% ( d = 0.06 mm). The tensile yield stress increased from 296 ± 9 ( d = 0.1 mm) to 380 ± 6 MPa ( d = 0.06 mm), while maintaining a large elongation (14.8\% ± 1.2\%). The yield stress and elongation were superior to those of the cast counterparts by 2.9 and 4.0 times, respectively. In the sample with d = 0.04 mm, pores formed owing to excessive thermal energy input. Additionally, we investigated multiple strengthening mechanisms of the as-fabricated alloy. This is the first study to improve the mechanical properties of LPBF-fabricated Scalmalloy by optimizing the track-to-track interval and tuning the UFG fraction.},

  abstract     = {The alloy design and homogenization processes are intimately associated with the microstructure, phase composition and performance for Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys. The microstructures and phase composition of a series of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys before and after the homogenization treatments were investigated along with thermodynamic calculation to understand the underlying relationship. The eutectic microstructures ( α -Al + M (Mg(ZnAlCu) 2 )) are dominating with Cu-enriched [AlCuMgZn] particles, both depending on the Zn:Mg ratio and (Cu + Mg) content, in addition to minor constituent θ (Al 2 Cu) and Al 7 Cu 2 Fe phases in the as-cast alloys. The optimal homogenization process was suggested based on the analysis of the residual phases (i.e., the S (Al 2 CuMg) phase) since all (for low/mediate-(Cu + Mg) alloys) or partially (for high-(Cu + Mg) alloys (∼&gt;4.24 wt\%)) S (Al 2 CuMg) particles were dissolved during the homogenization. This residual S phase may be transformed from the primary M and/or Cu-enriched [AlCuMgZn] phases. The homogenization kinetics calculation results agreed well with above experimental results. A critical (Cu + Mg) level and a linear correlation between Cu and Mg concentrations were revealed based on the thermodynamically modelling, which can be conductive to determine the optimal homogenization process. Furthermore, the solubility limit and stoichiometric balance principles based on controlling the homogenized microstructures can guide the composition design for advanced high-strength aluminum alloys.},

This study has demonstrated that porosity below 1\% does not affect mechanical properties of 2319 WAAM walls, whereas the as-built microstructure and applied heat treatment highly influence the properties obtained. Without interlayer dwell time, a fine uniformly distributed equiaxed microstructure is obtained, however, if an interlayer arc stop period is applied, columnar dendritic grains in the interlayer zone is obtained. Heat treatment with low aging temperature and time demonstrated not to be suitable to ensure high mechanical properties and low anisotropy. Instead, if 190 °C and 26-hour aging heat treatment is used, properties up to 324 MPa for yield stress, 452 MPa tensile strength and 8\% elongation can be achieved perpendicularly to the building direction with anisotropy of 1\%, 2\% and 46\%, respectively, for the manufacturing conditions that avoided columnar grains.

  abstract     = {Computationally-efficient surrogate models based on a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) are developed to quantify the uncertainties in the fracture behavior and lifetime of a self-healing thermal barrier coating system (SH-TBC) and a benchmark conventional TBC system. The surrogate models are built using deterministic information from micromechanical finite element simulations of thermal cycling of the systems, which are conducted until failure by spallation. Fracture and healing events are simulated using a cohesive-zone based crack healing model. The thermally-grown oxide layer (TGO) interface amplitude and its growth rate, the diameter and volume fraction of healing particles, and the mean distance of particles from the interface are used as training variables. Statistical characteristics and sensitivity indices are obtained from the trained models. It is found that the interface amplitude is the most significant contributor to the variance in the TBC lifetime, with other parameters displaying a relatively minor influence. Healing particles extend the expected value of TBC lifetime, however they also increase the uncertainty of thermal fatigue life. The analysis of self-healing TBCs exemplifies how PCE-based surrogate models can serve as a powerful tool for deriving design insights in complex material systems.},

Then, post-thermal annealing treatments are carried out to explore thermal stability and crystallization phenomena together with the evolution of mechanical properties . Compact films exhibit larger thermal stability with partial crystallization phenomena starting at 420 °C, still to be completed at 550 °C, while nanogranular films exhibit early-stage crystallization at 300 °C and completed at 485 °C. The microstructural differences are related to a distinct evolution of mechanical properties and residual stress, with compact TFMGs showing the highest values of Young’s modulus (157 GPa), hardness (12 GPa), strain rate sensitivity (0.096), and local residual stress (+691 MPa) upon annealing at 550 °C, while nanogranular films reach the maximum values of mechanical properties at 485 °C followed by relaxation at higher temperatures due to complete crystallization. We show that PLD in combination with post-thermal annealing can generate different families of amorphous films with varying nanoscale morphologies, resulting in tunable mechanical properties and thermal stability, which can thus be used for designing novel film configurations for different fields of application.},

With the additional attribute of wearable nature, these temperature sensors are used ubiquitously to determine the effect of physiochemical variations happening in the environment of the chosen biomedical and industrial applications. Graphene, owing to its exceptional electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties, has been extensively used for the development of wearable temperature sensors. The prototypes have been deployed with certain wireless communication protocols to transfer the experimental data obtained under both controlled environments and real-time scenarios.

Lasers are used for engraving microchannels on a silicon wafer, drilling inlet/outlet holes in quartz glass cover, and welding the Si sample and quartz glass cover. The entire fabrication process is completed within two hours. The microchannel surface is converted into a hydrophilic wall as proven by contact angle measurement, and a water flow is easily introduced to the channel as a cooling fluid. The boiling heat transfer performance of the fabricated microfluidic channel is evaluated by applying heat to the bottom of the device. A micro-heater placed underneath the Si substrate is also prepared using a laser to induce selective sintering of a conductive Ag layer. The heat generated by the heater is successfully removed by boiling heat transfer, and the critical heat flux is measured to be ∼ 55.2 W/cm 2 at a water flux of 208 kg/m 2 s.},

Microstructural evolution in austenitic stainless steels during cyclic plastic deformation has been studied via diffraction line profile analysis; however, their microstructure-dependent mechanical response upon stress partitioning in the matrix (austenite) and deformation-induced martensite has remained largely unexplored. In this study, the stress response analysis of austenitic stainless steel was performed using neutron diffraction. The phase stress in the austenite correlated well with the dislocation density in the phase. The actual stress in the martensite was nearly half of the assumed stress and the phase stress in the austenite. However, the apparent stress (the residual stress subtracted from the actual stress) was similar to the assumed stress as the martensite contains a fairly large compressive residual stress (approximately 1 GPa). Overall, the loading stresses at peak loads can be explained by sharing stress on the austenite and martensite.},

  abstract     = {In nature, many natural porous tissues of animals or plants follow heterogeneous structures pattern. Including turtle back pattern, leaf veins, wood porous fiber and porous cancellous bone are classic heterogeneous structures. In order to better design bionic microenvironment porous bone implants, herein, a bionic porous structure based on Voronoi-Thiessen diagram to create heterogeneous topology microenvironment promoting bone regeneration were proposed. Porous structures with tunable heterogeneity were built and achieved by selective laser melting (SLM). The topology analysis revealed the introduce of heterogeneity brought wide pore size distribution and irregular topology. The mechanical and hydrodynamics properties were predesigned and simulated by finite element analysis (FEA). The heterogeneity hardly influenced the overall strength, stiffness and permeability but the irregular stress and fluid shear rate distribution in FEA results indicated fluctuating local stiffness and permeability. In vitro and in vivo experimental results indicated that Quasi-homogeneous structure had irregular topology mimicking that of the natural bone structure and semi-heterogenous structure shown better osteogenesis. It is found that the scaffold heterogeneous microenvironment factors play important roles for bone regeneration, and which is crucial for the development of new orthopedic implants.},

  abstract     = {Applications involving strain rates in excess of 10 2 - 10 3 s −1 are unique in both materials selection and design approaches and are of particular importance for protection of infrastructure and personnel in dynamic impact scenarios. Three broad categories of such applications, according to the impact type and configuration requirements, including material and design characteristics, can be identified: (i) ballistic protection against projectiles or fragments; (ii) protection against other types of high energy events (HEEs), such as a crash or a blast; and (iii) micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMODs) mitigation. Prior studies have highlighted beneficial design features to enhance integrity under dynamic loading conditions, such as the ability to absorb the impact energy through cellular structural design or to deflect the impact. In these scenarios, the ability to optimise the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the protection system can facilitate significant improvements in structural performance under high strain rate conditions, signifying the great potential of additive manufacturing (AM) methods in this field. However, to date, research on AM of materials and structures for dynamic impact applications has been relatively limited. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge in high strain rate engineering design and systematically assess the potential and emerging opportunities that can be realised via the AM approach.},

  abstract     = {Infectious bone defects (IBD) remain a major problem in orthopedics in clinical settings. For IBD repair, implants possessing multiple functions such as osseointegration and antibacterial activity are in demand. This study aims to develop a surface-modified titanium (Ti) implant (MTi/Ag/CaP) with osseointegration and antibacterial functions for IBD repair. The pure Ti implant is printed using a selective laser melting technique, and a two-layer hierarchical structure is formed on its surface using a one-step micro-arc oxidation (MAO) approach. The outer layer is an apatite-like material decorated with Ag nanoparticles, whereas the inner layer is porous TiO 2 . In vitro experiments show that the MTi/Ag/CaP implant can effectively eliminate and inhibit the adhesion and proliferation of bacteria over a long period time while promoting MG-63 cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo experiments further reveal that the MTi/Ag/CaP implant produces more mineralized bone tissue than non-treated samples and interlocks closely with the bone tissue after 8 weeks. The one-step MAO modification developed in this study is simple, efficient, and environment-friendly, which demonstrates great potential as a promising approach for providing advanced biomedical materials in orthopedic applications, including for the prevention and treatment of IBDs.},

  abstract     = {A large amount of lactate accumulated in the tumor tissues plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis, recurrence, metastasis, drug resistance and immunosuppression. However, there is a lack of a simple and efficient lactate depletion strategy. Herein, a red blood cell membrane (mRBC)-camouflaged polydopamine (PDA)-coated dendritic mesoporous silicon nanoparticle (DMSN) was constructed for the delivery of lactate oxidase (LOX) to achieve coordinated catalytic consumption of intracellular and extracellular lactate and modulation of immunotherapy (denoted as DPLM). Due to the encapsulation of the mRBC, the DPLM could achieve long circulation in the blood and gradually accumulate into the tumor tissues within 8 h. The PDA which possessed catalase-like nature could catalyze the decomposition reaction of H 2 O 2 in hypoxic tumor tissue, therefore providing oxygen for LOX to oxidize extracellular lactate. Meanwhile, with the help of the photothermal conversion ability of PDA, the laser-trigged low-temperature photothermal effect on DPLM could cause the endosomal escape, which facilitated the delivery of LOX into cytoplasm to deplete intracellular lactate. In addition, due to the photothermal effect, tumor cells could release immune signals that promoted immune cells infiltration into tumor tissues. This study provides an innovative LOX delivery system to regulate tumor acid environment and relieve immunosuppression.},

However, a simple GTR membrane functions only as a mechanical barrier for isolation and lacks the ability to resist bacteria and actively induce tissue regeneration. In this study, an ornidazole (ONZ)/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-loaded poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA)/wool keratin (WK) composite membrane with a core/shell structure was prepared by emulsion electrospinning. ONZ was used in the shell layer to inhibit bacteria and bFGF in the core layer to accelerate tissue regeneration. The ONZ/bFGF composite membrane, with early substantial release of ONZ within 7 days and slow sustained release of bFGF for more than 28 days, exhibited good cell barrier function, cytocompatibility and degradability, and inhibited the proliferation of Pg, Fn and Pa over 21 days. Moreover, this composite membrane facilitated periodontal tissue regeneration and rapid wound healing. The ONZ/bFGF-loaded composite membrane is a strong candidate as a GTR membrane for periodontal tissue regeneration, and it also holds great potential as a functional dressing for skin defect repair. These results will broaden the prospects for the construction and application of multifunctional tissue engineering scaffolds for sustained drug release.},

The morphology, surface state, and laser absorptivity of both virgin and oxidized powders were systematically characterized. Their impacts on the flowability and powder bed quality were monitored by custom-designed recoating experiments and powder shear tests. The results of an in situ wetting analysis and microstructure evaluation were compared to establish a correlation between the powder characteristics and laser fusion. The powder oxidation enhanced L-PBF processability by improving the homogeneity of powder spreading and the formation of stable, consecutive laser beads. A thin ceramic layer-coated SS alloy reinforced with uniform (Si, Mn)-based oxides was synthesized by the L-PBF processing of severely oxidized powders. The mechanical strength of this alloy was found to be similar to that processed using the virgin powders, whereas the elongation was slightly decreased, likely due to the amorphous oxide feature and the mechanical oxide-Fe interface. This study provides a systematic understanding of powder reuse and new insight into the potential for economically developing high-performance parts by the positive utilization of powder oxidation and the L-PBF process.},

However, the surface of polymeric materials typically exhibits intrinsic deficiencies, limiting their durability and functionalities, e.g., low wear resistance, low thermal and electrical conductivity, low adhesion, low bioactivity, low reflectiveness, and weak photochemical resistance. Polymer metallization is an emerging concept that addresses these deficiencies by forming a metallic skin on polymeric surfaces. Herein, the working principles, recent advances, challenges, functional capabilities, and applications of the state-of-the-art polymer metallization methods in the fields of additive manufacturing, coating technologies, and material science are reviewed on nano-, micro-, and macroscales. The polymer metallization methods applied to polymeric and polymer composite substrates are physical vapor deposition, electrochemical plating, a family of thermal spray methods (such as flame spaying, arc spraying, plasma spraying, and cold spraying), and a series of polymer–metal direct bonding methods (such as adhesive bonding, injection overmolding, and fusion joining techniques, including ultrasonic joining, friction spot joining, electromagnetic induction joining, and laser joining). Understanding the key aspects within these approaches would guide scientist and engineers for optimizing the design and durability of structural materials made of polymers/composites.},

The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiment was conducted to measure the paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic distribution of the asphalt as the input parameter of the prediction model. After the calculation results of the wax precipitation temperature (WPT) and wax precipitation curve (WPC) were compared with measured values acquired from experimental methods (viscosity method, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) method), it was found that the trend of WPC is approximately similar, but the WPT of the theoretical model was significantly higher than that of FTIR.

Effects of wave radius, plate thickness, slot percentage, and base material on the Poisson’s ratio and mechanical performance are explored experimentally and numerically. The results show that assembled auxetic chiral honeycomb (AACH) exhibits lower peak force and high plateau stress than the conventional assembled one. With the increase of wave radius and plate thickness, the energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA) would increase. As for the different material combinations, when the base materials in vertical and horizontal wave plates adopt stainless steel and aluminum, respectively, the AACH would exhibit desirable EA, SEA, and auxetic behavior. These findings provide a new approach to the manufacture of auxetics at a low cost, which is beneficial for potential applications.},

The mechanical properties of medium carbon steel are close to that of low alloy high strength steel. It was found that the GNDs are distributed in a gradient at the interface of the soft domain, and the closer to the boundary the higher the density, which contributes to the occurrence of the hetero-deformation induced (HDI) hardening mechanism and provides additional strength and plasticity. The increase in elongation of the annealed samples is due to the recrystallization of ferrite and the redistribution of cementite, which realizes the combination of HDI mechanism, Orowan strengthening and annealing softening mechanism. Additional strengthening mechanisms are calculated and a physical model of cementite ripening during annealing is proposed. The tensile fracture shows that the cracks mainly propagate along the grain boundaries of the layered microstructure, and the high density of dimples can make the propagation path of the cracks tortuous and increase the elongation.},

By means of simulations, we study the effect of different geometric patterns of holes on the mechanical parameters of a piece of Engelman Spruce, with special emphasis on the density, the radial and longitudinal stiffness, and derived quantities. We show how one can control the elastic properties of perforated wood boards used for mechanical, acoustic and/or aesthetic purposes in general, and not only guitar making. These results could open a new era of rationally designed wood-based panels, for instrument making and beyond.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) has made great progress in the photovoltaic (PV) field. In recent years, more and more articles have shown that the modification of organic cations can improve HOIPs’ performance, and a surge of interest has been paid to rethink the effect of organic cations. In our review, we summarized the influences of organic cation rotation on structure, optoelectrical properties, and stability. We also provide theoretical insights into why and how organic cations affect the performance of HOIPs in experiments. At last, we have proposed possible control methods and development directions in the hope that the rotation of organic cation can be better observed and utilized in inherently tunable perovskite materials, solar cells, LED, photocatalysis, photothermal conversion, and other related fields.},

  abstract     = {To address the issue of lacking scientific guidance for welding 25Cr-35Ni-Nb + MA/32Cr-20Ni-Nb joint in petrochemical plant applications, the joint microstructures were studied by adopting four types of filler wires. The high-temperature tensile tests and creep rupture tests were performed to investigate joint failure mechanisms. Cellular/columnar dendritic grains were formed at the fusion line region with similar orientations to adjacent un-melted grains. The fine-sized dendritic grains generated at the central weld seam presented a larger misorientation owing to a lowered cooling rate. The lesser alloying element in filler wire led to a larger area with cellular/columnar dendritic grains. The carbide precipitates mostly located at grain boundaries either in the form of particles or necklace structures depending upon the filler wire compositions. The heterogeneous microstructure was thought to be the main reason for the failure at weld seam and fusion line region with large hardness fluctuations when joints welded by the filler wire with a more diverse alloying element. The filler wire with the least introduction of alloying elements, i.e., ERNiCrCoMo-1, gave rise to a more uniform microstructure and hence higher joint property without failing at the weld seam, which was therefore considered as the most suitable filler wire candidate.},

The two candidate materials chosen for the jacket are SS 316 LN and Nitronic – 50 owing to their desirable mechanical and physical properties at cryogenic service temperature. The current manufacturing techniques to fabricate the jackets or conduits include fusion butt welding. There are some inherent disadvantages of utilizing the fusion joining process such as the possibility of sensitization and the evolution of undesirable phases detrimental to the application. An attempt has been made to fabricate the jackets with FSW to evaluate its feasibility to obtain the desired mechanical and physical properties critical to the application. The welding parameters optimization, workpiece clamping approach, microstructure evolution, hardness line profiles, tensile properties, and magnetic properties of the jacket welds corresponding to both the materials have been discussed in the paper.

  abstract     = {Laser shock peening (LSP), a surface modification technique, is promising to enhance the strength and wear resistance for Ni-based superalloys. To understand the strengthening mechanism in a laser shock peened Ni-based superalloy DZ417G, we utilize synchrotron poly- and monochromatic X-ray microdiffraction, as well as electron microscopy and microhardness to quantify the local microstructures and mechanical properties at various depths. In the 1.2-mm-deep hardened layer, the microhardness increases monotonically by ∼50\% from the unaffected interior to the surface. Quantitative microdiffraction analysis shows that large amounts of dislocations are introduced by LSP. High densities of 7.1 × 10 15 m −2 and 11.8 × 10 15 m −2 are seen close to the peened surface for the γ- and γ′-phases, respectively, which are 5 and 20 times of those in the unaffected region. Different gradients of dislocation density are observed for the two phases from interior to surface, and their combined effect accounts well for the hardness increment. Due to the unaltered γ′-precipitates and chemical composition in the LSP affected zone, the large density of dislocations dominates the observed strengthening. Combined poly- and monochromatic X-ray microdiffraction allows quantifying the local microstructures of plastic deformation over a large sampling scale that can hardly be achieved using other materials characterization techniques.},

The effect of the process parameters utilised was characterised using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). SEM/EBSD results demonstrated, for the first time, that the microstructure and phase close to the interface was complex and comprised martensite, austenite and Fe phases, sequentially arranged in a layered sandwich pattern across the build direction. This complexity was necessary for excellent bonding. The L-PBF process parameters influenced the diffusion behaviour and the concentration of elements found at the interface. The diffusion rate of Fe and Ti across the NiTi-316L interface was 3.05 × 10 - 6 m 2 / s 3.05×10-6m2/s and 3.27 × 10 - 8 m 2 / s 3.27×10-8m2/s , respectively, representing a 93.27-fold increase.

With the unique combination of a miniaturized micro-mechanical experiment and high-resolution X-ray imaging, the critical energy release rate at the crack tip of materials is determined quantitatively in sub-100 nm dimension, which allows to reveal scale-dependent mechanical properties. The ability of controlled microcrack steering in engineered materials and structures into regions with high fracture toughness is demonstrated. This unique characterization capability promises broad applications for design and manufacturing of robust microchips in future technology nodes, and it is applicable to the study of a broad variety of 3D nanostructured material systems.},

Especially, the distribution probability of lamellar α intersection is introduced instead of the distributed relationship of different α lamellae, and the distributed relationship between lamellar and globular grains is transformed into the distribution of globular grains by the equivalent circle method. Then, several corresponding distribution probabilities are selected in terms of describing different microstructure states (equiaxed, basketweave, duplex microstructures). The model is applied to the quantitative analysis of TC4 alloy with different morphology grains. The results show that the distribution of α grains with different morphology in the β matrix becomes more inhomogeneous with increasing height reduction and cooling rate. Moreover, the larger the globular α size is, the greater the aggregation degree and the smaller the uniformity of other α grains around it is.

In this work, we employ 150 keV low energy proton with intensity up to 5 × 10 15 dose to irradiate the epitaxial ε-Ga 2 O 3 thin films. The characterization of the structural and optical properties shows no detectable variations in lattice structure and optical transmission. In addition, with increasing irradiation dosage, a decrease of Ga 3+ population and an increase of the concentration of oxygen vacancies are confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Photoresponse measurements further illustrate that, despite of a mild degradation in the photodetector performance, the device still shows a high photoresponsivity of 2.52 × 10 -3 A/W and a large photo-to-dark current ratio over 10 3 .

In this concept, the continuous brittle phases could become dispersive by inserting a network-like structure to divide the brazing seam spatially. This concept was verified in a specific brazing system, where Ti 3 SiC 2 ceramic and Ti 2 AlNb alloy were brazed by an AgCu interlayer. Ductile Cu foam with a network-like structure was used to disperse the continuous brittle TiCuSi intermetallic that should have in-situ formed in the Ti 3 SiC 2 /AgCu/Ti 2 AlNb brazed joint. Results show that the effect of Cu foam on dispersing the brittle TiCuSi intermetallic is pronounced. The effects of holding time and pore size on the dispersion effect of Cu foam were investigated. The joint fracture analysis and micro-mechanical properties of phases analysis reveal that the dispersive TiCuSi intermetallic is superior to the continuous one. The reason is that the microstructure of discrete TiCuSi intermetallic surrounded by ductile Ag-based and Cu-based solid solutions has a more robust capacity to accommodate microcracks. Thus the brazed joint is toughened and strengthened.},

The addition of W, Mo, and V elements causes the main peak of the HEAs to shift to the left to varying degrees, among which the biggest shift is 1.5 V HEA, followed by 1.5Mo HEA, the smaller is the 1.5 W HEA. At the same time, the γ&#39; precipitates phase of the alloy has a highly coherent relationship with the FCC matrix phase, which ensures that the strength of the alloy is increased without sacrificing its plasticity.},

  abstract     = {Metastable β titanium alloys are attracting great interest due to their intricate plastic deformation mechanisms. In this work, a novel metastable β titanium alloy Ti-6Mo-3.5Cr-1Zr is developed by controlling the phase stability. The alloy exhibits a compressive strength of ∼ 1152 MPa with large malleability (∼34\%) during dynamic compressions. The microstructural evolution and adiabatic shearing behavior of the alloy are investigated by applying stop rings to control the compressive strains. Microstructural characterizations and differential scanning calorimetry show that the content of stress-induced ω (SIω) phase increases with the accumulation of strain, resulting in strain hardening of the material. The formation of adiabatic shear band (ASB) is observed in samples with 30\% strain, whilst the formation and expansion of ASB are hindered by stress-induced structures. The microstructural evolution along outer edge → transition zone → center of the ASB region corresponds to (β + ω)→(β + α)→(β), which is caused by the temperature increasement in ASB. In addition, the average grain sizes in ASB region are gradually refined under the action of dynamic recrystallization. These results provide insights into the dynamic deformation mechanism and adiabatic shearing behavior of metastable β titanium alloys.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, finding new materials with enhanced thermal insulation properties has become a mandatory task to reduce energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. In recent years, nanocellular polymers have aroused great attention due to their very interesting combination of properties, which include reduced conduction through the gas phase thanks to the Knudsen effect. There are plenty of theoretical works hypothesizing the thermal insulation performance of nanocellular polymers. However, there is a lack of experimental results, especially at low densities. In the present work, the thermal conductivity of low-density microcellular and nanocellular poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) was measured to evaluate the different heat transfer mechanisms acting on these structures. PMMA foamed sheets with relative densities ranging from 0.09 to 0.18 and cell sizes between 400–4000 nm were produced by gas dissolution foaming using CO 2 as a physical blowing agent. Samples were measured at various temperatures, resulting in thermal conductivities between 37.4 and 46.6 mW/(m·K) at 10 °C. Experimental results have been analyzed to build a semi-empirical model able to predict the thermal conductivity and each heat transfer mechanism contribution. To do this, a novel method to determine the solid structure factor from the slope of the thermal conductivity versus the temperature curve is introduced.},

Observations from early targets showed that erosion damage caused appreciable mass loss along the target vessel inner wall. Later target designs incorporated a cavitation mitigation technique called small-bubble gas injection, in which small helium gas bubbles were introduced into the flowing mercury during operation. Samples removed from target vessels after operation revealed that gas injection greatly reduced or eliminated erosion damage. Photographs of the target interiors showed areas where significant erosion damage occurred in targets that were operated without gas injection. The same areas had no observable erosion damage in targets that were operated with gas injection. Laser-line scan measurements were performed on samples from several target vessels operated with and without gas injection to measure the extent of erosion damage and quantify the effect of gas injection on erosion. In-situ strain measurements during operation showed that gas injection reduced the target vessel strain by 25\%–75\%. These results provide conclusive confirmation that gas injection effectively mitigated erosion damage and reduced strain in SNS target vessels during operation.},

The main challenge was to interpret the results from all diffraction angles to obtain meaningful validation data for future computer simulations of induction hardening and tempering. The results were discussed in relation to hardness distribution. With the help of the applied measurement technique, even the effects of macro-segregation near the longitudinal sample axis can be detected. In inductively heated and quenched cylindrical specimens of 50CrMo4 specimens, macro-segregations near the longitudinal sample axis lead to a reduced retained austenite content, which shifts the axial stresses towards tensile stresses. Comparing the results with those from the literature, it can be seen that variations in the chemical composition of the sample within the specification range of the steel grade have less influence on the residual stress distribution in the induction hardened samples than the sample geometry and/or the quenching rate.},

A comprehensive strategy of machine learning (ML) and multi-objective optimization based on thermodynamic simulation data was proposed to accelerate the composition design of Ni-based superalloys. The microscopic parameters were determined by Pearson correlation analysis and domain knowledge as the key affect factors of tensile strength and elongation. The Multi-objectives Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) was adopted to search the well-built surrogate by ML meta -heuristically for the Pareto front of three objectives and its responding Pareto optimal solution set of composition. Furthermore, nine high-performance superalloy samples selected from the obtained Pareto front were well verified by fabricating and testing in the laboratory. Specially, a new composition among the nine as-fabricated samples was the best one according to the pre-defined design preferences with the γ′ solvus temperature, γ′ volume fraction, and TCP phases content approximating to 1210 °C, 65\%, and 0.01\%, respectively. This intelligent cooperation strategy based on ML and MOEA extends the methodology for multi-composition and multi-property design materials, which can optimize multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than do one by one.},

However, as most polymers are organic and flammable, the fire hazards associated with commonly used polymer foams are significant. Accordingly, intrinsic flame-retardant poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is considered ideal for fabricating thermally insulating materials. In this study, lightweight, thermally insulating, flame-retardant, and strong PVDF foams were prepared using microcellular foaming. To analyze the crystallization behavior, various saturation pressures and temperatures were applied to investigate their effects on the foaming behavior of PVDF. PVDF foams with expansion ratios of 5–28.8 and cell sizes of 10–250 μm were prepared using microcellular foaming. Moreover, the crystal forms, thermal insulation, flame retardancy, and compressive performance of the structure-tailored PVDF foams were investigated. The foaming process induces the generation of β-phase crystals, and the PVDF foams exhibit excellent thermal insulating (thermal conductivity of 33 mW⋅m −1 ⋅K −1 ), flame-retardant, and compressive properties. High-performance PVDF foams can be potentially used for producing advanced flame-retardant thermally insulating materials via green and cost-efficient microcellular foaming.},

With the incorporation of BNNSs, the thermal stability and water vapor barrier property of the developed mats were improved, and the average diameter of the nanofibers decreased from 385.6 nm to 221.0 nm. Moreover, the developed mats exhibited good antimicrobial activity in vitro and possessed hydrophobic surfaces.

Several studies have been conducted to increase the ceramic content in the feedstock, but the binder and additives in it have remained in the polymeric content. A novel strategy for highly dense additive manufacturing using a sol-gel-based ceramic slurry without polymeric additives is presented. Alumina, which is the most widely used fine ceramic, was chosen as a representative ceramic material. The proposed sol-gel solution enabled a high solid loading of approximately 50 vol\% without any polymeric dispersant while satisfying the requirements for material extrusion process, such as extrudable viscosity (&lt;100 Pa.s) and self-sustainable yield stress. This novel sol-gel binder system evolves into aluminum oxide nanoparticles during the sintering process, eventually fusing to the alumina particles. The as-printed green body possessed high alumina content and 66\% of theoretical density, which was higher than that obtained via the conventional molding methods. A reduced linear shrinkage of less than 16\% and a high density of 99.5\% of the theoretical value were also achieved. This research would present a practical strategy for ceramic additive manufacturing as an emerging fabrication process.},

Here, the metal-type dependence of plasticity heterogeneity in three different GNG structured face-centered cubic metals (Cu, Al, and Ni) was studied by large-scale molecular dynamic simulation, from the plasticity perspectives of dislocation, deformation twinning, and grain boundary. The dislocation and deformation twinning-based plasticity show clear metal-type dependence in GNG structure of different selected metals. For grain boundary activities, GNG Cu, Al, and Ni are equivalent in the overall grain boundary sliding and micro-cracking process, but GNG Ni shows markedly higher grain boundary-free volume and stress due to the grain size gradient-induced twinning process. We find that GNG Al shows the weakest plasticity-induced strengthening due to its weak strain hardening and ununiform plasticity distribution, while GNG Ni exhibits prominent plasticity-induced strengthening because of the obvious extra strain hardening process. Besides, we further discuss the reasonable gradient grain size design of GNG structure, considering the critical grain size of the Hall-Petch and inverse Hall-Petch relationship, which will demonstrate a more rational plasticity heterogeneity and internal atomic stress distribution.},

This work investigates the feasibility of tailoring an alloy to allow atomization using nitrogen gas while remaining within the Alloy 625 specification.

In this study, experimental and simulated single-track melting of Co-Cr-Mo alloy with electron beam were performed to probe the basic influencing factors of solidified grain morphology. With the aid of numerical modeling and data analysis, the importance of each variable to the grain morphology and correlation between variables, including process parameters, solidification parameters, and fluid velocity to the grain morphology, were revealed. Under unsteady solidification of the dynamic moving molten pool, prediction of the solidification criterion based on the fundamental solidification parameters was not as accurate as expected. The processability and thermophysical properties of the material jointly determined the limitations of controlling the solidification parameters only by the power and scan speed. Furthermore, the effect of melt flow on the grain morphology was discussed.

  abstract     = {The manufacturing of flexible strain sensors for wearable electronics usually requires different conductive materials for the sensing part and the connection part. This increases the complexity, cost, and performance issues due to the mismatch of the thermo-electro-mechanical properties of the materials. Herein, a new design scheme using a single conductive material is presented for a low-cost mass-producible fabric strain sensor, where a carbon/silicone nanocomposite is screen-printed to make both parts. By exploring the dimension effect and modelling of the conductive tracks, and adopting a large difference of over 100 times in aspect ratio, this research makes the electrical response of the fabric strain sensor depend almost exclusively on the sensing part, while its connection part has a low resistance. The sensor exhibits outstanding performance with a wide working range (60\% strain), adequate linearity, long fatigue life (∼50,000 cycles), and mechanical robustness, rendering it suitable for human body movement detection. Moreover, the manufacturing process is simple and low-cost ($11 per m 2 ). Thus, the new design scheme overcomes the mismatch issue and provides an important reference value for the design of flexible resistive sensors working in a high resistance range, from ∼ 100 KΩ to several MΩ.},

  abstract     = {The nitrogen-phosphorus flame-retardant coating was formed on the surface of cotton fabrics via strong electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonds with layer-by-layer coating of protein extracted from fishery waste fish scales and phytic acid (PA) derived from plant seeds. The flame retardant property of the coated cotton fabrics demonstrated a significant improvement with a limiting oxygen index of 31.1\%, meeting the flame retardant requirements of commercial fire-protection suit. Especially, noteworthy, due to the synergistic smoke suppression effect of fish scale protein and phytic acid, the total smoke emission was greatly reduced by 139\%. Meanwhile, the charring of the cotton fabrics treated with FSP and PA was significantly enhanced. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman results of the residual char further reveal that the treatment of the combined coating facilitates the formation of dense and regular graphitized char residue during combustion or under high temperature. This waste-sourced, biomass-derived coating paves a new way towards sustainable flame-retardant fabrics and has great significance in civil, military, and industrial fields.},

  abstract     = {Vitrimers are emerging dynamic polymers with exchangeable associated networks that can potentially be used as substitutes for conventional thermosetting polymers, whose healing and recycling are difficult. However, vitrimers have limited engineering applications due to their process complexity, the addition of extra catalysts, and the unclear factors that affect network rearrangement. Herein, epoxy vitrimers with intramolecularly-catalyzed transesterification were prepared by curing an ester-containing epoxy resin with diethylenetriamine and monoamines. The obtained diethylenetriamine-cured vitrimer had favorable tensile stress and modulus (60.86 MPa and 0.94 GPa). The intramolecularly-catalyzed vitrimers exhibited fast stress relaxation, and the relaxation time of monoamine-containing vitrimers was reduced to 253 s at 180 °C. The effect of structure variation on the vitrimers’ properties was investigated by controlling the influencing parameters. The molality of the tertiary amine and β -hydroxy esters were directly proportional to faster stress relaxation. A higher crosslink density led to better mechanical properties and a higher glass transition temperature but retarded the stress relaxation. Side-chains with low steric hindrance accelerated the stress relaxation. Repair and remolding were more efficient in the vitrimers with lower stiffness. This study contributes to the design and practical applications of various epoxy vitrimers according to the desired final properties.},

In this paper, the elastic properties of IPCs reinforced by three different types of regular lattice fibre networks are investigated by computer simulation and analytical methods. The numerical results indicate that the larger the difference between the Poisson’s ratios and the smaller the difference between the Young’s moduli of the constituent materials, the larger the Young’s moduli of these IPCs are. It is also found that structural hierarchy can enhance the stiffness of these IPCs by 30\%. In addition, the three types of IPCs have Zener anisotropy factors in the range of 1.0 ± 0.04 1.0±0.04 in most cases, could have an almost isotropic Young’s modulus two times larger than the Voigt limit, and a Poisson’s ratio with a positive or negative or zero value. Moreover, they are easy to manufacture, their Young’s moduli are in general 1.0–3.0 times those of the conventional particle or short fibre reinforced composites and other types of IPCs including those reinforced by the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) shells, and the type of IPCs with the largest Young’s modulus has been identified.},

Effects of the filament interval, position and moisture content of SMFs on thermal protection were investigated. Additionally, thermal insulation and evaporative resistance of the SFSs were examined. Results demonstrated that the application of SMF in a four-layered fabric system could significantly suppress the temperature increase and prolong the time to reach 12 °C and 24 °C temperature rise. Using a SMF with 2 cm filament interval provided better thermal protection. SFS with a SMF close to the outer shell provided a prolonged time to reach 24 °C temperature rise. Moisture within a SMF increased the heat dissipation rate, and the air gap enhanced the positive effect of moisture on protective performance. The SFS showed higher thermal resistance and lower evaporative resistance compared to the traditional five-layered fabric system as a control, especially for SMF with 2 cm filament intervals.

The vibration reduction efficiency of bandgaps is analysed based on the recursive method and numerically verified. Furthermore, wave splitting is found in the rotor-in-rotor metamaterial due to strong equivalent nonlocal interactions. Its dispersion relation shows a “dual wavevector” phenomenon: there are frequency ranges where a positive slope and a negative slope coexist. Numerical simulations using finite cell analysis are performed to validate the wave splitting by calculating the phase velocity and group velocity. The finding of wave splitting in the dual wavevector region is expected to provide new insights to control wave propagation.},

  abstract     = {Finding actionable trends in laser-based metal additive manufacturing process monitoring data is challenging owing to the diversity and complexity of the underlying physical interactions. A single monitoring solution that captures a particular process phenomenon, such as a photodiode that tracks melt pool intensity, is not alone capable of evaluating process stability or detecting flaw formation with sufficient precision for routine application in industry. In this work, to improve flaw detection performance, we adopted a data fusion approach that captures multiple process phenomena. To demonstrate this, we acquired data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) builds of cylindrical specimens produced with different laser spot sizes, emulating defocusing due to process faults such as thermal lensing. The resulting specimens had porosity of varying types and severity, quantified by post-build non-destructive X-ray computed tomography, Archimedes density measurements, and destructive metallographic characterization. During the build, the melt pool state was monitored with two coaxial high-speed video cameras and a temperature field imaging system. Physically intuitive low-level melt pool signatures, such as melt pool temperature, shape and size, and spatter intensity were extracted from this high-dimensional, image-based sensor data. These process signatures were subsequently used as input features in relatively simple machine learning models, such as a support vector machine, which were trained to detect laser defocusing, and in addition, predict porosity type and severity. The results show that the data fusion approach significantly enhanced system performance by reducing the overall false positive rate from ∼ 0.1 to ∼ 0.001 without sacrificing the true positive rate (∼0.90). These results were at par with a black-box, deep machine learning approach (convolutional neural network).},

During the past decade, Ga 2 O 3 -based solar-blind PDs have made a great progress in key metrics such as responsivity, detectivity and gain. However, they still suffer from relatively slow response time, from milliseconds to seconds. The trapping states at the surface/interface are believed to contribute to the low response speed. Besides the intrinsic factors, external factors including the illumination and bias voltage also have an important influence on the photoresponse speed. However, there is no in-depth analysis of illumination and bias impact on the photoresponse properties. Herein, we present an experimental investigation on the illumination intensity and bias voltage modulating response speed in a typical Ga 2 O 3 -based photoconductive PD. The photoresponse time can be accelerated up to two orders by varying the illumination and bias. The superior photoresponse capabilities of the Ga 2 O 3 -based PDs can be ascribed to the light controllable trap/de-trap processes as well as electric field accelerated carrier transport. The study offers clear images of the charge diffusion and drift process in the photodetector upon external stimuli, which will aid to optimize the performance of Ga 2 O 3 -based PDs.},

At the microscale, the inclination variable of unit-cell is introduced into the analytical formula of modulus in the compression direction. Then, the mechanical constitutive model of lattice structure with the inclination variable is established, which can be used to obtain the optimized inclination angle and maximize the stiffness in the compression direction. At the scale of periodic macro-array, to achieve the best mechanical properties in the compression direction without sacrificing the mechanical properties in the horizontal direction, twinning boundaries are introduced into both horizontal and vertical directions of the structure. Additionally, the mechanical properties of the structure can be further improved by controlling the number of twinning boundaries. The models are then fabricated through additive manufacturing and compressed. The experimental and simulation results show that the proposed method can simultaneously improve the stiffness, strength, and toughness of the lattice structure. For example, the stiffness of the optimized SC-BCC lattice structure is improved by 50.82\%, the strength by 10.94\%, and the energy absorption performance by 20.06\% in the compression direction.},

Notably, the powder characteristics influence the heat absorption and conduction, thereby altering the molten pool behavior and solidification parameters. However, the effect of the powder feedstock on solidification during PBF has not been widely investigated. In this study, a CoCrMo alloy was fabricated using powders prepared by gas-atomization (GA) and plasma rotating electrode process (PREP). Under the given operating conditions, samples built using the two powders were characterized and compared. By performing multi-scale numerical simulations, melting and solidification were visualized and analyzed to elucidate the mechanism through which the powder characteristics influence the non-equilibrium solidification behavior during PBF-EB. The study revealed that after appropriate size control, compared with the GA powder, the PREP powder had a smaller specific surface area and higher sphericity; thus, the generated powder layer exhibited higher heat absorption and dissipation rates. Therefore, a high solidification rate was facilitated, thereby suppressing microsegregation. These findings contribute to PBF knowledge related to feedstock, proving to be an essential reference for selecting and optimizing metallic powders applicable to additive manufacturing.},

However, the practical integration of optical fibres into thermoplastic composites remains still to be solved. To this end, a novel sensor integration approach by 3-D printing is proposed, and mechanical testing is conducted to test its performance. Optical fibres were placed inside thermoplastic embedding elements at controlled interlayer thicknesses (0 to 1.6 mm) from the substrate surface. Self-sensing experiments by optical fibres identified a uniform level of residual strains at −1600 µε from the 3-D printing attachment process. Furthermore, tensile creep testing (up to ca. 1\% strain) revealed that distributed strain transfer coefficients for optical fibre sensors remain constant with time. A simple calculation method that accounts for the shear lag effect between the component and optical fibre strains was derived from previous analytical work. This method enables the empirical prediction of strain transfer coefficients for optical fibre surface attachments with arbitrary embedding interlayer thickness.},

  abstract     = {The experimental investigation of the dynamic mechanical behavior of graphene aerogel is still lacking due to its low impendence. The present work, therefore, reports on the preliminary experimental characterization of the energy absorption characteristics of graphene aerogel by using the split Hopkinson pressure bar emphasis on the influence of the drying method. The graphene aerogels were synthesized by the sol-gel method and dried, either by supercritical CO 2 drying (SD) or by freeze-drying methods (FD). It was observed that under dynamic uniaxial compression, the SD samples exhibited a negative Poisson&#39;s ratio throughout gradual compression. However, FD samples failed by radial shattering without this auxetic behavior. The energy dissipation ratios of SD samples increased from 41\% to 73\% as expected with the specimen thickness increasing from 3 mm to 12 mm, being overall higher in comparison with FD samples which rises from 35\% to 43\%. SD graphene aerogels have a large number of random pores (∼50 nm), which is beneficial for absorbing the kinetic energy through plastic deformation and pore walls’ collapse. By contrast, the FD graphene aerogels’ pore walls buckle readily under the impact, and fail due to their ordered porous structure at the micron scale (∼1μm), which impairs their energy absorption capability.},

Effect of short overheating on the tensile properties of a Ni-based superalloy Waspaloy has been studied due to its significant importance for practical applications. The results have shown that a combination of near supersolvus overheating at 1000 °C with very rapid cooling at a rate of 50 K/s is most detrimental case to the tensile properties of the material. This is attributed to the absence of γ ′ γ′ and carbide re-precipitation and growth during cooling period. Microstructure change during overheating and cooling has been deduced using in-situ resistivity measurements. This work provides evidence that multilateral measurements including resistivity can shed light on the failure controlling parameters.},

  abstract     = {Commonly, the increased free surface of nanometals results in completely different mechanical behaviors from their bulk counterparts. At present, studies on the plasticity behavior of nanometals is widely carried out under quasi-static states. Understanding the plasticity mechanism of nanometals during a high-speed forming process is largely unexplored. This study explored the rate dependence of the forming behaviors of Al and Au nanofilms using laser-induced ultrahigh strain rate forming processes. The results showed that the superplastic behavior of the nanofilms can be activated above a critical value of the strain rate (&gt;2.0E8 s −1 ). The Al nanofilm exhibited a maximum vertical strain of ∼ 567\% at a strain rate of 8.1E8 s −1 , and that of the Au nanofilm was ∼ 620\% at a strain rate of 8.8E8 s −1 . The superplastic forming mechanism mediated by interstitials was revealed for the first time. Further, the potential contribution of the interstitial-mediated plasticity mechanism in breaking through grain size limit and constitutive model modification was discussed. The discovery of this particular mechanism supplements the deformation mechanism diagram and constitutive relationship of nanometals, and is thus of great significance to the study of material responses in extreme conditions and manufacturing process analysis and optimization.},

Two full factorial designs and their analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to overcome the challenge of relating the multiple microstructural variables of dGTR to the mechanical properties of the compounds in pristine and healed states. The design of experiments (DoE) predict that the use of dGTR-based reinforcements, with a decrease in network density higher than 50\%, enables the incorporation of more than 40 phr of reinforcing filler, increasing the tensile strength in the pristine state (more than 4 times) and mitigating its negative effect on the healing process. Experimental tests have validated these theoretical predictions. This research demonstrates that it is not necessary to control the selectivity of the devulcanisation process. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that only by increasing the dGTR surface network density breakage it is possible to incorporate significant amounts of the residue from simple recycling processes in order to improve the performance of high value-added rubber formulations, such as self-healing materials.},

In this study the design space is formalised using a set of input parameters and evaluation metrics to provide a structured and reproducible approach to designing a TPMS-like cellular solids. Interactions between the design parameters and evaluation metrics are identified using a full-factorial design of experiments. From this the most impactful design parameters are identified as the TPMS equation, type of structure, and volume fraction. It was found that the gyroid-surface structure provided the most flexibility, with near-isotropic mechanical properties across a wide range of volume fractions, allowing the creation of reduced mass/stiffness designs without introducing anisotropy or variation in Poisson’s ratio. The volume fraction at which the connectivity of a structure changes, “pinch-off limits” are presented for six of the most commonly investigated TPMS-like cellular solids. Additionally, the effects of common transformations are presented including: examples of how phase-shift and/or rotation can be used to modify the features which intersect the free-boundary of a design; dimensional analysis which shows the practical effects changing unit cell size; and analysis showing the effect of rotating a cellular structure on both the mechanical properties and surface orientation. These computational studies are supported with a physical case study which demonstrates how several design parameters may be modified to change the manufacturability of a TPMS-like cellular solid.},

  abstract     = {In this work, novel TiC particles doped by trace amounts of B, referred to as TiC B , were introduced to an Al-Mn alloy with the Al-TC B master alloy. The effects of the TiC B particles on the solidification microstructure, extrusion behavior, and mechanical properties of the Al-Mn alloy were systematically studied. The results showed that TiC B particles could significantly refine α-Al grains by providing heterogeneous nucleation substrates and hindering the growth of α-grains. For example, when the amount of added TiC B particles was 0.5 wt\%, average α-Al grain size could be refined to a minimum of 40.2 μm from 410.1 μm when no particles were added. After hot extrusion, TiC B particles and fractured α-Al(Fe, Mn)Si formed streamlines along the extrusion direction. More importantly, TiC B particles could inhibit the dynamic recrystallization process during hot extrusion and retain numerous geometrically necessary dislocations. Consequently, the mechanical properties of the Al-Mn alloy at room temperature (25 °C) and elevated temperature (350 °C) were significantly improved after adding TiC B particles. When the amount of added TiC B particles was 1.5 wt\%, the ultimate tensile strengths at 25 °C and 350 °C were increased by 25.6\% and 32.4\%. This work sheds light on the grain refinement and strengthening of non-heat-treatable wrought Al-Mn alloys.},

  abstract     = {Extrusion-based 3D printing with rapidly hardening polymeric materials is capable of building almost any conceivable structure. However, concrete, one of the most widely used materials for large-scale structural components, is generally based on inorganic binder materials like Portland cement. Unlike polymeric materials, a lack of precise control of the extent and rate of solidification of cement-based suspensions is a major issue that affects the ability to 3D-print geometrically complex structures. Here, we demonstrate a novel method for controllable-rapid solidification of concentrated mineral suspensions that contain a polymer binder system based on epoxy and thiol precursors as well as one or more mineral fillers like quartz and calcite. The thermally triggered epoxy-thiol condensation polymerization induces rapid stiffening of the hybrid suspensions (0.30 ≤ ϕ ϕ ≤ 0.60), at trigger temperatures ranging between 50 °C and 90 °C achieving average stiffening rates up to 400 Pa/s. The use of nucleophilic initiators such as 1-methylimidazole provides control over the activation temperature and curing rate, thereby helping to achieve an adjustable induction period and excellent thermal latency. By using multiple techniques, we provide guidelines to create designer compositions of mineral suspensions that utilize thermal triggers to achieve thermal latency and ultrafast stiffening – prerequisite attributes for 3D-manufacturing of topologically-optimized structural components.},

Herein, we prepared polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel membranes with copper ion-loaded polydopamine (PDA@Cu) to simultaneously achieve antibacterial and pro-angiogenesis functions in a wound dressing. We prepared three porous PVA/PDA@Cu hydrogels with different concentrations of copper ion , namely PVA/PDA@Cu-1, PVA/PDA@Cu-2 and PVA/PDA@Cu-3. Although the incorporation of PDA@Cu slightly decreased the compressive mechanical strength, the tensile property of the PVA/PDA@Cu significantly increased, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the PVA hydrogel film. The hydrogel membranes had good biocompatibility, except PVA/PDA@Cu-3, which had toxic effects because of a high Cu concentration. The antibacterial effect of the membrane increased with the increasing Cu concentration. Owing to the photothermal property of PDA, the PVA/PDA@Cu hydrogel membranes show synergistic antibacterial ability. Furthermore, the PVA/PDA@Cu-1 and PVA/PDA@Cu-2 hydrogel membranes had pro-angiogenesis property. Results of in vivo experiments showed that PVA/PDA@Cu-2 achieved satisfactory repair outcomes for the bacterial infected wound with abundant collagen deposition and formation of neo-vessels. These results suggest that the PVA/PDA@Cu hydrogel membrane serves as a better platform for regeneration of the infected skin and thus will have a clinical application in the future.},

The experimental procedure for this purpose is fortified with a univariate multi-objective optimization strategy to predict the best composition. The compressive strength of the grafts improves up to ∼ 4 folds by parametric optimization and Zn 2+ functionalization, without any post-processing. These grafts maintain mechanical integrity and strength during 6 weeks of dissolution study in simulated body fluid (SBF), while the non -functionalized starch-HA grafts fully degrade within a week. The Zn 2+ functionalization results in up to ∼ 79\% antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus . Osteoblast cell viability increases ∼ 1.6 folds on these graft surfaces on day 11. Our innovative methods of optimization are expected to reduce the experiment time, cost, and chance of human error in 3D printing.

Experimental data show that low-cycle fatigue life of the alloys increased 22.5\% by the appropriate EST. The mechanism affecting the fatigue life was studied by SEM and TEM. The results show that after the appropriate EST, the volume fraction of the α phase increased, the lath-like transformed β phase was broken and dissolved locally, accompanied by the formation of a secondary α phase and its morphological transformation from flake-like to more finely dispersed acicular. It was found that the appropriate EST led to the nanoscale solid-state phase transition; namely, the dissolution of an unstable brittle AlTiH x phase in the alloy matrix and precipitation of the Al 24 Ti 8 strengthening phase with a size close to 5 nm in the β phase. These transitions occurred when the local maximum temperature of the sample recorded was only 296.8 °C.

The morphology, roughness and wetting properties of the coatings were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and contact angle measuring instrument, respectively. The results showed that CNSs and CNTs synergically constructed peak-like microstructures and villi-like nanostructures with the assistance of polydopamine (PDA) and epoxy resin (EP), and the obtained superhydrophobic coating had a water contact angle (WCA) of 160.7° and sliding angle (WSA) of 4.0°.

  abstract     = {Although nano-systems can promote the cellular internalization, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are easily to be destroyed or eliminated in the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to premature drug release or insufficient colonic accumulation. A novel oral nano-in-micro system for the efficient colonic delivery of curcumin (Cur) was developed in this study, in which the hyaluronic acid (HA)/zein complex NPs loading Cur were embedded in alginate/chitosan hydrogel microparticles (Cur@NMPs) with the electrospray technology. The Cur@NMPs showed uniform-sized sphere with an average size of 218.36 ± 10 μm, encapsulating Cur@HA/zein NPs with the average size of 148.64 ± 3.21 nm. Cur in NMPs showed the sustained drug-release profiles in simulated gastric fluid, whereas it showed the rapid release in simulated colonic fluid. Mediated by the HA-CD44 receptor recognition, Cur@HA/zein NPs had the increased cellular uptake efficiency in macrophages. Furthermore, NMPs had the significant colon-retention and bio-adhesiveness capacity in colon tissues. As expected, the oral administration of Cur@NMPs significantly mitigated colitis symptoms in DSS-induced UC mice by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB pathway. The above results can provide a useful drug delivery strategy for Cur in the treatment of UC by retaining the advantages of nano- and micro-scaled carriers.},

  abstract     = {This work studies the acicular ferrite (AF) nucleation and growth from a classical defect, i.e. non-metallic inclusion surface. The heterogeneous AF-nucleation probability on NMI is predicted by a mathematical model following the classical nucleation theory. The calculation results are in consistent with the experimental data. The current model includes the exact form of the activation energy and Zeldovich factor for heterogeneous nucleation on pre-existing spherical surface. It generates an interaction map that for the first time quantitatively describes the superposition influences of the interfacial energies and NMI-size on the AF-nucleation potency. In the AF-growth aspect, we systematically reveal the single AF-plate evolution behavior through the synergy between the experimental observations and multiphase-field simulations. It is found that the AF-tip morphology is impacted by the misorientation angle between the favorable growth direction and normal vector. It also influences the AF-lengthening and widening kinetics. Additionally, the anisotropic stress field induced by the AF-NMI interface plays a significant role in controlling the complex curvature of the AF-plate. The current study opens new perspectives for understanding the AF-precipitation mechanisms.},

The superior and consistent mechanical and corrosion properties of LPBF-printed components are essential for engineering applications. The 316L stainless steel (SS) is an essential alloy with widespread applications from household items to nuclear and aerospace industries. Extensive research is conducted to understand and improve the mechanical properties of LPBF printed 316L SS. Studying the corrosion behavior of LPBF printed 316L has attracted only limited attention. Additionally, a discrepancy in the corrosion performance of LPBF printed 316L has been reported due to the complex microstructure and defects introduced during LPBF. Therefore, understanding the influence of processing parameters and feedstock on defects and microstructure becomes critical in understanding the processing-corrosion relationships and producing LPBF printed 316L components with reproducible properties. This review presents the influence of feedstock, processing parameters, and post-processing techniques on manufacturing defects, microstructure, and corrosion performance of LPBF printed 316L. Strategies and hypotheses to improve the corrosion resistance of LPBF printed 316L are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Lattice structures’ performance is directly determined by the topological structure and arrangement of cells. Here, we propose a lattice structure design approach that generates predictable mechanical properties by adjusting the three-dimensional posture and mirror arrays of cells. Specifically, the Euler angle ( α β γ ) is introduced to accurately control the three rotational degrees of freedom of the orthogonal unit cell. Then, a new unit cell with symmetric characteristics composed of multiple primitive rotation units is constructed by mirror operation, which is called super variable pose Octahedral Structures (SVPOS). The mathematical model of SVPOS topological structure is established, the mapping relationship between Euler Angle and relative density is deduced, and the mechanical response of structures with different Euler angles is studied. The results show that Structure of α = β = γ = 30˚ obtained the best performance, and the elastic modulus, compressive strength, and energy absorption at 50\% strain of it are 553.1\%, 471.9\% and 529\% of that of the octahedral, respectively. The new lattice structure can be obtained by adjusting the Euler Angle, its relative density and performance can be better predicted, which can provide experimental and theoretical basis for the design of lattice structures that meet different requirements.},

We report on a continuum system featuring locally bistable units that allows for the controlled and self-sustained manifestation of macroscopic geometric frustration. The patterning of the units encodes a finite set of ordered ground configurations (spin-ice states) and a unique family of co-existing higher-order frustrated states (spin-liquid states), which are both activated upon unit inversion. We present a strategy for accessing any globally frustrated state on-demand by controlling the constitutive units’ inversion sequence. This control strategy allows for observing the unfolding of geometric frustration as the microstructural features evolve due to the energy minimization of the constitutive units’ interactions. More broadly, our model system offers a blueprint for “taming” macroscopic geometric frustration, enabling novel applications such as path-driven computation and solving optimization problems using structural systems.},

  abstract     = {Labyrinth seals are widely used in turbomachinery devices to prevent the leakage of fluid medium in seal structures. Under high parametrical environments, the heat generated by frictional resistance of the turbulence between the stator and rotor walls not only increases the temperature of the fluid and the solid, but also reduces the operation efficiency of the device. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the fluid–solid-thermal multi-field analysis of labyrinth seals and propose a comprehensive optimization design of the load-bearing and heat insulation. In the present study, inspired by a bionic snail shell, a sandwich structure with load-bearing material on both upper and lower surfaces and the heat insulation material in the middle is obtained through the genetic algorithm optimization. Then, the luid-solid-thermal multi-field analysis of the labyrinth seal with the sandwich structure is carried out. It is verified that the layer arrangement and layer thickness ratio of the bionic structure ensured the optimal performance of load-bearing and heat insulation. After changing the layer arrangement or layer thickness ratio, the comprehensive performance of load-bearing and heat insulation is obviously weakened. The result shows that the bionic multilayer sandwich structure can be applied to the labyrinth seal to achieve optimal comprehensive performance of load-bearing and heat insulation.},

The TiC particle dispersion was almost identical in both composites with variation in the size distribution. However, there was a significant difference in the morphology of the α phase in the matrix. The α+β-extruded composite exhibited globular α p (grain size: 0.7 μm); in contrast, the β-extruded phase showed acicular α s (grain size: 1.5 μm). Additionally, α-Ti was the predominant phase in contact with TiC particles due to the semi-coherent relationship between these two phases. A remarkably high yield strength (1215 MPa) was achieved at room temperature in the α+β -extruded composite, while the β-extruded composite exhibited consistently improved strength at high temperatures. Morphological characterization using atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the β phase was slightly harder than the α phase, probably due to the solid solution of Fe and W that predominant in the β phase.},

S275 is considered as a mild/low alloy steel that is compatible with IN718 and can serve as a mechanically under-matched substrate for WAAM deposition with potential use in the petrochemical industry. Characterization of the interfacial hybrid part was conducted through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) in three different states of as-built (AB), solution-treated (ST), and aged (STA) conditions. EDS elemental mapping confirmed the presence of Laves closer to the interface even after 1-hour solutionizing at 1080 °C. Solution-treatment resulted in eliminating microsegregation (mainly Nb) and considerable Laves dissolution, along with a significant decrease of the hardness in both WAAM-deposited IN718 and the substrate. The bulk texture of WAAM-deposited IN718 was measured by neutron diffraction in all three states of AB, ST, and STA, showing a strong 〈0 0 2〉 texture parallel to the building direction (BD). Elastic-field mathematical models were used to interpret the role of heat treatment in perfect-, and partial dislocations’ mobility and Peierls-Nabarro stress by considering the neutron diffraction and nanohardness data collected across the interface. Limiting aspects associated with dissimilar joining of IN718 and S275 alongside post-processing heat-treatments were pointed. Recommendations were made to facilitate possible additive repair of IN718 hybrid parts for various industrial applications.},

Glass adhesion was not observed even after 40-hour annealing suggesting the high chemical inertness of the coatings at the high temperature. In addition, the Ru–Pt multilayer coatings exhibited a better anti-sticking property than monolayer (Ru or Pt) coatings. The microstructure, surface morphology, and hardness were further characterized. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis confirmed the perseverance of layered structure after annealing at 750 °C and the hindrance effect on dislocation motion and diffusion arising from the Ru-Pt interfaces. After long-term annealing, interdiffusion leads to Pt-Ru solid solutions, which further enhance the mechanical performance and stability of the noble metal coatings, beneficial for prolonging the lifespan of PGM molds and the optical quality of molded glass. The high anti-sticking and mechanical performances of the developed coatings were finally confirmed in industrial tests.},

Therefore, research on contactless laser bone drilling has become a mainstream trend in the development of bone surgery. This study presents a laser rapid drilling strategy for bone surgery with minimizing thermal osteonecrosis and debris based on the design of dynamic focusing and spreading droplet cooling. The laser drilled hole suffered from low temperature ( T max = 46.2 ○ C) under clinically accepted threshold of 47 ○ C, presenting osteocyte-filled lacunas, visible Haversian canals and increased pullout strength when compared with that following mechanically drilling. An intact bone column without debris was extracted from a 4-mm-deep hole in vitro on a sheep tibia which provides a clean surgical method with increased drilling rate of 0.94 mm 3 /s. The criteria dimensionless We constant related to spreading droplets leading to effective heat transfer is determined as2.8 × 10 3 × Re -1/2 ≤ We ≤ 1.9 × 10 -2 × Re 7 , yielding a high convective coefficient of 0.11 W/mm 2 ·K for cooling.

  abstract     = {Heavy-metal-free ferroelectrics are sought as environmentally compatible alternatives to commonly used inorganic oxides. Here, we demonstrate direct evidence of the ferroelectric properties of a hybrid organic–inorganic material, dimethylglycinium-dimethylglycine chloride. At room temperature, the compound crystallizes in the polar space group P 2 1 and exhibits a switchable spontaneous polarization of 1.9 μC cm −2 . Ferroelectric properties are preserved in a wide temperature range up to about 401 K, where the crystal undergoes the transition to the paraelectric phase of the space group P 2 1 / c . The temperature-dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction study and the calorimetric data indicate an order–disorder contribution to the transition mechanism, which is consistent with the critical slowing down of the dielectric relaxation observed near the Curie point. The spontaneous polarization results from ionic displacements that are induced by changes in the disordering of the dimeric cations. In the ferroelectric phase, the crystal exhibits remarkable piezoelectric activity. The electromechanical and elastic properties of the material were thoroughly characterized.},

To prevent dental caries, it is important to inhibit S. mutans and induce tooth remineralization . In this study, we combined a self-assembled lysozyme with polyphemusin I (PI) to form a multi-functional membrane for inhibiting S. mutans and inducing remineralization. The normal enamel coated with lysozyme nanofilm could adsorb significant more PI. After combining with PI, the coated enamel could kill more S. mutans and had the superior ability in inhibiting biofilm formation. In addition, the coated enamel combined with PI could prevent the loss of calcium and phosphate ions. In the pH cycling, the coated enamel regenerated more crystals than normal enamel did. The coated enamel combined with PI had a significant lower lesion depth (72.45 ± 4.07 μm) compared to normal enamel combined with PI (93.30 ± 7.64 μm) after S. mutans demineralization. Moreover, the lysozyme nanofilm and PI had good biocompatibility . Accordingly, the formed multi-functional membrane could be a promising strategy for preventing dental caries.},

In this study, a biomimetic poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) shish-kebab microstructure was formed on the fibrillated domains of ePTFE through induced crystallization. The surface morphology and chemistry, mechanical property, cytocompatibility, and endothelial cell adhesion of PCL shish-kebab modified ePTFE were investigated. The effectiveness of and synergy between this physical topology modification and the traditional chemical RGD dig-coating in terms of cell adhesion were also evaluated. The positive effect of the shish-kebab structure on cell adhesion was found to be more significant than that of RGD coating, and there is a strong synergy between ePTFE surface modification and RGD coating.

However, it is a challenge to design the ideal IL with the required properties. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained by significantly large datasets have shown good performance in drug discovery. However, low generation efficiency and small sparse datasets prevent their application on IL. In this work, we propose a high generation efficiency molecular design model for IL, which realizes multi-objective optimization on a small dataset. The model combines VAE, multilayer perceptron, and particle swarm optimization for property prediction and molecule optimization. The thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the ILs are chosen as a case to verify the advantages of our model. The results shows that by setting molecular validity judgments to optimization target, 98\% output of our method are valid molecules. Besides, the heat capacity and thermal conductivity are improved by 39\% and 15\%, respectively. Our model improves the applicability to small sparse datasets and the generation efficiency of VAE-like generation model. By multi-objective design ILs for given properties, our model can provide guidance for the design and application of ILs.},

Traditional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery all have significant side effects. Therefore, multifunctional collaborative therapeutic nanoplatforms are attractive to patients with laryngeal cancer. In this study, a near-infrared responsive IR780-modified MXene (Ti 3 C 2 ) nanosheet was proposed as a strategy for targeted therapy to achieve the synergistic functions of photothermal (PTT) therapy, photodynamic (PDT) therapy and mitochondrial pathway apoptosis. Electron spin resonance results showed that Ti 3 C 2 @IR780 could produce singlet linear oxygen for PDT. Molecular biology studies showed that Ti 3 C 2 @IR780 had the outstanding ability to generate ROS to disrupt mitochondrial function, resulting in apoptosis of cancer cells up to 60.51\%. In vivo experiments showed that Ti 3 C 2 @IR780 could effectively aggregate at tumor sites. The temperature of the tumor region could reach 63.7 °C in the presence of near-infrared light. Tumor growth was inhibited by 92\% during the treatment, and there was no recurrence. Results of the sections showed an 88.1\% reduction in microtumor vascularity with Ti 3 C 2 @IR780 treatment for 21 days compared to the control group. These findings suggest that this multifunctional nanoplatform with synergistic NIR-sensitive properties can effectively inhibit tumor growth, providing an ideal strategy for cancer treatment.},

  abstract     = {In this work, different interlayer remelting strategies are applied to regulate the microstructure evolution, martensitic transformation, and superelastic features of NiTi shape memory alloys prepared using the EBF 3 additive manufacturing technique. The NiTi deposits prepared under different remelting beam currents are all composed of the B2 austenite, residual B19′ martensite, and submicron-scale Ti 4 Ni 2 O x precipitates, and exhibit a one-step phase transformation (B2 ↔ B19′). Meanwhile, the crystallographic orientation, grain boundaries, and residual strain of these alloys present a distinct variation with the application of different remelting beam currents. During mechanical testing, the critical stress (σ Ms ) of the EBF 3 -fabricated NiTi alloys was seen to possess a significant dependence on the martensitic transformation behavior, namely with the amount of B19′ martensite and the corresponding M s . However, the broadening and stabilization of lamellar martensite created by dislocation pile-ups and plastic deformation in the cyclic loading–unloading procedure is the key reason for the deterioration of the superelastic response of the NiTi deposits. This work confirms that the mechanical and functional performances of NiTi alloys produced via EBF 3 -technique can be modified upon the application of proper interlayer remelting strategies, which can be extrapolated to the directed energy deposition of shape memory alloys or other metal components.},

In this paper, a novel gradient-free optimization method is proposed by integrating the material-field series expansion topological parameterization and the deep neural networks, providing two-fold advances: firstly, it generally reduces the massive topological design variables to fewer than 200, while keeps the capability to represent relative complex 3D topologies and clear boundaries; secondly, by constructing a sequential neural network surrogate model, it sufficiently explores the reduced design space and is capable of handling multi-peak and discontinuous optimization problems. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated via several design problems, among which the optimized material effective bulk modulus achieves 98\% of the H-S bound and the highly-nonlinear peak weld stress in a phone dropping process is decreased by 16.59\%. This method reduces the computational time by 1–4 orders of magnitude compared with the coarse-mesh-based gradient-free methods, and it is the first time to successfully conduct gradient-free 3D topology optimization with thousands of finite elements. The method’s ease of implementation and compatibility with various simulation software, brings topology optimization into complex industrial applications and proves that gradient-free technology represents an effective optimization benchmark for improving structural performance.},

  abstract     = {Degradation in system performance due to ice accretion on curved surfaces remains a decades-old challenge. We recently reported that Buckling Elastomer-like Anti-icing Metallic Surfaces (BEAMS) exhibit a low ice adhesion strength and extreme durability in realistic icing conditions. BEAMS consist of thin, flat metal sheets suspended on strips or dots of adhesive, and this partial confinement facilitates buckling of the metal sheet, causing ice to dislodge from the surface at a low applied force. The mechanism of ice detachment from curved BEAMS has not been investigated. Here we study how curvature affects the shear ice adhesion strength of BEAMS, using both glaze- and rime-type ice at −20 °C. For glaze, it was observed that increasing the radius of curvature increased the ice adhesion strength regardless of whether the curvature was positive or negative. For rime ice a high radius of curvature, R = 17.3 mm, was used inside an icing wind tunnel. When the compliance of the material used to suspend the metallic sheet was increased, the rime ice adhesion strength was as low as τ ice ≈ 3 kPa. Further, the confinement configuration of BEAMS was studied to understand its effect on lateral torsional buckling. Lateral torsional buckling altered the radius of curvature of both the suspension material and metal sheet, initiating cracks due to the unchanged curvature of the accreted ice. Accordingly, the extremely low ice adhesion strength of BEAMS, even on curved surfaces, was due to buckling instabilities either within the thin metal plates or the suspension material. Overall, BEAMS would appear to be a durable, low-ice-adhesion candidate material even for complex and curved surface geometries such as the leading edges of aircraft wings, wind turbine blades, or power transmission lines.},

In this study, we report the successful formation of self-organized Cr 2 O 3 -Fe 2 O 3 core–shell nanoparticles by adopting a non-equilibrium route of pulsed laser-induced dewetting of an alloyed thin film. In this process, the evolution of nanoparticles takes place from the rupture of the initially flat liquid-phase alloyed film under laser irradiation. A continued laser pulsing results in the ripening of the morphologies at different stages eventually leading to a final droplet shape nanoparticle. Using highly sensitive 3D chemical mapping of individual nanoparticles and thermal simulations, we reveal that thermodynamically-soluble Cr 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 phase-segregate in the core and shell regions, respectively, within ∼ 100 ns during a fast solidification process, leveraging the difference in the cooling rates, surface energies and enthalpy of mixing at high-temperatures.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the utilization of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as regression models to solve the issue of hot flow stress forecasting has become a standard approach. In a connection with this kind of regression issue, employed ANNs are usually learned via a shallow learning technique while only limited attention has been paid to a deep learning method. In the frame of the submitted research, the shallow learning approach is thoroughly compared to the deep learning techniques which are based on the use of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and an Auto-Encoder (AE). To do so, these learning techniques are applied on a feed-forward multi-layer ANN describing the experimental hot flow curve dataset of micro-alloyed medium carbon steel. In comparison with the shallow learning method, both deep learning approaches provided higher accuracy in the network response – especially in the case of a higher number of hidden layers. The results have also shown that neither the RBM-based deep learning method nor the AE-based method had a significant effect on the duration of the necessary calculations. However, it turned out that the RBM-based method can, under certain conditions, lead to a more reliable network performance.},

Monotonic and cyclic tests were carried out at strain rates between 0.00833 s −1 and 250 s −1 , frequencies up to 20 Hz, and different mean stress, amplitude stress and stress ratios to evaluate the self-heating effect developing in the materials. Measurements of the specimen’s temperature were carried out using a thermochromic liquid crystal paint and an infrared sensor. Experimental results showed that the temperature increased during fibre testing by as much as 13.2 ± 0.2 °C and, even though the maximum temperature was below the melting temperature of the material, melting was observed. Tension-tension cyclic tests showed that the fatigue life of the coupon specimens significantly depended on the testing conditions. In some cases, the measured temperature was as high as 102 ± 1 °C. Depending on the fatigue parameters, the laminates showed two different types of failure modes: mechanical or thermal. Hence, it is important to take into account self-heating effects when designing engineering parts reinforced with UHMWPE fibres.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid microwave sintering is considered a promising method to produce densified components using in-situ resources for lunar construction. This study aimed to examine the effects of primary microwave sintering parameters on the densification, microstructure evolution, and mechanical properties of a lunar soil simulant and analyzed the processing-microstructure-properties relationship. The experimental design was based on the Taguchi method, where temperature, dwell time, and heating rate were regarded as the primary design factors. Density measurements presented the porosity of microwave-sintered specimens ranging from 8.5\% to 11.5\%. Chemical and microstructural characterization was integrated and showed three identical mineral phases appeared at different sintering conditions. Nanoindentation was used to determine nanomechanical properties of microstructural components and subsequent effective stiffness via homogenization technique. Uniaxial compressive strength of sintered specimens was also measured. The sintering design parameters in the range attempted significantly affected microstructural characteristics, while no major changes in the chemical–mechanical properties of phases occurred. Taguchi analysis implied that microstructural evolution is predominantly affected by the sintering temperature, whereas the other two factors (i.e., dwell time and heating rate) were not significant. The fundamental understanding from this study can improve the design of hybrid microwave sintering to densify lunar soils for future lunar construction.},

Electrical capacitance volume tomography (ECVT) is a powerful approach for detecting and visualizing the three-dimensional (3D) water distribution inside cement-based materials. In this paper, the water ingress in mortar and concrete was monitored and visualized in 3D by ECVT. The feasibility of ECVT was first verified by conducting a moisture transfer experiment inside uncracked mortars. Then, the water ingress process into cracked mortar and concrete was monitored and visualized using this technique, which further confirmed the ability to image 3D volumetric water content in materials with highly heterogeneous permittivity. In addition, the water distribution inside the cracked and uncracked mortars was simulated utilizing two finite element models. The simulated results agree well with the ECVT reconstructed results, supporting the applicability of ECVT to image 3D water transfer in uncracked and cracked cement-based materials.},

In this study, a comprehensive experimental program was conducted at multiple scales on the HS-ECC. It was found that increasing the replacement ratio of silica sand by GPA improved the tensile ductility, crack control ability, and energy absorption of HS-ECC, although its compressive and tensile strengths were reduced. GPA with low alkalinity were observed to react with the cementitious matrix, and the pozzolanic reaction provided additional chemical bond and thus enhanced the GPA/matrix interface. In addition, GPA could be regarded as “additional flaws” in the HS-ECC system. According to the Weibull-based modeling, it was found that GPA could play a crack-inducing role in activating more inactive initial flaws. Therefore, GPA can tailor the active flaw size distributions in HS-ECC matrix. The findings of this study provide a new avenue for the utilization of GPA.},

This review summarizes the additive manufactured HEAs in terms of microstructure characteristics, mechanical and some functional properties reported so far, and provides readers with a fundamental understanding of this research field. We first briefly review the application of AM methods and the applied HEAs systems, then the microstructure including the relative density, residual stress, grain structure, texture and dislocation networks, element distribution, precipitations and the influence of post-treatment on the microstructural evolution, next the mechanical properties consisting of hardness, tensile properties, compressive properties, cryogenic and high-temperature properties, fatigue properties, creep behavior, post-treatment effect and the strengthening mechanisms analysis.

  abstract     = {Artificial protrusions fabricated on metal surfaces are adequate for the mechanical interlocking to strengthen the metal/polymer joint. The morphology and its adhesion with the metal substrate of the fabricated protrusions greatly influence the joint strength and joint detachability. However, the large-sized protrusion can cause carbon fiber damage when embedded into the polymer plate, which results in the decline of the joint strength. This paper applied a diode-pumped solid-state laser system to melt stainless powders to fabricate micron-sized protrusions on metal surfaces. The effect of four impacting factors, original powder size, powder bedding thickness, laser power density, and laser irradiation time, on the formation of micro-protrusions was investigated. SEM was used to characterize the morphology and diameter of the formed micro-protrusions. The results showed that the fabricated micro-protrusions present a spherical shape under the stable manufacturing process, and the diameter ranged from 100 µm to 500 µm. The micro-protrusions size positively correlated with the original powder size and powder bedding thickness. Laser power density directly affected the forming of micro-protrusions, and the suitable process window was between 160 W/mm 2 to 290 W/mm 2 . When the laser irradiation time was 10 s, it helped stabilize the fabrication process.},

The effects of particle size on microstructure and strengthening mechanisms were clarified. It was found that both Si 3 N 4 p and TiB 2 p stimulated the nucleation of recrystallization and distorted the fibrous distribution of elongated grains. A strong grain refinement effect was realized by introducing fine Si 3 N 4 p and fine TiB 2 p, while the grain aspect ratio was the lowest in the composite reinforced by coarse particles. The texture intensity was weakened by the addition of particles, while the texture types were not changed. Si 3 N 4 p and TiB 2 p were tightly bonded with Al matrix, and MgAl 2 O 4 was formed at the Si 3 N 4 p/6061Al and TiB 2 p/6061Al interfaces, causing a large consumption of Mg element. Hence, the number of precipitates in matrix was reduced, and the precipitation strengthening was weakened. The composite reinforced by fine Si 3 N 4 p and coarse TiB 2 p owned a highest room-temperature strength due to the strengthening of load transfer, thermal mismatch, and precipitates. The combination of fine Si 3 N 4 p and fine TiB 2 p achieved a highest high-temperature strength, and load transfer and pinning effect of particles on grain boundaries became the main strengthening mechanisms.},

To overcome these problems, the multilayer micro-lattice biomaterials (MB) combining both suitable mechanical properties and biocompatibility are proposed based on skull structural characteristics. The quasi-static compressive mechanical properties of MB are studied experimentally, numerically and theoretically, which are verified by experimental results. The typical deformations, such as distinct shear zone and stress concentration of nodes, are observed. The strength and modulus of the above MB specimens are in the range of 86.72 ± 0.84 to 197.73 ± 0.74 MPa and 2.99 ± 0.13 to 7.56 ± 0.54 GPa, respectively. Simultaneously, the properties of MB with gradient design, including positive, negative and hybrid gradient are investigated by finite element (FE) simulation. The MB with hybrid gradient can better match the structural characteristics of skull. Since the designed MB has out-of-plane compression characteristics comparable to that of skull and suitable biological space for cell growth, it can be implanted into the human body to matched surrounding skull tissue well. The insight of MB combining with design constraints of biomaterials provides a novel method for designing/tuning skull repair biomaterials that might result in the optimized clinical skull surgery effect.},

  abstract     = {Biodegradable Zn-based composites have been recognized as a promising approach to develop the new generation biodegradable materials for orthopedic applications. However, the insufficient interfacial bonding between the Zn matrix and reinforcements limited the performance of Zn-based biocomposites. In this study, Cu 2 O modified graphene oxide (Cu 2 O-GO) sheets were employed as reinforcement to manufacture Cu 2 O-GO/Zn biocomposites via spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. Due to the low Gibbs free energy in the formation of ZnO (−163.8 kJ·mol −1 ), an in situ reaction between Cu 2 O and Zn matrix occurred during the SPS process, resulting in Cu and ZnO as reaction products. In the meantime, the Zn matrix could alloy with the in situ generated Cu, contributing to a Zn-Cu alloy matrix with enhanced mechanical performance. In other words, ZnO modified GO sheets reinforcing Zn-Cu matrix biocomposites were achieved by a one-step process. Intimate and strong interfacial connections between the graphene and Zn-Cu matrix were achieved in 4Cu 2 O-GO/Zn biocomposites via ZnO-related and CuZn 4 -related interfacial bonding. Considerable strengthening efficiencies (13.9–27.9) were confirmed in Cu 2 O-GO/Zn biocomposites. As a result, 4Cu2O-GO/Zn biocomposites exhibited a yield strength (YS) of 222.9 MPa, a degradation rate of 68.4 mm·y −1 , acceptable cytocompatibility to MC3T3-E1 cells, and antibacterial activity of 98.6\% to S. aureus.},

In addition, the wetting layer of Cu increased the bonding strength of the interface between Cu and the second phase.

Then, this study focused on investigating the effects of cage hydrophobicity and cage size on lipase encapsulation respectively by adjusting the log P value (from −0.85 to 1.28) and chain length (from 2.93 to 5.41 nm) of crosslinkers. It showed that lipase activity was dependent on the hydrophobicity of cage. Moreover, the size of cage had important effect on lipase loading amount, and a big cage was conducive to house lipase molecule. The structural analysis indicated that molecular cages could retain the active conformation of lipase and increase its structural rigidity. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed the interaction between the lid domain of lipase and molecular cage, leading to the higher activity of encapsulated lipase (63.6 U/mg) than that of free lipase (50.6 U/mg). Besides, the encapsulated lipase showed more than twice higher thermal stability and almost 8 times higher tolerance to denaturant than the adsorbed lipase.},

The scaffold consisted of nanofibre matrices arranged in a triangular prism micropattern with either aligned or random nanofibres. The morphological analysis revealed that the scaffolds had a compact layer of nanofibres, and the peak of the triangular prism was present after separation. The in-vitro analysis presents that the human dermal fibroblast cells (HDF) are distributed homogenously and aligned along the structural scaffold. The triangular prism micropattern supported cell movement, resulting in improved cell elongation behavior. In in-vivo analysis, the aligned microstructural scaffold demonstrated a better therapeutic effect and advanced epithelialization on day 7.

  abstract     = {Developing a dual-function skin-stretching device is beneficial for skin mechanotransduction analysis and wound healing applications. In this study, a dual-function skin-stretching device was designed based on three-dimensional (3D) printing, which can be fixed on rat skin for skin stretching and tension-relieving tests. During the skin stretching assay, a piece of skin was pulled outward by applying a mechanical load, the magnitude of which could be studied by force analysis. In the tension-relieving assay, skin wound edges could be pulled to the opposite side to accelerate wound closure. The skin-stretching device could exert forces of varying magnitudes (0.0042–0.0113 N) on the skin, leading to variations in the histological features of the skin epithelium. Western blot indicated that the protein levels of the mechanosensitive molecule yes-associated protein (YAP) were positively associated with the mechanical strength exerted on the skin. The tension-relieving assay demonstrated that the scores and cross-sectional size of skin scars decreased by fixing the skin-stretching device to the skin. Collectively, we developed a skin-stretching device that could potentially exert a dual force on rat skin, providing a potential method to analyze the molecular mechanism of mechanotransduction during stretch-induced skin growth and promote skin wound healing with a minor scar.},

However, the magnetostriction of bulk polycrystalline Fe-Ga alloys always suffers a major setback due to random grain orientation. In this study, selective laser melting (SLM) was used for the first time to manufacture bulk polycrystalline Fe 81 Ga 19 alloys, and different scanning paths were determined for revealing the influences on grain orientation and magnetostrictive properties. The results showed that elongated columnar grains formed in the building direction due to the epitaxial growth during SLM. For zigzag scanning, grain orientation was parallel to the building direction while tilted by ∼17° for unidirectional scanning. And annular scanning resulted in mixed grain orientations in the alloys. Moreover, Fe 81 Ga 19 alloy with zigzag scanning exhibited 〈1 0 0〉 preferred grain orientation. Consequently, the saturated magnetostriction of bulk Fe 81 Ga 19 alloy with zigzag scanning reached ∼77.2 ppm, representing 23.9\% and 25.1\% increments compared with unidirectional and annular scanning, respectively. The Fe 81 Ga 19 alloy with zigzag scanning also presented an ultimate compressive strength of 448.6 MPa and a degradation rate of 0.09 mm/y, as well as favorable biocompatibility. These results indicated that SLM might be a potential method for manufacturing magnetostrictive bulk Fe-Ga alloys for implant applications.},

The present study concentrated on a kind of precision-improving ultrasonic elliptic vibration cutting approaches, which fabricated nanometer-level surface roughness, inhibited subsurface damages evolution, and formed continuous ultra-fine grained layer microstructure. The surface morphologies have been characterized by ultra-depth three dimensional microscope and white light interferometer. Excellent machined surface quality was achieved under ultrasonic elliptic vibration cutting condition, and an ideal surface roughness of Sa = 70.7 nm was obtained. Microstructural alteration studied using EBSD technique and TEM observation confirmed the generation of ultra-fine grained structure. Surface grain size has been reduced from 50 ∼ 100 μm to 50 ∼ 300 nm without cracks and other micro-damages. Research demonstrated that surface energy accumulation and dislocations clustering induced by high-strain rate diamond tool impact provided the primary driving force of ductile-mode removal and grain recrystallization. A dislocation density-based simulation model was carried out to complement the static experimental investigations.

Generative machine learning may be a useful tool in extracting and transferring complex structure features. A generative adversarial network (GAN) was trained using x-ray microtomography images of porous and lattice structures. Three types of cellular materials were used. Two-dimensional images were generated by the generative network at two resolutions. A bag of features approach was used to sequence the generated images of porous structures. The combination of 2D GAN method and similarity based stacking resulted in 3D structures. The approach aimed at economising on computational cost whilst ensuring a degree of continuity through the structure. The original and generated open cell porous structure images were binarized and 3D surfaces were created using imaging tools. The surfaces were transformed into solid geometries, using computer aided design tools and exported for 3D printing. The compressive behaviour of the specimens was compared. The method generated qualitatively similar structures of consistent relative densities. However the relative density and compressive response of the generated structures diverged in relation to the reduction in resolution. The method shows promise for biomimicking, or generating hybrid natural-artificial structures, based on training sets.},

Their use is suboptimal for reasons like stress concentration at nodes, and/or poor anisotropy. Stochastic structures can mimic the bone microarchitecture with anisotropic mechanical properties. While several methods exist for generating stochastic structures, they face limitations like being computationally expensive, complex, or only applicable in specific cases. In this work, scaffolds are created using level set equations which permit spatially controllable porosity. A 3D volume is populated with random nodes, which segment the 3D volume into subdomains. Each subdomain is occupied with a basic architecture generated through level-set equations. All the architectures in the subdomains are then smoothly integrated at sub-domain boundaries to form the stochastic scaffold. Stainless steel stochastic scaffolds with porosities from 58\% to 70\% were fabricated and their mechanical characteristics, as well as cell viability, was assessed. Young’s modulus of the scaffolds ranges from 0.02 to 2 GPa, in the same range as that of trabecular bone, thus, mitigating stress shielding. I n-vitro assay displayed a statistically significant osteoblast growth from Day 1 to Day 3 in 58\%, 61\%, and 64\% porosity scaffolds.},

However, the rapid degradation of CS leads to pH problems and does not match the rate of osteogenesis. The 3D printed CS scaffolds were immersed in Polycaprolactone (PCL) solution to obtain PCL-coated scaffolds with improved mechanical and biological properties. Finite element method (FEM) analysis found that PCL impregnation has the effect of stress shielding and defect healing, effectively improving the mechanical properties of CS porous scaffolds. The degradation rate of PCL-coated scaffolds was significantly slowed down in Tris buffer. After 4 weeks of degradation, the compressive strength of PCL-coated scaffolds remained at 23.34 MPa, maintaining reliable mechanical properties. PCL coating significantly reduced the degradation rate of CS scaffolds, and the pH value and Si ion concentration of Dulbecco&#39;s modified Eagle&#39;s medium (DMEM) soaked by PCL-coated scaffolds were more favorable for cell survival. The results show that PCL-coated scaffolds enhance cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, demonstrating the potential applicability of bone tissue engineering applications.},

The reflection and transmission spectra are obtained for various graphene’s chemical potentials and refractive index of sensing layer (Ns) of structure in the range of 1.3–1.6 THz. The proposed structure exhibits the attributes of both dual-band filter and single-band antenna-sensor. The conductivity of graphene and its structural parameters are studied to optimize the component performance. In filtering mode, the first bandstop is from 1.23 to 1.6 THz equal to 26\% of fractional bandwidth (FBW) at 1.415 THz. The second stopband is centered at 3.12 THz with FBW of 14\% for Ns = 1.6 and 0.6 eV chemical potential. In the antenna mode, a single band of the antenna-sensor is centered at 1.95 THz for the same Ns and same chemical potential.

The oxide films formed after immersion for 85 days were deeply investigated by focused ion bombarding and transmission electron microscopy. Results have shown that OCP decreased with elevated temperature and corrosion potential increased with time. FeCrAl alloys have satisfactory corrosion resistance because of small corrosion currents and thin oxide films. Only monolayer multicrystal spinel oxide forms on FeCrAl alloys. Slight Nb addition (0.5 wt\% and 1.0 wt\%) benefits the corrosion resistance due to relatively large impedance of oxide and delayed oxidation of Fe 2 Nb particles.

The relationship between the flow stress and the deformation temperature, strain, and strain rate was exhibited by Johson-Cook (JC) constitutive model. It&#39;s found that the strengthening and softening parameters were variables at the high strain rate and hot deformation. The modification was employed, and the modified JC model showed a more precise prediction demonstrated by the higher average absolute relative error. The coupling effect of strain rate strengthening and thermal softening mechanism resulted in the flow stress evolution under different strain rates and temperatures. The dislocation theory was used to explain the strain rate strengthening that under the high strain rate over 10 2 s −1 , the main obstacle was the viscous damping mechanism. The quasi-static tests evaluated the thermal softening mechanism associated with the microstructure evolution. The dynamic recovery and recrystallization&#39;s synergistic effect dominated the thermal softening. During the thermal deformation, dense dislocations tangled around the κ phases, apt to be the nucleation of the dynamic recrystallization.

At the same time, the development of production methods that are cost effective, scalable and reproducible becomes crucial to ensure the clinical translation of any development. The application of electrospray (ES) technology in micro-nano drug delivery system not only has the above advantages, but also can quickly obtain uniform and stable micro/nanoparticles as drug carriers through its own characteristics. Natural or synthetic polymers are often used as raw materials for these micro/nanoparticles. The micro/nanoparticles carriers prepared by these polymers can change the solubility and bioavailability of drugs and reduce the toxicity caused by mass accumulation after sudden drug release. And after reaching the target site, they’re easy to degrade and will not accumulate in the body. In this review, taken together, we briefly describe the principle and advantages of ES, as well as the common polymers for the preparation of micro/nanoparticles by this method. The types of electrosprayed micro/nanoparticles and their advantages as micro-nano drug delivery systems in different drug delivery routes and different diseases were also discussed.

  abstract     = {Based on the compositional design concept, an Al–6 Mg–0.8Mn (–0.2Sc) alloy with a good combination of strength and ductility was obtained by hot extrusion deformation with a large extrusion ratio. The microstructure evolution and mechanical property of an Al–6 Mg alloy with adding Mn and/or Sc elements were investigated. The results showed that the addition of Sc element resulted in the grain refinement and promoted the precipitation of nano-sized Al 6 Mn phases in the Al–6 Mg–0.8Mn–0.2Sc alloy. After hot extrusion, the number of nano-sized Al 6 Mn phases decreased with the morphology transforming into the rhomboidal/plate-like shape. The combined effect of nano-sized Al 6 Mn phases and Al 3 Sc dispersoids offered a strong pinning effect on both grain boundaries and dislocations, leading to a significant refinement for recrystallized grains. Strengthening mechanism analysis indicated that the grain boundary and dislocation strengthening play important roles in enhancing the yield strength of the alloy. In addition, the uniform distribution of solid solution Mg atoms and high recrystallized fraction contributed to the high ductility of the extruded alloy. The aim of this work is to provide a strategy to acquire Al–Mg alloys with excellent mechanical performance.},

To enhance their mechanical properties and mutually their usability, grain refinement of the initially coarse-grained microstructure was realized using high–pressure torsion. This leads to different microstructural conditions, exhibiting fine-, ultrafine-grained or nanocrystalline microstructures. Scanning as well as transmission electron microscopy was performed to analyze the respective grain size and microstructures. The hardness and Young’s modulus of the deformed specimens were quantified by nanoindentation testing. Furthermore, X–ray diffraction indicated a decreased grain size and changed lattice spacings upon increasing the deformation ratio. The deformed specimens were tested for their fracture behaviour by continuous stiffness measurements during in-situ microcantilever bending experiments. Here, mean J –integral values of 288 ± 38 J/m 2 and 402 ± 89 J/m 2 were determined for the 5 and 50 times turned specimens, respectively.

The SLM-processed HEAs presented a simple disordered face centered cubic solid solution with columnar grains growing along the building direction and exhibiting a 〈0 0 1〉 preferred orientation. Dendritic-segregation, a common phenomenon occurring in as-cast counterparts was eliminated, thus providing a significant method to form a single-phase solid solution. The cellular structure in the columnar grains germinated perpendicular to the boundary of molten pools. In addition, dislocations induced by internal stress were observed. Accordingly, the SLM-processed Al 0.3 CoCrFeNiCu HEA exhibited superior microhardness and compressive strength. Finally, two types of defects were found in this SLM alloy, including irregular holes and hot cracks. The latter occurring on solid–liquid interface of molten pool were retarded by grain boundaries and then turned into muti-branches. Nevertheless, no crack-free sample could be prepared even though the printing parameters were optimized to achieve a high relative density of 99.08\%, indicating this HEA was not suitable for SLM technology to prepare.},

The determination of critical impact velocity is of crucial importance in designing munitions to produce a maximum destructive effect on the target upon impact. Here, combining high-speed photography and image processing technique, we demonstrate an approach to determine the critical impact velocity through quantitatively assessing the energy-release characteristics of a Zr-Ti-Nb reactive alloy under high-speed impact. The Zr-Ti-Nb alloy is fabricated by powder metallurgy and has high strength and sufficient ductility under dynamic loading. By conducting a series of ballistic impact experiments, the relationship between the impact velocity of alloy projectiles and light emission from burning fragments is obtained and discussed. Two critical impact velocities are determined. The first represents the minimum impact velocity required for initiating the intense exothermic reaction of the alloy projectiles, while the second denotes the impact velocity when the extent of reaction reached the maximum. By analyzing the fragments recovered at different velocities, it is proved that the fragmentation behavior of the alloy projectiles is found to be highly dependent on the impact velocity. This results in obvious different energy-releasing characteristics of Zr-Ti-Nb alloy, and the corresponding mechanism was also discussed.},

It is found that coherent particles exert a stronger retardation effect on grain boundaries compared to incoherent particles, with regards to both pressure and time, but also that this benefit is limited to a small range of misfit values. The simulations also show that the mobility is not a constant during particle passage, as commonly assumed, which means that grain boundary pressure cannot easily be extracted from the grain boundary velocity. Furthermore, the complex evolution of the pass-through mechanism and the transient behavior for intermediate coherencies is also investigated. The highest drag force is found to occur at the switching point between enveloping and pass-through. As part of the study, the advantages of using PFC for this type of analyses are also highlighted.},

Thereafter, nanopatterned porous Ti sheets were crumpled at two deformation velocities ( i.e., 2 and 100 mm/min). The compression tests of the scaffolds indicated that the elastic modulus of the specimens vary in the range of 11.8–13.9 MPa. Micro-computed tomography scans and computational simulations of crumpled scaffolds were performed to study the morphological properties of the resulting meta-biomaterials. The porosity and pore size of the scaffolds remained within the range of those reported for trabecular bone. Finally, the in vitro cell preosteoblasts culture demonstrated the cytocompatibility of the nanopatterned scaffolds. Moreover, the aspect ratio of the cells residing on the nanopatterned surfaces was found to be significantly higher than those cultured on the control scaffolds, indicating that the nanopatterned surface may have a higher potential for inducing the osteogenic differentiation of the preosteoblasts.},

In this study, a thin-walled BMgS structure was optimised. A ZE21B alloy with large breaking elongation and excellent mechanical properties served as the basis of our BMgS. Using finite element analysis, the support ring structure of a typical stent BioMatrix was optimised using response surface models, and an optimised configuration of a thin-walled BMgS was obtained. The optimised thin-walled stent (100-μm thick) had a radial strength comparable to that of the original thick-walled stent (150-μm thick); and the maximum principal strain is significantly decreased (0.207 vs 0.283). The balloon dilation and radial strength tests were validated. Experiments showed that the optimised stent had sufficient deformation stability during the crimping and expansion processes, and there was no strut fracture. Furthermore, the maximum principal stress area of the stent and the damage to the stenotic artery were significantly improved after optimisation.},

Herein, based on the abnormal tumor metabolism (glutamine addiction), a nanosystem of glutamine-decorated nanoparticles was fabricated to achieve efficient tumor delivery. Considering the high toxicity and side effect by chemotherapy with high doses, a chemotherapeutic sensitizer tetrandrine was used in combination with doxorubicin to achieve a synergistic effect in tumor treatment. The targeted nanosystems of glutamine-decorated nanoparticles (GDTNPs) were loaded with doxorubicin and tetrandrine simultaneously. Effective tumor accumulation of GDTNPs in vitro and in vivo was achieved due to glutamine addiction and the extraordinary inter-organ glutamine metabolism. The data revealed that tetrandrine enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin to hepatic carcinoma cells by blocking cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and arresting cell cycle, demonstrating the synergism of doxorubicin and tetrandrine. With KM mice bearing murine hepatic tumor (H22) as model, GDTNPs demonstrated the optimum tumor inhibition efficacy with no notable systemic toxicity. Therefore, it could be propose that the co-delivery of doxorubicin and tetrandrine by the glutamine-decorated nanoparticles is a promising strategy for the effective chemotherapy of hepatic carcinoma with enhanced efficacy and reduced cytotoxicity.},

In this research, the random fields were verified through experimental characterization to predict the elastic response of three nuclear graphite grades, ETU-10, IG-110, and 2114. Finite element models (FEM) were generated using segmentations of x-ray computed tomography (XCT) data known as image-based models (IBMs) to validate and compare with the RFEM results and better understand the effects of uniform oxidation in these graphite grades. The RFEM predictions appear to correlate well with the experimental values of the measured Young’s modulus of the three graphite grades and display the same trends as IBMs.},

  abstract     = {Shear relaxation commonly occurs in shock compressed metals at the plastic wave front, but no consensus has ever been reached on its origin due to the multiscale nature of high rate plasticity. To this end, this work takes a top-down approach by conducting a theoretical and numerical investigation on the macroscale, and then simulations on the mesoscale with crystal plasticity, followed by a brief discussion on the microscale mechanisms based on dislocation theory. On the macroscale, theoretical derivation through isotropic elasticity and von-Mises plasticity, as well as continuum simulations of shocked aluminum employing Johnson-Cook plasticity and equations of state for nonlinear elasticity at high pressures, uncovers that strain rate hardening decisively leads to shear relaxation when the equivalent plastic strain rate is greater than two-thirds of the total strain rate ( ε ̇ p &gt; 2 / 3 ∙ ε ̇ 1 ε̇p&amp;gt;2/3∙ε̇1 ). Other factors play subsidiary roles, including limited or conditioned promotive effect of thermal softening and suppressive effect of strain hardening. On the mesoscale, simulations with crystal plasticity and hyperelasticity perfectly verify the macroscopic discoveries, and additionally revealed the subordinate stimulative effect of deformation heterogeneity of polycrystals. On the microscale, dislocation nucleation and multiplication are identified as the dominant factors by evaluating contributions of micro-mechanisms to strain rate hardening.},

  abstract     = {Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. At present, drugs are one of the most indispensable means to treat OSCC. Evodiamine (EVO) is one of the major bioactive compounds of the plant Evodia and has been shown to inhibit the growth of OSCC cells. However, it suffers from poor aqueous solubility, which results in a low bioavailability. To improve of this property, we utilized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as a vehicle for the delivery of EVO, which were functionalized with folic acid (FA) for targeting the tumor cells. The GQDs-FA-EVO nanocomposite system was synthesized by a self-assembly method, which was simulated theoretically at the atomic scale using molecular dynamics calculations. These MD simulations confirmed that the binding of EVO to the FA-functionalized GQDS was spontaneous and resulted in the formation of a highly stable nanocomposite complex. When the loading of EVO into the composite system was 10\%, the growth inhibition rate of OSCC cells exceeded 50\%( p &lt; 0.01). In tumor-bearing nude mice, the GQDs-FA-EVO composite loaded with 10\% EVO significantly reduced the tumor volume by 19\% compared to the EVO group after the 18-days treatment( p &lt; 0.05).},

  abstract     = {This work describes the use of fused deposition modelling (FDM) to prepare antiplatelet thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based tubular grafts. FDM 3D-printing technology is widely available and provides the ability to easily design tubular grafts on demand, enabling the customisation of vascular prosthesis dimensions. An antiplatelet drug, dipyridamole (DIP), was combined with TPU using hot-melt extrusion to prepare filaments. DIP cargos ranged between 5 and 20\% (w/w). The resulting filaments were used to prepare small diameter vascular grafts using FDM. These grafts were characterised. Moreover, DIP release kinetics, antiplatelet activity and in vitro hemo- and cytocompatibility were evaluated. The results suggested that the materials could provide sustained DIP release for 30 days. Moreover, the presence of 5\% DIP in the material showed a clear antiplatelet effect compared with pristine TPU. Alternatively, higher DIP loadings resulted higher surface roughness leading to higher platelet adhesion. Therefore, the biocompatibility of 5\% DIP samples was tested showing that this type of materials allowed higher HUVEC cell proliferation compared to pristine TPU samples. Finally, DIP loaded TPU was combined with rifampicin-loaded TPU to prepare double-layered tubular grafts. These grafts demonstrated a clear antimicrobial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.},

  abstract     = {Template-assisted electrodeposition is a promising microscale additive manufacturing technique allowing to deposit pure metals with high resolution. To allow the application-relevant design of metamaterials, it is necessary to establish microstructure-mechanical property relationships under extreme conditions. In this work, a novel process based on two-photon lithography was used to synthesize arrays of nanocrystalline nickel micropillars and complex microlattices. This allowed high throughput mechanical testing using a newly developed in situ nanoindenter at unprecedented combination of cryogenic temperatures (160 to 300 K) and strain rates (0.001 to 500 s −1 ). Strain rate sensitivity was found to increase from ∼ 0.004 at 300 K to ∼ 0.008 at 160 K. Thermal activation analysis showed a decrease in activation volume from 122b 3 at 300 K to 45b 3 at 160 K and an activation energy of 0.59 eV in line with collective dislocation nucleation as the rate limiting mechanism. Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction allowed quantifying microstructural changes during deformation. As such, a deformation map along with the responsible deformation mechanisms has been ascertained for additively micromanufactured nanocrystalline nickel at unique combinations of extreme temperatures and strain rates. Further, rate-dependent compression of microlattices and complementary finite element simulations using the results from micropillars as constitutive models exemplified the promise of such metal microarchitectures in space and aviation applications.},

The simultaneous effects of reinforcement on composite properties were analyzed quantitatively with models to establish synergies or a coupling effect of lignin. The agreement between measured results and predicted values proved to be excellent. The models were also successfully applied to data published in the literature. Lignin increased the strength from 10 to 20 MPa, and a smaller amount of added flax increased the strength up to 30 MPa. Modeling also established the stronger reinforcing effect of flax; the corresponding B parameters for lignin and flax were 3.7 and 5.9 for strength and 1.0 and 5.2 for impact resistance, respectively. The two reinforcements acted independently; their effects were additive, and synergism could not be detected.

Conventional histology identifies different zones within carious lesions by their optical appearance, but fails to quantify the underlying nanoscale structural changes as a function of specific location, impeding better understanding of the demineralisation process. We employ detailed collocative analysis using different imaging modalities, resolutions and fields of view. Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) reveals subsurface 3D nanostructure within milled micro-sized volumes, whilst X-ray tomography allows minimally destructive 3D imaging over large volumes. Correlative combination of these techniques reveals fine detail of enamel rods, inter-rod substance, sheaths, crystallites and voids as a function of location. The degree of enamel demineralisation within the body of the lesion, near its front, and at the surface is visualized and quantified in 3D. We thus establish the paradigm of dental 3D nano-histology as an advanced platform for quantitative evaluation of caries-induced structural modification.},

The TaNiSiC films remained X-ray amorphous after four hour-long annealings up to 700 °C, while TaNiC alloys with high Ni and C contents crystallized. These differences were attributed to a strong driving force for separation of Ni and C in TaNiC, whereas the addition of Si, due to its solubility in the other elements, reduced the elemental segregation in TaNiSiC. The as-deposited TaNiSiC films exhibited hardnesses of 9–12 GPa. Annealing led to an increase in hardness by 2–4 GPa, due to decreases in average atomic distance, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction measurements. Potentiodynamic polarizations from –0.7 to +1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) in 10 mM sodium borate showed lower current densities by up to 2 orders of magnitude with increasing Ta content (28–52 at.\%). Changes in Si/C content (7–13 at.\% Si) had no effect. However, optical microscopy showed that TaNiSiC films with high Si/low C contents (13/10 at.\%) suffered much less localized etching compared to TaNiC films. Thus, Si had a significant role in increasing the mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability of the TaNiSiC films.},

The mechanism of the Dy-modified MgSnGd phase and its effect on the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-cast and as-extruded alloy were systematically investigated. Experimental results reveal that a new phase MgSn (Gd, Dy) is formed with Dy addition to Mg-8Zn-1Mn-3Sn-1.2Gd alloy, MgSn (Gd, Dy) phase can act as an effective heterogeneous nucleation site of MgSnGd phase. Meanwhile, the addition of Dy consumes Sn and Gd atoms, reducing the enrichment of solute atoms and inhibiting the MgSnGd phase&#39;s growth. The Dy addition can effectively promote the dynamic recrystallization process due to the combined effects of the refined grain structure of as-cast alloy and the particle-stimulated nucleation effect caused by dispersed MgSnGd phase. The alloy exhibits an excellent combination of high strength and ductility with the ultimate tensile strength of 384 MPa and an elongation of 14.5\%. The fine-grained structure, the uniformly distributed MgSnGd particle, and MgSn (Gd, Dy) nanoparticles are mainly responsible for the ultra-high ultimate tensile strength. The high ductility is due to the fine-grained structure, appropriate decrease of dislocation density, and dynamic recrystallization.},

  abstract     = {Wire + Arc Additive Manufacture (WAAM) is an economical manufacturing technique to build components. To maintain the commercial and technical benefits, inspection is desired at each layer of the build. New conformable phased array roller-probes offer the potential to inspect the as-built sample in-process or on completion. A challenge with such inspections is the refraction of the ultrasonic waves at multiple interfaces. The Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT) and Total Focusing Method (TFM), combined with Full Matrix Capture (FMC) acquisition enabled imaging through the as-built WAAM surface. However, single-element firings, associated with FMC are a limiting factor due to the lower energy at transmission, while the high number of firings and subsequent larger data size negatively affect inspection speed. This work introduces the concept of Virtual Source Aperture (VSA) for ultrasonic roller-probe inspection, through modelling of VSA on custom-designed calibration WAAM block. The concept is then demonstrated on a mock as-built WAAM sample inspection with reference defects. The results demonstrate that a markedly lower number of transmissions are required to match the performance of the FMC counterpart while increasing the energy levels. Moreover, an almost 50\% reduction in the data size enabled a doubling of the inspection speed.},

The impact of SOC concentration, injection speed, series-connected filter number on the in-situ filtration/degradation performance of the filter were systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that the prepared filter had excellent catalytic capability towards all mentioned SOCs. Specifically, three series-connected filters could completely degraded SOCs even when the concentration of each SOC was higher than 0.1 mM. ESR and quenching tests indicated that the OH and SO 4 − were main radical species dominating the SOC degradations. Meanwhile, high-valent metal-oxo species were also generated which participated in the SOC degradations. Furthermore, the filter had promising longtime use stability which maintained its effectiveness for 2 h of uninterrupted water flow.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the moisture damage mechanism and material selection of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) with amine-based antistripping agent (ASA). The surface free energy (SFE) of virgin and ASA modified asphalts and five aggregates with different acidities were measured, yielding the compatibility of each asphalt-aggregate combination. The corresponding compacted mixtures were evaluated by tensile strength ratio (TSR) considering the freeze–thaw and MIST conditioning. The use of amine ASA changed the thermodynamic properties of asphalt by decreasing the nonpolar components and increasing the polar components, which enhanced the work of adhesion between asphalt and aggregate and reduced the free energy released at the presence of water. The wettability of asphalt over aggregate was also increased due to the ASA, suggesting a better coating quality of asphalt mixtures was achieved. All those changes led to the increased energy ratio (ER), indicating the improved moisture resistance and compatibility of materials. At the molecular level, it might be because the amino groups from ASA adsorbed the silanol groups at the aggregate surface, leading to a stronger bond between asphalt and aggregate. The asphalt mixtures with acidic aggregate exhibited more serious moisture damage, which could be attributed to the lower dry adhesion energy and the larger free energy released with moisture. To enhance the moisture resistance, the selection of compatible asphalt-aggregate combinations seemed more effective than the use of amine ASA. The ERs of all the asphalt-aggregate combinations correlated well with the TSR results, and the SFE-based criteria for material selection of HMA were tentatively proposed.},

It has been selected in this study for producing bulk material and complex geometries of a strut-based lattice type (rhombic dodecahedron). A detailed characterisation of as-built and heat-treated specimens has been conducted including microstructural analyses, identification of imperfections and rigorous mechanical testing under different load conditions. An isotropic elastic–plastic material model is deduced on the basis of tension test results of bulk material test specimens. Performed experiments under compression, shear, torsion and tension load are compared to their virtual equivalents. With the help of numerical modelling, the overall structural behaviour was simulated using the detailed lattice geometry and was successfully predicted by the presented numerical models. The discussion of the limits of this approach aims to evaluate the potential of the numerical assessment in the modelling of the properties for novel lightweight structures.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most important components of a vehicle, the automotive coating system is typically a multi-layer polymeric structure with complex scratch damage patterns. This work is the first one to systematically investigate the scratch performance of an automotive coating system via experimental and numerical approaches. To achieve this end, uniaxial tensile tests are firstly carried out to acquire the basic mechanical properties of paint films at different strain rates. Then, a series of scratch tests are conducted in accordance with ASTM D7027/ISO 19252 standards, and the damage features are identified. In addition, the effects of scratch speed, loading rate, and stylus type are experimentally investigated. Afterwards, a finite element approach for scratch simulations is developed, which includes a rate-dependent constitutive model calibrated using the uniaxial tensile tests, a tied interface algorithm for efficient connection between coating and substrate, and an interior contact method to avoid excessive element distortions. Eventually, with the aid of the presented numerical approach, the damage patterns observed in scratch tests are numerically explained, and the scratch damage process is reasonably surmised. The presented approaches and findings can contribute to the development of anti-scratch automotive coating structures.},

The results showed the incorporated nHAP increased the hydrophilicity of the fiber surface, and 6–10 wt\% nHAP/PLA membrane showed the enhanced modulus in the direction perpendicular to membrane plane. Biological experiments demonstrated the nHAP proportion-dependent osteogenic activity of nHAP/PLA membranes. The addition of 6–10 wt\% nHAP in the fiber membrane significantly promoted cell proliferation and differentiation. In vivo experiments of stacked implantation of the membrane displayed multilayer growth in the pure PLA group owing to the hydrophobicity of PLA and single-layer growth in the nHAP/PLA group because the hydrophilicity of the nHAP/PLA membrane improved the adhesion of the layers. The addition of 6–10 wt\% nHAP/PLA also promoted cell recruitment and infiltration and increased osteogenesis, with enhancements of 41\% in bone tissue volume/total tissue volume and 37\% in bone mineral density. Our study provides helpful support for the preparation of composite electrospun membranes with improved osteogenic activity by optimising the organic–inorganic proportion.},

First, we explain the design settings of labyrinthine metamaterials. Next, the objective functions to obtain labyrinthine structures are introduced, and the corresponding topological derivatives are obtained. The optimization problem is formulated in the framework of the level set topology optimization method, and two-dimensional numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. Based on the frequency responses of the effective parameters and dispersion analysis, the optimized designs are characterized by a negative refractive index over a wide frequency interval, which can be controlled by a parameter introduced in the objective function.},

  abstract     = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes regularly experience high temperatures, quick velocities and rapid solidification taking place in a small volume melt pool. Accurate capturing of data from the melt pools is very difficult and can require expensive equipment. Physics based numerical models can be used to simulate the AM process. However, there are many thermal and fluid dynamics models that have been developed each with their own sets of physical models and assumptions. In this work, a three dimensional multiphysics computational fluid dynamics model was used to obtain thermal behavior, geometry and surface topology from the melt pool of single laser scan tracks on a bare Inconel 625 substrate. The simulation results were compared with the highly controlled AMB2018-02 series of benchmark tests performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The complex physics involved in the simulations, including heat and mass transfer, fluid flow, evaporation, and Marangoni convection enabled accurate prediction of the melt pool geometry, thermal behavior and the surface topology. The simulation results for the thermal behavior were mostly within the standard deviation of the experimental results. Simulation results from surface topography were able to capture the peak and valley trends. Overall, the underlying physics involved produced good results in a reasonable amount of time and were accurate enough to form a basis that can be coupled with other models to predict microstructure and other material properties.},

Two exothermic peaks derived from the primary solidification of the α-Al phases and the α-Al/Si eutectic reaction were detected. These exothermic peaks became broader and shifted to lower temperatures at higher cooling rates. Focus ion beam (FIB) milling enables microstructural characterization of AlSi10Mg powder solidified at controlled cooling rates above 10 2 °C·s −1 in the FSC equipment. The sample solidified at 4 × 10 4 °C·s −1 exhibited a fine microstructure consisting of a primary α-Al phase surrounded by lamellar-shaped Si phases. The fraction of the Si phase continuously decreased with increasing cooling rate, indicating higher content of solute Si element in the α-Al phase solidified at a higher cooling rate. The secondary dendrite arm spacing (λ) of the primary α-Al phase decreased in the sample solidified at a higher cooling rate ( dT / dt ). The relation follows a general equation of λ = A ( dT / dt ) - n ( A : 38.4, n : 0.33) in wide range of cooling rate (10 -1 ∼ 10 4 °C·s −1 ).

  abstract     = {The objective of this contribution was to increase the fracture toughness of talcum reinforced polypropylene (PP) while preserving specimen stiffness. This was accomplished by introducing soft interlayers (ILs) made of standard PP (PP-St) or very compliant PP (PP-Soft) and utilizing the so-called material inhomogeneity effect. Architectures with one or two ILs of either 0.3 or 0.9 mm thickness were tested in single edge notched bending experiments. Layers of PP-Soft always arrested growing cracks due to their low Young’s modulus, E , and yield stress, σ y σy , which is called an ( E - σ y ) E-σy) -inhomogeneity. However, the increase in fracture toughness came at the cost of specimen stiffness. For ILs made of PP-St, E was still lower compared to the matrix material, but σ y σy was similar (pure E -inhomogeneity). Specimen stiffness remained high for these composites, but crack arrest could not be achieved in most cases, which could be explained by plastic deformation of the soft layers. Plastic deformation could be contained within the ILs in one of the architectures, where two large ILs were used. Crack arrest could be achieved in this adapted IL design, leading to excellent fracture toughness in combination with high stiffness.},

Five bra cups with different types of surface yarn and shapes are proposed. The physical and compression properties of the bra cups, degree of support and subjective sensation of the resultant bra prototypes are then evaluated and compared with a conventional daily wear bra with foam cups. The results show that the proposed bra cups could provide a compression strength and support comparable to those of foam bra cups but with air resistance decreased from 0.32 kPa･sec/m to&lt;0.23 kPa･sec/m. The spacer fabric knitted bra cups made of double strands of surface yarn can exert significantly higher bra-skin interfacial pressure (p &lt; 0.05) and reduce 9\% of relative nipple displacement than that made of single strands of yarn. The different cup shapes show differences in perceived breast stability, gap between the breast and bra cup and thermal sensation. The outcomes show the feasibility of producing bra cups from yarn in one step and provide a reference for future development of sustainable intimate apparel.},

We used PD-L1 siRNA to down-regulate checkpoint protein PD-L1 on cancer cell surfaces, and IFN-γ was used as an immunomodulatory agent to activate the innate immune system. When PD-L1 siRNA, IFN-γ, and glucose oxidase (GOx) were co-delivered to the tumor microenvironment (TME) by a pH-sensitive drug delivery system (DDS), starvation-immunotherapy combinedly resulted in significant tumor volume reduction in a mouse model. The DDS was prepared by using PLGA polymer whose surface was coated with chitosan. IFN-γ, siRNA, and GOx entrapment efficiencies were 93.5 ± 3.1\%, 65.1 ± 2.6\%, and 66.2 ± 3.3\%, respectively. Moreover, the size of the DDS was well below 200 nm, allowing easy sterilization and tumor accumulation by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In vitro pH-dependent release study indicated that in acidic pH, the developed DDS can show accelerated drug release. In a mouse model and in acidic TME, the DDS resulted in the best therapeutic effect due to pH-dependent drug release compared to unmodified DDS and free drug.

  abstract     = {Laser-processing technologies are often applied to enhance the properties of ceramics, such as laser glazing of Yttria Stabilised Zirconia (YSZ). However, very limited attention was paid to the solidification phenomena and mechanisms of YSZ. In this paper, two coexisting solidification behaviours of laser-melted YSZ have been identified, namely grain bending (crystals with curved grain boundary geometry under the surface) and grain surface sealing (in-plane surficial crystals cover vertical columnar grains). Although these phenomena have been reported, this is the first time the two phenomena coexist in the same material. A new cellular automata (CA) approach has been proposed to explain the formation mechanisms of these two phenomena. This new CA method consists of the separation of growth modes into dendritic and planar growth, whose critical transition value is calculated based on the supercooling theory. Besides, the proposed model for planar growth is far less computationally expensive than the widely used decentred octahedron algorithm. A good agreement with the EBSD data of longitudinal cross-sections and the top surface has been observed which proves that the proposed method can become a more realistic and efficient way to predict the grain microstructure in laser processing, allowing to capture dendritic and planar growth simultaneously.},

In this study, the elastic constants of the equiatomic ternary refractory multi-principal-element alloys, NbTiV, and MoNbV, were investigated, using in-situ neutron diffraction and first-principles calculations. The experimentally measured and theoretically predicted elastic constants show a good agreement. The alloying effect of adding Ti and Mo into NbV base alloy on the elastic constants is studied. Particularly, adding Ti elements into the NbV alloy results in the increase of the Zener anisotropy ratio from 0.59 to 0.99, leading to the formation of the elastically isotropic NbTiV alloy, while the addition of Mo decreases the anisotropy ratio to 0.52. Pugh’s ratio ( B / G ), Cauchy pressure ( C 12 - C 44 ), and Poisson’s ratio ( ν ) are used to predict the brittle/ductile nature of the studied alloys, which is consistent with the mechanical results. The present work provides valuable insights into the design of ductile and strong refractory high-entropy alloys by tuning the elastic properties.},

Scaffolds with nano-sized calcium deficient hydroxy apatite (CDHA) in the core and large crystals of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD or brushite) on the outer surface were fabricated by immersing the 3D ceramic scaffold in aqueous ‘cement solution’. In contrast to conventional CaP cement reactions where a single product is obtained, here we could achieve a composite of apatite-brushite. The composite scaffolds showed improved compressive strength without loss of porosity which was suitable for efficient bone tissue regeneration. With 65\% porosity, these scaffolds showed compressive strength of 15 MPa. The porosity of CaP scaffold was increased by applying salt-leaching technique to 3D printing, which greatly influenced the biodegradation of the scaffold in vivo . Composite scaffolds with fast degrading brushite shell showed better and faster scaffold-to-bone integration compared to apatite based scaffold. In vivo studies verified that multi-phase CaP scaffolds with bimodal pore structure induced good new bone formation behavior (85\% of coverage rate on calvaria defect site after 11 weeks of implantation) with good biodegradability (76.6\% of degradation in rabbit subdermal model after 12 weeks of implantation).},

Cell uptake experiments, in vivo imaging, and tissue distribution experiments demonstrated that HCNCs had excellent targeting ability to homologous tumor cells (SK-BR-3). The results of MTT, flow cytometry, Western blot, cell immunofluorescence staining, and in vivo antitumor experiments proved that HCNCs had a more significant ability to promote HER2-positive breast cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit its proliferation. These results clearly concluded that HCNCs were a promising nano-targeted preparation in anti-HER2-positive breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {The construction of twin boundaries (TBs) in materials is a remarkable way of promoting their strength and ductility. However, the effects of TB orientation on the mechanical properties have not been reported experimentally so far. Using a state-of-the-art in situ tensile stage equipped in a transmission electron microscope, uniaxial tensile tests were performed on three single-crystalline Ni samples with TB parallel and perpendicular to the tensile direction and no TB. The results showed that the uniform tensile elongation strongly depends on TB, 120\% for the perpendicular TB sample, 99\% for the parallel TB sample, and only 55\% for the no TB sample. In addition, dislocation interaction before reaching the perpendicular CTB contribute to cross-slip and dynamic formation of dislocation jogs, thereby improving strain hardening and resulting in a large uniform tensile elongation.},

Traditional structure zone diagrams that relate one or two deposition conditions to microstructures are limited to simple mappings, with machine-learning methods only recently attempting to relate multiple processing parameters to the final microstructure. Despite this progress, process-structure relationships are unknown for deposition conditions that vary during thin-film deposition, limiting the range of achievable microstructures and properties. We combine phase-field simulations with a genetic algorithm to identify and design time-dependent deposition protocols that achieve tailor-made microstructures. We simulate the physical vapor deposition of a binary-alloy thin film by employing a phase-field model, where deposition rates and diffusivities of the deposited species vary in time and are controlled via the genetic algorithm. Our genetic-algorithm-guided protocols achieve targeted microstructures with lateral and vertical concentration modulations, as well as more complex, hierarchical microstructures previously not described in classical structure zone diagrams. By elucidating the process-structure mechanisms during physical vapor deposition and using this knowledge to achieve precise thin-film microstructures, our algorithm provides insights to the thin film, physical vapor deposition, and film functionality communities looking for additional avenues to design novel thin-film microstructures.},

In this work, a conventional Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) feedstock is used for 3D printing of low alloy-steel AISI 8740 via CEM. This steel is widely used in aircraft, aerospace, and MIM industries. However, it has, so far, not been processed using CEM-based 3D printing. The influence of four printing parameters, extrusion multiplier, extrusion temperature, nozzle velocity, and layer thickness on green density and surface roughness was explored following the feedstock&#39;s investigation. Full-factorial and face-centered response designs were utilized to study the influence of printing parameters and their optimization to achieve maximum green density and minimum surface roughness. The optimized parameters were found to be an extrusion multiplier of 107.6\%, extrusion temperature of 180 °C, nozzle velocity of 20 mm/s and layer thickness of 0.050 mm through a multiple response optimization process. The dense green part with relative densities of ≥ 98\% was achieved with minimum surface roughness of Ra = (2.3 ± 0.1) μm and Rz = (16.1 ± 1.1) μ m. Moreover, a scanning electron microscope was utilized to study the surfaces of green parts.

Plastic deformation introduces defects to microstructure and provides work hardening while a proper heat treatment may induce precipitation processes which lead to additional strengthening.

Accumulative roll bonding is used as plastic deformation technique but with intention to provide a new microstructural feature – interlayer boundaries, instead of grain refinement. Solution heat treatment and ageing procedures are designed in a way that healing of the microstructure with maintaining some deformation-related features is maintained. Depending on the placement of solution treatment in the whole procedure, precipitation processes are similar or different from ones observed in a conventional solutionizing-ageing sequence. Nevertheless, the final hardness is always increased when compared to a typical heat treatment. Transmission electron microscope observations are performed to study variances in nucleation and growth of strengthening phases.},

Here, an integrated micro-extracting system (MES) that includes a multimicrochannel microneedles (MMNs) array and a bilayer suction cup is presented. The system coupled with negative pressure (NP) realizes high-efficiency extraction of ISF and in-situ recruitment of biomacromolecular markers in a minimally invasive manner. By high-precision laser microfabrication technology, internal microchannels are created through pyramidal microneedles (MNs), which convey a concentrated, safe NP around the local dermal capillaries to increase their filtration and permeability, realizing the enrichment of biomacromolecular markers in ISF; meanwhile, the excellent mechanical properties of MMNs promise stable outlets for ISF under NP, achieving high-efficiency extraction. More importantly, compared to the lasting damage caused by applying NP directly to the skin surface, skin tissue is well-tolerated to our MES. The biomacromolecular enriching effect is confirmed by fluorescent substances with different molecular weights in vivo and bone turnover markers in osteoporosis mice model. The system broadens the vision of MN-based microdevices for minimally invasive disease diagnosis and prognosis.},

The oxide layers were prepared using an alkaline electrolyte with glycerol as an additive under micro-arc discharge conditions with different Si content on their surfaces. The hybrid ZrTi coatings with a Zr/Si structure achieved the best tribological properties described by a low friction coefficient of 0.3 and high abrasion resistance. There was also an increase in corrosion potential and polarization resistance of hybrid ZrTi coatings. Although the proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was slower on these hydrophilic Ti and ZrTi coatings than both on uncoated Ti-6Al-4V and the reference tissue culture polystyrene dishes, both types of hybrid coating promoted greater osteogenic differentiation of these cells, indicated by approx. twice as high activity of alkaline phosphatase. The hybrid oxide layers newly developed in this study – especially the layers with Zr – are therefore promising for coating metallic bone implants.},

In this work, the topochemical hydrolysis reaction of cutinase from Humicola insolens (HiC) on PLA fibre was mechanistically investigated using the advanced surface sensitive nanoscale thermal analysis (nano-TA) technique. The enzymatic hydrolysis preferentially occurs at the amorphous regions of the fibre outer layer, thus leading to randomised hydrolysis, monomer release and ablation of the fibre surface during the initial phase of the hydrolysis. Due to the higher hydrolysis rate at amorphous regions, the crystallinity of the fibre outer layer increases. As a result, an enrichment in overall fibre crystallinity is observed by increased melting enthalpy. The accessibility of the enzyme to the fibre core is restricted, thus the change in crystallinity is prevalent on the fibre outer region. The observed increase of the surface softening temperature from the glass transition temperature close to the melting on-set of crystalline PLA as detected by nano-TA supports the hypothesis, that selective hydrolysis preferably takes place at the amorphous region at the fibre outer layer, thus leading to modified PLA fibres with an unchanged fibre core and a very thin and highly crystalline surface layer.},

As asphalt binder ages, the colloidal particles are subject to fundamental physicochemical changes such as agglomeration, which is translated into dramatic engineering property changes of the asphalt binder. In engineering practices, organic rejuvenators are often added to the aged asphalt binder, with the hope of breaking down the nanoparticles and restoring its original engineering properties. However, how the nanoparticles evolve during the aging and rejuvenation of asphalt binder remains hypothetical. This study revealed the fundamental changes of the colloidal particles in asphalt binder during aging and rejuvenation. Moreover, changes in the morphology of colloidal particles are connected to the relaxation spectrum of the asphalt binder. As a result, practitioners do not have to rely on complicated methods and equipment to observe asphalt binders at the microscopic level. Instead, they can employ commonly used engineering tests with a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) to decipher what occurs at the nanoscale during asphalt binder aging and rejuvenation. This would greatly assist practitioners in material selection and design.},

Properties of SLM-fabricated materials depend on the influence of pores, while the effect mechanism is not clearly understood. To clarify the pore effects and achieve reliable forecasting, a statistical-theory-based grain-scale simulation work was performed. Taking Inconel-718 as the example, actual pore defects were detected and classified into three types i.e., gas pore, keyhole pore and lack-of-fusion (LOF) pore, which were then fitted by single or multiple ellipsoids. The volume, shape and posture of pores were characterized by independent parameters, and single-pore-included single-crystal simulations were carried out. Furthermore, overall pore effects were divided into single-ellipsoidal effects, sub-pore quantity effects and sub-pore intersection effects, and the influence mechanisms of pore characteristics on the mean tensile strength and the maximum damage driving force were clarified through partial correlation analysis. Eventually, single-crystal mechanical and damage property prediction models for the grain with an internal pore defect were developed and verified, which show good accuracy with 8–22\% relative deviation for damage resistance predictions, and show excellent accuracy with lower than 0.3\% relative deviation for strength property predictions.},

Uniform distribution at predictable concentrations is achieved by designing polymeric capsules containing the fillers and using them as feedstock for extrusion. Functionality can be inferred from that of the particles and target concentration. However, suitable conditions for printing strongly depend on polymer type and characteristics/concentration of fillers. Soft magnetic composite filaments were produced from polylactic acid (PLA) capsules filled with 30–52 wt.\% maraging steel particles. Composite filaments preserve the soft magnetic character of the fillers. Fillers reduce the transition temperatures of the polymer by ∼ 5 K and have a profound impact on printability. Rheological characterization shows that the “ball bearing effect” of gas-atomized particles reduces the viscosity of the composites by more than one order of magnitude, decreasing printing temperature from 215 °C to 170 °C, associated with the lack of agglomeration of particles achieved by the proposed production method. Rheological experiments allow to detect the required changes in printing conditions without requiring an extensive and costly trial and error process of printing with a large set of printing parameters.},

This study aims to illustrate the disadvantages of simplifying the anisotropic transformation deformation of martensite to isotropic dilatation for modeling the transformation-induced deformation of ferrite. A novel methodology is developed comprising sequential experimental and numerical research on DP steels to quantify transformation-induced strains in ferrite. This methodology combines the results of prior austenite grain reconstruction, phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) orientation data to estimate variant-specific transformation deformation. Subsequently, by comparison of full-field micromechanical calculation results on a virtual DP steel microstructure with experimental EBSD kernel average misorientation and geometrically necessary dislocation measurement results it is shown that neglecting the shear deformation associated with the martensitic transformation leads to significant underestimation in the prediction of transformation-induced strains in ferrite.},

  abstract     = {Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) - based porous structures have been universally adopted for mimicking the properties of bone scaffolds due to their interconnected geometries with smooth surfaces and controllable pores. To further increase the versatility and controllability, an enhanced porous scaffold based on TPMS is proposed. The enhanced pores with different sizes are designed onto three types of TPMS-based scaffolds and then additively manufactured through laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). To investigate the manufacturability, various approaches are used and the results confirm that morphological features of printed samples are identical to the designed ones. As for mechanical properties, the results from the compression tests show that the elastic modulus and compressive strength of enhanced porous scaffolds are 2.0 GPa to 5.1 GPa and 86.7 MPa to 264.2 MPa respectively, which are all in the range of human bones. In terms of permeability, both experiments and simulation indicate that the designed scaffolds have 40\%−150\% improvement compared to scaffolds without enhanced pores. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds is further verified by in vitro studies. The results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed enhanced porous scaffolds for bone implants, and it will facilitate the design of more effective porous materials.},

This paper presents the creation of rats’ renal failure model by embolizing the renal artery using radiopaque hydrogel microfibers. By using a dual coaxial laminar flow microfluidic device, barium alginate gel microfibers containing zirconia particles were fabricated. Since the zirconia particles are radiopaque, the microfiber can be delivered and embolized while confirming the position of the microfiber in real-time under X-ray imaging. The delivery of microfibers through a catheter into the renal artery of rats to create a renal failure model was tested. The radiopaque microfibers were visualized by X-ray imaging when delivered by a catheter. Furthermore, the microfibers remained stable for 2 weeks after delivery. In addition, by adjusting the number of microfibers, two different rat models with severe and mild renal failure conditions were created. The proposed delivery of radiopaque hydrogel microfibers to create an embolization model is expected to be an effective approach to control the degree of symptoms and elucidate the pathology.},

  abstract     = {Reconstruction of patient-specific scaffolds to repair uniquely shaped bone defects remains a major clinical challenge in tissue engineering. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printed scaffolds have received considerable attention as a promising technology for the rapid generation of custom shapes. However, synthetic polymers commonly used for 3D printing, such as polycaprolactone (PCL), lack the biological capacity to mimic native extracellular matrix functions to support cell growth and differentiation into desired tissues. We described the preparation and characterization of a 3D hybrid model for bone tissue engineering that comprises an extracellular matrix (ECM)-enriched hydrogel embedded in a PCL scaffold. The human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell–derived matrisome (BMTS) was utilized as a source of ECM-enriched biomacromolecules, and scaffold biocompatibility was evaluated in vitro using human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). The 3D hybrid model exhibited excellent BM-MSC viability and osteogenic activity in vitro in both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cultures. Furthermore, bone remodeling was evaluated by in vivo through a rat calvarial defect model; notably, the fabricated 3D hybrid model effectively enhanced vascularized bone regeneration. Therefore, this promising BMTS-based 3D hybrid model might serve as an excellent bone tissue-engineered scaffold for use in orthopedic applications.},

The developed framework is able to predict the heat treatment time, temperature, and initial chemical compositions by reading the morphology of Fe distribution and its concentration. The results show that the trained deep neural network has the highest accuracy for chemistry and then time and temperature. We identified two scenarios for inaccurate predictions; 1) There are several paths for an identical microstructure, 2) Microstructures reach steady-state morphologies after a long time of aging. The error analysis shows that the majority of the wrong predictions are indeed not wrong, but the other right answers. We validated the model successfully with an experimental Fe-Cr-Co transmission electron microscopy micrograph.},

Although being predicted to be metastable by ab initio density-functional theory calculations, single-phase fcc NaCl-structured solid solution thin films with Al solubility limits as high as x ∼ 0.51–0.61 in (TiHfNbVZr) 1 -x Al x N and x ∼ 0.45–0.64 in (TiHfNbVZrTa) 1 -x Al x N are synthesised utilizing a hybrid deposition technique that offers dynamic mixing of film atoms from Al + subplantation and non-equilibrium growth conditions leading to quenching of the desired film structure. In experimental studies supplemented with density-functional theory calculations, it is demonstrated that Al concentration in alloys with the multielement compositions of high-entropy nitride thin films determine hardness, yield strength, toughness, and ability to deform plastically up to fracture due to different deformation mechanisms arising from the electronic structure and phase compositions.},

However, only limited eutectics have been determined since MPEAs were brought to light in 2014. It still remains a huge challenge to efficiently identify the eutectics. Here, we propose a novel strategy to determine eutectic compositions via phenomenological mode and machine learning, which is validated with Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Hf/Al MPEAs. Phenomenologically, approximate eutectics can be calculated via the addition of binary eutectics when ignoring the effect of Co-Cr-Fe-Ni interaction. Then, these eutectics are quantitatively corrected by only adjusting Hf content through machine learning. A prediction accuracy higher than 90\% is achieved. Noticeably, the variation of eutectic compositions significantly alters the microstructures, leading to great changes in mechanical performances. These findings can potentially pave the pathway to explore the vast compositional space of eutectics and dramatically accelerate the development of eutectic MPEAs.},

Tumor microenvironment activated cascade Fenton catalytic activities and MRI capability at different stages were obtained, which can simultaneously realize diagnosis and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) for cancer. In addition, photothermal therapy (PTT) was also achieved owing to the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of PDA and GQDs, which further improve the Fenton catalytic activities and realized synergistic therapy for cancer. The experimental results showed that only about 30\% of cancer cells was killed when CDT or NIR laser alone for cancer inhibition. However, when PTT and CDT were employed simultaneously to treat the cancer cells, the therapeutic efficiency has increased by 300\% (90\% of cancer cells was killed and about 10\% cancer cells survived) due to combinatorial effect of PTT and CDT. Obviously, a more effective treatment of cancer could be realized using MRI guided tumor synergistic therapy with the as-prepared nanocomposites.

Bacteria and other microbes use reactive oxygen species (ROS) to send signals between microbes for their proliferation and propagation. Therefore, we developed a functional bone substitute comprised of a ceramic scaffold (Calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite, CDHA) and immobilized gold nanoparticles (Au-scaffold) to scavenge microbial ROS and suppress microbial proliferation at early stages. The Au-scaffold can selectively scavenge H 2 O 2 and ∙O 2 •- , and consequently, effectively inhibit the growth of Micrococcus luteus ( M. luteus ). In terms of antimicrobial activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the Au-scaffold against M. luteus are comparable to commercial antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and tetracycline). The Au-scaffold also shows higher cell viability than the commercial antibiotics. Thus, with its antimicrobial activity and low toxicity, the developed Au-scaffold has promising potential antibacterial activity against one of the major post-surgical infection bacteria, Micrococcus luteus.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the microstructural evolution mechanisms in machining of advanced materials is essential to achieve excellent surface integrity levels within the manufacture of safety–critical components. However, as thermal and mechanical effects are coupled in conventional cutting operations, it is difficult to attribute their individual role on microstructural evolution and integrity. To investigate the temperature-dependency of microstructural evolution in cutting, a new experimental set-up has been developed to perform machining experiments under controlled temperatures. Results show that an onset in chip shear localisation with nanocrystalline grain refinement can be induced uniquely by an increase in cutting temperature under fixed cutting parameters, which microstructurally controls the transition from continuous to serrated chip formation. Increase in mechanical effects at HT leads to the formation of a continuous chip grain refinement layer, associated to a change in energy partition at the tool-workpiece interface. These small-scale behaviours are found to control the reduction in cutting forces and energy at higher temperatures, with a decrease of ∼ 25–30\%. Nevertheless, despite the lower deformation energy, HT cutting induced larger amounts of microstructural deformation because of thermal softening effects, further disclosing the role of thermal effects on the interplay between shear localisation, microstructural evolution and surface integrity.},

  abstract     = {A plasma-sprayed aluminum-silicon (AlSi)/polyester coating is applied in modern gas turbine engines as an abradable sealcoating to maintain tight clearances between the rotating blades and the static casing. While running the engine, the rotating blades “rub” with the abradable coating, which results in extreme strain rate (up to 10 6 ) dynamics and a high-temperature environment. Due to the difficulty of collecting direct measurements, predictive computational models are important for analyzing the deformation and failure of the abradable material, to help meet the design target of avoiding damage to the blade tip and maintaining high fuel efficiency. In this research, a microstructure-based finite element (FE) computational model was developed to capture the complex mechanical behavior of the AlSi/polyester microstructure. The model is based on a virtual representative-volume-element (RVE) of a metal-polymer microstructure, reconstructed from x-ray computed tomography. It models the plastic deformation of, and damage to, each AlSi and polyester constituents, as well as the failure at their interface. The model was calibrated and validated with uniaxial tension and compression experiments, conducted at two temperatures (298 K and 533 K) at an applied strain rate of 10 3 - 10 4 s - 1 103-104s-1 . The material exhibited strongly asymmetric tension-compression behavior and a sensitivity to temperature, which was well captured by the model. The model was further applied to investigate changes in mechanical behavior due to variations in constituents’ volume fractions, which provides guidance to the microstructural design of AlSi/polyester abradable materials. The model is expected to facilitate the development of improved abradable materials by bypassing the conventional trial-and-error approach and extensive testing requirements.},

Both case 1 and case 2 presented an unstable and sensitive region, in which a tiny perturbation could result in a rapid increase of the resonance frequency.

  abstract     = {Recently, efforts have been made to manufacture self-sensing smart composites by integrating piezoelectric sensors with laminates. However, the interleaving of pressure sensors, such as piezoelectric polymeric films, dramatically reduces the impact resistance of the hosting laminates, and consequently, delamination can occur. This study aimed to fabricate a self-sensing composite material by embedding piezoelectric nanofibers of poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) in a polymeric elastic matrix and carbon black-based electrodes to detect a piezoelectric signal. The mechanical and electrical properties of the self-sensing laminate were maintained after 10 6 fatigue test cycles. By appropriately tuning the parameters of the acquisition circuit, the sensor could measure not only impulsive loads but also low-frequency loads as low as 0.5 Hz. A piezoelectric model with lumped parameters for the polarization process and piezoelectric response of the nanofibers is proposed and validated by experimental results. As a proof of the model, the piezoelectric nanofiber sensors were embedded in a prosthetic carbon fiber sole, and the piezoelectric signal response closely followed the ground reaction force with a sensitivity of 0.14 mV/N.},

The generation of sound, defect-free metallurgical joints between multiple adjacent overlapping friction surfacing deposits, also referred to as multi-track friction surfacing, from dissimilar aluminum alloys is the focus of this experimental work. An extensive volumetric defect analysis is carried out for various overlap configurations, including post-processing strategies in order to assess the inter-track bonding integrity using microscopic characterization techniques and micro-computed tomography. The effect of layer arrangement and overlap distance on the volumetric defect formation in both inter-track and layer-to-substrate interface is quantified and discussed. Post-processing via hybrid friction diffusion bonding process demonstrates a significant reduction in defect volume ratio, proving higher material efficiency. The gained knowledge was used to successfully build a multi-track multi-layer friction surfacing stack, demonstrating the suitability of this process for large-scale additive manufacturing components. The subsequent mechanical analysis reveals excellent homogeneous isotropic tensile properties of the additive structure in the range of the base material tensile strength.},

With reconstructed three-dimensional representative volume elements (RVE), linear elastic and linear elastic–perfect plastic Finite-Element-Analyses were performed for a variety of loading states. The stress state ratios and the plastic yielding were investigated with respect to the mesostructural quantities obtained from the FIB tomography. The specific pore surface area and the fractional density were found to represent characteristic scalar measures for the sintering structure, which were further used to formulate a thermodynamic consistent continuum model for the macroscopic stress state and yield locus. An assessment of the modelling approach showed good coincidence of the macroscopic stress state with experiments and simulations from literature and a 43\% better prediction accuracy for the yield locus compared to established modelling approaches. The transferability of the model parameters to different silver sintering raw materials was partially proved by literature results and promises reduced parameterization effort.},

We have characterized the second phase particles formed during solidification, hot rolling, and aging treatments in a Cu-4.06Cr-1.25Nb alloy. Face-centered-cubic (FCC) Cr, L1 2 Cr 3 Cu, C14 Cr 2 Nb, C15 Cr 2 Nb, and Nb-rich particles were detected in the alloy. The crystal structure, precipitation, phase transformation behavior and orientation relationship (OR) were uncovered. C15 Cr 2 Nb particles formed in the solidification process while C14 Cr 2 Nb particles precipitated as aged at 600 °C. The competition of nucleation between nano-scale Cr 3 Cu and Cr 2 Nb particles aged at 600 °C was discussed. The nucleation of L1 2 Cr 3 Cu was prior to that of C14 Cr 2 Nb, and the precipitation of Cr 2 Nb particles would limit the coarsening of Cr particles. A phase transformation map during age treatment was established on the basis of transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. These findings are helpful in developing high-performance Cu-Cr-Nb alloys.},

Different real-time sensors integrated into laminates have been proposed, such as fiber Bragg gratings and piezoceramics. However, their presence negatively affects the mechanical properties of the hosting laminate. This work proposes a non-invasive method for piezoelectric functionalization of composite laminates by interleaving lead zirconate titanate micrometric powder between glass-fiber-reinforced polymer plies. The effects of different powder volume fractions on the electromechanical properties were evaluated in terms of the electrical response and laminate inherent strength. The lead zirconate titanate powder laminates demonstrated an electrical sensitivity value that was up to 439\% higher compared with that of the embedded commercial disk laminate (12.4 V/kN versus 2.3 V/kN). Impact tests revealed that the resistance of the interleaved lead zirconate titanate powder laminates is comparable to that of the pristine laminates, whereas a fragile commercial disk leads to delamination. Furthermore, an analytical model was proposed to predict the piezoelectric voltage coefficient g 33 g33 as a function of the electrical properties, volumetric powder fractions, and polarization process. The model matched the experimental g 33 g33 coefficients ( R 2 = 0.97 R2=0.97 ), demonstrating its capability to predict the electromechanical behavior of piezoelectric composites and define their design guidelines.},

Drug-eluting contact lenses (DECLs) have been proven to improve the efficacy of treatment. For the manufacturing of DECLs, no method can directly deposit drug formulation on commercial lenses. In this work, a novel additive manufacturing approach, nanoelectrospray (nES), and a custom-built nES printing system was developed to directly deposit drug formulations on the surfaces of commercial contact lenses. As a demonstration, nES was used to coat the model biopolymer, zein, onto commercial lenses. Precise deposition of a ring-shaped polymer layer only on the peripheral region was achieved. For printing optimisation, the spraying width is primarily controlled by the nozzle substrate distance. The coating thickness, which can be used to directly control the drug dose, is subject to the polymer concentration in the formulation, dosing speed and the number of rotations. By using the spray current transient and established scaling law, the predicted spray volume is highly correlated to the experimental results. This study built a firm technological foundation for using nES as a novel additive manufacturing method to produce DECLs with drug coating at the surfaces of contact lenses in pre-defined patterns and locations.},

For the first time, a substructure of the γ phase is discovered to be composed of hierarchically arranged “nano-lamellae in micro-lamellae” with high-density dislocations. As building blocks of the γ phase, the nano-lamellae are not twin-related but form pairs with disordered and partially ordered phases alternating in the micro-lamellae. The partially ordered phase is presumably an intermediate of the disorder–order transition. A geometric model for describing the crystallographic orientation relationships among the micro-/nano-lamellae is established. This hierarchical substructure disappears and may evolve into twins of ordered phases after annealing. In addition, thermal/mechanical properties of the as-cast and annealed alloys are compared, and the effects of γ phase on the properties are discussed.},

The scientific and industrial literature from the past few years reveals that there is a growing demand for the development of high-strength aluminium alloys for LPBF. However, some major challenges remain for high-strength aluminium alloys, especially in relation to printability and the control of defects. Possible strategies that have been identified to achieve high strength with printability include the adaptation of existing high-strength cast and wrought alloys to LPBF, the design of new alloys specifically for LPBF, and the development of aluminium-based composites to achieve unique combinations of properties and processability. Whilst review papers exist for aluminium alloys in general for the related work up to 2019, the purpose of this paper is to review the latest developments related to high-strength aluminium alloys for LPBF up to early 2022, including alloy and process design strategies to achieve high strength without cracking. It aims to provide fresh insights into the current state-of-the-art based on a review of extensive yield strength data for a wide spectrum of aluminium alloys and tempers that have been studied and/or commercialised for LPBF.},

  abstract     = {Cu alloys can be plastically deformed to reach ultra-high strength , but often at an expense of their electrical conductivity. Here we report that the introduction of hierarchical precipitations and the resultant microstructural heterogeneities at different scales could overcome the strength-conductivity tradeoff in Cu-Ag-Zr alloy. The intrinsic particle size dependent precipitation behavior, owing to the different cooling rate during powder atomization, has been inherited after hot isostatic pressing (HIP) of powders into bulk sample. The following cold rolling and aging created multi-scale structures with the sub-micron particles at grain boundaries and sub-micron-to-nano scale precipitates in the grain interior. Those introduced heterogeneous precipitate configurations also altered the evolution of deformation structures during cold rolling and aging, with partially recrystallized grains embedded in highly deformed matrix featured by high density of dislocation and substructures, which results in an excellent combination of tensile strength (704 MPa), electrical conductivity (88.7\% IACS), and tensile elongation (14.9\%). Besides, no significant coarsening in the micro-nano structures is observed after annealing at 450 °C for 1 h. The findings in this work proposed a novel approach for designing high-strength, high-conductivity, and high-thermal stability copper alloys based on hierarchical precipitation-stimulated structures at nano-to-micron scale.},

The linear model achieved a better accuracy, with a test R 2 of 0.76. It was possible to conclude that the ULSS is strongly dependent on the actual coating layer height ( h real ), which in turn depends on h and v . The optimal set of parameters resulted in an ULSS of 23.9 ± 2.0 MPa. Additionally, specimens for a three-point bending test based on the ISO 14679:1997 were produced and tested to further evaluate the influence of coating layer on mechanical behavior of hybrid joints, this time focusing exclusively on their interphase component.

  abstract     = {Gradient structured (GS) materials commonly feature varying microstructures with increasing depth from the surface. In this work, a novel through-length gradient structure (TLGS) is achieved in tungsten by a thermo-mechanical processing (TMP) strategy. The basic principle is to transfer the geometric gradient in thickness of initial compact into thickness-reduction gradient of one deformed sheet. Such thickness-reduction gradient enables formation of multi-aspect microstructural features including grain structure, dislocation density and crystallographic texture as spatial gradients. Attributing to the dual effect of work hardening and dynamic recrystallization during TMP, the gradients show a “fluctuation” characteristic with distance along length axis. Tensile tests show that the TLGS-tungsten gets benefit from its homogeneous counterparts by union. The asymmetrical deformation behavior and mechanical incompatibility can be arisen from the coexistent of disparate microstructural features, which is responsible for improved strength-ductility synergy. This strategy opens the door for facile manufacture of large-scale GS metallic materials.},

  abstract     = {In this work, CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy (MEA) parts were fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) with different laser powers. The microstructural evolution before and after tensile test was characterized to explore the strengthening and ductility improvement mechanisms. Similar microstructures and tensile performances were achieved among the samples that were fabricated with different processing parameters, which indicates a credible parameter window for fabricating high-quality CoCrNi samples. An excellent combination of tensile strength and ductility was acquired (yielding strength: 689–700 MPa, ultimate tensile strength: 963–973 MPa, and elongation after fracture: 31.9–37.7\%), which were primarily attributed to the grain boundary strengthening mechanism and adequate working hardening capacity, respectively. After tensile test, most grains were rotated by aligning 〈1 1 0〉 directions, along with high-density low angle grain boundaries. Besides, both deformation twinning and dislocation multiplication were activated during tensile process, which acted as dominant deformation mechanisms. The findings above reveal that LPBF can fabricate high-quality CoCrNi MEAs with cellular and columnar sub-structures, and an excellent tensile strength without sacrificing ductility.},

Experimental results revealed that the in-plane interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the pyrolyzed B 4 C/SiC f z-pinned laminates was above 3.0 MPa, which was 110\% higher than that of the unpinned laminate. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the combined effect of B 4 C and SiC fibres in the pin on the interlaminar performance of the laminate at high temperatures due to the enhancement in the interlaminar strength of the composite. Furthermore, the ILSS of the laminate increased when the z-pin content of the B 4 C/SiC f pins increased; however, when the content of the z-pin further increased, the vertical interlayer direction would happen the brittle fracture.},

In this study, the deformation mechanism of heterostructured bulk aluminum with submicron deformation mechanisms was investigated using a mechanism-based strain-gradient plasticity model, whose gradient information was obtained using a discrete gradient computation method. The model was then used to simulate bending of the material and investigate extra strain hardening. The microstructure of the material was characterized using electron backscattered diffraction analysis. The complicated dislocation reactions occurring during the deformation of multilayer deposition material were determined from the simulation results. The distribution and evolution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) were numerically determined. The simulation results demonstrate that the GNDs and the number of material gradient cycles have a direct influence on plastic hardening. Inclusion of more layer periods in the material resulted in additional large-scale strain gradient across its thickness. The results of this study advances the understanding of the underlying deformation mechanisms that control ductility and strengthening over periods and gradients and provides the possibility of obtaining multilayer materials with exceptional mechanical properties.},

This paper proposes an integral transformation model for the description of both the martensitic transformation temperature and its volume fraction considering both chemical driving force and non-chemical free energy. The proposed model was validated in both incomplete and complete martensitic transformation systems with different austenite grain sizes. Compared with the conventional Koistinen and Marburger model, the integral transformation model can predict the M s Ms and M f Mf temperatures as well as the transformation fraction in an integrated manner and depict the relationship between martensite fraction and temperature as a more realistic S-shaped curve. This can be attributed to the fact that the integral transformation model is developed from a generic energy viewpoint and takes into account not only the chemical driving force but also the significant non-chemical free energy contribution.},

The introduction of magnesium ions into calcium phosphate-based materials can give them angiogenic and mineralising capabilities. However, the optimum calcium to magnesium ratio has yet to be determined. Microspheres have received much attention from researchers due to their flexibility, non-agglomeration and other advantages. We prepared calcium-magnesium phosphate biphasic microspheres (CMBS) using the water-in-oil emulsion cross-linking method to achieve osteogenic differentiation and vascularisation. The simultaneous use of the sacrificial template method and heat treatment endow the microspheres with a rich micro-pore structure. In addition, we investigated the compounding ratio of calcium phosphate to magnesium phosphate and determined the optimal compounding ratio (Ca/Mg = 3/1–1/1) for this material. The prepared microspheres promoted the attachment, proliferation and directed differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs). CMBS-I (Ca/Mg = 3/1) and CMBS-II (Ca/Mg = 1/1) microspheres showed the best promotion effect among all groups. These microspheres were implanted under the skin of Sprague- Dawley (SD) rats, and the composite microspheres significantly induced vascular regeneration compared to pure phase microspheres.},

However, basic principles of exquisite microstructures design for improving water repellence are still lacking. This paper reports a novel 3D-printed biomimetic superhydrophobic surface with petal-like microstructures inspired by the droplet pinning effect of nepenthes peristome. Then, parameters such as petal number, petal proportion and spacing distance are studied and optimized to improve water repellence, which is evaluated according to droplet bearing capacity. The results show that when the petal number is 4, the spacing distance is 100 μm, and the petal proportion is 50\%, the petal-like structured surface achieves its maximum droplet bearing capacity. Comparing with the common mushroom microstructures, the maximum increase rate in bearing capacity is 58.3\% for the optimized petal-like microstructures. Corresponding mechanism analysis attributes such superrepellence property to the sharp edge effect and the arch curve effect. Furthermore, the excellent water repellence enables the petal-like microstructured surface to be used for water droplets manipulation, oil-water separation, and captured-air drag reduction.},

In order to acquire high-quality data of indentation, this paper proposes a novel evaluation method on the significance of effect factors and their interactions for thermal drift rates during cryogenic indentation using a Taguchi robust design combined with finite-element analysis. The results of signal-to-noise (S/N) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are indicated that the effects of the five control factors on the measurement of thermal drift are ranked as: specimen material &gt; indenter tip assembly’s material &gt; loading rate &gt; testing temperature &gt; peak of load. It demonstrates that temperature-dependent material properties for the contact pair are the most important factors in determining the thermal drift rate. Therefore, an upgraded indenter tip assembly with the Invar 36 shaft and the diamond tip is proposed for the cryogenic indentation of different materials. To further reduce thermal drift, an atmosphere pre-cooling method for tip assembly and specimen during cryogenic indentation is recommended owing to its minimum thermal drift and high homogeneity of temperature.},

Here we use four different types of Mg/steel laser-TIG butt fusion welding methods to identify the forming mechanism. One of the key points to control the forming of Mg/steel butt fusion welding is to compensate the burning loss of Mg alloy, and the other is to promote the interfacial reaction. The interface mismatch degree for the higher strength joint has analyzed, and the molecular dynamics simulation results are consistent with the fracture analysis results. The Fe/AlNi interface exhibits a fully coherent relationship. The mismatch degree of the AlNi/Mg interface before the lattice distortion of AlNi and Mg shows the following relationship: (0 1 1 ¯ 1¯ ) AlNi //( 2 ¯ 2¯ 1 1 0) Mg ＜(2 1 1) AlNi //(0 0 0 2) Mg ＜(1 1 0) AlNi //(0 0 0 2) Mg ＜(2 0 0) AlNi // (0 0 0 2) Mg ＜(1 1 0) AlNi //(0 1 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1¯1¯ ) Mg .

  abstract     = {Lattice structure has excellent mechanical properties to develop lightweight devices, and additive manufacture makes it possible to construct complex lattice without extra cost. Especially, with the development of structural optimization technology, design of gradient lattice structure with optimized material distribution has become a research hotspot. In this paper, a double-sided metal mirror infilled with topology optimization (TO) based self-supporting lattice structure and fabricated with selective laser melting (SLM) was proposed. Considering the manufacturing constraints of SLM technology, commonly used body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice was modified and coordinate transformed to construct the self-supporting infill of the mirror. To further improve the mechanical properties of the structure, density-based TO method was introduced to optimize the diameters of all struts in the infill lattice. Finally, an SLM 3D printer was utilized to manufacture the mirror, and both stiffness and anti-vibration performance of the original and two different lattice infilled metal mirrors were evaluated through FEA . Compression tests were also conducted to verify the compressive property of all mirrors. Even though with 20\% less material cost, both computational and experimental verifications have shown that the optimized lattice infilled mirror has much better mechanical properties compared with the original design.},

  abstract     = {Polycationic vectors are a promising class of gene delivery systems. To improve delivery efficiency and reduce cytotoxicity, hydrophobic modification has been proposed as an effective way. Herein, we synthesized a class of terpolymer vectors with various hydrophobicities as well as multiple biodegradable disulfide bonds and cationic side chains. The chemical structure and hydrophobic modification ratio of polymers were characterized. The amphiphilic vectors were able to condense pDNA to form flexible and uniform nanoparticles with a size of 60–85 nm. The shielding effect of hydrophobic side chains led to a lower zeta potential and reduced cytotoxicity. The endocytosis efficiency of amphiphilic vectors was significantly increased and the endocytosis pathway shifted from mainly via the clathrin pathway to clathrin/caveolae/lipid raft co-mediated endocytosis. The amphiphilic vectors demonstrated significantly higher transfection efficiency. In addition, the hydrophobic structural domain of polymers could improve serum stability, alleviating the serum inhibition commonly seen in cationic polymers. Then, we tested the tumor-suppressor gene wtp53 delivered by the amphiphilic vectors in triple-negative breast cancer models both in vitro and in vivo . Tumor cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were triggered through the regulation of downstream cell cycle proteins and apoptosis proteins, inhibiting tumor growth with an excellent safety profile.},

In such a context, this article starts with a brief, critical review of existing technologies while their pros and cons are highlighted. Against that background, the authors propose a new approach for the highly automated fabrication of gridshell structures from variable modules reinforced with textile meshes. To demonstrate the feasibility of such a new technology, a demonstrator called ConDIT 1.0, a sphere-like shell structure composed of several frames, was designed and built. The frame modules were fabricated automatically using extrusion-based 3D printing and a printable, strain-hardening cement-based composite (SHCC). This article presents the design of ConDIT 1.0, the mechanical material characterization of printed SHCC, the technology of module production, the results of geometry verification for print modules using 3D scanning, and the procedure for the demonstrator’s assembly.},

Herein, a unique tubular C 3 N 4 -carbon heterostructure was constructed via thermal polycondensation process, where the inherent open porous C 3 N 4 microstructure was rationally exploited as scaffolds to co-assemble with pyridinic N moieties into composites. Beyond the critical role of serving as a carbon source, the EDTA-2Na additive provides a fairly straightforward pathway for the production of surface cyano groups, which presumably results from the dehydration process of amide bonds. The interfacial cyano groups and work function difference induce strong built-in electric field effects, boosting spatial carrier transfer kinetics. Meanwhile, the incorporated reactive N species endow high affinity for CO 2 and thereby remarkable enhancement of uptake capacity. The developed hybrid system modulates the CO 2 reduction pathway with favoured 8e − selectivity (56\%) toward CH 4 products, with an evolution rate up to 2.54 μmol·g -1 h −1 , compared with trace of the bare C 3 N 4 counterpart. This work constitutes a prospective target for surface and interface design and paves the way for developing high-performance photocatalysts for multi-electron CO 2 reduction.},

In this research work we proposed a new type of Fe-Si directional alloyed soft magnetic material (DASMM), this core-shell structured Fe-Si DASMM powder particle surface insulating SiO 2 shell both have high resistivity and strong metallurgical bonding to the substrate Fe core. The influence of 0–2 wt\% doped Bi 2 O 3 upon the microstructure and magnetic properties of sintered Fe-Si DASMM were systematically studied. The melted Bi 2 O 3 in-situ reacted with the surface Si shell in Fe-Si directional alloyed soft magnetic powder (DASMP) and formed high resistive SiO 2 shell and Bi metal through a reduction reaction. Consequently, the doped Bi 2 O 3 promoted the Fe-SiO 2 core-shell structure formation for the Fe-Si DASMM. As the doped Bi 2 O 3 content increased, the insulating SiO 2 shell network structure intensity, continuity and uniformity progressively improved; the resistivity increased first and then decreased. While due to the effective inter-particle eddy current insulating effect by the in-situ reduction formed SiO 2 shell, both the core loss ( P cv ) and coercivity ( H c ) of Fe-Si DASMM decreased gradually.},

This paper presents a bottom-up finite element based multiscale computational strategy that bridges the experimentally measurable properties of constituent fibers and matrix to numerical predictions of viscoelastic behavior of composite laminates and general shell structures. A user-friendly RVE analysis plug-in tool is developed in Abaqus/CAE to rapidly estimate the effective orthotropic viscoelastic properties of unidirectional composites by taking as input the microstructure geometry as well as the known properties of fibers and matrix. Some benchmark problems were solved, and the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed plug-in tool were verified. Next, the strategy is shown to be applicable to model the viscoelastic behavior of macroscale composite laminates and deployable shell structures, by utilizing built-in functions in Abaqus to define the stacking sequence and accordingly update the material properties. In particular, the proposed multiscale strategy was employed to simulate the influence of modulus relaxation on the deployment dynamics of a composite tape-spring hinge, and good agreement was achieved as compared to reported experimental results.},

An experimental setup is presented for the microscopic analysis of the thermoelastic effect, which allows high precision measurements of specimen. In-situ diffraction experiments were performed for a single phase low carbon steel HC260Y using synchrotron diffraction at the High Energy Material Science beamline P07 in Petra III, DESY. This allows a direct comparison of the onset of yielding by observing the evolution of lattice strains and dislocations densities with the specimen temperature in a continuous cyclic test having high measuring frequency and accuracy. Therefore, the lattice strains are evaluated based on the peak shift of several lattice planes and the dislocation density is estimated based on the micro strain due to peak broadening. The results prove existing assumptions about the relation between the thermoelastic effect and the onset of yielding and clearly qualify the temperature-based determination method for material characterization on a microstructural basis. The usefulness of the temperature elasticity parameters is shown exemplarily with the determination of loading moduli and compared to existing methods.},

Nevertheless, a clear relationship between the atomic structure and mechanical properties of TFMGs has not yet been achieved. In particular, the role of composition in determining a different local atomic order and the effect of nanostructure on TFMGs properties must be further investigated. In this work, the mechanical properties and thermal stability of several amorphous Zr 100-x Cu x TFMGs with either compact or fine columnar nanostructure were studied. The mediating role of composition in controlling crystallization temperature and hardness is here reported, which was found to increase from 4.6 to 7.7 GPa with increasing Cu content from 26 to 76 at.\%. Moreover, plastic behavior and fracture resistance are shown to be highly dependent on both composition and nanostructure, with the Cu-rich and homogeneous film able to withstand elongation up to 2\% strain before crack initiation. These results underline how atomic structure changes induced by composition can effectively influence TFMG properties, while demonstrating an approach to tune their behavior for various technological applications.},

Statistical analysis is implemented to evaluate the nonuniform distributions of the generated RVEs and the results agree well with the experimental data in all statistical distributions. Furthermore, finite element method and volume homogenization are conducted to predict the elastic properties of the generated RVEs. The predictions are close to the experimental data in the literatures and the expected transversal isotropy in the 2–3 plane of the microstructures is confirmed. In addition, the effective elastic properties of glass/epoxy composites with fiber volume fractions of 30–70\% are calculated by using the generated microstructures and compared with the theoretical models. The agreement of the numerical and analytical results provides further validation for the proposed algorithm to generate RVEs of composite materials.

Here, we report the structural stability and elemental segregation of high-entropy TiNbZrTa/CrFeCoNi metallic and nitride multilayer coatings under 3-MeV Xe 20+ ion-irradiation at room temperature and 500 °C, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that the microstructure of nanocrystalline CrFeCoNi high-entropy-alloy sublayers are not stable and readily transforms into amorphous state at 500 °C and/or under irradiation conditions. The elemental distribution, acquired by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy under scanning transmission electron microscopy mode, shows preferential diffusion of Co and Ni into TiNbZrTa sublayers, while Fe and Cr preferentially remain within the previous CrFeCoNi sublayers. TiNbZrTaN/CrFeCoNiN x nitride multilayers exhibit a higher crystallinity and structural stability as well as resistance to diffusion at high-temperature and/or irradiation conditions than their TiNbZrTa/CrFeCoNi metallic multilayer counterparts. These findings are explained by atomic size differences, the difference in Gibbs free energy of the mixing system, and interstitial-solute-induced chemical heterogeneity.

Specifically, the transfection efficiency was considerably increased in Hank’s Balanced Saline Solution (HBSS), with various Mw (30–150 kD) and DD (85–95\%) combinations in different cell types. In addition, even though the CS/siRNA nanoparticles physical parameters such as diameter size and polydisperse index were disturbed by cell culture medium or serum, a relatively high knockdown efficiency could still be obtained in HBSS. Moreover, the highly efficient silencing in HBSS even did not require pre-mixing to formulate the CS/siRNA nanoparticles.

Minimising implant failure and the corresponding need for expensive and difficult revision surgery is vital to both improve the quality of life of the patient and lighten the burden on overstretched healthcare systems. However, balancing forces during total hip replacements is currently subjective and entirely dependent on surgical skill, as there are no sensors currently on the market that are capable of providing quantitative force feedback within the small and complex geometry of the hip joint. Here, we solve this unmet clinical need by presenting a thin and conformable microfluidic force sensor, which is compatible with the standard surgical procedure. The sensors are fabricated via additive manufacturing, using a combination of 3D and aerosol-jet printing. We optimised the design using finite element modelling, then incorporated and calibrated our sensors in a 3D printed model hip implant. Using a bespoke testing rig, we demonstrated high sensitivity at typical forces experienced following implantation of hip replacements. We anticipate that these sensors will aid soft tissue balancing and implant positioning, thereby increasing the longevity of hip replacements. These sensors thus represent a powerful new surgical tool for a range of orthopaedic procedures where balancing forces is crucial.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical actuators based on shape memory alloys (SMA) are becoming a key component in the development of novel soft robotic applications and surgically implantable devices. Their working principle relies in the temperature induced martensitic transformation (MT), which is responsible of the actuation mechanism. In this work, we found experimental evidence to show that the martensitic transformation can be controlled by electromagnetic field (EF) by a wireless process in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys. It is shown that the martensitic transformation can be driven by an external EF (frequency 45 kHz) while the specific absorption rate (SAR), which was determined through real-time dynamic magnetization measurements, allows the instantaneous monitoring of the transformation evolution. On the basis of the obtained results, we propose a strategy to achieve a battery-free wireless SMA actuator that can be remotely controlled. This concept can be applicable to other SMA material that exhibit a similar magneto-structural phase transition.},

Based on this approach, a yolk-shelled SnO 2 @N dopped C (yolk-shelled SnO 2 @NxC) composite has been successfully synthesized for lithium-ion battery electrodes. The reported yolk-shelled SnO 2 @NxC, with SnO 2 as inner shell and core, can remarkably increase the volumetric energy density of electrodes. The void between shell and core could accommodate the volume expansion during lithiation. More importantly, the NxC outer layer as a framework maintains the structure&#39;s integrity and shortens the transmission distance of charges. The results confirm the much-improved electrochemical performance. The yolk-shelled SnO 2 @NxC electrode delivers excellent cycling stability of 740 mAh g −1 at a current density of 0.25C after 750 cycles and a superior rate performance of 500 mAh g −1 at 5C (1C = 800 mA g −1 ).

  abstract     = {Para-xylene (PX) is an important material for the production of polyester fibers and resins; it is widely used in fuel and medical fields. To alleviate the low strength and unsatisfactory mass-transfer performance of conventional catalysts during xylene isomerization, a combined-structure catalyst is fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. In this study, a catalyst ink formulation and preparation method suitable for 3D printing is designed, and a wet ball-milling process is adopted to improve the stability of the ink during 3D printing. The mass-transfer performance of the structured catalysts are investigated via computational fluid dynamics simulation; thus, combined-structure catalysts with high diffusivity and high specific surface area are realized. Compressive strength tests and xylene isomerization reaction experiments are conducted on the three-dimensionally printed catalysts and extrudates. Compared with the extrudates, the three-dimensionally printed catalyst exhibits higher mechanical strength and better catalytic performance. Among the structured catalysts, the combined linear-staggered/wave-vertical (LS/WV) catalyst demonstrates the best overall performance with a PX concentration in xylene of 22.89\% and a high ethylbenzene conversion of 36.70\%, which is approximately 21.68\% higher than the extrudates.},

Electrons and holes were generated in the CPdots upon visible light absorption and the generated hole oxidized H 2 O 2 used as a fuel. TiO 2 suppressed the recombination of electrons and holes by accepting excited electrons from CPdots. The TiO 2 -based micromotor was moved by O 2 produced under visible light. In addition, when H 2 O 2 was decomposed, electrophoresis and diffusiophoresis occurred because of concentration gradient. A SiO 2 -based micromotor showed a much slower movement, indicating the necessity for TiO 2 .

The temperature and velocity range for the formation of different phases, including amorphous phase, mixed phase and IMC was exploited. A high level of plastic deformation and flow was found to destabilise the crystallised Fe-Al structure, promoting the formation of amorphous phase and enlarging the formation window of amorphous and mixed phase at a high temperature (∼650 K). The processing temperature was expected to govern the crystallinity of the final interfacial microstructure. The joint failed at the Al alloy side when an amorphous or mixed phase appeared at the interface, but a thicker (&gt;100 nm) IMC layer resulted in a significantly decreased strength.

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease with a high incidence in the elderly and is mainly treated by drugs. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits the entry of oral neuroactive drugs to the brain, reducing drug concentration and affecting the treatment of PD. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, especially thermosensitive systems, allow drug access to the brain via the nose-brain pathway, which is not limited by the presence of BBB. These delivery systems demonstrate outstanding performance in enhancing brain accumulation of active drugs, improving the loading capacity and stability. In this study, a nano-hydrogel delivery system composed of hydrogen bond-enhanced nanogel and thermosensitive gel is prepared for the effective delivery of albiflorin to treat PD. Importantly, the glycyrrhizic acid acts as a hydrogen bond crosslinker and adjunctive drug to prevent the premature release of albiflorin and achieve synergistic therapeutic performance. Compared to free drugs, the nano-hydrogel delivery system provides superior efficacy due to the enhanced stability. Moreover, this nano-hydrogel delivery system exhibits a selective brain distribution and accumulation and good antioxidant and anti-inflammation effects. This work demonstrates that this intranasal nanogel may function as a promising drug delivery system in treating PD.},

The differences to ballpoint pens, rollerballs or pencils are in the tactual perception of the nib gliding over the paper surface and in the visual impression of a freshly drawn ink line with all the colour impressions and changing light reflections when a wet line dries and reveals either shading or sheen. This subjective impression of the wet line is commonly described as ink wetness and a lot is discussed and speculated about why one ink writes „wet“ and another „dry“. While such a subjective impression can not, the amount of ink put onto the paper can be measured quantitatively. To that end, a number of commercially available fountain pen inks were used to draw lines of a certain length and the amount of ink laid down on the paper was measured. These ink consumption data were correlated to the physical and chemical properties by a principal component analysis. The most significant outcome was the primary dependence of „ink wetness“ on surface tension, followed by viscosity and conductivity with unexpected and partly counter-intuitive correlations.},

In addition to the risk of compromised immune function with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory regimens used to treat irAEs, the complex mechanisms of irAEs make management of the “off-target” effects extremely challenging. Various materials with high biocompatibility, controllable degradability, and the ability for local and targeted delivery and controlled and sustained release of drugs have been explored to limit irAEs.

Here, a micro-and nano-environment dual-modulated barrier membrane (MNBM) with on-demand gene delivery capability is presented. Our MNBM is developed by first preparing extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2) siRNA-loaded gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) nanogels via facile nano-emulsification technique, then incorporating these nanogels into poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) fibers via simple blending electrospinning. The GelMA nanogels offer a nano-niche for ERK2-siRNA encapsulation and allow for a nano-environment controlled siRNA release by readily tuning the GelMA concentrations during nano-emulsification, while the resultant MNBM can mediate a micro-environment controlled siRNA delivery in response to the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enriched micro-environment at the tendon repair site. Such MNBM can not only biologically orchestrate fibroblast behaviors by silencing the target gene expression, but also physically shield the tendon from extrinsic cell/tissue invasion. This study provides a proof-of-concept of anti-adhesion barrier membrane as an intelligent gene delivery system to offer a spatiotemporal and biophysical dual control over tendon recovery according to disease state and ensure long-term therapeutic efficacy. We envision such MNBM represents a promising therapeutic platform with great efficacy to achieve adhesion-free tendon repair.},

  abstract     = {Electrospraying (ES) is a state-of-the-art processing technique with the promise of achieving key nanotechnology and contemporary manufacturing needs. As a versatile technique, ES can produce particles with different sizes, morphologies, and porosities by tuning a list of experiment parameters. However, this level of precision demands an exhaustive trial-and-error approach, at high costs and heavily relies on processing expertise. The present study demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can expedite the optimization process by accurately predicting particle diameter, for both nano- and micron-sized particles. This was achieved by constructing an informative electrospraying database containing 445 records from the literature, followed by the development of predictive ML models. Feature engineering techniques were explored, where ultimately it was found that solvent physiochemical properties as the molecular representation and data with imputation provided models the highest performance. The top two models were XGBoost and Random Forest (RF), which yielded root-mean-squared errors (RMSE) of 3.91 μm and 6.19 μm evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation (CV), respectively. These models were experimentally validated in-house with different combinations of experiment parameters, where RMSE between the predicted and actual particle size was found to be 1.30 μm for the XGBoost model and 1.62 μm for the RF model. Therefore, it was concluded that data generated by the ES literature, in addition to being both cost- and material-free, can yield high-performing ML models for predicting particle size. The ML models were also consulted to determine the key processing parameters that govern particle size, where it was concluded that the models learnt similar attributes identified by scaling laws.},

After the pulsed laser deposition treatment, tungsten particles and clusters were densely coated on the laser-ablated surfaces. The fabricated substrates were characterized by triple-scaled hierarchical structures having different patterns, corrugated structures, and broccoli-like nano-protrusions. An aging treatment was performed to improve wettability. The results verified that the proposed multiple laser treatments in combination with the aging treatment allow the quick implementation of superhydrophobicity while maintaining good reflectance over the spectral range. Moreover, the topology was characterized using an optical profiler and through scanning electron microscopy, while a video-based optical contact angle measuring device and spectrophotometer were used to measure the contact angle and optical reflectance, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this study, W-Ag matrix composites were fabricated by a relatively low temperature (750 °C) via designing dual-metal-layer (Cu and Ag) coated W powders. The effects of Cu and Ag coated W powders on the densification, microstructure and properties of the composites were investigated. The results indicated that the Cu-Ag coating promotes the sintering process and favors the low-temperature densification of W-Ag matrix composites. Moreover, the Cu-Ag coating benefited the formation of Cu-Ag solution and improved the interfacial bonding. The hardness of W-Ag matrix composites was increased to 260.0 HV by adjusting the composition of the material, and compressive strength can reach 799 MPa. The electrical conductivity can reach 45.0\% IACS.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the radiation responses of Zr/Nb nanostructured metallic multilayers (NMMs) are studied. The nanostructures with different layer thicknesses were deposited on Si (1 1 1) substrate by using magnetron sputtering and were subjected to heavy-ion irradiation at room temperature with different fluences. Nanoindentation , XRD , DFT, SIMS , and Variable Energy Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (VEPAS) techniques were used to study the type and distribution of defects, and strain within the material as well as the changes in the hardness of the structures as a function of damage. Our results suggest that the strain and the irradiation hardening are layer thickness- and damage-dependent while they are independent of the type of irradiated ions. The magnitude of hardening decreases with decreasing individual layer thickness indicating that the number of interfaces has a direct effect on the radiation tolerance enhancement. For thin layers with a periodicity of 27 nm (Zr/Nb 27 ), a transition from hardening to softening occurs at high fluence, and a saturation point is reached in thick layers with a periodicity of 96 nm (Zr/Nb 96 ). The as-deposited thin multilayers presented a significantly higher atomic-scale disorder which increases with ion irradiation compared to the thick multilayers. VEPAS reveals the vacancy defects before and after irradiation that contribute to the presented strain. Based on the findings, thin nanostructured Zr/Nb multilayered structures possess excellent radiation resistance due to the high density of interfaces that act as sinks for radiation-induced point defects .},

Eutectic high entropy alloys (EHEAs) show a wide potential application in these fields due to their superior mechanical performances and good castability. Here, we systematically investigated the dynamic compressive properties and microstructural characteristics of the Al 1.19 Co 2 CrFeNi 1.81 EHEA at room temperature (298 K) and liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The EHEA exhibits an excellent strength-plasticity combination, especially at the strain rate of 4300 s −1 at 77 K, showing a yield strength of 1365 MPa and a true plastic strain over 40\%. The underlying deformation mechanisms were uncovered using transmission electron microscopy, revealing that the deformation mechanism is dominated by dislocation slip at 298 K. However, at 77 K, nanotwins together with dislocation slip dominate the plastic deformation. Meanwhile, profuse relatively stable structures are formed due to the interactions between stacking fault (SF)-SF, dislocation-twin boundary and nanotwin-nanotwin, which can effectively inhibit dislocation movement and contribute to a superior strain hardening ability. The adiabatic shear band forms in the late stage of dynamic deformation, and the fractographic observations show a transition from ductile to mixed ductile–brittle fracture mode with decreasing temperature.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondria-targeting nanoparticles have proven to be promising platforms for cancer therapy. However, precise mitochondria targeting in the complex tumor environment is still challenging and requires more ingenious design. Herein, we developed the glutathione (GSH)-responsive nanoagents to target mitochondria in tumor cells precisely for photothermal-enhanced chemodynamic therapy (CDT). The nanoagents were designed by preparing the cubic shape of CuFeS2 nanoparticles that sequentially modified with mitochondrial-targeting peptide (KLAK) and integrin-targeting peptide (RGD), which KLAK and RGD were covalently conjugated via a disulfide bond. After being endocytosed into integrin-overexpressed tumor cells, disulfide bond was broken and RGD was separated from the nanoagents in the presence of overexpressed GSH. Then, the exposure of KLAK on the surface further aid the rustling nanoagents to target mitochondria. Under NIR laser irradiation, the surrounding temperature of the nanoagents would rise due to their excellent photothermal effect, resulting in the improvement of the Fenton reaction from the CuFeS2. It was well demonstrated that this photothermal-enhanced chemodynamic therapy nanoplatform could effectively damage the mitochondrial function and further induce the apoptosis of tumor cells. As a therapeutic platform with both tumor/mitochondria-targeting and PTT-enhanced CDT, our study has provided a new path in the field of cancer therapy.},

The full-wavelength infrared tunability (Δ ε 2.5–25μm = 0.47) of the photonic stack thermochromic device (PSTD) is 63\% higher than that of the conventional device, thus achieving a high contrast between the cooling power at high ( q = 470.75 W/m 2 ) and low ( q = 2.97 W/m 2 ) temperatures. Furthermore, the robust angular insensitivity and customizable operating temperature allow fabrication of the PSTD on-demand, ensuring operability under various conditions. In addition, the strategy endows the PSTD with excellent mechanical flexibility and significant reductions in thickness (90\%) and weight (83\%).

However, the joint ductility was limited by the lack of deformation experienced by the cold-rolled CoCrFeMnNi base material during tensile loading. In this work, it is shown that by simply changing the base material condition, from cold-rolled to annealed, it is possible to significantly improve the joint fracture strain from ≈ 5 to ≈ 10\%, while preserving the strength at ≈ 450 MPa. Using electron microscopy, high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction and mechanical testing aided by digital image correlation, the microstructure evolution across the welded joint is assessed and correlated to its mechanical performance. Moreover, thermodynamic calculations considering the compositional changes across the fusion zone were used to predict the microstructure evolution of this region.},

  abstract     = {When rolling aluminum (Al)/magnesium (Mg)/aluminum (Al) composite plates with large reduction, there are often differences in the matrix structure and hard brittle properties of interfacial intermetallic compounds, which have a negative impact on the mechanical properties. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the evolution of the diffusion layer and homogenize the internal structure of the metal plate by annealing to achieve the best performance. In this study, Al/Mg/Al composite plates were formed by hard-plate rolling (HPR) with a single pass of 60\% reduction and annealed. The results show that the tensile strength (UTS) of rolled plate is 235.4 MPa and the elongation to failure (A) is 6.2\%. It is found that after annealing at 300 °C for 1 h, the interface bonding property is suitable, the microstructure is gradually uniformly refined by the joint action of shear band expansion and twin induced static recrystallization, the UTS reaches 265.1 MPa. The A is increased by 18.5\%. In conclusion, annealing treatment can significantly improve the microstructure and connection strength of hard-plate rolling Al/Mg/Al composite plates and provide scientific guidance and technical support for the forming and manufacturing high-performance lightweight composite plates.},

  abstract     = {Nano-engineering is of particular interest in tailoring the hydrogen storage properties of magnesium hydride (MgH 2 ). This work demonstrates in situ formation of nanocrystalline MgH 2 by hydrogenation at room temperature. We investigated the effects of hydrogenation variables on the MgH 2 nanostructure. The results showed a large amount of MgH 2 nanocrystallites with sizes of 4–10 nm in the hydrogenated samples. The sample recharged at 298 K under 0.1 bar hydrogen showed MgH 2 nanocrystallites with a mean size of 5.2 nm. The dehydrogenation kinetics of the sample hydrogenated at lower pressure are improved over samples hydrogenated at higher pressures. The in situ formation of nanocrystalline MgH 2 can be achieved by deliberately engineering the nucleation and growth rate of MgH 2 . Hydrogenation pressure, temperature, and the defect density of the material are the critical parameters affecting the nucleation rate of MgH 2 . In addition to low temperature, hydrogenation under lower pressure can significantly slow the growth rate of MgH 2 during hydrogenation. These findings provide a different strategy enabling in-process control over the nanostructure of MgH 2 .},

  abstract     = {The recent development of additive manufacturing has led to an increased interest in the study of functionally graded cellular structures, which exhibit superior mechanical properties to the conventional uniform structures. However, connectivity is a critical problem that should be addressed, especially when multiple unit cell topologies are incorporated into a structure. In particular, inappropriate connectivity may cause stress concentration at the interfaces, reducing the structure’s lifespan. This paper proposes a method to design multi-morphology cellular structures that ensures smooth transition of geometry and homogenized mechanical properties between adjacent unit cells. The proposed method uses a genetic algorithm to design intermediate unit cells between a base and a target unit cell. Moreover, a customized parametric unit cell representation supports the design process. An implicit modeling method is adopted to synthesize the explicit 3D models. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed method guarantees smooth transitions of geometry at the interfaces, variations in density, and homogeneous mechanical properties. Moreover, experimental characterization resulted in an increase of 78.7\% in the elastic modulus and a reduction of 54.9\% in the maximum von Mises stress for the structure designed with the proposed method when compared with that created using the conventional non-smoothing technique.},

  abstract     = {Recently, some advanced computer algorithms, including the inverse design method based on deep learning, have been widely applied to design versatile electromagnetic devices, featuring fast design and high efficiency especially in the global optimization problem. However, enormous amount of data generated from blind preliminary and computationally expensive simulations to predict the optical responses is required. Herein, to overcome this shortcoming of traditional deep-learning-based inverse design method, a fast, highly efficient, and sufficiently accurate synergetic strategy for devising photonic applications is presented, which integrates an explicit equivalent-circuit-intervened model as the guide in the implicit deep learning method to avoid blind calculations. As a case study of the proposed synergetic paradigm, the absorbers with customized and challenging spectral patterns are explored. For verification, three proof-of-concept designs were characterized: single-layer notched-band absorption, dual-layer trap absorption, and triple-layer ultra-wideband absorption. Our approach solves the knotty issues of batch designs, as well as the complex and time-consuming processes, suffered in traditional approaches. Moreover, our demonstrated equivalent-circuit-intervened intelligent strategy can be directly extended to various other photonic architectures, advancing a significant step toward real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Nanoscale creep behaviors of metallic glasses (MGs) have gathered considerable interests in recent years, owing to their distinct atomistic mechanisms of plasticity. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a burgeoning technique for manufacturing MGs, the nanoscale creep characteristics and creep mechanism of the AM-ed MGs, however, remain ambiguous. In this work, the nanoscale creep behavior and creep size effect of a selective laser melted (SLM-ed) Zr-based MG were investigated by using nanoindentation. The creep stress exponent ( n ) and shear transformation zone (STZ) volume, as the indicators of the creep mechanism, were estimated. The n values are in the range of 2–3, and STZ volumes are around 2 nm 3 . The creep resistance of the MG was found to decrease with the increasing applied peak loads. A potential mechanism for this creep size effect was revealed: the smaller of the STZ volume, as well as the greater ratio of plastic flow under the higher maximum load, are responsible for the decreasing tendency of creep resistance. This research gives a comprehensive understanding of the atomistic mechanisms in the AM-ed MG during the nanoscale creep deformation process and can serve as a reference for improving the plasticity and further engineering applications.},

However, because Ti6Al4V has a high strength, it is substantially stiffer than natural bone, resulting in stress shielding. To resolve this issue, an effective way is to construct porous titanium alloy scaffolds with adjustable pore size and porosity, and 3D printing technology may be utilized to build complex bespoke forms that fit our specifications. In this work, 3D-printed porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds with imitation of trabecular structure (ITS) and the corresponding regular structure scaffolds (RS), which have three different average pore size (300/400/500 μm), were prepared by selective laser melting technology. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were used to assess the scaffolds&#39; physiochemical characteristics, as well as their osseointegration capabilities. The findings revealed that the ITS scaffolds were conducive to cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. And the in vivo performance was examined through rabbit tibia bone defect model, the results demonstrated that the ITS scaffolds with average pore size of 400 μm showed the ideal osseointegration potential. Therefore 3D-printed titanium scaffolds with imitation of trabecular structure provides a viable bio-inspired structural and functional design method of titanium alloy orthopedic implants.},

Simultaneously, graphene is increasingly being considered as a reinforcement material to be used for metals and polymers because of its exceptional properties. Although several studies have examined the additively manufactured graphene/polymer composite parts’ mechanical properties, few have explored how graphene affects the 3D printed polymers’ tribological properties considering friction and wear. Thus, the present study aims to examine the tribological behavior concerning 3D printed graphene/resin composite. For this, the digital light processing (DLP) technique is used. Graphene’s impact and the variation in the printing process parameters were assessed by considering aspects such as the surface roughness, microstructure, wear, friction, and hardness characteristics of the tested materials. According to the results, a considerable decrease was observed in the friction coefficient of graphene specimens (0.5 wt\%) as it reduced by approximately 50\% compared with pure resin material. The present study is unique as the quantity of added graphene (up to 2 wt\%) was substantially more than what has typically been used in other studies concerning photopolymerization printing capability.},

Grains of the niobium and steel matrix near the interface were characterized by elongated and fine equiaxed structures, respectively, while that in vortex area was fine columnar grains. Then, the interfacial thermokinetics was investigated by a smoothed particles hydrodynamics simulation to reveal the formation of the observed defects and diverse grains.

Increased density was positively correlated with increased laser power, scan speed and hatch spacing for the horizontally built samples but not for the vertically built samples. A smaller difference in the average temperature within a printed layer, associated with the vertically built samples, was linked with reduced porosity and reduced porosity variability between samples. Control of the L-PBF parameters was found to allow control of the resulting part chemical composition which also directly affected phase transformation temperatures, and related phase structures. The laser process parameters were found to have a significant effect (p &lt; 0.01) on the martensite start/finish temperature, austenite start/finish temperatures, and the total temperature span. The volumetric energy density was also found to have a direct correlation with both the cooling (r = 0.52) and heating (r = 0.53) enthalpies, which was found to be due to increased nickel evaporation.

The influence of cooling rates on subsequent precipitation behaviors was investigated by experimental and thermodynamic simulations. The results show that by controlling the formation of clusters/GP zones through changing pre-aging cooling rates, i.e. PA-0.2, PA-0.3 and PA-0.4 (°C/min, from 80 °C to 40 °C), an excellent bake hardening increment and natural aging stability can be obtained. The highest bake hardening increment can reach 180 MPa for PA-0.4 sample, which is twice higher than those of Al-Mg-Si-(Cu) alloys. The microhardness remains almost unchanged within NA for 14 days at a lower level of approximately 85 HV 0.2 . Thermodynamic simulations estimate the solvus temperatures and chemical composition for GP zones, revealing the strengthening and stabilising mechanisms behind: a) Mg-Zn- clusters formed during pre-aging can suppress Mg-Si- clusters formation in the natural aging process, b) non-isothermal hinders the precipitates growth, a faster cooling rate leads to smaller and softer Mg-Zn- clusters, and c) the formation of a heterogeneous microstructure contributes to the high bake-hardening response without changing the type of strengthening phase β″.

Four builds of AlSi10Mg specimen geometries were manufactured to: (i) determine the fatigue curves for both as-built and machined conditions; (ii) measure the fatigue crack growth rate; (iii) produce and test under fatigue a benchmark component used as a reference for the validation of the fatigue assessment procedure. Tools and concepts of flaw tolerance were then used to perform the fatigue assessment of the benchmark component and were shown to be successful in the life prediction. Results obtained from this wide database (related to internal defects and surface features) show that only a fracture-based fatigue assessment is able to provide precise life estimates consistent with material crack growth properties. Eventually, all the experimental results including specimens design, analysis of fracture surfaces and raw tests’ data will be made available in a database which can be accessed and used by the industrial and scientific communities to calibrate and validate alternative fatigue assessment procedures of AM parts.},

We then synthesized a kartogenin-conjugated DUCWJ (DUCWJ-KGN) scaffold using an EDC/NHS catalyst. 1 H NMR, Fluorescence staining, and FTIR confirmed that the carboxyl group of KGN was covalently coupled with the free amine groups in the Wharton’s jelly (WJ) matrix, and the in vitro release profiles of KGN from the DUCWJ-KGN scaffold showed sustained release for 6 weeks. Both the DUCWJ and DUCWJ-KGN scaffolds had excellent biocompatibility and biofunctionality, supporting cell attachment, migration, and proliferation, and DUCWJ-KGN scaffolds the KGN-loaded scaffold could induce higher chondrogenic markers expression. The DUCWJ-KGN scaffold could also promote fibrocartilaginous regeneration at the rotator cuff tendon-to-bone interface, which indicates that the DUCWJ-KGN scaffold is a promising enthesis to enhance fibrocartilaginous interface regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Insect wings are formed by intricate combinations of flexible membranes and rigid veins; such a structure enables excellent flight performance, adaptability to aerodynamic forces, and biological functions. Comprehensive understanding of the interplay between wing patterning and flight dynamics has however not been achieved yet due to enormous variability of natural patterns and the extreme complexity of the modeling wing-air interactions. Therefore, the design of a pattern for artificial flexible wings is challenging. In contrast to other studies mimicking biological patterns of insect wings, we propose usage of metamaterials principles to enable controllable dynamics, and machine-learning techniques to solve a related multi-parameter design optimization problem. We demonstrate the advantages of this hybrid approach by finding practical patterns with improved target property – enhanced lift. The obtained designs were manufactured by means of a low-cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D-printer from a single commercially available thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and revealed the required balance between the rigidity of metamaterial “veins” and the flexibility of the wing base. Extensions of our approach to other designs or analyses of other moving structures offer straightforward benefits in tackling a wide range of computationally complex aerodynamic and vibroacoustic problems.},

  abstract     = {The subsurface integrity of the fillet affects the gear service life during high-power-density transmission. To clarify the fillet formation in the gear skiving process, the internal subsurface integrity of gear fillets at the approach and recess sides were investigated by considering the surface texture. Metallurgical and mechanical investigations were conducted to advance the understanding of the fillet formation mechanism. The long-axis angle of the deformed grains and geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) of the subsurface revealed the dominant deformation mode and strain hardenability. As a result, the surface texture must be analyzed to elucidate the local cutting feature-induced plastic deformation owing to the high velocity gradient near the skived surface. The long-axis angle difference at the fillet of recess side increased approximately 5 to 10 times compared to that of the approach side, indicating that the refinement and slip-dominated deformation mode prevails at the formation of the leading and trailing fillets, respectively. Greater strain hardenability at the subsurface of the leading fillet was elucidated by the nanoindentation test and grain dislocation density. This work advances the understanding of microstructural alteration at the subsurface of the leading and trailing fillets, contributing to the gear functionality-based assessment of the gear skiving process.},

High-resolution 3D X-ray microscopy facilitated a non-destructive, direct investigation of the three-dimensional pore space and microstructure. By using image-based pore space analysis, various pore space parameters, such as, e.g., pore volume, pore-size distribution, and pore connectivity were determined. In addition to the characterization of the pore space, phase analysis, structural and chemical investigations were carried out by X-ray powder diffraction, electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared, Raman and X-ray spectroscopy. Finally, to evaluate the influence of characteristics on the physical properties, elastic, strength and thermal properties were determined. With the increase of porosity, the flexural strength and thermal conductivity values decrease from σ f = 123 ± 8 to 37 ± 5 MPa and λ = 3.22 ± 0.02 to 1.77 ± 0.02 W/(m·K), respectively.

  abstract     = {The potential usefulness of relatively simple pore microstructures such as parallel, identical, inclined slits for creating broadband sound absorption has been argued through analytical models. In principle, such microstructures could be realised through budget additive manufacturing. However, validation of the analytical predictions through normal incidence impedance tube measurements on finite layers is made difficult by the finite size of the tube. The tube walls curtail the lengths of inclined slits and, as a result, prevent penetration of sound through the layer. As well as demonstrating and modelling this effect, this paper explores two manufacturing solutions. While analytical and numerical predictions correspond well to absorption spectra measured on slits normal to the surface, discrepancies between measured and predicted sound absorption are noticed for perforated and zigzag slit configurations. For perforated microgeometries this is found to be the case with both numerical and analytical modelling based on variable length dead-end pores. Discrepancies are to be expected since the dead-end pore model does not allow for narrow pores in which viscous effects are important. For zigzag slits it is found possible to modify the permeability used in the inclined slit analytical model empirically to obtain reasonable agreement with data.},

Here a new quantification mechanism of H embrittlement at atomic scale applicable for various metals is demonstrated. The process of the cohesion reduction caused by the lattice trapping H atoms in interstices is physically expressed. Specifically, the strongly intensified Pauli repulsion in interstices occupied by H atoms caused by the local increase of electron density leads to lattices dilatate and thus metallic cohesion diminish. The ab initio simulation is conducted to validate the quantification mechanism and the theoretical results of the nearest neighbor atom distance and the maximum cohesion strength agree pretty well with the simulation results for various metals trapping H atoms. The study reveals the content and location of the trapped H atoms and the electronic structure properties of host metals co-determine the cohesion strength of the lattice after trapping H atoms, provides the atomic scale mechanism to quantify the general cohesion reduction of the lattice trapping H atoms, and takes the essential step in predicting the evolution of metallic material mechanical properties in the environment contained H atoms.},

In contrast to cracking around the indents in the as-cast Al-Si alloy, the LRS nano-fibrous eutectic microstructure demonstrated higher strength, strain-hardening, and uniformly distributed plasticity around indents with no cracks. A transition in morphology from long nano-fibrous Si to short nano-fibrous Si is observed underneath the indent in LRS eutectics. The mechanism for this morphological evolution with increasing plastic strain is postulated to involve three stages of the deformation process: First, the formation of closely-spaced dislocation arrays in the nano-channels of Al matrix confined by Si fibers. Second, fiber segmentation when the stress field of the dislocation array exceeds the critical stress for fracture in Si nano-fibers. Third, recovery of dislocation substructures and sub-grain formation in Al leading to a rotation of fractured Si segments. The final microstructure consisted of short Si nano-fibers along triple junctions of the subgrains in Al. The implication of this unusual microstructure evolution with increasing plastic strain on the plastic co-deformation in high-strength LRS nano-eutectic microstructures was discussed in this report.},

  abstract     = {The engineering stress–strain curve of a material allows one to determine mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, strength, and toughness. While machine learning has recently been used to predict stress–strain curves, large volumes of experimental data are required to achieve high prediction accuracy. More importantly, conventional machine learning models are not generalizable from one material to another. To address this issue, a novel transfer learning approach is introduced to predict stress–strain curves across different fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites fabricated via additive manufacturing. Optimal transport (OT) is integrated with the transfer learning approach by mapping the source label space to the target label space, which further improves knowledge transferability across different FRP composites. The stress–strain curves of the additively manufactured FRP composites are generated under flexural loading conditions. Experimental results show that the OT-integrated transfer learning approach can predict the complex stress–strain curves of FRP composites with small training data. The predictive model achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10\%. The extracted modulus and strength from the predicted stress–strain curves achieved MAPEs of less than 5\% and 10\%, respectively. This work demonstrates that transfer learning has the potential to transform how stress–strain curves are generated.},

In this paper, the hierarchical microstructures and properties of peak-aging Al–0.5 Mg–0.4Si (wt.\%) alloy (AlMgSi) and AlMgSi alloy microalloying with 0.4 wt\% Sc (AlMgSiSc) were investigated by atomically-resolved transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. The results show that a certain number of Sc solutes exist in the Al matrix, forming a solid solution strengthening matrix with reduced corrosion susceptibility. In addition, the strengthening and toughening of AlMgSiSc are associated with the formation of primary Al 3 Sc dispersoids, which cause dispersion strengthening and fine-grain strengthening. Moreover, the precipitate free zones (PFZs) containing Sc solutes were observed in the AlMgSiSc, leading to the excellent resistance to intergranular corrosion and elongation due to the smaller width and higher corrosion potentials of PFZ compared with AlMgSi. The Sc solutes can significantly promote the precipitation of GP zones and solute clusters. Further study reveals that smaller-scale precipitates, GP zones, and solute clusters have enrichment of Sc as well, thereby bringing out remarkable precipitation hardening to AlMgSiSc.},

A comprehensive parametric study of the constituent properties was performed to determine their sensitivities to overall behaviors. On this basis, an optimization framework was developed to reflect the integrative performance and cost-performance of hybrids. The simulation obtained a saturation point of the matrix shear strength of approximately 70 MPa, beyond which the overall behavior rarely changed. A dispersed arrangement of the fiber bundles could significantly delay the damage propagation and enhance the overall behavior only at low contents of high-elongation fibers. In the present case, the mean ultimate strength can be improved from 1063 MPa to 1315 MPa. The sensitivity analysis indicated that for the elastic moduli of fibers, carbon fiber strength, and Weibull shape parameter of basalt fibers, trade-offs must be considered to balance the overall ultimate strain, strength, ductility, and hybrid effect. The bundle-based modeling concept provides a fast and convenient approach to evaluate the global behavior of hybrids.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a new toxic-free Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 amorphous alloy with a critical casting size of 5 mm diameter and 20 mm long has been synthesised through copper-mold casting process. The Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 bulk metallic glass (BMG) rod has further formed into thin films through the filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) deposition process. To assess the biocompatibility and the surface behaviour of the synthesised Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 BMG, the metallic glass (MG) thin films are fabricated on the glass substrate and cultured using murine osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and human osteoblast-like cells (SaOS-2). Various characterisation techniques has been utilised to evaluate the surface properties and the cultured cells behaviour of the deposited thin films. The synthesised Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 composition shows good biocompatibility similar to the routinely used Ti-6Al-4V. The osteoblast cells proliferate very well on the Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 MGs and exhibit similar levels of alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity to those of the controls and the Ti-6Al-4V material. The MC3T3-E1 cells adhered and spread faster on the alumina particle blasted Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 and Ti-6Al-4V surfaces with osteoblast-like shapes. These results suggest that Ti 40 Zr 10 Co 36 Pd 14 BMG is biocompatible and could support osteoblast differentiation. Thus, the new alloy can be used as a candidate material for potential biomedical application.},

  abstract     = {The Tb-Dy-Fe alloy with superior magnetostrictive strain and excellent energy density is applied in various fields such as precise driving and intelligent sensing. However, the Laves phase of magnetostrictive alloys has severe brittleness and poor fracture toughness at room temperature, limiting the development of their engineering instruments. In the present study, the transition element doping method is proposed to regulate the elemental composition for the severe brittleness of Tb-Dy-Fe-Cu alloys. The values of Vickers hardness for Nb-doped and Ti-doped specimens were 520.82 HV and 531.90 HV, respectively, with an increase of 4.097\% and 6.311\% compared to the original specimens. The saturation magnetostriction coefficient is 800p.p.m. for the natural specimens and around 620p.p.m. for the doped specimens. On the one hand, the enhancement of the mechanical properties of doped specimens is mainly attributed to the growth twins and nanoprecipitates induced by doping the transition element. On the other hand, the weakened magnetic properties of the doped specimens ascribed to the accumulations consisting of nanoprecipitates, twins, and elemental aggregates. This doping method could provide an essential reference for developing novel magnetostrictive materials with more desirable and balance physical properties.},

In this study, we developed a multifunctional superhydrophobic silicone rubber (SR)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/laser-induced graphene (LIG)/SR composite strain sensor using laser direct writing. A highly stable MWCNTs/LIG crosslinked conductive network layer, high-performance superhydrophobic layer, and stretchable SR layer were integrated to fabricate the sensor by tuning the laser parameters. The SR/MWCNTs/LIG/SR composite strain sensor possessed a high gauge factor of 667, large strain detection range of 0–230\%, and a stable sensing response over 2500 cycles due to the MWCNTs/LIG crosslinked conductive network. Moreover, the SR/MWCNTs/LIG/SR composite strain sensor could effectively prevent icing owing to its anti-icing (36 min@-5 °C) and photothermal deicing (88 s@1 W/cm 2 @NIL) properties and hinder acid and alkaline (pH = 1–14) corrosion attributed to the laser-induced superhydrophobicity, thereby expanding its applications to acid, alkaline, and low-temperature environments. Consequently, the multifunctional superhydrophobic SR/MWCNTs/LIG/SR composite strain sensor is demonstrated to be suitable for human body motion detection in complex and severe environments.},

In the present study, the promising gyroid, diamond and Schwarz primitive minimal surfaces are used for the design of 3D lattices for biomedical implants. The lattices are fabricated using laser powder-bed fusion and a blend of elemental titanium-tantalum powder. The processability, compressive mechanical properties and in vitro biological properties of the dense and lattice samples are assessed via non-destructive and destructive characterization methods. The topologies from the designed structures are retained through processing and the compressive tests results show that the strength-to-modulus ratios are comparable to the conventional Ti-6Al-4 V alloy. However, the higher ductility and absence of toxic elements make the Ti-25Ta lattices a more favourable option for a new generation of implants. Compared to conventional lattices, the designs presented here also show advantageous mechanical properties for use in bone implants with higher elastic admissible strains. The in vitro cell cultures confirm the high biocompatibility of the material and improved biological response of the interconnected lattices over dense material.},

Diabetic wounds are caused by increased blood sugar levels, which leads to microvascular disease and skin dystrophy. Additionally, their occurrence can be accompanied by inflammation and a variety of bacterial infections. Diabetic wounds are complex; therefore, achieving good results after a single treatment modality is often difficult. In this study, we used materials science engineering methods to integrate several factors required for diabetic wound treatment, which resulted in the development of a bilayer hydrogel. First, the upper layer of the hydrogel inhibits bacterial growth and promotes wound closing, which solves the problems of wound infection and protection. Additionally, the lower layer of the hydrogel has a porous structure, which promotes the adhesion and growth of wound healing-related cells. Moreover, the lower layer of the hydrogel can release cytokines that promote vascular endothelial cell and fibroblast migration and stimulate skin tissue regeneration. We evaluated the ability of this double-layer hydrogel to heal diabetic wounds in vivo and in vitro and found that it offered protection while promoting healing. We also determined that a combination of multiple factors can provide better reparative effects to treat chronic diabetic wounds.},

Natural products (NPs), which are complex chemical molecules with abundant biological activities derived from microorganisms and plants, have demonstrated great potential for treating inflammatory diseases with several unresolved drawbacks. Increasing studies have indicated that NP-based nanomedicine resulting from the combination of NPs and nanotechnology may open a brand-new vista for the therapy of inflammatory diseases. In the present review, we summarize the classification of NP-based nanomedicine and its potential therapeutic effects in various inflammatory diseases, as well as further elucidate the challenges in the wide clinical application of NP-based nanomedicine to promote a comprehensive understanding and development of inflammatory disease therapy by NP-based nanomedicine.},

After dry sliding in reciprocation motion at applied loads of 2–15 N, surface and subsurface regions of the samples were investigated using SEM and TEM analyses, respectively. At an applied load of 2 N, dislocation activity was the subsurface deformation mechanism. The superficial depth-dependent gradient ultrafine microstructure containing the BCC phase decorated with the retained FCC phase, as well as mechanical nano-twins were formed when the applied load was increased to 5 N. By further increase in applied load (10 N), these twins were replaced with elongated FCC /BCC grains. At an applied load of 15 N, a friction-induced heterogeneous microstructure including two individual regions of extremely ultrafine and ultrafine grains was detected in the subsurface region of the worn sample. The simultaneous effects of grain refinement, dislocation-mediated plasticity, and martensitic phase transformation, along with hetero-deformation-induced strengthening, enhanced the hardenability of the subsurface during sliding wear. The formation of the protective superficial tribo-oxide layer triggered by the mechanical support of the substrate resulted in the outstanding tribological performance of the V 10 Cr 10 Fe 45 Co 30 Ni 5 HEA.},

  abstract     = {Functionally graded lattice structures are gaining increasing attention due to their potential to enable the customization of the structural response and development of multi-functional applications. However, some grading methods may lead to weak layers or discontinuous unit cells. These problems can be overcome by varying the morphology, but the mechanical performance is only slightly improved, limiting the application of lattice structures. This work proposes a bidirectionally graded lattice structure, wherein the gradient design is simultaneously implemented in parallel and perpendicularly to the load direction. Experimental samples fabricated through laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and using PA2200 as the matrix material, were subjected to quasi-static compression tests. The results showed that the bidirectionally graded lattice structure attains a significantly higher compressive modulus, yield stress, and plateau stress (59.8\%, 43.0\%, and 33.9\% higher, respectively) compared with a unidirectionally graded lattice structure. Moreover, a proposed stiffness prediction method was appropriate for effectively estimating the modulus of graded body-centered cubic lattice structures, which combined with the understanding of the influence of gradient parameters, allows the realization of a tailored structural performance. In conclusion, the proposed bidirectionally graded strategy and experimental findings provide an effective reference for the design of multi-functional lightweight additive manufactured parts.},

One objective of this paper was to revisit the picture frame and bias extension tests in the case of such non-orthogonal NCFs in order to determine the in-plane shear behavior which is different for positive and negative shear angles. A simulation approach based on stress resultant shell elements was developed for these reinforcements by taking into account the specific plane shear behavior of non-orthogonal NCF reinforcements identified by picture frame tests. It was shown that simulations of non-orthogonal NCF (0–45° and 0/135°) draping processes gave results that were consistent with experimental forming tests of these materials. In particular, the hemispherical forming of an NCF at 0–45° led to a very specific deformed shape with a good correlation between simulation and experiment. Some specificities of the 0–45° preforms, especially weak areas, have been highlighted both by simulation and experimentally.},

In this study, the D-optimal experimental design method is employed to reduce the number of experiments while providing statistically grounded designs with high-quality results. The proposed D-optimal design includes 18 mixes that investigate three level-six factors. High-performance cementitious printing mortar was selected for future applications of new thinner structures with less massive concrete. In total, three types of cement, three types of sand and five admixtures are investigated, including superplasticizers. The factors are the cement, sand, and superplasticizer type, the water-binder and sand-binder ratio, and the use of a viscosity modifying agent or C-S-H seed admixture. Calorimetry tests were conducted along with the direct shear test, the flow test and the compressive strength test.

  abstract     = {Brick-and-Mortar structures can exhibit exceptional combinations of properties, such as high strength and toughness. The properties are highly dependent on the failure regime, namely the ability to distribute damage prior to failure. In our recent work on rectangular Brick-and-Mortar structures, we have identified a transition from localised damaged (called ‘two-peak’ failure) to distributed damage (called ‘peak-plateau-peak’ failure), depending on the brick aspect ratio and the relative normal and shear layer material properties . However, the effect of non-rectangular brick shapes on these failure regimes has not yet been explored. In this work we predict with semi-analytical modelling, and validate with experiments, that introducing an angle into the ‘shear’ layers of the Brick-and-Mortar structure to create ‘diamond’ and ‘inverse diamond’ brick shapes results in a transition from ‘two-peak’ to ‘peak-plateau-peak’ failure for low aspect ratios. It is further shown that the angle required to transition to ‘peak-plateau-peak’ failure decreases with increasing aspect ratio, and that introducing an out of-plane angled layer in the form of an osteomorphic brick shape can further decrease the angle required for the transition. Our work demonstrates that the transition from ‘two-peak’ to ‘peak-plateau-peak’ failure significantly increases the toughness of the structure, without compromising strength or stiffness, highlighting the importance of understanding and controlling the parameters that affect the failure regimes.},

The results present that the volume fractions of α-Al 15 (Fe, Mn) 3 Si (α-Fe phase), β-Mg 2 Si (β phase) and Q-Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6 (Q phase) in the skin layer and the central zone are higher than those in the segregation band zone. The volume fractions and sizes of the θ-Al 2 Cu phase (θ phase) in the skin layer and the central zone are lower than those in the segregation band zone. In the skin layer, the preferential growth orientation of the α-Fe phase with plate-like morphology is parallel to the heat transfer direction, while the other phases exhibit a complex seaweed-like morphology. In the central zone and the segregation band zone, the shearing stress and turbulent flow during the filling process lead to the morphology of α-Fe and β-Mg 2 Si relatively regular. However, the morphology of Q-Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6 and θ-Al 2 Cu phases are irregular owing to their lower solidification temperatures. The distribution and morphology of β-Mg 2 Si, Q-Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6 and θ-Al 2 Cu in the segregation band zone mainly determined the distribution and morphology of the α-Fe phase.},

  abstract     = {The as-cast rare earth magnesium alloy is extremely difficult to be rolled due to poor plasticity. In this paper, the rolled rare earth magnesium alloy thin sheet was successfully prepared by repeated rolling with small thickness reductions in multiple passes. The microstructure evolution of rare earth magnesium alloys during rolling and forming and its plastic deformation mechanism was explored. The results show that the shape of the precipitates affects the plastic deformation of rare earth magnesium alloys. The slender precipitates can activate more types of non-basal slip to coordinate the deformation, while the agglomerated precipitates cause cracks easily. Intragranular multi-slip and inter-grain slip transfer are the plastic deformation mechanism and hardening mechanism of rolled rare-earth magnesium alloys. The competitive relationship between local strain and macroscopic strain affects the selection and activation order of slip variants, and geometric compatibility is not a necessary condition for coordinated deformation between adjacent grains. The rolled rare earth magnesium alloy sheet not only improves the strength and plasticity significantly but also breaks through the limitation of the application shape of rare earth magnesium alloy, which is of great significance for expanding the practical application of rare earth magnesium alloy in industrial production.},

In Directed Energy Deposition, a powder stock is processed with a laser beam, which offers a high process flexibility. However, aging of the powder feedstock during storage or after recycling remains fundamentally challenging for aluminium alloys because of their sensitivity to oxidation and porosity. In order to investigate these effects, AlSi10Mg powder batches were aged in different conditions and processed by Directed Energy Deposition. The results showed that powder aging does not significantly change the particle size or morphology, but it introduces more oxygen and hydrogen in the powder. The oxidation of the particles reduces the laser beam absorbance of the powder and increases wetting of the melt pool, which affects the track geometry. A 3.5 to 4.2 times higher porosity was observed in the material deposited from aged powder, which are most likely hydrogen pores caused by the increased hydrogen content in the aged powder. The tensile properties of the parts built with aged powder showed 19.0\% lower yield strength, 14.2\% lower ultimate strength and 99.2\% higher elongation, which are most likely the results of the coarser microstructure and increased porosity.},

  abstract     = {Hyperthermia treatment with magnetic bone cement can not only realize the highly targeted treatment of the deep-seated bone tumor but also repair the weakened bone tissue. However, the potential risk of overheating limits the use of this material. Herein, we report a novel super-paramagnetic injectable radiopaque bone cement (MSBC) that can control hyperthermia temperature by itself. The injectable MSBC was prepared by incorporating SiO 2 -modified nano Mn-Zn-Cu-Gd ferrites into an acidic calcium phosphate cement matrix. The SiO 2 layer on the ferrites protects the oxides from reacting with the acid matrix vigorously to keep the good magnetic property. The acid matrix allows the ferrites to degrade gradually and almost one-tenth of MSBC degrades after soaking in phosphate buffer solution for 28 days. Moreover, MSBC can realize self-controlled hyperthermia around Curie temperature (65 ℃) in vitro under an alternating magnetic field. The X-ray transmission results show that the radiopacity of MSBC is significantly enhanced in comparison to the matrix. Furthermore, MSBC shows no cytotoxicity and can promote the mineralization ability of osteoblasts. Overall, this novel magnetic bone cement provides a new avenue for improving the thermal safety of magnetic hyperthermia treatment of bone tumors.},

  abstract     = {We report for the first-time combinatorial synthesis of thin film metallic glass libraries via magnetron co-sputtering at the limit of crystallinity. Special care was taken to prepare extremely pure CuZr films (1–2 µm thickness) with large compositional gradients (Cu 18.2 Zr 81.8 to Cu 74.8 Zr 25.2 ) on X-ray transparent polymer substrates in high-vacuum conditions. Combined mapping of atomic structure (synchrotron radiation) and chemical composition (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) revealed that over the entire composition range, covering multiple renowned glass formers, two phases are present in the film. Our high-resolution Synchrotron approach identified the two phases as: untextured amorphous Cu 51 Zr 14 (cluster size 1.3 nm) and textured, nanocrystalline α-Zr (grain size 1–5 nm). Real space HR-STEM analyses of a representative composition substantiate our XRD results. Determined cluster and grain sizes are below the resolution limit of conventional laboratory-scale X-ray diffractometers. The presented phase mixture is not permitted in the Cu-Zr phase diagram and contrary to existing literature. The phase ratio follows a linear trend with amorphous films on the Cu-rich side and increasing amounts of α-Zr with increasing Zr content. While cluster size and composition of the amorphous phase remain constant thorough the compositional gradient, crystallite size and texture of the nanocrystalline α-Zr change as a function of Zr content.},

The alloy showed good processability with maximum density over casting alloy with the same composition. The microstructure of the as-built alloy was characterized by the formation of cell structure. The α -Al cells manifested GP zones/Mg-Si clusters. The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation to fracture of the as-built alloy were 341 ± 14 MPa, 518 ± 6 MPa, and 7.1 ± 0.4\%, respectively. Due to the precipitation of β ″ nanoparticles in α -Al cells, the strength of the SLM alloy was effectively improved after direct aging at 150 ℃ and 200 ℃, with a maximum YS of 446 ± 5 MPa and maximum UTS of 546 ± 1 MPa, which were much higher than those of Al-Si-based alloy produced by SLM. When the aging temperature exceeded 200 ℃, the strength of the alloys decreased rapidly, but the elongation increased significantly. Multiple strengthening mechanisms, including grain refinement, GP zones/Mg-Si clusters, and β ″ nanoparticle precipitation contributed to the high strength of SLM AlSi8.1Mg1.4 alloy.},

However, interactions may occur during running between the rotating blades and the coating sprayed onto the casing. Due to the complexity of reproducing experimentally rotor/stator interactions, modeling approaches are used to optimize the choice of abradable coating, making constitutive laws necessary input data for rotor/stator interaction studies. Previous experimental researches were done to explore the dynamic and quasi-static compressive thermomechanical behavior of AlSi-PE abradable coating [1,2]. Using results from these investigations and from a complementary experimental characterization coupled with a high speed camera, parameters of a standard Johnson–Cook constitutive law have been identified for the wide ranges of strain-rate and temperature explored. Although modeling data were in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results, an original constitutive law formulation has been proposed to better predict the thermomechanical behavior of AlSi-PE abradable material at high temperatures. As an introduction of damage into the modeling, a standard and modified Johnson–Cook damage law, describing a strain criterion from which failure theoretically begins, has been included and analyzed when modeling the coating’s behavior by considering only quasi-static conditions.},

This paper investigates using reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of machine learning that teaches an agent to complete a task through accumulating experiences in an interactive environment, to automate the designing of 2D discretized topologies. RL agents use past experiences to learn sequential sets of actions to best achieve some objective. In the proposed environment, an RL agent can make sequential decisions to design a topology by removing elements to best satisfy compliance minimization objectives. After each action, the agent receives feedback by evaluating how well the current topology satisfies the design objectives. After training, the agent was tasked with designing optimal topologies under various load cases. The agent&#39;s proposed designs had similar or better compliance minimization performance to those produced by traditional gradient-based topology optimization methods. These results show that a deep RL agent can learn generalized design strategies to satisfy multi-objective design tasks and, therefore, shows promise as a tool for arbitrarily complex design problems across many domains.},

This work demonstrated a potential of using rCFs for interlayer toughening of carbon fibre/epoxy composites. Nonwoven mats based on rCFs and commingled rCFs/Polyphenylene-sulfid (PPS) fibres were used to interlay a laminate, aiming to improve the mode-I and mode-II fracture toughness. The experimental results proved significant enhancements in the interlaminar fracture properties upon interleaving, with the rCF/PPS mats exhibiting a more prominent toughening effectiveness than the rCF mats. For example, the maximum increase in mode-I and mode-II fracture initiation energies of the laminates was 51\% and 66\%, respectively upon interleaving the rCF mats, and 220\% and 105\%, respectively by adding the rCFs/PPS mats. The fractography analysis proved that the main toughening mechanisms were fibre debonding and pulling-out for the rCF mats and fibre bridging for the commingled rCFs/PPS mats. The differences in the toughening mechanisms resulted in opposite effects of the interlayer/epoxy adhesion to the fracture toughness, i.e. an improved interlayer/epoxy adhesion increased the toughening effectiveness of the rCF mats, but negatively affected the toughening performance of the rCF/PPS mats.},

Through an experiment on the influence of the auxiliary heating process on the deposition of pulsed laser wire feeding, the focus is on the improvement effect of the combined heating process on the deposition of low-power pulsed laser wire feeding.

The experimental process data and metallographic analysis results of the sample show that the combined heating process not only improves the energy input in the deposition process, but also reduces the temperature gradient between the deposited sample and the substrate, improves the laser absorption rate of the substrate, increases the size of the deposition channel and molten pool, reduces the surface roughness of the sample, and enhances the interlayer remelting, A more uniform macro shape contour is obtained.

Here, under different porosities, we propose a biomimetic graded TPMS scaffold design with adjustable graded pore size, providing guidance for designing porous bone implants without the characteristics of stress concentration, stress shielding and barrier mass transport. Specifically, the structural characteristics of TPMS can be achieved without stress concentration. By adjusting the porosity, the elastic modulus of Ti6Al4V samples can be adjusted in the range of 1158–4567 MPa, which can match the individual selection of mechanical properties of the biological bone. Since the TPMS scaffold is designed by layer-by-layer splicing, through adjusting the height parameters of the single-layer structure, the selective pore size variation can be realized to further match mass transport of biological bone. Then, the in vitro culture experiments have been conducted and the maximum cell survival rate of the scaffold with an offset constant 0.4 is 85.44\%, which can meet the mass transport of bone implants. As such, the proposed graded scaffold design in this paper shows excellent potential for orthopedic implants.},

  abstract     = {Contact guidance for cell outgrowth refers to the phenomenon of the topography of the extracellular matrix regulating cell behaviors and functions. In tissue engineering, scaffolds with appropriate topographic cues for cell contact guidance show great potential in facilitating tissue repair and regeneration. Advanced 3D printing technology enables the fabrication of intricate and accurate structures for the study of the cellular responses and underlying mechanisms of contact guidance. This review focuses on 3D printing topographic cues for cell contact guidance. First, typical 3D printing technologies for manufacturing topographic cues are covered. Subsequently, cellular responses on 3D printing topographic cues in cell culture experiments are summarized. Then, the mechanisms of contact guidance on cell outgrowth are recapitulated. Finally, the major challenges and future perspectives for this field are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Infected diabetic wound (DW) healing entails a series of temporally and spatially regulated stages including antibacterial responses, revascularization, and collagen deposition, underscoring the need for the controlled sequential delivery of appropriate compounds when treating these wounds. Here, we designed a multifunctional core–shell CTS@PLCL/DWJM@Cu nanofiber loaded with three bioactive agents, including chitosan (CTS), copper (Cu), and decellularized Wharton’s jelly matrix (DWJM). We used this platform to facilitate regulated antibacterial, angiogenic, and collagen deposition activity in the context of DW healing. These CTS@PLCL/DWJM@Cu nanofibers exhibited satisfactory mechanical properties, excellent absorption, acceptable biodegradability, a high level of biocompatibility, elevated adhesive rates, and the ability to sequentially mediate controlled sequential CTS and Cu release. Further in vitro analyses revealed that the initial release of the CTS shell was sufficient to exert antibacterial activity, after which the sustained release of the Cu core promoted cellular migration, neovascularization, and enhanced angiogenesis-related gene expression. In vivo, DWJM further accelerated the deposition of collagen. Together, the sequential antibacterial, angiogenic, and collagen deposition activities synergistically enhanced DW healing. We thus posit that the core–shell CTS@PLCL/DWJM@Cu nanofiber holds great promise for use as a dressing material capable of promoting the appropriate stages of DW healing in a regulated, sequential manner.},

  abstract     = {Due to the personalized large defect and bone absorption of the alveolar cleft, its regeneration is still a great challenge. Conventional autologous bone repair leads to donor site adverse reactions and then bioactive materials with stable mechanical properties, suitable degradation rates, good osteogenic ability are required. In this study, the α-tricalcium phosphate (doping with and without 6\% strontium ; α-TCP-Sr6, α-TCP) bioceramic scaffolds with high-precision pore structure were developed to repair the alveolar cleft, and the physicochemical properties and bone repair performances were systematically compared with the pure β phase of tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) bioceramic scaffolds. It was shown that Sr dopant could adjust the bio-dissolution of α-TCP scaffolds, and contributed to excellent mechanical stability. As for the osteogenic capability in the alveolar cleft of rabbits, the α-phase TCP scaffolds both exhibited appreciable new bone ingrowth compared to the β-TCP scaffolds. However, bone malformation and fibrous tissue invasion occurred in the control group (without filling scaffolds). This study suggests that the Sr dopant may adjust the biodegradation and mechanical stability of α-TCP, and such biodegradable Ca-phosphate bioceramics scaffolds prepared by digital light processing (DLP)-based 3D printing technique demonstrate significance in promoting the reconstruction of the alveolar cleft.},

  abstract     = {Extremal materials are elastic metamaterials with rank-deficient elasticity tensor. Due to this novel property of the elasticity tensor, extremal materials (especially pentamode materials) show outstanding performance in various wave manipulation applications. However, until now there is still a lack of a systematic and general design methodology that is applicable for all kinds of extremal materials. In this study, we proposed to design extremal materials by using topology optimization techniques without any prior knowledge about the geometric symmetry of the unit cell, thus more anisotropic materials can in principle be designed. Besides the number of zero eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor, the corresponding eigenvectors (usually called the soft modes of the extremal materials) can also be customized in our method. We use a two-step design strategy to accomplish the design of the microstructures. Several numerical examples are shown to verify the effectiveness of the optimization framework in designing extremal materials with and without constraints on soft/hard modes. Numerical results reveal that the proposed method can design extremal materials with arbitrary values of soft or hard modes. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to three-dimensional case. Our works pave the way for exploring the rich property of extremal materials.},

  abstract     = {The effect of alloying Cr-rich Cr-Si alloys with Pt was investigated by a combination of complementary experimental methods and atomic scale modelling. The investigated Cr-Si and Cr-Si-Pt (Cr ⩾ ⩾ 86 at.\%) alloys developed a two-phase microstructure consisting of Cr solid solution ( Cr ss Crss ) matrix and strengthened by A15 precipitates during annealing at 1200°C. It was found that additions of 2 at.\% Pt increase the coarsening rate by almost five times considering annealing times up to 522 h. Pt was found to change the precipitate matrix orientation relationship, despite its low influence on the Cr ss Crss matrix/A15 precipitate misfit. Through this experimental and modelling approach new insight has been gained into mechanisms of enhanced coarsening by Pt addition. The increased coarsening is principally attributed to a change in interface composition and structure resulting in different thermodynamic stabilities: Pt-containing A15 phase was found to have a broader compositional range if both elements, Pt and Si, are present compared to only Si. Additionally, the Cr ss Crss phase was found to have a higher solubility of Pt and Si over just Si. Both factors additionally facilitated Ostwald ripening.},

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a biological factor that effectively promotes the recovery of nerve function after spinal cord injury. The focus of this study was to accurately and efficiently maximize the biological effects of bFGF locally. Therefore, we innovatively synthesized methacrylate-silk fibroin (SilMA) hydrogels for bFGF delivery. This hydrogel has photocurable properties and form a gel upon UV in 15 s. The hydrogel shows no obvious cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that SilMA@bFGF can releases bFGF slowly to promote the regeneration of nerve axons, inhibit glial cell proliferation and improve neuronal mitochondrial function. In the early stage of spinal cord injury in rats, the SilMA hydrogel also inhibit the local inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress compared with injury alone, which is more conducive to the repair of nerve function. This study is the first to apply a photocurable silk fibroin hydrogel to spinal cord injury and the result is satisfactory. This method will provide a new treatment strategy for spinal cord injury.},

Thereafter, the OHC-CSA-DA and carboxymethyl chitosan (COOH-CS) based hydrogel (CSA-DA-CS) was successfully fabricated through integrating enzymatic crosslinking, Schiff base and hydrogen bonding interactions. The optimum adhesive strength of the hydrogel was obtained by an orthogonal design when the concentrations of polymer, HRP enzyme, and H 2 O 2 were 30 mg/mL, 0.24 U/mL, and 0.00085\%, respectively. This novel hydrogel showed rapid self-healing performance, robust mechanical strength and strong adhesion, spray film-forming ability, hemostatic property, antibacterial property and good biocompatibility, which are beneficial to function as a wound dressing.

Each new HEAs matrixes can be easily strengthened by nano-precipitates through subsequent aging heat-treatment. As an example of this reliable and universal approach, two brand-new Co 22.8 Cr 19 Fe 23.5 Ni 24.7 Cu 5 Ti 5 and Co 24 Cr 20.9 Fe 25.1 Ni 24 Al 3 Ti 3 HEAs, are discovered, prepared, and tested correspondingly, which exhibit outstanding strength-plasticity com binations far superior to those reported in the literatures. Their ultimate tensile strengths are 1281 MPa and 1339 MPa, respectively, with the elongation of 30\% and 19\%. In both alloys, the uniformly dispersed nano-precipitates γ′ with L1 2 ordered structure are observed to be coherent with the FCC matrix phase. The dominant deformation and strengthening mechanisms of both alloys are planar dislocations and stacking faults. The design strategy is not only applicable to the present work but also introduces new thoughts for the rapid development of other new precipitation strengthened HEAs.},

Structures of these applications are often subjected to dynamic loadings of high strain rates and need to mitigate the impact by absorbing its energy. The advancement of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies has enabled the fabrication of structures in many industrial sectors. Many sectors now utilize AM to produce their parts to attain light weight, enhanced functionality, and part number reduction. Therefore, it is critical to characterize the mechanical properties of AM materials. Despite receiving a great deal of research under quasi-static conditions, the dynamic response of AM materials is still lacking. This paper reviews the recent studies on the high strain-rate response of AM light metal alloys. We mainly focus on the two most common AM light alloys, namely AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V. The paper starts by reviewing the main AM techniques and materials&#39; high strain-rate testing methods. We then review the flow behaviour, deformation mechanisms of AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V under high strain rates and the effect of post-processing. Moreover, we present a comparison of the high strain-rate mechanical behaviour against conventionally manufactured alloys.

In this study, combining 3D printing with sacrificial template method aiming to fabricate aerogel scaffolds with adjustable macro/micro-pore structure for tissue engineering was explored.

The rheological results indicated that PEGDA-Pluronic F127 hydrogel precursors possessed shear thinning and shear recovery behaviors and were suitable for 3D printing. After removing the sacrificial material of Pluronic F127, the aerogel scaffolds displayed larger micro-pore structure compared to no removing group and still maintained sufficient mechanical strength. Furthermore, the L929 fibroblast cell showed high cell viability and well proliferation performance after culturing 7 days on aerogel scaffolds fabricated by 3D printing.

The surface hydrophobicity of electrosprayed nanodroplets was further enhanced by cold plasma modification using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method with hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO). The treatment led to a successful decrease in surface wettability of our samples. Morphology (scanning electron microscopy), wettability (contact angle) and chemical composition (FTIR analysis) were observed for a period of six months to track possible changes; the obtained results verified the presence of HMDSO during the whole time period. Cytocompatibility was confirmed in vitro with 3T3 mouse fibroblasts according to the norm ISO 10993-5. Cell adhesion and proliferation were assessed in vitro by metabolic MTT assay and fluorescence microscopy after 4, 7, and 14 days. Antiadhesive behaviour was confirmed by atomic force microscopy and ex vivo by peel test 90° with intestinal tissue, the final structure has a great potential to reduce postoperative tissue adhesions.},

Nevertheless, poor interfacial adhesion between carbon fibers (CFs) and polymer matrix remains a serious issue. Herein, a mechanically enhanced CF/epoxy composite with highly efficient EMI shielding was fabricated through in-situ polymerization of polyaniline (PANI) nanolayer. The PANI nanolayer improved the interfacial adhesion in the composites via the entanglement of molecular chains, π–π stacking, and chemical bonding et al. The resulting CF/PANI/epoxy composite exhibited an interlaminar shear strength of 72.8 MPa, which was a 24\% improvement over 58.5 MPa for the virgin CF/epoxy composite. Moreover, an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness of 54.8 dB was achieved, which was 58\% higher than that of the virgin CF/epoxy composite. This could be attributed to the significant enhancement in conduction loss, interfacial polarization loss, and multiple reflections with the help of PANI nanolayer. This study provides a novel strategy for the development of high-performance CFRPs for efficient EMI shielding.},

  abstract     = {Several breakthroughs have been achieved in anti-tumor immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in the past decade. Despite the considerable therapeutic effects, ICB is still limited by the low benefit rates and severe systemic toxicity. Pre-clinical studies have shown that photothermal therapy (PTT) mediated by nanoparticles (NPs) can counterbalance the drawbacks of ICB therapy and produce synergistic anti-tumor effects. NPs offer several advantages such as increased tumor-targeting ability, high drug-loading capacity and satisfying biocompatibility. Therefore, combining NPs-based PTT and ICB therapy can achieve a better outcome against tumors, and even prevent metastatic and recurrence by inducing immune memory. Here, we have discussed the current progress in ICB therapy and NPs-based PTT, along with the pre-clinical trials on PTT/ICB combinational therapy. The synthesis and mechanisms of different photothermal NPs have also been summarized. Moreover, the current challenges, deficiencies and future improvement of this novel treatment modality have been analyzed.},

Here, µm-thick multifunctional and sustainable composite membranes of electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) infused with functionalized, anionic, and cationic cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with enhanced wettability, tensile strength, and excellent retention capacities were designed. CNCs could uniformly impregnate into the three-dimensional CA network to effectively improve its properties. The impregnation of cationic CNCs at 0.5 wt\% concentration drastically increased the tensile strength (1669\%) while maintaining high permeation flux of 9400 Lm -2 h −1 which is remarkable with cellulose modified electrospun membranes. The membranes infused with anionic CNCs exhibited a particle retention efficiency of 96\% for 500 nm and 77\% for 100 nm latex beads whilst the cationic CNC membranes exhibited a combined particle retention strategy using selectivity and size exclusion with a retention of &gt;81\% with 100 nm latex beads and 80\% with ∼50 nm silver nanoparticles.

  abstract     = {Metallic implants have the disadvantage of being insufficiently biologically active despite their good mechanical properties and general affordability. Therefore, their bone growth at the implant site in an osteoinductive and osteoconductive manner could be improved by using bioactive coatings with incorporated active ingredients (antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, growth factors, osteoclast inhibitors, anticoagulants, etc.) that are released locally at the implant site in a controlled manner. In addition, the long-term exposure of metallic implant materials to a corrosive environment (human body fluids) can lead to toxic corrosion-induced ion release. To ensure the biological, non-corrosive, and appropriate mechanical properties of the implant-coating system, the choice of the coating method is crucial. This review describes recent developments in the application of bioactive coatings on metal implant materials, such as 3D printing, electrospinning, electrophoretic deposition, dip coating, drop casting, sol–gel deposition, biomimetic deposition, plasma spraying, layer-by-layer deposition, physical vapour deposition, and the formation of titanium oxide nanotubes by anodization. In addition, this work addresses promising ways to incorporate active ingredients into coatings through various entrapment methods of nano- and micro-encapsulation to achieve the desired controlled release.},

In addition, to avoid the thermal decomposition of fine particles of La(Fe,Si) 13 , a solid-state reaction was conducted during sintering using a mixture of α-Fe and La-rich compounds as the initial powder. After sintering, the sample shape exhibited channel widths and depths of 200 μm and pillar widths of 300 μm, which were originally designed for the NaCl dissolutive mold. The metallographic microstructure mostly comprised the La(Fe,Si) 13 phase, and the volume fractions of the extra phases, such as α-Fe and La 2 O 3 , were suppressed to 1.1\% and 3.2\%, respectively. The maximum of the magnetic entropy change in a single pillar reached −19 J/kg K. Direct observation of magnetic nucleation/growth confirmed the smooth emergence of the first-order transitions in multiple pillars. Consequently, this fabrication approach promoted micro-channel-designed La(Fe,Si) 13 H y while maintaining a large magnetocaloric effect via low carbon contamination.},

  abstract     = {The machining difficulty has limited the further application of ultra-hard materials. For V-shaped coarse-grained electroplated cubic boron nitride (CBN) grinding wheel, a precise and efficient pulse laser truing method was proposed. Firstly, a theoretical model of the pulse laser truing process was established in order to optimize the laser truing energy distribution. Secondly, the effects of truing depth, grinding wheel speed, laser power and truing time were analyzed. Finally, the grinding performance of laser trued wheels were evaluated. The results showed that larger grinding wheel speed n would bring higher energy value and more stable energy distribution, truing depth h would not affect the value and stability of energy. CBN would not undergo phase transition and could bear more laser power P avg . With the increase of truing time t , the geometric precision of V-shaped grinding wheel could be improved. The angle of V-shaped grinding wheel could reach 90.15° (deviation 0.02°), the bottom fillet radius was 53 μm (less than 100 μm). The surface roughness and grinding force corresponding to laser truing were less than that of mechanical truing, the truing time required was reduced by 72\%∼83\%, and the corresponding tooth profile angle and bottom fillet were basically the same.},

The rationale that underpins this potential is asymmetric deformation that is similar to shearing; such a deformation has vector characteristics. In this paper, several cellular structures were designed that deformed the cell structure in many ways under uniaxial load, in accordance with the deformation vector addition principle of chiral cells (such as compression–dislocation, compression–bending coupling deformation, and variable wings with forward and backward sweep functions)—which were verified by finite-element analyses and experiments. With a given objective deformation, a genetic algorithm was introduced to encode structures with various chiral cells, and the feasibility of the method was verified through several examples. The research herein shows that structures with various deformation demands can be designed through reasonable assembly of chiral cells, which has potential applications to the field of variant structures design.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an analysis of simultaneous topology and orientation optimization based on a principal stress method within the Solid Orthotropic Material with Penalization (SOMP) framework. Numerical case studies were done to assess the expected benefits of including orientation in the design process for minimum compliance structures under single load cases printed with orthotropic materials. In particular, comparisons were made between structures designed with and without consideration of orthotropic material orientations during the topology optimization (TO) process. Direct-Ink Writing (DIW) additive manufacturing (AM) was used to print experimental specimens, which were tested in bending to validate numerical results. The novelty of the work centers on the experimental evaluation of the performance of optimized topologies designed with SOMP and manufactured via DIW. Additionally, new knowledge is presented in the form of corresponding numerical and physical experiments showing that with a principal-stress based material orientation updating scheme, equivalent performance can be achieved with respect to compliance by 1) optimizing topology and orientation concurrently with orthotropic material orientations controlled during TO using maximum in-plane principal stress directions; or 2) optimizing topology assuming equivalent isotropic properties, and substituting the original orthotropic properties along principal stress orientations post-optimization. This experimentally validated finding confirms that including orientation in the compliance-based design framework for AM of structures with orthotropic materials is not advantageous. For single load cases, using the standard Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method for design purposes and then aligning material orientations with principal stress orientations after the design is produced is sufficient for obtaining equivalent performance benefits.},

By combination of post-mortem 3D Electron Backscattered Diffraction, Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy techniques, this work unveils the progressive evolution of the accommodating twin mechanisms from low to high strain rate, correlating differences in mechanical behavior with differences in twin crystallography. Away from quasi–static conditions, simple considerations of twinning shear do not suffice to describe unconventional twin morphologies, requiring the competition between newly activated dislocations and lattice distortions for allowing the evolution of the twin boundary along non–invariant twin planes. Under shock compressions, the basal/prismatic transformation establishing a lattice misorientation of 90° entirely governs the parent → twin conversion. The results illustrated here confirm that some of the recent interpretations deduced by particular twin morphologies are not universally valid and that deformation twinning is not only stress- but also strongly time–controlled.},

Moreover, we employ a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and propose cross-modal attention (CMA) to focus on the vital regions of the welding pool image. To train our model, the experimental setup was first designed. Then, it was deployed in an actual body production workshop of high-speed train to collect welding pool images, as well as sound and current and voltage data. Hence, a new dataset for detecting welding defects is presented. Experimental results on the dataset indicate that the proposed model can effectively detect different defects and actions. Furthermore, when the output of the shallow layer, the layer near the input layer, is fed into the CBAM and the output of the deep layer, the layer near the output layer, is fed into the CMA.

The ACDs could not only control the morphology and crystal form of CaCO 3 but also could be doped into CaCO 3 during the formation of CaCO 3 to form ACDs@CaCO 3 organic–inorganic hybrid fluorescent materials which had excellent luminous ability. Meanwhile, the morphology and crystal form of CaCO 3 could also be controlled by controlling the CO 2 flow rate and rotation speed. After that, a possible biomineralization mechanism of CaCO 3 in the presence of ACDs was proposed. Finally, the synthetic spherical ACDs@CaCO 3 were applied to the field of biological imaging for the first time. Our work not only provides new bionic methods for the synthesis of multifunctional biomineralized materials and new insights for further understanding of biomineralization mechanism, but also the synthesized new biomineralization fluorescent materials have great application potential in the field of bioimaging.},

  abstract     = {Gout normally occurs when excess urate crystals accumulate in the joints that induce inflammation. The inflammations further result in gout flares, causing serious pain. Some anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve pain, but they have various side effects. Nanomedicines can reduce side effects but are mostly based on the delivery of additional organic drugs, which adds complexity and may cause other health problems. We developed folic acid (FA)-modified lysozyme (Lys)-protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) (i.e., FLA) by a one-pot method, and successfully used FLA as an effective anti-inflammatory drug for relief of gout flares in hyperuricemic rats. The morphological changes of the cells were studied by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence microscopy. Western blot was conducted to understand the inflammation factors. AutoDock Vina was used for molecular docking of FLA. FLA reduced the inflammation, oxidative stress level in vitro. By injecting FLA into gout rat models, inflammations, cartilage destructions and pain during gout flares were also significantly relieved. Compared with complicated nano-delivery systems, FLA directly exhibits exciting therapeutic efficiency against gout flares, which will have considerable prospects in the clinic.},

  abstract     = {Peri-implantitis is the main cause of implant failure with limited clinical management. Recently, the photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted more and more attention, due to its convenient and efficient erasure of bacteria. Unfortunately, the high temperature may also cause healthy tissues damage, so that there is a call for the balance between “kill and heal” during PTT. Here, the disregarded photothermal effect of titania nanotubes array (TiNTs) is investigated, to realize the mild PTT (mPTT) idea. It is found that the delivered heat is inversely proportional to TiNTs diameters (30–80 nm) and in proportional to NIR light power (300–2000 mW/cm 2 ). The maximum temperature elevation is reached within 4–6 min (13.4℃ under 300 mW/cm 2 ), which belongs to the temperature range of mPTT. In addition, the peri -implantitis related cells including macrophages, endothelial progenitor cells and osteoblasts all exhibit favorable phenotype alterations after mPTT. Specifically, the macrophages are undergoing M2 polarization (anti-inflammation, pro-healing), endothelial progenitor cells show functional suppression (abnormal vascularization inhibition) and osteoblasts exhibit enhanced osteogenic differentiation (beneficial for new bone repair). In conclusion, these findings suggest that mPTT conveyed by TiNTs may control inflammation and promote bone regeneration, which may be a promising choice for peri -implantitis management.},

Modeling of the precipitation kinetics, electrical resistivity and strength evolution is therefore essential for optimizing heat treatment and processing of these alloys. In this work, in situ electrical resistivity monitoring during both non-isothermal and isothermal thermal processes and microstructural characterizations were conducted on an Al-Cu-Mg-Zr alloy with different pre-precipitation microstructures to provide fundamental insights of precipitation behaviors. The results showed that precipitation behaviors of Al-Cu-Mg-Zr alloy, such as the dominant strengthening phase, were highly dependent on pre-precipitation microstructures and thermal history. A time–temperature-microstructure-properties map was established to unravel precipitation characteristics and their strengthening functions. The maximum hardness was indicated to be attributed to the combined presence of Guinier–Preston–Bagaryatsky (GPB) zones and fine S (Al 2 CuMg) phase. Further, in situ electrical resistivity was used as the main input data to develop an improved model based on the classical Kampmann and Wagner type numerical model (KWN model). This integrated model could not only reveal precipitation kinetics but also well predict hardness evolutions of the studied alloy during non-isothermal and isothermal processes.},

However, due to the soft lubricating components, the mechanical properties of composites are dramatically reduced. In this paper, Al 2 O 3 -cBN-hBN self-lubricating material was designed. High density, fine grain ceramics were synthesized by high-pressure technology. The influence of thermodynamic condition, cBN/hBN addition on mechanical and thermal properties of sintered composites was analyzed. Friction and wear tests were carried out. It is found that the addition of cBN particles can significantly improve the mechanical and thermal properties of the composites. However, the truss effect caused by excessive volume fraction of cBN can reduce the pressure transfer efficiency, and then affect the properties of sintered composites. The different hBN content can change the wear mechanism of the composites. The release efficiency of hBN particles in composites was enhanced due to the large modulus difference between cBN and hBN. The well-sintered Al 2 O 3 -cBN-hBN bulks present an excellent mechanical property. The hardness of the composites is improved at least by 54\% compared with the traditional self-lubricating material on the premise of ensuring fracture toughness and lubrication performance.},

By using X-ray diffraction (XRD), the solid solutions formation during MA were studied, the grain size and lattice strain were calculated.

The grain size decreased as rotational speed, milling time, ball to powder weight ratio increased, the change of lattice strain was opposite. The carbon and oxygen pollution levels introduced by stearic acid were higher than those introduced by n-heptane and lower than those introduced by ethanol. The powders were hardly alloyed when stearic acid was added at initial stage, but could be effectively alloyed after pre-alloying. Cold-welding was effectively inhibited and particles were greatly refined when 1 wt\% ethanol and stearic acid were added respectively. Solid solutions formation was affected by cold-welding and fracture. Severe cold-welding led to Fe, Cr, Ni rich regions formation.

By dispersing carbonyl iron particles and multiwalled carbon nanotubes in polydimethylsiloxane, an MRE with improved force-sensing capability is fabricated as a further effort to explore its comprehensive sensing effect. Then, the model is developed based on magnetic dipole analysis and tunneling theory. In addition, the conductive mechanism and vibrational operating state of the MRE are analyzed, while the effects of input force and current are investigated. The experimental results show that the resistance of the MRE decreases with increasing force or current, which is consistent with the theoretical model. For instance, the resistance decreases from 1.55 kΩ to 0.55 kΩ as the force changes from 0 N to 160 N, and the dynamic resistance responses show a very good match with the force input curve and the response curve present continuous, stable, and perfectly reversible signals. The validation results demonstrate that the proposed model can reproduce experimental results well without causing significant differences. In summary, the proposed model provides an accurate approach to estimating the conductivity of MREs for self-sensing actuator applications.},

  abstract     = {Elastic compression stockings (ECSs) are essential for the prevention and treatment of venous disorders of the lower limbs. Finite element modeling (FEM) is an effective method for numerically analyzing ECS pressure performance for guiding ECS material design and pressure dose selection in treatment. However, existing FEM studies have primarily used the two-dimensional (2D) mechanical properties (i.e., properties along the wale and course directions) of ECS fabrics and ignored their three-dimensional (3D) mechanical properties (i.e., those along the thickness direction), causing deviations in pressure predictions. To address this limitation, the present study developed a new approach for determining the 3D mechanical properties of ECS fabrics through orthotropic theoretical analysis, analytical model development, FEM, and experimental testing and validation. The results revealed that the deviation ratios between the experimental and simulated pressure values of ECS fabrics was 19.3\% obtained using the 2D material mechanical properties that was reduced to 10.3\% obtained using the 3D material mechanical properties. Equivalently, the FEM simulation precision increased by 46.6\%. These results indicate that the proposed approach can improve finite element analysis efficiency for ECS pressure prediction, thus facilitating the functional design of elastic compression materials for improving compression therapeutic efficacy.},

In producing theses masks, the sheets are often chemically etched to produce arrays of micro-holes. Because etching behavior of a material depends not only on the chemical composition of the material, but also on the surface microstructure of the material, an in depth exploration on the role of the surface microstructure of an Invar alloy on the etching behavior of the alloy is fundamental in manufacturing high quality FMMs. In this study, microstructure dependent etching behavior of a partially recrystallized Invar sheet is investigated. The Invar alloy was partially recrystallized at 750℃ to examine how recrystallized and non-crystallized grains differ in their etching behaviors using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and atomic force microscope (AFM) techniques. The results show that the overall etching behavior of the partially recrystallized Invar sheet not only depends on the properties of individual grains such as orientation dependent surface energy and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) content, but also on the properties of aggregates of grains such as grain boundary density.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing has enabled surface-based sheet lattice to emerge as a new mechanical metamaterial with exceptional weight specific strength properties and multifunction. A novel design method of shell offset has been developed here for enhancement of mechanical properties and domain controllability of separated spaces by sheet lattice. Using selective laser melting, Ti6Al4V lattice samples were fabricated for compression experiments, followed by Micro-CT reconstruction. Manufacturing deviations with mean values of statistical analysis were taken into numerical simulations for prediction of mechanical properties. Investigation results show that increasing the shell offset is an effective strategy to improve mechanical properties and energy absorption of sheet lattices by more than 200\% competing with net lattices, which is attributed to the higher second moment of area and successive layer-by-layer deformation mechanism of optimized unit type. In addition, a feasible adjustment region of 30–55\% has been found, in which spatial volume fraction of the two independent void phases can be controlled for flow regulation of heat exchange without changing their mechanical properties. Those design concepts of sheet lattices will be valuable in future thermal management applications with lightweight protection.},

Advance of alloy properties and balance of comprehensive performances depend largely on regulation of nano precipitates. However, introduction of further solute elements in Al-Li alloys leads to a greater complexity of precipitation behavior of nano second phase. A pivotal step in understanding the strengthening mechanism is to determine the crystal structure and the evolution pattern of nano precipitate. In this critical review, several major nano precipitates and precursors, as well as composite nano precipitates in Al-Li alloys, are surveyed from composition, atomic structure and orientation relationship with matrix. Nucleation mechanism and evolution process are then discussed. Based on a proper understanding of crystallography, great details are provided on precipitate-dislocation interactions by analyzing the interfacial structure between precipitate and matrix. Finally, the review offers a summary of advances in this field and some inspirations for future research directions.},

The present work provides a method to prepare a durable and non-toxic superhydrophobic coating on the surface of a cotton fabric. Thermal polymerization of spray drying was used to obtain uniform structure of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose (TOC) with nano silica (SiO 2 ), for achieving well-combined rough sphere-like micron particles with hierarchical dimensions, which were then immersed into isocyanate (IPDI) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) respectively along with cotton fabric to construct a superhydrophobic coating on the fabric surface. The surface morphology, chemical structure, roughness and wettability of TOC-SiO 2 /PDMS surface were studied by adjusting the mass ratios of SiO 2 to TOC. The optimal superhydrophobicity was obtained while the mass ratio of SiO 2 to TOC was 1:1, displaying a water contact angle (CA) of 158.6°. The introduction of the intertwined TOC-SiO 2 blends can construct a hierarchical micro-nano structure to enhance the hydrophobicity, simultaneously improve the mechanical durability of the superhydrophobic surface to prevent multiple peeling and friction damage, as well as outstanding chemical stability in a variety of harsh conditions.},

However, pure hydrogels suffer from poor elasticity and mechanical properties, which severely limit their application. Employing dual-crosslinked networks, comprising simultaneous existence of chemical and physical crosslinks, is an effective approach to circumvent these limitations. In this study, the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and alendronate loaded ZIF-8 (Aln@ZIF-8) nanoparticles were synthesized by one-pot method. Then, by incorporating ZIF-8 or Aln@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, the dual-crosslinked hydrogel consisting of hydrophilic polyacrylamide (PAM), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was developed. Furthermore, the mechanical properties were measured using a universal testing machine. The results showed that the hydrogel exhibited superior tensile properties, compression properties, storage modulus (G′), and loss modulus (G″) in 10 wt\% ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Therefore, considering the superior mechanical properties, the 10 wt\% hydrogels were selected as promising candidates as Aln delivery carriers with a high loading capacity (63.83\%) and a longer releasing profile (6 d), which might be a potential application in tissue engineering.},

Previous projects have been successfully built with glass and carbon fibre, proving their potential for lightweight construction systems. However, in order to move towards more sustainable architecture, it is crucial to consider replacing carbon fibre’s high environmental impact with other material systems, such as natural fibre. This paper evaluates several fibres, resin systems, and their required CFW fabrication adjustments towards designing and fabricating a bio-composite structure: the LivMatS Pavilion. The methods integrate structural design loops with material evaluation and characterisation, including small-scale and large-scale structural testing at progressive stages. The results demonstrate the interactive decision-making process that combines material characterisation with structural simulation feedback, leveraged to evaluate and optimise the structural design. The built pavilion is proof of the first successful coreless filament wound sustainable natural fibres design, and the developed methods and findings open up further research directions for future applications.},

In this paper, slag is heated up to the same temperature as in a steel factory and then poured on top of cement paste samples with W/C ratios of 0.20 and 0.40. A combination of FEM, TGA , XRD and SEM/EDS was used to investigate the effects of hot spill on the samples.

However, undesirable implantation responses including thrombus formation, inflammation, and hyperplasia is still the life-threatening to the patients. In this study, a novel tellurium-functionalized polycarbonate-polyurethane (PCU-TeTe) was designed and synthesized by introducing ditelluride bonds (Te-Te) into the molecular structure of polymer. The developed PCU-TeTe showed an excellent catalytic activity in the nitric oxide (NO) release with a rate of 2.8 × 10 -10 mol·cm −2 ·min −1 , hence has multiple advanced functions in the blood environment. Both in vitro and ex vivo results of hemocompatibility showed that PCU-TeTe could substantially reduce the probability of thrombogenesis. Besides, PCU-TeTe could significantly promote endothelial cell (EC) proliferation while suppress the growth of smooth muscle cell (SMC) and macrophage (MA). Moreover, the in vivo results including qualitative and quantitative date (e.g. abdominal aorta hyperplasia) demonstrated that PCU-TeTe could not only promote healthy endothelialization, but also inhibit thrombus, inflammation and hyperplasia. Such tellurium-functionalized system could be a promising strategy for the design and fabrication of vascular materials or implants, especially for blood-contacting devices in the future.},

Polymers are effective materials currently used in the field of BTE due to their diverse characteristics and easy processing performance, which are categorised into natural polymers and synthetic polymers. Photothermal effects produced by near-infrared (NIR) light constitute an effective way to promote osteogenesis, with the advantages of being non-invasive and having high spatial and temporal precision. The main objective of this systematic review was to reveal the current applications of NIR light-assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) with polymer scaffolds as the delivery vehicles for photothermal agents and tissue supports in BTE. The databases collection was completed on October 1, 2021, and a total of 21 relevant studies were finally included. According to the retrieved literatures, we outlined that polymers could be made into various forms, such as coatings, three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds, membranes and injectable hydrogels, etc., and that the hyperthermia generated by PTT has a good effect on osteogenesis, as well as anti-tumour, antibacterial and osseointegration around the implants. These findings have revealed that the joint application of BTE polymer scaffolds and NIR light-assisted PTT play a positive role in bone regeneration.},

A eutectic Al-12Si alloy was used as a low-melting matrix precursor to prevent thermal sintering of the active phase during liquid metal infiltration. CO 2 methanation was chosen as the reaction test. The activity and CH 4 selectivity (close to 100\%) achieved with the Guefoam catalyst were similar to those obtained with a packed bed of the same active phase particles, but with the advantages of a structured reactor such as robustness and ease of handling. The thermal conductivity of the Guefoam catalyst is significantly improved with regard to the packed bed of active phase particles, which reduces the temperature gradients in the catalytic reactor, as demonstrated by computational fluid dynamic modelling. Since the permeability of the Guefoam catalyst is 2.7 times that of the packed bed, the pressure drop caused by the passage of a fluid through the novel material is reduced, resulting in a significantly higher catalytic performance index than the packed bed.},

Further, optimized sample states were achieved via thermal post-processing using standard capability aging, super-transus (900 °C) and sub-transus (660 °C) heat treatment strategies with varying quenching mediums (air, water and ice).

  abstract     = {Shape memory alloy (SMA) beam actuators are widely used in morphing structures, which leads to a surgent demand for a comprehensive design method. Previous methods have not considered the heat treatment and the evolution of actuation performance during training. In this study, an in-depth investigation was conducted into the Ni 50 Ti 50 (at\%) SMA beam actuator from the perspective of heat treatment, training, numerical simulation for developing a comprehensive and novel design methodology. The proper heat treatment conditions that result in the relatively high actuation performance for the Ni 50 Ti 50 SMA beam were determined. The dependence of the thermomechanical behavior evolution on the training load was established. Moreover, a numerical analysis method for the SMA beam actuator based on a 3-D constitutive model with tension-compression asymmetry considered was detailed, followed by the calibration of material parameters. A forward design method for the SMA beam actuator was proposed with the shape and actuation performance evolution during training under various training loads fully considered in the design process. The proposed design method was applied for a design case and the accuracy of the design results demonstrated its feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Modern engineering applications require advanced materials that are stronger, tougher, and lighter. Nature offers various structural architectures to achieve superior mechanical properties. Inspired by bone with a spongy soft-core and a compact hard-shell, this study introduces architected multi-material lattices with tunable mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength, and energy absorption. The architected lattices are fabricated via multi-material fused filament fabrication. The hard polylactic acid (PLA) shell of the lattice struts maintains the stiffness, while the soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) core enhances toughness and energy absorption capacity. The microstructural and mixed-mode fracture characteristics of the PLA-TPU interfaces were examined since the interfacial microstructure and adhesion are crucial to stress transfer in multi-phase composite materials. This study explores the flexural behavior of the multi-material struts and reveals two distinct failure modes depending on the volume fraction of the soft-core through 3-point bend tests. This study demonstrates the bio-inspired design on a hexagonal planar lattice with a strut thickness-to-length ratio of 0.3. Tunable stiffness, strength, and energy absorption are achieved by varying the core-to-strut thickness ratio. Compression test results show that the architected lattices exhibit an energy absorption capacity that is about 2–3 times greater than that of the constituent single-phase lattices.},

Additive manufacturing (AM) is an efficient method to fabricate functionally graded materials (FGMs) with gradually variable composition and structures as a function of position. In this work, a powder-based laser directed energy deposition (LDED) process was carried out to develop a series of compositionally graded joints from 316 stainless steel to Inconel 718 alloy. The microstructure, composition, precipitation transformation and mechanical properties were investigated as a function of position in FGMs via experimental characterization and computational analysis. The 75 wt\% IN718 component with fine and equiaxial grains is directly obtained from the laser deposition. The diffusion and segregation of Ni, Nb and Ti elements underly the transformation mechanism between Laves, NbNi 3 /δ, γ&#39;&#39; and γ&#39;&#39; phases during aging, which has a high consistency with the computational prediction. The precipitation transformation has a close relationship with the final mechanical properties of the FGM. The computational-experimental approach is a promising method to tune the microstructure-property relationship of dissimilar metal joints. The gradient precipitation that can be flexibly tuned by LDED process provides a high throughput design to develop new functional materials with local tailoring of properties.},

The optimal process parameters and modification mechanism were explored. Research results indicated that grafting ratio of lipoic acid can reach more than 13\% and the polypeptide chains were more stretched in solution, when 30\% lipoic acid was added into keratin solution at 40 °C with a reaction time of 2 h. In addition, lipoic acid grafted on thiol groups can effectively weaken the intra- and intermolecular forces of keratin, this change made the arrangement of macromolecular chains more orderly.

The effects of structural parameters and material on mechanical properties and biocompatibility were studied. The shrinkage test results showed that the density of scaffolds was mainly affected by the porosity. The mechanical test results showed that Ir2 and Ir3 scaffolds had better compressive behaviors, and the compressive strength could be increased by 30\% by regulating the irregularity. All scaffolds showed comparable mechanical properties to that of cancellous bone. Cell experiments showed that the effect of structure on cell proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization was most evident at the early stage of implantation.

Here, we reported a facile and scalable method of uniaxial cold-drawing for engineering tendon patch scaffold. Comprised of bioactive and structure-supporting portions, the scaffold obtained featured microtopography of aligned and sparely-stacked fibres while providing mechanical properties approaching to that of human rotator cuff tendon. The structural integration between scaffold’s two portions resulted in stable and reliable fabrication, where parameters of drawing ratio, speed and temperature influenced the formation of fibrous microtopography. When mesenchymal stem cells were cultured with the scaffold, phenotypic markers of tenogenesis including scleraxis, decorin and tenomodulin were examined higher over nonfibrous controls. Our results further demonstrated that expression of collagen type I was associated with highly aligned intracellular cytoskeleton and the higher nucleus alignment and elongation, coupling with down-regulated cell proliferation and noncytotoxicity.},

The MBW@LDH–DDP was incorporated into epoxy resin (EP) to fabricate a composite, and its curing behavior, fire properties, and mechanical properties were assessed. The results revealed that the cure index value of the EP/MBW@LDH–DDP composite was between ΔT* and ΔH*, indicating an excellent cured state. Moreover, it exhibited good flame-retarding performance (LOI: 32.5\%; UL94: V-1 rating; flame retardancy index: 1.57). The improved fire safety was attributed to the barrier function of MBW, the presence of metallic oxides generated from LDH, and the catalytic dehydration of phosphorus oxoacids produced during the decomposition of DDP. The PO radicals generated from DDP were capable of capturing HO and H radicals in the gaseous phase. Furthermore, the incorporation of MBW@LDH–DDP improved the mechanical properties of the EP.

Nowadays, we are able to model and predict how the surface structures of materials evolve during oxidation based on the cross-fertilisation of various computational techniques. This review first overviews the state-of-the-art first-principles and force-field-based approaches for modelling surface reactions. Then, classical theories and recent advances in understanding the atomic-scale oxidation of bulk materials are introduced, from the initial solid-gas interactions to the subsequent oxide film growth. Defect-promoted oxidation mechanisms will be discussed in detail. Finally, distinct oxidation mechanisms of nanomaterials are discussed, including nanoparticles, nanowires, and two-dimensional materials, which are significantly different from their bulk counterparts and could result in novel oxide nanostructures with unique properties. This review provides a systematic overview of the central role of computational techniques in probing the atomic-scale oxidation mechanisms, which could further guide the synthesis of oxide-based cutting-edge materials such as ultra-thin oxide films and hollow oxide nanostructures.},

We specifically examine the effect of the choice of reinforcement phase, particularly its patterning and organization, on the toughness and deformation mechanisms of heterogeneous designed hexagonal (HDH) lattices. The HDH lattice is fabricated by using the 3D-laser cutting, and the HDH lattice composite is made by a hybrid manufacturing process on this basis. The experimental results show that the crack paths of the substrate lattice are consistent with the lattice composite. With longer crack paths, the total energy dissipation of the HDH lattice composite is significantly enhanced, and thus the toughness increases accordingly. In addition, theory and simulation studies for the substrate lattice are also carried out to explore the crack deflection mechanism. These results provide tougher lattice structures and shed new insights into the structure–property relationship which may further facilitate the design and usage of lattices in a wide range of structural engineering applications .},

  abstract     = {The premature failure of the γ’’-strengthen mechanism restricts the further application of Inconel 718 superalloys at temperatures over 650 °C. Although numerous attempts have been made to improve the performance, the complex chemical composition and phase constitution still pose a great challenge to the development of IN718. We systematically explore the sole/synergetic effect of various alloying elements on stabilities of the matrix (γ) and the precipitates (γ’, γ’’) in IN718, and map their mechanical properties versus chemical compostions by employing high-throughput calculations. Results indicate that the promotive effect of Al and Ti on stability of γ’ phase exhibits a synergistic relationship, either over-low Al or Ti would obviously weaken the promotion. W is detrimental to stability of γ’ phase. Co yields a complicated effect on stabilities that depends on its sublattice position and the Al and Ti contents. By drawing the mechanical maps, it shows that the preferred composition range for the phases with desired properties is roughly demarcated in theory. The Al, Ti, and Nb concentrations need to be cautiously altered due to their conflicting effects on stabilities and mechanical properties of the phases. Alloying Co is encouraged to enhance the properties while alloying W might be theoretically deprecated.},

Optical properties of bulk multicomponent transition metal carbonitrides were characterized using reflectivity spectra. Optical pseudogap energies were extrapolated using the Tauc method, and color appearance was quantified in the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) Lightness*Chroma*hue (L*C*h) color space. Variations of color parameters chroma and hue were analyzed in terms of pseudogap energies and electronic band structures. Compositional variations were utilized to predictably tune aspects of the electronic structure, including the specificity of electronic transitions and the energy at which they occur, to tailor the material’s color appearance and facilitate the formation of new carbonitride colors.},

The current work investigates the production of inorganic SSEs from silicate minerals, which are abundant materials in natural resources (kaolinite) as well as in industrial waste-streams (amorphous silica). The synthesized materials showed high amorphous contents combined with lithium silicate phases at variable proportions, according to the molar proportions of the reacting system. The materials have been characterized with XRD, SEM/EDS, FTIR, TGA-DSC, XPS, EIS, and density measurements. The results showed that hybrid structures of amorphous and crystalline silicates can form an ordered hotchpotch morphology. The best of the hybrid SSEs presented ionic conductivity values of 1.42 × 10 -4 and 1.30 × 10 -4 Scm −1 for samples with total amorphous contents of 73 and 83 wt\%, respectively. The connected structure between amorphous and crystalline phases in a hotchpotch structure is hypothesized to assist the hopping of the Li + ions via combined mechanisms of segmental motion of the silicates amorphous chains with defects in the crystalline phases. The proposed approach may offer new research paths towards the low-cost scalable production of SSEs.},

Then, the GelDA/pGO hydrogels with multifunction of adhesion, conductivity, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity were designed through an oxidative coupling reaction between catechol groups. The rheology, mechanical properties , and conductivity of hydrogels could be adjusted appropriately by changing the concentration of pGO. Furthermore, the catechol groups made the hydrogel possessed an adequate adhesive hemostasis in the rat liver hemorrhage model. While the introducion of pGO enabled the hydrogels to get the satisfactory photothermal antibacterial properties , which were verified by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria tests.

Herein, a multifunctional polycaprolactone/gelatin (PG)-blended membrane embedded with alendronate-loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (Aln/Zif-8) nanoparticles was fabricated by electrospun technique and a simple solution-phase synthesis. Surface characterizations confirmed the successful synthesis of PG/Aln-Zif-8 nanofibers endowed with excellent mechanical strength. The release kinetics analysis showed the synergistic effects of the coordination bonds among Aln, zinc ions (Zn 2+ ), and organic ligands played a critical role in regulating the initial burst release and delayed release of Aln and Zn 2+ , respectively. The in vitro results of MC3T3-E1 and RAW264.3 cells demonstrated that the PG/Aln-Zif-8 membranes possessed superior anti-osteoporosis and osteoinductive properties. Furthermore, the PG/Aln-Zif-8 samples also exhibited significant bactericidal properties against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli . The in vivo results further confirmed that PG/Aln-Zif-8 membranes had superior osteoinduction abilities, contributing to the accelerated osseointegration in the osteoporosis model. Altogether, these new bioinspired surface modifications highlight the promising alternative for fabricating multifunctional MOFs on electrospun membranes to accelerate early osteogenesis in osteoporosis.},

A mostly amorphous phase, rich in Al and Zr, is found within the interdendritic region. The annealed state reproduced the combination of A2/B2/Al-Zr-rich phases reported previously. Calculations from two relevant ThermoCalc databases were compared with the experimental results. Equilibrium calculations were compared with results for the annealed alloy, whereas solidification paths calculated using Scheil-Gulliver model were used for comparison with the as-cast alloy. A previously hypothesized spinodal decomposition during cooling as the mechanism responsible for the patterned A2/B2 microstructure is confirmed via the CALPHAD calculations, pointing to its use as an efficient design tool for such alloys. Finally, the comparison between the experimental and computational findings allowed better understanding the solidification path and equilibrium stability of this alloy, giving a base to make better decisions on the field of new refractory superalloy design.},

  abstract     = {Disruption of phase stability by energetic particle bombardment is a major challenge in designing advanced radiation-tolerant alloys and ion beam processing of nanocomposites. Particularly, ballistic dissolution susceptibility of different solute nanocluster species in alloys is poorly understood. Here, low dose rate neutron irradiations were conducted on a Fe-Cr-Ni based austenitic steel in the BOR-60 reactor (9.4 × 10 −7 dpa/s, 318 °C) followed by accelerated dose rate ion irradiations at multiple temperatures ( ~ ~ 10 −3 dpa/s, 380 – 420 °C). Using atom probe tomography, the stability of radiation-enhanced Cu-rich and radiation-induced Ni-Si-Mn-rich nanoclusters was evaluated. During neutron irradiation, Cu-rich clusters nucleated with their core concentrations progressively increasing with dose, while Ni-Si-Mn-rich clusters formed and evolved into G-phase precipitates. Ion irradiations dramatically altered the nanoclusters. Cu-rich clusters were ballistically dissolved, but Ni-Si-Mn-rich clusters remained stable and coarsened with dose at 400 and 420 °C, highlighting that different nanocluster species in a single microstructure can have innately distinct ballistic dissolution susceptibilities. Solute-specific recoil rates were incorporated into the Heinig precipitate stability model, which shows that in addition to radiation-enhanced diffusion, recovery from ballistic dissolution depends on solute concentration gradient near cluster interfaces. The combined experimental-modeling study quantified the critical temperatures and damage rates where ballistic dissolution dominates for each cluster species.},

  abstract     = {The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a continuous channel through the body that consists of the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, the large intestine, and the rectum. Its primary functions are to move the intake of food for digestion before storing and ultimately expulsion of feces. The mechanical behavior of GI tissues thus plays a crucial role for GI function in health and disease. The mechanical properties are characterized by a biomechanical constitutive model, which is a mathematical representation of the relation between load and deformation in a tissue. Hence, validated biomechanical constitutive models are essential to characterize and simulate the mechanical behavior of the GI tract. Here, a systematic review of these constitutive models is provided. This review is limited to studies where a model of the strain energy function is proposed to characterize the stress–strain relation of a GI tissue. Several needs are identified for more advanced modeling including: 1) Microstructural models that provide actual structure–function relations; 2) Validation of coupled electro-mechanical models accounting for active muscle contractions; 3) Human data to develop and validate models. The findings from this review provide guidelines for using existing constitutive models as well as perspective and directions for future studies.},

  abstract     = {The processing of new generation titanium alloys using the Laser-based Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) technology is an innovation in the world of science. The selection of parameters as well as the determination of the process window enabling the processing of powder based on the chemical composition of Ti-13Nb-13Zr is the main element of this research. The wide spectrum of powder tests, such as batch powder analysis in the field of microscopic examination, powder fraction and distribution, dynamic flow tests, and examination of the chemical composition of powders, have delivered comprehensive results. Followed by the development of key set parameters affecting the efficiency of the L-PBF process and thus providing low porosity samples. As part of this study, an analysis of the influence of the thermal additive manufacturing process on the microstructural changes of the material was carried out using the methods of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, as well as the analysis of X-ray fluorescence. The research confirmed the possibility of obtaining a high relative density of the material produced with the use of additive technologies at the level of over 99\% while maintaining a stable chemical composition of the material meeting the ASTM F1713 conditions.},

  abstract     = {This work aims at understanding the nucleation and growth of alumina films grown on Ti(C,N)-based layers using an industrial-scale CVD system. Firstly, Al 2 O 3 layer was deposited on Ti(C,N)-based layers without any nucleation treatment, pure α-Al 2 O 3 is obtained, whereas no orientation relationship at the Ti(C,N)/α-Al 2 O 3 layers interface can be observed. Secondly, Al 2 O 3 layer was deposited on the bonding layer consisting of rutile TiO 2 , which is obtained by oxidizing the uppermost part of Ti(C,N)-based layers. Herein, α-Al 2 O 3 single-phased layer is obtained, and the epitaxial growth of α-Al 2 O 3 on rutile is observed. The orientation relationships can be found as: ( 1 ¯ 20 ) α - A l 2 O 3 / / ( 10 1 ¯ ) r u t i l e (1¯20)α-Al2O3//(101¯)rutile , ( 003 ) α - A l 2 O 3 / / ( 010 ) r u t i l e (003)α-Al2O3//(010)rutile and [ 210 ] α - A l 2 O 3 / / [ 101 ] r u t i l e [210]α-Al2O3//[101]rutile . Finally, Al 2 O 3 layer was deposited on the bonding layer, produced from a TiCl 4 -H 2 -N 2 -CH 4 -CO-AlCl 3 gas mixture. Regarding this intermediate layer, despite additions of CO and AlCl 3 , no evidence for oxide phases, e.g. TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 can be found, while Ti(C,N) needle-shaped grains develop. In this case, κ-Al 2 O 3 is epitaxially grown on Ti(C,N), with the orientation relationships found as:. ( 0 1 ¯ 3 ) κ - A l 2 O 3 / / ( 2 ¯ 20 ) T i ( C , N ) (01¯3)κ-Al2O3//(2¯20)Ti(C,N) , ( 100 ) κ - A l 2 O 3 / / ( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1 ) T i ( C , N ) (100)κ-Al2O3//(1¯1¯1)Ti(C,N) and [ 031 ] κ - A l 2 O 3 / / [ 112 ] T i ( C , N ) [031]κ-Al2O3//[112]Ti(C,N) . Since processing parameters for the alumina depositions were always the same, it is revealed that the nucleation of α-Al 2 O 3 and κ-Al 2 O 3 can be accurately controlled with deposition of specific bonding layers.},

In this study, we have obtained crack-free and lamella-like interfacial architecture in the transition region of a stainless steel/Ni-based superalloy bimetal conjugated by laser directed energy deposition. Upon rapid solidification, insufficient solute mixing and complex fluid flow endow the interfacial architecture with pronounced concentration fluctuations and interwoven grain/sub-grain structures. Additionally, high-level thermal stresses and misfit strains induce plentiful inter-lamellar crystal defects, including randomly distributed dislocations, misfit dislocation arrays, stacking faults and stacking fault tetrahedral. The alternate soft and stiff lamella architecture decorated by grown-in crystal defects as well as the 3D grain/sub-grain structure interlock is effective in retarding dislocation motion and accommodating further plastic deformation, potentially enhancing the damage tolerance against applied loads.},

The effects of torsion deformation ( T = 5–50 turns) and electric pulse treatment ( f = 50–400 Hz and t = 50–1000 µs) on the phase transformation behaviour and superelastic properties of NiTi alloys were comparatively analysed. The results indicate that A → R and R → M transitions occur with broadened transformation peaks during cooling and eventually disappear with the increase in torsion turns. Torsion deformation effectively improves superelasticity via the introduction of dislocations. The superelasticity is initially improved and then reduced under the increase in torsion turns. After electric pulse treatment with various pulse frequencies and switch-on times, the superelasticity is first decreased and then increased. Better superelasticity is obtained in the deformed NiTi alloy after 40 torsion turns, followed by electric pulse treatment of 150 Hz/600 µs. The corresponding accumulative residual strain is reduced, leading to an 85\% increase in superelasticity compared to the as-received one.},

In this work, the absorbance of 39 metal powders for additive manufacturing is determined at 20 laser wavelengths. Different grain sizes and aging states for: steels, aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, Nitinol, high entropy alloy, chromium, copper, brass and iron ore were analyzed. For this purpose, the absorbance spectrum of the powders was determined via a dual-beam spectrometer in the range of λ = 330 - 1560 nm. At the laser wavelengths of λ = 450 nm, 633 nm and 650 nm, the absorbance averaged over all materials was found to increase by a factor of 2.4 up to 3.3 compared to the usual wavelength of λ = 1070 nm, with minimal variations in absorbance between materials. In the investigation of the aged or used powders, a loss of absorbance was detectable. Almost no changes from the point of view of processing aged and new AlSi10Mg powders, is expected for laser sources with λ = 450 nm. The resulting measurements provide a good basis for process parameters for a variety of laser wavelengths and materials, as well as a data set for improved absorbance simulations.},

This study reports a rare dual-function coating of antimicrobial effect and anti-corrosion performance. The coating was prepared by adding cuprous oxide/polyaniline (Cu 2 O/PANI) composite to acrylic resin. Cu 2 O/PANI core–shell structure was constructed through the oxidation–reduction method. According to the different weight percentages of Cu 2 O in Cu 2 O/PANI (0\%, 35\%, 46\%, and 100\%), the performance and protection mechanism of Cu 2 O/PANI composites were researched. Cu 2 O/PANI-2 (weight percentages of Cu 2 O was 35\%) displays an excellent anti-corrosive effect, due to the improved dispersibility of PANI in coating and the enlarged area of effective contact between the PANI and Fe-based metal. And the superior antimicrobial property of Cu 2 O/PANI-2 is responsible for the better adsorbability towards bacteria, which can be accurately anchored and shortens the function routes of Cu 2+ . Considering the anti-corrosive and antibacterial applications, the developed Cu 2 O/PANI-2 has a far-reaching influence on marine development.},

For ferrite dendrites, the magnetic field suppressed the concentrated growth, side-branched irregular morphology as well as orientation deflections across the weld. Results indicated that grain refinement, increased boundary disorientation and reduced residual strain enhanced the tensile strength, lowered brittleness and cracking susceptibility. Furthermore, variations of current, supercooling and electromagnetic stirring were analyzed at 0mT and 18mT magnetic intensities. At 0mT, current first increased and then decreased, attaining the highest in the columnar zone while supercooling rose in a steady form. At 18mT, the enhanced heat diffusion induced by fusion line variation lowered the supercooling and inhibited the columnar-to-equiaxed behavior while electromagnetic stirring reached the highest in columnar zones. Therefore, grain refinement was observed in columnar zones while coarsening in central zones at 18mT. In the interfacial zone, continuous and directional growth was achieved by the current at 0mT while grain refinement and growth deflection by electromagnetic stirring.},

The low autophagy activity of OP-BMSCs contributed to poor osseointegration, which could be regulated by the classical autophagic activator, rapamycin. Hence, it is of great significance to regulate autophagy by rapamycin to promote osseointegration at the three-dimensional (3D) printed prosthetic interfaces under osteoporotic environment. In this study, 3D printed porous titanium alloy prosthetic interfaces with bionic pore size and porosity were prepared and implanted into the distal femur of osteoporosis rabbits. Subsequently, a transdermal drug delivery device was used to deliver rapamycin to the interfaces implantation sites. Ultrasound-mediated rapamycin delivery could restore the declined cellular activities (including cell viability, proliferation, migration, and osteogenesis), as well as inhibit potential osteoclast-inducing capacity and adipogenic differentiation by upregulating the autophagy level of OP-BMSCs. Moreover, percutaneous ultrasound-mediated rapamycin delivery significantly improved bone ingrowth and osseointegration of prosthetic interfaces in osteoporotic environment. To conclude, this novel therapy combining 3D printed bionic prosthesis and percutaneous ultrasound-mediated rapamycin delivery can effectively promote prosthetic interfaces osseointegration by regulating autophagy after arthroplasty for patients with osteoporosis.},

This study investigated the effect of AuNPs@PDA-PLGA nanomembrane combined with electrical stimulation (ES) on promoting functional recovery of spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, an AuNPs@PDA-PLGA was prepared and its characterization and biological properties were determined by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effects of AuNPs@PDA-PLGA nanomembranes combined with ES on NSCs were evaluated in vitro. Finally, BBB score and immunohistochemical staining were used to confirm the therapeutic effect of AuNPs@PDA-PLGA nanomembrane combined with ES on recovery of SCI. The results showed that AuNPs@PDA-PLGA nanomembrane had good property for NSCs growth. Nanomembrane combined with ES could effectively promote the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Animal experiments results showed that the combination of AuNPs@PDA-PLGA nanomembrane and ES could promote the regeneration of new neurons and the formation of neuronal synapses, thus decrease cavity area, which all contribute to the functional recovery of spinal cord injury. Our results suggest that AuNPs@PDA-PLGA nanomembrane combined with ES can effectively promote functional recovery of SCI and provide a promising therapeutic option for SCI treatment.},

Surface properties were investigated considering water-in-air contact angle and nanoindentation tests, while morphological characteristics and degradation kinematics (accelerated degradation tests) were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pairing with thermal and mechanical properties monitored at each considered time point. A set of mathematical equations describing the variation of fiber diameter, porosity, mechanical properties, and weight, as a function of molecular weight and degradation time, were obtained based on the experimental results. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) proliferation and differentiation tests were also conducted using in vitro colorimetric assay. All results indicated that molecular weight had impacts on the surface, mechanical and biological properties of PCL scaffolds, while no significant effects were observed on the degradation rate. Scaffolds with lower molecular weight presented better bio-mechanical properties. These findings provide useful information for the design of polymeric bone tissue engineering scaffolds.},

Due to the uncontrolled pore structure and large grain size, the biological performances of the conventional BCP bioceramics is restricted to a large extent. Herein, this study attempted to fabricate BCP bioceramics with appropriately uniform macropores and abundant micropores by combining the advantages of the H 2 O 2 foaming method with the microsphere-sintering method, and different sintering methods were adopted to adjust the micro-nano topography. Due to the optimal design of macropore distribution and nano topography , the obtained BCP bioceramics could well trigger and regulate in vitro biological responses, such as degradation, bone-like apatite formation, protein adsorption, cell spreading, angiogenic and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo canine intramuscular implantation further revealed that the nano topography and appropriately uniform macropores might be responsible for the early neovascularization and osteoinductivity of the prepared BCP bioceramics. Collectedly, the neovascularization and osteoinductivity of BCP bioceramics were further enhanced by optimally designing the pore structure and micro-nano topography, which hold huge potential to be an alternative to the gold standard of autogenous bone in bone repairing applications.},

  abstract     = {Several cues, including wettability, surface morphology, and porosity, affect the cellular behaviors on nanofibrous scaffolds. However, a challenging task is determining the more influential parameter on cellular behaviors. Herein, we prepared two sets of polycaprolactone (PCL)-based electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds, viz. surface morphology-altered PCL (SMA PCL) scaffolds and hydrophilic PCL-chitosan scaffolds with different chitosan content. We further investigated the scaffolds&#39; cell attachment and proliferation ability to determine which is a predominant factor, wettability, or surface morphology? Water contact angle and alternative current impedance analyses revealed that incorporating chitosan to PCL increased the wettability and dielectric properties. In contrast, alterations in surface morphology did not show any significant changes to the properties mentioned above of neat PCL. Different solvent compositions (CHCl 3 /DMSO) caused cylindrical and smooth PCL nanofiber to adopt porous, wristed, or flat fibrous structures. The fibroblasts cell studies revealed that both PCL-chitosan and SMA PCL scaffolds had similar cell proliferation profiles on day 1. However, the former scaffolds showed a statistically significant difference from the latter ones on days 3 and 5. In conclusion, we suggest that increasing the wettability of nanofibrous scaffolds is more influential in directing cellular behaviors than surface morphology modification.},

In this paper, laminated construction and failure mechanism of twill carbon fiber and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber hybrid composite laminates under ballistic impact were comprehensively studied. Three different interface properties were characterized by peeling test. The simulation results were in good agreement with the ballistic impact experimental results. The sample of 4C4P with carbon fiber in the front and UHMWPE fiber in the back shows the best impact energy absorption performance,with the specific energy absorption increased by 92.22\%. Based on the computed tomography (CT) scanning, delamination damage cloud images of the composite laminates were presented for the first time. The improvement of interlayer fracture toughness can enhance the impact resistance of laminates, which mainly depending on the stacking sequence and interface properties.

Water absorption, platelet adhesion, fibrinogen adsorption, blood coagulation activity, and cytotoxicity were investigated. Pore size in SF/GA porous materials increased with increasing content of GA in SF but decreased significantly in SF/CA porous materials after incorporating CA in SF. Based on the water binding capacity of materials and capillary effect of pores, the binary composites SF/GA 1:1 and SF/CA 3:1 displayed the best water absorption. Although GA and CA were more favorable for fibrinogen adsorption, SF/GA 1:1 and SF/CA 1:1 exhibited greater numbers of adhered platelets, shorter clotting times, and greater whole blood coagulation ability. Human skin fibroblasts spread well on the pure SF and GA and all the composites of SF/GA and SF/CA, and they showed high proliferative activity. Pure CA inhibited cell proliferation.

With the development of modern science and technology, the research on hydrogel, a new kind of biomaterial, is increasingly extensive. Many researchers have carried out research on bone tissue-related engineering based on the advantages of hydrogel, such as adjustable mechanical properties, convenient production and combination with bioactive factors. The researchers mainly focus on the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of hydrogel made of composite materials. The disease causes extensive trauma, broken bones and cartilage damage that does not heal on its own, while traditional surgical treatments can bring side effects such as infection, inflammation and pain. As a new kind of biomaterial, hydrogel has controllable mechanical properties and biocompatibility, and is widely used in bone tissue engineering as scaffold material for growth factor transport and cell adhesion. In order to make hydrogels more suitable for local treatment of orthopedic diseases, the excellent properties of hydrogels are combined with synthetic materials with advanced technologies in different fields.

This research explores the use of Fe GARS powders, with 15 wt\% Cr with micro-alloyed additions of 0.15 wt\% Y and 0.10\% Ti, in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM), and evaluates the effectiveness of oxide dispersoid formation in the liquid melt pool.

  abstract     = {At the onset of a miniaturized device era, several promising methods, primarily wet methods, have been developed to attain large-scale assemblies of microparticles. To improve the speed, versatility and robustness of the current methods for the structured assembly of microparticles, an automatable method capable of forming 2D arrays of microspheres on large silicon surfaces is devised. The method uses surfaces perforated with vacuum-suction holes, capable of aspiring and holding individual particles from a particle cloud generated by subjecting a lump of chargeable particles, e.g., silica, polystyrene, and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), to a strong electrical field under ambient air conditions. The microsphere levitation depends on the electrical conductivity and permittivity of the particles. A single or double brush stroke can remove excess particles covering the formed arrays. We find that silica or polystyrene microspheres with a diameter of 5 μm or 10 μm can be assembled on the order of a few seconds, independently of the array size. Owing to the reversible nature of the arresting vacuum force, the assembled layers can be transferred to another surface, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets, thus providing a key step for future particle printing processes for the fabrication of hierarchical materials, e.g., photonic crystals.},

The SA mechanism of GO, CNC and CNC/GO in suspension is evaluated at different concentrations and mixing ratios. SAXS determine the interparticle distance, interaction and distribution of CNC and GO to resolve the self-assembling mechanism. At lower concentrations, the GO sheets are distributed randomly and separated by a large inter-sheet distance of 83 nm with poor inter-sheet interaction. As increases the GO concentration, the inter-sheet repulsion results in a nematic arrangement with the inter-sheet distance decreasing from 83 to 52 nm. Mixing isotropic and nematic phase of CNC with GO at different CNC/GO ratio from 2 to 50 shows transitions from isotropic, to biphasic and nematic state. In isotropic state, at low CNC/GO ratio, the GO sheets are randomly distributed between the CNC rods which increases the CNC inter-rod distance from 22 to 51 nm. However, at higher CNC/GO ratios, steric repulsion from the large amount of CNC forces the GO sheets to align following the direction of CNC nematic assembly.

  abstract     = {Shape memory alloy (SMA) wires are excellent candidates for wearable actuators since they are thin, low weight and have a high actuation force. The main drawbacks are that the wire should be kept straight and needs to be relatively long to enable a large enough actuation stroke. Embedding the SMA wire in a flexible tube largely enhances its applicability since then the counter forces are transferred by the tube material and the tube can be rolled up or attached to flexible surfaces or clothing layers. The performance of such tube-guided SMA actuators is, however, more complicated since it not only depends on the SMA behaviour but also on the tube materials and the actuator construction. In this research, a simple end-state model for a tube-guided SMA actuator system is proposed. We measure and model both the SMA and tube material properties, including tube creep effects, and derive an approximate prediction for the actuator stroke. Validation experiments showed that the predicted stroke during the second heating and cooling experiments agreed well with the measurements and that the average deviation is 9.6\%, even though the deviation is much larger (27.3\%) for the maximum applied force.},

STFs are easily deformed under the action of a low shear rate. However, they instantly transform into a hard solid-like state at a high shear rate. After the removal of the impact force, STFs revert to their original liquid state. During this process, STFs absorb a significant amount of impact energy. Hence, they can be employed as a buffer and for vibration reduction. In this study, a comprehensive review of existing literature on STFs is presented. First, the basic properties, classification, and rheological mechanism evolution of STFs are discussed. The factors influencing the shear thickening behavior of these fluids are then reviewed. Subsequently, several computational models of the STF are discussed because the underlying mechanism of STF is still unclear, and to date, there is a paucity of good computational models. Finally, the research progress of composites based on STF in the fields of stab and spike resistance and low- and high-velocity impacts, and the use of STF as a new energy dissipation medium in the fields of explosion resistance, vibration control, adaptive structure, and industrial polishing are summarized.},

Multi-functional metasurfaces have shown magnificent potentials for many applications, including wireless communication, radar systems, and security. EM functions of metasurfaces can generally be switched or controlled by electrical or optical components, but these conventional tuning technologies suffer from complexity, high cost, and design limitations for large scales and function integration. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel thermal–mechanical anisotropic metasurface to provide multiple functionalities through mechanical transformation due to thermal stimulus on two shape memory alloy actuators, switching EM functionality between absorption and reflection. The absorptivity and reflectivity at 10.5 GHz are 96.5\% and 81.33\%, respectively. It consists of the motional metasurface and stational metasurface where mechanical transformation is achieved by the motional metasurface. In addition to the mechanical transformation, its function is switched depending on incident EM wave direction due to anisotropy that could achieved the transmission enhancement in ratio of 11.02 dB at operation frequency 5.9 GHz in opposing excitation. The proposed idea is numerically and experimentally demonstrated and discussed.},

In this work, a bulk high-entropy alloy (HEA) was implanted with nitrogen ions accelerated at 50 kV to induce and study crystal structural defects. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) showed that the studies HEA consisted of two phases—σ and body-centered cubic (BCC)—and underwent the σ to BCC phase transformation due to ion bombardment. Unexpectedly, XRD peaks of implanted samples could not be assigned to any known simple nitride, a finding that suggests the creation of new high- or medium-entropy ceramics. Studies of the mechanical and tribological properties with the use of nanoindentation and scratch tests revealed a hardening of both phases of the implanted surface and higher wear resistance. There were also surprising increases in the hardness-to-Young’s modulus ratio and elastic recovery for both phases. The results are promising not only for the nuclear applications, but also for space applications, mechanical engineering, and tribology.},

  abstract     = {The damage or penetration research of the long rods has attracted more and more attention from scholars worldwide. In this article, the dynamic compression tests of W-Zr reactive material are performed. Six experiments of the long rods impacting the multi-spaced plates at hypervelocity are carried out on a two-stage light gas gun. Two kinds of long rods, inert 40CrNi2MoA steel and W-Zr reactive material, are used. The initial impact speed ranges from 2040 m/s to 3200 m/s. According to results, W-Zr reactive material reacts at the strain rate of 2200 s −1 and higher, whose strength limit is related to the strain rate. The long rods can produce debris clouds when hitting the multi-spaced plates at the speed of 2040 m/s and higher, causing large perforation and great damaged area in the subsequent plates. The perforations and damaged areas of the multi-spaced plates depend on the specific kinetic energy of the long rods. The violent reaction behavior of the W-Zr reactive material helps to cause large perforation and damaged area of the subsequent plates than inert materials. It proves that the damage ability of the W-Zr reactive material is stronger than that of the inert material with a similar density.},

Therefore, this study focuses on the characterization and simulation of sputtering etched profile by Ga FIB on GaN substrate. First, the profile characterization experiments are carried out to analyze the influence of ion dose, dwelling time, and scan area, and the results reflect that the sputtering etched regularity on GaN substrate differs from that on Si substrate, especially in redeposition effect, milling rate, and droplet phenomenon. In addition, the forming mechanism of droplet phenomenon is discussed, and the milling experiments are conducted to research the droplets avoidance method, which shows that the appearance of droplets is impacted by ion dose and dwelling time. Finally, the sputtering yield of GaN under focused gallium ion beam is measured and sorted, and the simulation program is developed based on continuous cellular automaton (CCA) model. This work can provide a guidance for the further application of GaN-based materials.},

With introducing the solute A element into solvent B matrix, the solute A atoms will prefer to the certain sites of solvent B atoms in CPGA cluster. Setting a CPGA cluster consisted of solute A and solvent B atoms as the central cluster, Friedel oscillation perturbation of central cluster on surrounding CPGA clusters will be totally shielded along radial at the position of 3 times of size of central cluster. Then, CPGA unit clusters for fcc and bcc structure solid solution alloys are established, which consist of the central, nearest neighbor, and glue clusters. Take K type TCs as an example. The nominal and theoretical stable composition proportion for Ni-Cr/Ni-Si solid solution alloys are Ni 90 Cr 10 /Ni 97 Si 3 (wt.\%) and Ni 96.9 Si 3.1 /Ni 89.5 Cr 10.5 (wt.\%), which correspond well with each other.

  abstract     = {The gigantically unexplored chemical space for the combinations of donor and acceptor poses a mammoth challenge in enhancing power conversion efficiency. Herein, a strategy integrating machine learning and density functional theory was proposed to assist the rational screening of prominent donor/acceptor pairs. Notably, 10 promising donor/acceptor pairs were ultimately sieved out with power conversion efficiency lager than 18.22\%. Furthermore, the density functional theory computation expressed that the new donor/acceptor pair of D18/BTP-eC9 possessed stronger absorption intensity, while the K C S / K C R KCS/KCR (ratio of charge separation rate and charge recombination rate) and μ e μe (electron mobility) were larger than those of the best known D18/Y6 with the increments of 201.31\% and 125.98\% respectively. The SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed that the two most important features of A_nR08 and D_D/Dtr12 were positively related to the improvement of power conversion efficiency. It was found that A_nR08 was positively associated with π-conjugation strength, and high D_D/Dtr12 suggested the highly fused chemical structure, indicating the practical clues in discovering top-performing donor/acceptor pairs.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at reducing energy consumptions in data writing, the development of new memory materials is highly required. To develop new phase change materials (PCMs) with extremely low operation energy used in non-volatile memory, such as storage-class memory, we performed Bayesian optimization for the physical properties of PCMs through numerical simulations. In this numerical simulation, the electrical potential and temperature distribution were solved simultaneously. It was found that a PCM with low thermal conductivity, low melting temperature, and low ratio of contact resistance to volumetric resistance results in a low operation energy of a PCM-based memory application. Finally, we developed a design strategy for PCMs. New PCMs should be developed by lowering the operation energy E , described as E = κ (1 + C )Δ T /Δ z , where κ is the thermal conductivity of the PCM, Δ T is the melting temperature, C is the ratio of contact resistance to the volumetric resistance, and Δ z is the thickness of the PCM. The present results clarify the relationship between thermal and electrical properties for lowering operation energy ever hidden in previous studies. According to the design strategy, an operation energy in phase change memory application can be decreased to less than 1/100 compared with conventional Ge-Sb-Te compounds.},

Where these application envelopes are exceeded, TTR element insertion results in unacceptable levels of damage to both the composite and/or TTR elements. Here, we demonstrate that low-speed insertion of rigid reinforcements into heated prepreg preforms is a feasible and robust reinforcement process capable of providing accurate TTR element placement with minimal tow disturbance compared with existing methods for similar pin sizes. The insertion process is characterised with respect to insertion forces, and mesoscale laminate deformation/damage for carbon-benzoxazine prepreg preforms. The research investigates the influence of pin leading edge on insertion for a range of pin diameters (1.2, 1.5, and 2.0 mm) and preform consolidation states, describing low insertion forces and good quality laminate preforms. Insertion forces increase with pin diameter, typically resulting from increased pin-tow contact area and friction. Large diameter sizes and low insertion forces expand the range and forms of materials that can be inserted compared to existing TTR methods and show that this method can potentially be transferred to benefit work on composite hole creation, joining, and repair.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with the characterization of load-dependent dielectric loss and sensitivity analysis for CNT-based nanocomposite sensors (CNCSs) under AC loading. To this end, an electromechanically coupled microstructural theory is developed from the bottom up to quantitatively predict their overall dielectric loss change ratio and strain-sensitivity factor. In the theory, various categories of load-dependent functional interface effects, such as strain- and filler-dependent electron hopping and dielectric relaxation, are incorporated into it. The electric damage process under mechanical load is characterized through the principle of irreversible thermodynamics. The outcome is a microstructure-based coupled theory whose predictions of AC dielectric loss change ratio can be directly calibrated with the experimental data of MWCNT/PVDF nanocomposite sensor over a broad strain loading range from 0 to 10\% and a wide frequency spectrum from 5 kHz to 500 kHz, where PVDF is a shape memory polymer. The theory further demonstrates the advantage of demarcating CNCSs via the dielectric loss over the traditional electric resistance. It can be used to rapidly determine the macroscopic dielectric loss change ratio by choosing a specific CNT volume concentration and AC working frequency, and further simplify the design procedure of highly sensitive strain sensors.},

In order to observe in situ the internal damage of cement-based materials under hydraulic pressure, a new testing apparatus equipped with an X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-μCT) scanner is developed. The behaviors of water infiltration and strain development are evaluated for mortar specimens with different water-to-cement ratios. Although the internal damage of the mortar specimens under hydraulic pressure was not detected by the X-μCT scanner and fluorescent imaging, the mechanical properties tested after hydraulic pressure loadings were altered, indicative of the occurrence of microcracks (&lt;50 μm) below the resolution of these observation techniques. It is concluded that the internal damage of mortar specimens under hydraulic pressure is strongly influenced by two mechanisms: hydraulic pressure as a mechanism of external confinement and water infiltration as a mechanism of stress relaxation. The volumetric strain development due to hydraulic pressure varies greatly with location, owing to heterogeneous water infiltration in mortar. Therefore, the balance of these two mechanisms must be taken into account to assess the risk of internal damage of cement-based materials under hydraulic pressure.},

Two types of dendrite may undergo the so called-“smooth dendrite orientation transition”, which produces a large amount of solute segregation holes in 〈1 0 0〉 dendrites, and liquid grooves in 〈1 1 0〉 seaweed and butterfly patterns, thus may significantly impact the mechanical properties of castings. We identified a strong correlation between supersaturation and the formation of liquid holes and liquid grooves as well as the degree of solute segregation. We also proposed that the interfacial energy anisotropy can be related with Zn content by discussing the anisotropic Young’s modulus and experimental pattern of Al-Zn alloys. The inducement of anisotropy and the quantitative relationship between interfacial energy anisotropy, Zn concentration, elastic anisotropy and dendrite orientation deserves attention.},

During the filling process, the contact states between particles can be controlled by the number and positions of reference points. Taking the quasi-static uniaxial tensile simulation of concrete as a verification example, two concrete models with the same particle size distribution but different shapes have been established. Through the comparison of elastoplastic responses of different aggregate shape models in different tensile directions, it is concluded that the models meet the requirements of macroscopic uniformity, meso -scale randomness and statistical rationality.

The designed L-UHPC showed comparable or even superior functional and durability properties than normal-weight UHPC and high-performance cement mortar. The use of specified lightweight materials played prominent roles in ensuring the mechanical properties of L-UHPC.

After a brief introduction on the development of these prostheses and the associated problems, we describe the standard design of these systems. We review the different materials, constructions, and surfaces used in the development of femoral stems, in order to solve and avoid various problems associated with their use. Femoral stem prostheses have undergone substantial changes and design optimizations since their introduction. Common materials include stainless steel, cobalt–chromium alloy, titanium alloy, and composites. The structural development of femoral stem prostheses, including their length, shape, porosity, and functional gradient construction, is also reviewed. The performance of these prostheses is affected not only by individual factors, but also by the synergistic combination of multiple effects; therefore, several aspects need to be optimized. The main purpose of this study is to summarize various strategies for the material and construction optimization of femoral stem prostheses, and to provide a reference for the combined optimization of their performance. Substantial research is still needed to develop prostheses emulating the behavior of a real human femoral stem.},

  abstract     = {3D-printed bioscaffolds for the realization of individualized tissue regeneration remains challenging due to the limitation in terms of current biomaterial inks. Exploring a universal ink modifier to enhance the properties of the arbitrary inks for 3D printing of multi-functional scaffolds is therefore an alternative. Herein, a universally dispersible graphene oxide-based polyurethane (GO-PU) ink modifier with network structure constituting amphiphilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) and nanoscale GO (nGO) is presented for the first time. GO-PU can be stably dispersed in various organic and aqueous solutions for 24 h without obvious aggregation, far superior to pure nGO. The excellent printability of GO-PU is demonstrated to fabricate pure GO-PU and GO-PU modified composite scaffolds in which GO-PU is used as ink modifiers. The addition of GO-PU with 5\% (ww\%/wt\%) contents into PLGA or PEGDA can not only improve their mechanical properties without decrease printability, but also endow the additional performances with the resulting scaffolds from the incorporated functional nGO segments, like photo-triggered release ability. In addition, the results of in vitro and in vivo toxicity tests confirmed that GO-PU is biocompatible, indicating that this facile and universal approach for introducing graphene materials into 3D-printed scaffolds is with a great potential for tissue regeneration.},

An increasing number of studies have shown that the use of biomaterials has great advantages in regulating tissue repair, with lower cost and risk than the use of cytokines or cells. However, great challenges remain because of the marked differences between cartilage and subchondral bone. Here, biphasic osteochondral scaffolds with layer-specific differentiation were designed and developed. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was used as the matrix in the upper and lower layers, and differences in physicochemical properties and biological properties between the two layers were realized by different chemical crosslinking methods. The cartilage regeneration layer exhibited stress relaxation from the HA hydrazone crosslinking dynamics. Additionally, a porous HA hydrogel with dominant elasticity was prepared for subchondral bone repair. Importantly, a 3D-printed scaffold bracket could keep close integration of two layers and provided mechanical support, aiding the long-term tissue regeneration process. The in vitro and in vivo results indicated that the HA-base bilayer scaffold consisting of a dynamic HA layer and a porous HA layer realized the simultaneous integrated regeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Such scaffolds represent potential new materials for osteochondral regeneration.},

Although some Sn 2+ -based pyrochlore-type oxides ( A 2 B 2 O 7 ) with VBMs comprising spatially spread Sn 5 s orbitals show p-type semiconducting properties, these properties cannot be tuned by an intentional chemical doping owing to the instability of their valence states. Herein, the influence of chemical doping on the crystal structure and electrical properties of Bi 2 Sn 2 O 7 , whose VBM is composed of valence-stable ions with Bi 6 s orbitals, in the VBM is investigated. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that In 3+ is doped substitutionally at the Sn 4+ site. Although the doped In 3+ ions are expected to act as acceptors, their electrical properties always show n-type character. Simultaneously, extended X-ray absorption fine structure reveals the formation of oxygen vacancies in Bi O Bi bonds contributing to the VBM, whereas negligible changes are observed in the SnO 6 octahedra, suggesting that the generated holes are electrically compensated by electrons because of the oxygen vacancies. P-type electric properties can be observed under oxidizing conditions, providing a critical design concept for the realization of hole conduction in acceptor-doped Bi 2 Sn 2 O 7 .},

It causes distortion of the samples when removing them from the build plate, as well as acting detrimental with regard to fatigue. The understanding of how residual stresses in a printed sample are affected by process parameters is crucial to allow manufacturers to tune their process parameters, or the design of their component, to limit the negative influence of residual stresses. In this paper, residual stresses in additive manufactured samples are simulated using a thermo-mechanical finite element model. The elasto-plastic behavior of the material is described by a mechanism-based material model that accounts for microstructural and relaxation effects. The heat source in the finite element model is calibrated by fitting the model to experimental data. The residual stress field from the finite element model is compared with experimental results attained from synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. The results from the model and measurement give the same trend in the residual stress field. In addition, it is shown that there is no significant difference in trend and magnitude of the resulting residual stresses for an alternation in laser power and scanning speed.},

In addition, possible structural changes as a function of MY content have not been reported. Using pulsed neutron diffraction, high-energy X-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy and FPMD modeling, we show unexpected role of silver halides as unconventional modifiers taking two contrasting glass compositions: (AgI) 0.1 (As 2 S 3 ) 0.9 (critical percolation domain) and (AgBr) 0.5 (As 2 S 3 ) 0.5 (modifier-controlled region) as an example. The latter alloy seems to be a promising precursor for thermoelectric applications.

Especially the latter one is considered to control the frequently observed orientation dependent fracture toughness. A question that arises thereby is how the fracture properties for certain testing directions could be actively tuned by tailoring the grain aspect ratio. In this contribution this issue has been investigated by changing the aspect ratio of ultrafine-grained tantalum processed by high pressure torsion through post-rolling operations which induced a substantial increase of the grain length while keeping the strength on a comparable level. Samples in interesting testing directions were manufactured and tested. The increase of the aspect ratio results in the technically significant testing directions to an enhancement of the fracture toughness. Delamination toughening, which is promoted by the change of the aspect-ratio, has been indentified to be the main cause for the toughness enhancement and represents therefore a feasible pathway for optimizing the damage tolerance of SPD-processed materials.},

Integration of this novel technology into the construction industry, however, requires the development of a clear understanding of the mechanical behaviour of WAAM materials. To this end, a comprehensive experimental study into the mechanical properties and microstructure of WAAM plates made of normal- and high-strength steels has been undertaken and is reported herein. A total of 137 as-built and machined tensile coupons were tested, extracted in various directions relative to the print layer orientation from WAAM plates of two nominal thicknesses, built using different deposition strategies. The influence of the geometric undulations inherent to the WAAM process and deposition strategy on the resulting mechanical properties was investigated. Microstructural characterisation was also performed by means of optical microscopy (OM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The WAAM normal-strength steel plates exhibited a principally ferritic-pearlitic microstructure, while the WAAM high-strength steel plates displayed a mixed microstructure featuring ferrite, bainite and martensite. The EBSD analysis revealed a weak crystallographic texture, which explained the observed mechanical properties being almost isotropic. No significant differences in tensile properties were observed with the different deposition strategies, except for some variation in ductility. The geometric undulations of the as-built coupons resulted in some reduction in effective mechanical properties and a degree of anisotropy. Overall, the examined WAAM material exhibited consistent mechanical properties, a Young’s modulus comparable to conventionally-produced steel plates, marginally lower strength, reflecting the slower cooling conditions than is customary, and good ductility.},

The design advantages granted by additive manufacturing (AM) processes coupled with their capacity for in-situ production of composite materials are yet to be exploited in the realm of Al-transition metal dichalcogenides composites. In this work, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was deployed for the in-situ fabrication of Al-WS 2 composites for the first time, elucidating the process-structure–property relationships in comparison to reference spark plasma sintering (SPS) samples. The WS 2 response to the respective fabrication technique was also firstly investigated through a holistic characterisation. The formation of new phases (W for LPBF, Al 5 W and Al 12 W for SPS) provided the potential for microstructural tailoring for optimal tribological performance. For tribological properties, LPBF Al-WS 2 exhibited a coefficient of friction (COF) 0.55 ± 0.01 and specific wear rate 3.4 ± 0.3 × 10 −3 mm 3 /N∙m, slightly better than the SPS counterpart (COF 0.57 ± 0.02, specific wear rate 3.6 ± 0.3 × 10 −3 mm 3 /N∙m). Furthermore, a novel methodology for studying the evolution of worn surfaces is proposed and validated, by which a tribo-layer formed at lower friction cycles was observed for the LPBF samples, meaning that AM will also be advantageous for the performance aspect of self-lubricating materials.},

Here samples were additively manufactured using Ti6Al4V. Compared to original triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) based lattices, the curvature distribution spectrum was largely broadened, and negative curvatures were introduced by both LST (generating symmetrical curvature distribution) and RST (generating asymmetrical curvature distribution). Additionally, LST and RST can continuously adjust the Young’s modulus of the original lattice and obtain a drop up to 90\% with 0.3 vol fraction, which can be expected to match soft trabecular bones. Interestingly, the resulting structures show elastic anisotropy and slip-induced deformation. The proposed approaches can be applied to biomedical applications and used to adjust lattice properties for use in energy, aerospace, and optics.},

Along this line, the past decade has witnessed an increased interest in Origami inspired engineering, where it was shown that foldable and spatially-expandable structures with rich kinematics and unconventional Poisson’s ratio can be created using different Origami patterns. Among those, the Kresling Origami pattern has inspired the design of springs with nonconventional properties. Here, we develop a representative shell-based finite element model for predicting the quasi-static mechanical behavior of a class of 3D printed Kresling Origami springs. We validate the model against experimental data, then use it to generate maps that demarcate regions in the design parameter space into qualitatively different behaviors of the springs. We show that, depending on their design parameters, the springs can exhibit a linear elastic behavior; a nonlinear elastic softening/hardening mono-stable behavior; quasi-zero stiffness behavior; or even a bi-stable behavior. The modularity of these springs, their tunability, and the ability to combine them permits architecturing metamaterials with tunable constitutive laws, which could potentially revolutionize the design of shock absorbers and cushion materials.},

However, the reversible phase transformation producing its exceptional comportment is also responsible for a number of phenomena that make its mechanical characterisation particularly complex, by hindering the assumptions at the very basis of common uniaxial tensile testing. This necessarily reduces the level of safety and design optimization of current applications, which rely on incorrect mechanical parameters. In this study, the spurious effects introduced by the unconventional material behaviour during uniaxial tensile testing are analysed by means of digital image correlation (DIC), identifying the onset of undesirable material inhomogeneities and bending moments that are dependent on the test setup and strongly limit the reliability of standard characterisation. Hence, a more accurate and systematic testing approach, exploiting the ability of DIC to analyse the local mechanical response at specific regions of the test specimen, is presented and discussed.},

Using a numerical FEA modeling simulation and experimental method, the effectiveness of the optimized joining structure was validated. The stress concentration in the joints under three-point-bending test was significantly reduced in comparison to that of the traditional flat and zigzag joints, and the flexural strength was greatly improved by 120\% to 143\% compared with that of the zigzag joint.

  abstract     = {Oral administration remains the main treatment for H. pylori infection, but the acidic environment of the stomach, the biofilm and drug resistance of H. pylori severely impair the antibacterial effect of orally clinical drugs. Here, a multifunctional nanodrug, composed of rhamnolipid-assisted black phosphorus nanocomposite (RHL@BP), is engineered for drug resistant H. pylori ( H. pylori-R) treatment. The nanosystem is utilized to efficiently deliver isolinderalactone (ISL), a kind of sesquiterpenoids compound purified from traditional Chinese medicine, exhibiting significantly enhanced antibacterial ability against H. pylori-R under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. The acid sensitivity of BP and photothermal instability of RHL could trigger the controlled and efficient release of ISL, exhibiting significant synergistic antibacterial activity against H. pylori-R in combined with NIR irradiation. In an H. pylori-R infected mice model, the amount of remnant H. pylori-R in the combination of RHL@BP/ISL and NIR irradiation without antacid group was significantly lower than that of in the conventional triple therapy group ( P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the multifunctional RHL@BP/ISL demonstrated a comprehensive application of acid sensitivity, biofilm eradication, antibacterial agent and photothermal to treat H. pylori-R , providing a newly potential strategy for clinical treatment of H. pylori-R infections.},

  abstract     = {Interface engineering is a significant strategy to develop structural materials with good properties. In this study, bulk V/Cu nano-multilayers with different layer thicknesses were fabricated by cross accumulative roll bonding (CARB). Interface stability of V/Cu nano-multilayers with different layer thicknesses and their effects on thermal conductivity and helium irradiation have been explored. The microstructure analysis, tensile and hardness tests result show that V/Cu nano-multilayers maintain high mechanical properties and good thermal stability after annealing at 500 °C for 1 h. However, the strength drastically degrades after higher-temperature annealing because of microstructure instability, which is closely related to the aspect ratio of grains. Furthermore, spheroidization occurring in multilayer during the annealing process promotes efficient electron transportation and weakens electron scattering, which benefits the increase of thermal conductivity. The irradiation response of V/Cu nano-multilayers was explored by helium bombardment with a fluence of 1 × 10 17 ions/cm 2 at room temperature and 500 °C, respectively. Helium bubbles transform to gas cavities with increasing irradiated temperature, and different morphology of cavities at heterointerface, newly formed grain boundaries and triple junctions is attributed to the defect diffusion preference combined with thermal-induced interfaces migration.},

Homogenization of fungal biomass was done by an iterative ultrafine grinding process. Finally, the biomass was cast into films by a wet-laid process. Ultrafine grinding resulted in densification of the films. Fungal films showed tensile strengths of up to 18.1 MPa, a Young’s modulus of 2.3 GPa and a strain at break of 1.4\%. Highest tensile strength was achieved using alkali treatment, with SEM analysis showing a dense and highly organized structure. In contrast, less organized structures were obtained using enzymatic or heat treatments. A cell viability assay and fluorescent staining confirmed the biocompatibility of the films.

The density and morphology of pores, phase fractions, prior-β grains, and defect microstructures were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray computed tomography, electron backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy before and after deformation. The results were used to evaluate the relative importance of each feature on strengthening, deformation, and failure initiation mechanisms. Results focused primarily on coarse-powder EBM materials indicated that phase distribution and defect density were most influential for determining material yield strength as well as maximum possible strain to failure. Porosity was lower overall in EBM Ti-6Al-4 V than in SLM, allowing for occasional increases in part strain to failure, but remained a limiting factor determining overall part ductility.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials can enable the design of exotic properties, including the mechanical coupling of different loading modes. Chirality and non-centrosymmetry are known to play essential roles in the rational design of coupling effects. However, there is no theoretical support for the design of coupling behaviors based on the constitutive behavior of lattice structures. Exploring a planar non-centrosymmetric square lattice, we find a novel coupling effect: a compression-induced bending, which a micropolar continuum model can support. Observing the micropolar constitutive equation of a 2D lattice, we find that non-centrosymmetry is necessary but insufficient for designing an axial–bending coupling. The micropolar homogenization is adopted to calculate the material properties of infinite lattices, revealing that the axial-bending coupling coefficient is dependent on the cell size, which is verified by finite element simulations. The axial–bending coupling size effect of finite lattices shows different deformation patterns depending on the cell size and the magnitude of external loading. The novel coupling effect can expand the design space of metamaterials with potential applications in multidirectional mechanical actuators and mechanical logic gates for biomedical, automobile, and aerospace devices.},

In order to determine the influence of element diffusion on the phase formation and transition behavior in a high-entropy alloy (HEA), a systematic study on the reactive diffusion of Al and a CoCrFeNi HEA was carried out. It is demonstrated that thermodynamic and kinetic effects play a coupled role in the phase evolution in the HEA, among which the thermodynamic effect governs the evolution of major phases. The diffusion direction of the elements is controlled by the Gibbs free energy gradient in front of the interface, while the sluggish diffusion effect does not play a dominant role during reactive diffusion. At an annealing temperature of 773 K, the enthalpy of mixing dominates the total energy and therefore has a significant impact on the phase evolution during reactive diffusion.},

The distribution of the magnetic vector loss and electric vector loss in the hierarchical structures was revealed by numerical simulation. The content and dispersion of magnetic particles as well as the morphology of the amorphous carbon can be tuned. The 3D amorphous carbon matrix with highly dispersed Fe/Fe 3 C@graphite-C nanoparticles provided the strongest absorption of −69.0 dB and an effective response bandwidth (RL ≤ −10 dB) of 7.06 GHz. The numerical simulation revealed that the magnetic vector loss originated only from the core of Fe/Fe 3 C, and the electric vector loss was distributed throughout the structure, especially in the graphite-C shell, the interface between graphite-C and carbon nanoflakes, and the junction of different carbon nanoflakes. This work not only reveals the distribution of electromagnetic loss but also supports the theoretical analysis of the electromagnetic wave attenuation mechanism in composites, which provides direction for the future design of composites.},

The overlapped nodes of struts are considered in the theoretical model due to their excessive strut thickness. The analytical results exhibit good agreement with the numerical and experimental results. The effects of the geometric parameters, internal force species, and hierarchical magnitude on the elastic property are carefully studied. The findings suggest that the axial internal force in the new structure inhibits its auxetic effects in the three principal directions. Compared with the traditional three-dimensional re-entrant lattice with equal relative density, the vertex-based hierarchical one exhibits more comprehensive designability of auxetic effect and enables higher Young’s modulus with specific geometrical parameters.

The results obtained from high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis revealed that the combined effect of crack branching behavior and amorphous film made contributions to the slower crack growth rate. The aggressive Cl − ions invaded grain in multi-directions that was promoted by dislocation motion, facilitating the main crack to bifurcate. Besides, nanocrystals also enhanced branching behavior by deflecting the crack growth path. An amorphous film forming in crack evolved from the disorder of atom arrangement produced by dislocation accumulation and grew stably with the supplement of carbon atom generated in selective corrosion.

  abstract     = {Selective surface densification (SSD) can greatly improve the mechanical properties of powder metallurgical (P/M) parts with low additional costs. This work proposes a new surface vibration extrusion process to make up for some drawbacks of the existing SSD processes as far as possible. The surface densification effect and mechanism, as well as mechanical properties of the surface extruded P/M Fe-Mo-Cu-C steel with and without vibration assistance, are comparatively investigated. Following a small surface extrusion processing via a simple extrusion die, the surface of the vibration extruded P/M steel is more thoroughly and uniformly densified under a lower extrusion load when compared with the directly extruded P/M steel. This can be attributed to the vibration assistance facilitating the dislocation motion and metal flow. The high surface-densified layer is achieved, with depth up to 530 μm slightly superior to some commercial SSD parts. Moreover, approximately twice the surface hardness is obtained compared with the hardness before the extrusion. Lastly, superior friction and wear properties are achieved.

  abstract     = {Atherosclerotic plaques and thrombosis are chronic inflammatory complications and the main manifestations of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the leading cause of death globally. Achieving non/minimal-invasive therapeutic means for these implications in the coronary network is vital and has become an interdisciplinary concern. Accordingly, smart drug delivery systems, specifically based on micro- and nanoparticles , as a promising method to offer non/minimal-invasive therapeutic mechanisms are under active research. Notably, computational models enable us to study, design, and predict treatment strategies based on smart drug delivery systems with less time and cost compared with conventional procedures in interventional cardiology. Also, the optimisation and development of computational methods and models have created a broad and practical insight into patient-specific drug design and therapeutic interventions. This review discusses the most recent works on the transport, dynamics, and delivery of particles as drug carriers to target thrombus, inflamed surfaces, and atherosclerotic plaques. Towards understanding and producing optimised particle-based cardiovascular drug delivery systems, this review conveys an original and multifaceted image on the modelling for drug carrier design.},

  abstract     = {A predictive design, analysis, and optimization tool that quickly and accurately captures the frequency response of locally resonant metamaterials is presented. A reduced order model based on a discrete spring-mass system is used to relate the structural parameters of a unit cell to frequency response, intended for optimizing for the unit cell structure with the widest longitudinal stop band at a desired center frequency. Design maps that relate geometric parameters to performance metrics are assembled, from which optimized unit cells or paths for enhanced functionality can be identified. The method can be augmented to examine all vibration modes or extended to multi-dimensional wave propagation, such as shear or oblique waves. The practicality of the design maps is demonstrated through two examples. First, actual 3D printed size and material limitations are imposed onto the design maps to bound a physically realizable design space. The identified optimal geometry has the maximum gap width at the desired center frequency within the bounds. The second example utilizes tunable, filled resin systems to expand the design space through material variations. Multi-material unit cells fabricated with frames and resonators having different material properties are predicted to provide better performance than cells consisting of a single material.},

  abstract     = {Sintering, as a post-processing step in metal binder jetting (MBJ), often results in distortion. Numerical simulations can predict sintering distortion and minimize costly trial-and-error experiments. The present paper implements a numerical approach based on a phenomenological model of sintering to capture the creep deformation during free sintering. To qualify and calibrate the material model for MBJ, metallographic studies, dilatometry experiments, and viscosity measurements are carried out instead of empirical models for viscosity and sinter stress. Using the calibrated material model, final sintering distortions are predicted in two industry-relevant parts. The reproducibility of MBJ products is illustrated by manufacturing seven specimens for each geometry, and a statistical method to evaluate the simulations’ accuracy is suggested. The predictions have a good agreement with experimental results, particularly for specimens with a lower build height. As the build height increases in MBJ specimens, the number of interlayer gaps in the build direction grows, resulting in anisotropic densification. This causes a lower prediction accuracy under isotropic shrinkage assumption, especially in overhang areas. Consideration of anisotropic shrinkage and heterogeneous density distribution of green parts in sintering simulation is essential to improve the accuracy of sintering predictions for MBJ components.},

  abstract     = {With the ever-increasing demand for plastic structural components, the development of lightweight plastics is critical for environmental protection and reduced material consumption. Foam injection molding exhibits promise for manufacturing lightweight products, and hence, could be explored for the fabrication of foamed polypropylene (PP) parts. However, it is challenging to fabricate high-performance foam-injection-molded polypropylene (FIM-PP) foams due to the low melt strength of PP. Herein, we have proposed a novel method to prepare lightweight and strong ternary-blended PP foams with enhanced flame retardancy by incorporating in situ-fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and talc. The PTFE nanofibrils and talc effectively improved the melt viscoelasticity and crystallization of PP; hence, both, regular and mold-opening foam-injection-molded (MOFIM) ternary-blended PP foams, exhibited refined cellular structures. Furthermore, the MOFIM-PP/Talc/PTFE foam exhibited remarkable mechanical performance, including a 341\% increase in the tensile toughness, 408\% increase in the notched impact strength, and 121\% increase in the flexural strength, which were attributed to the enhanced brittle-to-plastic transition by PTFE nanofibrils and the refined cellular structure. These advantages, combined with the enhanced flame retardancy of the MOFIM-PP/Talc/PTFE foam, make this method cost-efficient, scalable, and green to manufacture lightweight and strong PP foams, thereby broadening the application scope of PP in structural components.},

  abstract     = {Comprehensive mechanical properties (high strength, good fatigue resistance and tunable stiffness) are significant for large and load-bearing implants, but still remain a challenge in practical applications. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK)-Ti6Al4V interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) with comprehensive mechanical properties were developed using a two-step process: fabricating Ti6Al4V microlattices using powder bed fusion (PBF) and subsequently manufacturing PEEK-Ti6Al4V IPCs using vacuum infiltration. The strut defects in the Ti6Al4V microlattices induced by PBF process were filled with PEEK , and thus excellent interfacial connection was achieved. Mechanical tests, under both quasi-static loading conditions (compression and three-point bending conditions) and dynamic loading condition (three-point bending condition), were carried out on the PEEK-Ti6Al4V composites with low and high modulus (20.0 and 60.0 vol\% Ti6Al4V) and the bare Ti6Al4V microlattices of equivalent elastic moduli. It was found that the composites had higher compressive and flexural strengths than the lattices. Moreover, the composites exhibited higher fatigue strength and longer fatigue life than the lattices. The fracture behaviors and the FEM simulation results revealed that the enhancing mechanisms for the PEEK-Ti6Al4V composites can be the alleviation of strut deformation and the resistance to crack propagation. Thus, the PEEK-Ti6Al4V composites can be promising materials for large and load-bearing implants.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports on a novel technique of a bearing load monitoring based on the use of smart sensor coating. For easier process and integration, screen printing is carried out to achieve multilayered thin film deposited on an outer bearing or a simple flat steel substrate. The formulation of piezoelectric ink is relied on the development of a UV curable barium titanate/polyurethane acrylate (BaTiO 3 /PUA) composite. A new design is proposed to enhance the sensitivity of the smart coating, which consists of three stacked layers: piezocomposite layer, dielectric layer (if needed), and conductive layer including electrodes and conductive tracks (CT). On one hand, the dimensions of the coating electrodes are revealed to be critical to the sensing performance. On the other hand, the CT has small impact on the piezoelectric measurement. As a result, no dielectric treatment is required between the composite and the conductive layers, leading to simplified printing process. Full characterizations of dielectric and mechanical properties, together with direct sensing measurement through electromechanical coupling are investigated on the home-made structure. Analytical and finite element models are developed to predict the mechanical properties of the tested substrate as well as the sensor sensitivity under different applied loads. Experiments are conducted on a 4-point bending (4 PB) setup, allowing to validate the analytical and numerical solutions. Good agreement between the model-predicted sensor outputs and the empirical measurements are observed, confirming high reliability of the proposed approach. It is eventually pointed out that the piezoelectric smart coating has higher sensitivity and easier integration than classical piezoresistive technology. Indeed, the printed sensor is capable to provide a direct voltage signal instead of a traditional strain gage where signal conditioning is needed. Accordingly, piezoelectric sensing together with printing technology could offer an efficient method for on-line and in situ monitoring of bearing.},

  abstract     = {Since 2021, cobalt (Co) is in Europe classified as carcinogen in quantities exceeding 0.1 wt-\%. This affects nickel-rich stainless steels, which contain about 0.2 wt-\% Co impurities. Previous findings show the bioaccessibility of Co in stainless steel to be primarily determined by the corrosion resistance. It has been unclear whether Co is distributed heterogeneously in the alloy and the outermost surface and whether a specific location would pose a risk for Co release under specific exposure conditions. This study aimed at locating Co in stainless steel 316L (0.2 wt-\% Co) surfaces prior to and after exposure to different synthetic body fluids for 24 h at 37 °C. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) investigated the location of Co in the surface oxide and extent of release along with other metals (iron, chromium, nickel, and manganese) into synthetic biological fluids (gastric fluid, pH 1.5; lysosomal fluid, pH 4.5; phosphate buffered saline-PBS, pH 7.4). Co was homogeneously distributed along with metallic nickel beneath the surface oxide and co-released with other metals upon surface reformation and passivation.

TNT were attached to PU with a new strategy. The resulting flexible structure was hydrophilic and super hydrophilic in OE-TNT-PU and CE-TNT-PU scaffolds, respectively.

The results revealed that the rate of endothelialization of the OE-TNT-PU scaffold vs pure PU scaffolds was 2 times greater after 5 days of in vitro cell culture. In addition, the number of platelets and their agglomeration on the newly designed scaffolds were much lower than those of PU scaffolds.

This paper investigated the thermal behavior of BCFB glass and its wettability on YIG. The microstructural evolution, mechanical and electromagnetic properties of YIG/YIG joint were systematically studied. CoFe 2 O 4 nuclei were gradually formed, growing up into nano-scale CoFe 2 O 4 crystals in the glass seam. Meanwhile, some CoFe 2 O 4 crystals grew up excessively by swallowing nano CoFe 2 O 4 , reaching microns. YBO 3 reaction layer was formed and grew into YBO 3 whiskers at the interface of YIG/glass with the brazing temperature increasing. The joint shear strength increased, reaching a maximum of 85.2 MPa at 775 °C under the collaborative reinforcement of well-integrated interface and glass-ceramic seam, then declined due to the aggravative reaction. The dielectric constant of YIG/YIG joints decreased with the brazing temperature increasing, varying from 18.5 to 16.6 at the frequency of 10 MHz.

Here, the Cu-Ti-Zr-Ni family, also known as Vitreloy 101, is systematically investigated for processing of the PBF-LB/M powder itself. Gas atomization was used to produce powder of Vit101 and derivates micro-alloyed with Si and Sn. The influence of atomization and alloy composition on glass formation, oxygen content, particle morphology, and flowability were investigated. Amorphous powder was successfully obtained using industrial-grade purity as feedstock for the atomization. The oxygen content within the powder was controlled by the surface-to-volume ratio, without significant influence of the different atomization parameters and the microalloying itself. The powder displayed high circularity with sufficient flowability after drying. Our results contribute to the investigation of Vitreloy 101 alloys as promising candidates for PBF-LB/M applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an alternative to traditional laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), using an efficient, highly scalable multi-laser additive manufacturing methodology known as Diode Area Melting (DAM). DAM integrates multiple individually addressable low power fibre coupled diode lasers into a laser head, these traverse across a powder bed to melt powdered feedstock. The highly scalable and compact diode lasers operate at a shorter wavelength and lower powers compared to traditional LPBF fibre lasers, enabling a more efficient energy absorption, with an increase of up to 14\%. In this study, a bespoke multi-laser head was used to process Ti6Al4V powder using ten 5 W 808 nm diode lasers simultaneously. Multi-layer parts were produced with a maximum density of 98\% with variable beam profiles shown to greatly influence melt pool formation, microstructure and mechanical performance (4–5 GPa hardness and elastic moduli up to 120 GPa). DAM was able to generate lower cooling rates than traditional LPBF systems (600 °C/s compared to 10 7 °C/s), with variable beam profiles altering grain size and promoting the development of a β phase within components.},

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is considered to be an effective and simple technique for the synthesis of monolayer MoS 2 thin films. However, the controlled growth of large size single-crystalline monolayer MoS 2 is still a challenge. This work presents controlled growth of large-area monolayer MoS 2 using evaporated Mo films pretreated with NaCl solution. The maximum size of the monolayer MoS 2 flake can reach 300 μm, which could be obtained by optimizing the mass concentration of NaCl solution. In addition, the study also reveals that an appropriate increase of NaCl concentration can affect the edge growth rate of sulfur and molybdenum, thus affecting the relative stability of the growth mode of the crystal. This provides new insight and research direction for the specific mechanism of fractal growth, which can also be used for the controllable growth of MoS 2 with high-density Mo-terminated edges for catalytic applications.},

  abstract     = {Grain boundary structures with high resistance to intergranular fracture are the target of grain boundary design. In this work, grain boundary elimination in front of crack tip is observed in two special bcc iron bicrystals through molecular dynamics simulations under mode I loading. Grain boundary elimination depends on crack advance direction and enhances resistance to intergranular fracture. Direction-dependent elimination leads to directional anisotropy of intergranular crack propagation. By analytical analysis and molecular dynamics simulation, grain boundary elimination is found to be attributed to the activities of twinning and dislocation. All twinning bands are formed by atomic slip along ordinary twinning direction, but all dislocations are nucleated by atomic slip along anti-twinning direction. Mechanisms of twinning formation and dislocation nucleation are revealed by calculating energy barriers of atomic slip and shear stress field. According to the mechanism of grain boundary elimination, conditions for grain boundary elimination are proposed to find all special grain boundaries. Results show that twist grain boundaries cannot be eliminated under mode I loading, while tilt grain boundaries with axes of 〈 110 〉 〈110〉 can. This work provides a good reference for grain boundary design.},

This paper proposes a low-plasticity ultrasonic rolling strengthening process (URSP) to improve the surface micro-morphology and residual stress of NNS blades. The surface micro-morphology and residual stress formation mechanisms produced by the low-plasticity URSP were introduced first. Then, the influences of the low-plasticity URSP parameters on the surface micro-morphology and residual stress were analyzed. Furthermore, the feasibility of low-plasticity URSP was analyzed through comparative experiments. Finally, the mechanism of low-plasticity URSP was further demonstrated from two aspects of surface micro-morphology and the residual stress. The results showed that increases in the extrusion depth improved the blade surface micro-morphology and residual stress level. The blade had a surface roughness of Ra 0.2 µm after low-plasticity URSP. A residual compressive stress layer of about 70 µm was formed on the blade surface, and the residual stress first increased and then decreased with the increase in depth. The maximum residual stress was 800 MPa when the residual stress layer depth was 30 µm, and the residual stress was close to that of the base material until the depth reached 70 µm.},

In this work, the transformations taking place at different temperatures in this alloy were investigated with the aim of achieving the necessary knowledge to customize the mechanical properties via heat treatments. Martensite decomposition, residual stress relaxation and the β-transus temperature were identified at progressively increasing temperatures. Then, different annealing treatments, corresponding to the temperatures identified, were conducted. For each condition, dissimilar α + β microstructures were obtained, varying in terms of morphology (lamellar, bi-lamellar) and size of the α laths (0.5–2.2 µm). The corresponding tensile properties were also significantly different. In particular, outstanding strength values were achieved when the residual stress was retained. For higher temperatures, a slight drop in strength was coupled with an outstanding improvement in terms of ductility. Overall, the most balanced combination of tensile properties was obtained for an annealing temperature of 875 °C. In this condition, the bi-lamellar microstructure grants a reduction in the slip length due to the presence of secondary α laths.},

However, compared with single-wire AM technology, it faces a more complex droplet transition pattern, which is closely related to the feeding modes of the elemental wires. In the current work, the effect of wire feeding methods on the droplet transition mode, the morphology, composition, and mechanical properties is for the first time systematically studied. Three wire feeding methods, including double-side-feeding, single-side-feeding, and parallel-feeding, were adopted to fabricate the Ti-Al-Nb intermetallics in-situ. The results show that the TiNb wire and pure-Al wire enter the molten pool separately and with a totally inconsistent droplet transition mode in the double-side-feeding and single-side-feeding methods. This droplet transition results in poor morphology, macro-segregation, and inconsistent mechanical properties. While in the parallel-feeding method, the TiNb and Al droplet transfer to the molten pool after forming a common droplet, which provides a better guarantee for the morphology and performance of the deposited parts. As a research oriented to the deposition process, the current work is of great significance for enriching the fundamental theory and promoting the development of the wire-based in-situ AM technology.},

In this work, the meltpool temperature was controlled by modulating the laser power based on feedback signals from a coaxial two-wavelength imaging pyrometer. The utility of closed-loop control in DED is demonstrated in the context of practically inspired trapezoid-shaped stainlesssteel parts (SS 316L). We demonstrate that parts built under closed-loop control have reduced variation in porosity and uniform microstructure compared to parts built under open-loop conditions. For example, post-process characterization showed that closed-loop processed parts had a volume percent porosity ranging from 0.036\% to 0.043\%. In comparison, open-loop processed parts had a larger variation in volume percent porosity ranging from 0.032\% to 0.068\%. Further, parts built with closed-loop processing depicted consistent dendritic microstructure. By contrast, parts built with open-loop processing showed microstructure heterogeneity with the presence of both dendritic and planar grains, which in turn translated to large variation in microhardness .},

  abstract     = {Pure molybdenum produced by additive laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes has a coarse, epitaxially-grown columnar grain structure with cracks located at high-angle grain boundaries, which are embrittled through oxygen segregation. The tensile strength of these pure molybdenum specimens is only 50 MPa, or 11\% of the strength of powder metallurgically sintered, deformed, and recrystallized molybdenum. Alloying molybdenum with carbon can reduce cracks, increase density to 99.5\%, and thus increase tensile strength to 650 MPa. The addition of carbon prevents embrittled grain boundaries and high residual porosity by outgassing oxygen, trapping any residual oxygen in the oxygen-soluble Mo 2 C carbide, and increasing the grain boundary surface on which the oxygen is distributed. In this study, we investigated the grain size, tensile strength, and hardness of five different molybdenum-carbon alloys produced via LPBF at constant process parameters. Our alloys ranged from pure molybdenum to 2.2 wt\% carbon, which corresponds to a near-eutectic composition. In the absence of extrinsic nucleant particles in the melt, the relationship between grain size and solute concentration—and thus the growth restriction factor—follows an inverse exponential Arrhenius-type equation. We attributed grain refinement at higher carbon contents to increasing thermal and constitutional supercooling. The supercooling allows grains to nucleate and grow on the underlying solidified layer, where the fastest growth direction 〈1 0 0〉 is better aligned to the thermal gradient than that of the epitaxially growing grains.},

An essential physical issue influencing LPBF is metal vaporization, and there has been much dispute regarding the occurrence and influence of metal vaporization during LPBF. The latest in-situ X-ray imaging results directly demonstrated the occurrence of massive vaporization based on the widespread presence of keyholes under typical LPBF conditions. In this study, a comprehensive review of metal vaporization during LPBF was conducted, in terms of its influence and underlying mechanism, as well as numerical simulations. Metal vaporization was found to be primarily dependent on the temperature of the melt pool and the surrounding atmosphere, and to substantially influence the transfer of energy, momentum, and mass during the process. Critical formation problems, such as powder denudation, plume, spatter, lack of fusion, and porosity were closely related to metal vaporization. An adequate energy input and optimized shielding atmosphere were found to be necessary to inhibit the negative influence of metal vaporization. Moreover, the vaporization by-products could be used for quality monitoring, and the vaporization loss of elements could be quantitatively adjusted to regulate the compositional distribution.},

This study focusses on the micro-mechanical behavior of fused silica micropillars at high temperatures and variable strain rates. 160 micropillars with a diameter of 1.6 µm have been tested at temperatures between −120 °C and 600 °C and strain rates between 10 -3 s −1 and 1 s −1 , which are to date unexplored conditions. Between −120 °C and 300 °C, the yield strengths (6–8 GPa) and strain rate sensitivities (≤0.03) vary only marginally. However, at 600 °C, a significant decrease in yield strength by more than 50\% (2.5–4.5 GPa) and an increase in strain rate sensitivity by a factor of 3 (0.09) is observed. Post-compression synchrotron-based ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (PXCT) on plastically deformed micropillars revealed a transition in deformation mechanisms: Shear-localization and shear-promoted densification at 25 °C; homogeneous shear-flow and densification limited by radial cracking at 300 °C; and unconstrained shear-flow and limited densification due to weak confinement strength at 600 °C. FEM results support these observations while separating geometric from material-intrinsic effects.

In this work, Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts composed of FAPbBr 3 nanocrystals (NCs) and WO 3 with different morphologies are prepared. Benefiting from the strong redox potential and morphological engineering, the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst exhibits an outstanding performance of BA oxidation to benzaldehyde (BD) with 99\% selectively. Remarkably, after manipulating the size of FAPbBr 3 NCs to quantum dots (QDs), benzoic acid (BZ) as the main product (90\% selectivity) of BA oxidation can be generated on the Z-scheme photocatalyst. As revealed by in-situ electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR), a new radical will be generated over the FAPbBr 3 QDs/WO 3 which alters the product of benzyl alcohol oxidation form BD to BZ.},

The present work highlights that contour scanning is crucial to ensure geometrical accuracy and thereby the high performance under uniaxial compression of complex Alloy 718 lattice structures. Studies of X-ray computed tomography visualizations of as-built and compression-strained structures reveal the continuous and smooth bending and compression of the walls, and the earlier onset of internal contact appearance in the denser lattices printed with contour. In contrast, the effect of addition of He to the Ar process gas appears to have limited influence on the mechanical response of the lattices and their microstructure as characterized by electron backscattered diffraction. However, the addition of He proved to significantly enhance the cooling rate and to reduce the amount of the generated spatters as evidenced by in situ monitoring of the process emissions, which is very promising for the process stability and powder reusability during laser powder bed fusion.},

A rolled stainless steel plate SUS304 workpiece is subjected to EJT for texturing by applying various current densities and jet kinematics. The resultant surface topography, removal characteristics, surface chemistry, and texture pattern are carefully investigated considering material microstructures. Experimental results reveal evident anisotropic behavior of texture which depends on the surface orientation with respect to the rolling direction. Periodic microstructures of aligned ripples are exclusively produced on surfaces parallel to the rolling direction, demonstrating the considerable influence of the rolling process on the EJT. Further, it is clarified by microstructural characterizations that the anisotropic texturing is ascribed to segregation bands of alloying elements resulting from the plastic deformation of the rolling process.},

In this work, Archimedean spiral metastructures are proposed for low-frequency vibration isolation by combining a double-layer corrugated sandwich core and two spiral metamaterial plates, which the former provides lightweight and high static load-bearing properties, and the latter possesses deep-subwavelength bandgaps. Both of the two proposed metastructures made of resin and Aluminum show efficient vibration isolation below 150 Hz where the corresponding flexural wavelengths are about 40 times the lattice constant, being a highly compact design for deep-subwavelength vibration control. We further develop a machine learning method to realize on-demand inverse design of the metastructures with targeted bandgap properties. The experimental and numerical results of the bandgaps are highly consistent, and further validate the accuracy of the machine-learning prediction. The slits between the Archimedean spiral arms make the metastructures be possible to further integrate sound absorption and isolation functions in future. The proposed metastructures provide a promising way for potential functional integration devices for vibration and noise control in industries such as aerospace engineering.},

For the effective application of graphene-based composites, the effect of bending on the thermal conductivity must be investigated. Consequently, the bending mechanism of GNSs in the dynamic compounding process was studied using molecular dynamics (MD). According to the MD simulation and previous experimental study, finite element models of bent GNSs and GNSs/epoxy composites were designed, to study the influence of bending content on thermal conductivity. The investigations indicate that the thermal conductivity of bent GNSs along the X-axis ( K GNS,x ) decreases linearly with the increase in height and number of bends. With the increase in bending length, K GNS,x initially decreases and then increases when the bend is low, while it always decreases when the bend is high. The thermal conductivity of bent GNSs/epoxy composites along the X-axis ( K c,x ) follows a similar trend and reduces sharply with increasing height. Contrastingly, K c,x always increases with the increasing length of bends. The results show that long and low bends in graphene improve thermal conductivity of graphene filled composites.},

The determination of phase diagrams is thus one of the central tasks in materials science. When exploring new materials for which the phase diagram is unknown, experimentalists often try to determine the key experiments that should be performed by referencing known phase diagrams of similar systems. To enhance this practical strategy, we attempted to estimate unknown phase diagrams based on known phase diagrams using a machine learning–based classification approach. As a proof of concept , we focused on predicting the number of coexisting phases across the 800 K isothermal section of each of the 10 ternaries of the Al-Cu-Mg-Si-Zn system from the other 9 sections. To increase the prediction accuracy, we introduced new descriptors generated from the thermodynamic properties of the elements and CALPHAD extrapolations from lower-order systems. Using the random forest method, the presence of single-, two-, and three-phase domains was predicted with an average accuracy of 84\% across all 10 considered sections with a standard deviation of 11\%. The proposed approach represents a promising tool for assisting the investigator in developing new materials and determining phase equilibria efficiently.},

The investigation addresses the issues associated with manufacturing actual bi-metallic structures and shades light on the intrinsic mechanism responsible for process-induced anisotropy and resulting interfacial strength. Interfacial shear tests of the candidate bi-metallic pair of low-carbon steel-316L stainless steel reveal that the intermediate machining before deposition of the second material, if deposited with low dilution and low heat input has a limited effect on the final build quality. The deposition direction influences the isotropy, i.e., strength improves when the shear force acts transversely to the deposition direction of the second material. Interlocking promoted by favorable deposition direction, as revealed by fractography, combined with metallurgical bonding, enhances the interfacial strength. Despite element migration and hardness spike in the interface up to 500 HV due to martensitic needles, a defect-free bi-metallic structure was possible with shear strengths over 400 MPa. The investigation contributes to the fundamental understanding of the approaches suitable for the deposition of sound bi-metallic structures.},

Therefore, the evolution information of AZ 31 strips treated by HMPT, such as the surface temperature, the microhardness and the microstructure was observed. It was indicated that HMPT belonged to the process of the rapid temperature change. The thermal effect produced by high-density multiple pulse was investigated. On the basis, the linear model of maximum stable surface temperature of AZ 31 was deduced in theory and consistent with the experimental data; and its influence on the recrystallization nucleation in HMPT were investigated. Compared with the conventional heat treatment, the recrystallization temperature decreased from 483 K to 465 K (maximum surface temperature) during HMTP, as well as the recrystallization time was shortened by 10 2 , resulting from the significant increase of dislocation climbing speed. The complex coupling between thermal effect and athermal effect made dislocation climbing motion remarkable increase through quantitative calculation and qualitative analysis, and the remarkable growth of dislocation climbing speed was calculated about 10 4 during HMPT.},

This work thus provides reliable analyses of powder strengths in as-atomized and annealed states to the calculation of critical velocities and deposit quality parameter η, as well as the associated influences of powder strength on single-particle adhesion and deposit microstructures and properties. By annealing of as-atomized powder, its strength is reduced by about 60\%, which allows decreasing the critical velocity for a successful deposition. Experimental results demonstrate that powder strength-based calculation of quality parameter η allows for a more realistic description of microstructural characteristics and deposits properties. The single-particle impact morphologies as well as the detachment features of adhering splats by cavitation tests visualize the respective deposition characteristics and bonding behaviors. The lower critical velocities by annealing contribute to better single splat adhesion, lower porosity, higher electrical conductivity, as well as improved tensile strength of deposits.

The cross-section profiles on the bending outside are fitted by the physics-driven B-spline curves. The geometric characteristics and the bending principles are set as the physics information and drive the design of the control vertices of the fitting B-curves. The interlaminar shape inheritance of the bimetallic tube is implemented by the same position angle of the corresponding control vertices. The cross-section profiles on the bending inside are fitted by the regular curves considering the elongation percentage. The comparison between the theoretical profiles and the experimental profiles shows remarkable agreement. The average circumferential errors of the theoretical profiles are within 1.82\%, far smaller than the errors of the traditional ovalization profiles. Additionally, the representative parameters of full-cross-section deformation are differently affected by the wall-thickness. The wall-thinning of the outer layer and inner layer usually shows an opposite tendency when the wall-thickness varies.},

The same regions within the samples were investigated before and after oxidation performed at different conditions. Quantitative analysis of the tomographic data provided information on changes upon oxidation of the relative volume of the different phases, the specific surface area (SSA) of the metallic core, the thickness of the oxide scale and pore size distribution. The results were discussed in the context of thermogravimetric analysis of the samples and supported by SEM imaging. It was observed that oxidation leads to an increase of the SSA of steel and the largest increase (∼50\%) was obtained for the sample processed for 100 h at 850 °C. It is demonstrated the open porosity forms a network of connected channels within the sample and it dominates in the volume.

This work presents a strategy of enhancing the mechanical performance of as-cast Ti6Al4V alloy by adding a small amount of rare earth (i.e. 0.1 wt\% Ce), where deleterious elements could be absorbed from the crystalline lattice during solidification process, forming uniformly distributed Ce-rich oxides or precipitates with ∼200 nm in size. The Ce-rich precipitates in turn refine the beta phase lamellae by introducing more nucleation in the cast alloy, which further enhances the strength. As such, the cast Ti6Al4V with Ce addition exhibits a tensile strength of 957 ± 47 MPa and elongation of 12.3\%, which exhibits a simultaneous strength-ductility enhancement compared with the Ti6Al4V counterpart (787 ± 65 MPa and 8.8\%). In addition, the Ce-rich precipitates also pin dislocation motions, which effectively shields the stress concentration at the crack tip and deflects the crack propagation during fracture process.},

We examine this issue from the perspective of design by systematically performing numerical simulations of the additive process of tubular components as a function of part design, including fillet radius, wall thickness, tube width and height. It is found that round corners, as opposed to sharp corners, suppress distortion even at small wall thickness (400 µm), while part width has a greater impact on distortion than part height. The buckling behavior of such structures is numerically investigated and analysis results show that for designs most prone to distortion, a critical height exists below which the component is distortion-free. The modeling was experimentally validated by manufacturing thin-wall components of IN718 alloy using the EOS M290 printer. The findings provide practical guidelines to manufacture metallic thin-wall tubular components with minimal to no distortion using powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {A process is presented for the production of periodic cellular structures based on investment casting of Al-12 wt\%Si alloy within a mould that is made of table salt (NaCl) packed around a sacrificial PLA polymer template. Moulding begins by pouring salt grains suspended within brine and packed by vibration around the pattern. This is followed by draining, drying, and pyrolysis of the polymer followed by pressure infiltration of the resulting mould with molten metal. Cast Al-12\%Si structures made of octahedra linked at their vertexes (6 in all three directions) with a relative density of 31\% are produced and characterized for their microstructure and compressive deformation. The highly porous structures replicate accurately the polymer pattern in dense metal, have a compressive modulus of 1.2 GPa, a plateau stress of 20 MPa, a densification strain of 77\%, and an energy absorption of 15 J/cm 3 corresponding to an efficiency of 80\% compared to an ideally plastic material.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of transformation induced plasticity high entropy alloys (TRIP HEAs) are affected by tailoring the metastability via alloying and processing. The current work focuses on as-cast and friction stir processed alloy where the initial microstructure is altered by Cu addition (a γ-fcc phase stabilizer) to the ε-hcp dominated HEA. With the Cu addition, the tensile stress-strain curves exhibited improved ductility and a delay in TRIP effect, suggesting an increased stacking fault energy, along with improved strength and work hardening. Improved properties with Cu addition are credited to almost 100\% stabilized γ-fcc phase, increased type and number of interfaces: Cu-rich precipitates, shorter faults, phase separation, and increased grain boundary fraction. The new alloy was then friction stir processed (FSPed) to further improve the properties. An advanced TRIP effect is observed with FSP as compared to as-cast alloy, attributed to increased ε-hcp fraction and finer grain size. Based on microscopic observations, the improved strength is due to finer grain size, increased dislocation density, low density of faults, whereas reduced ductility is reasoned to be due to dissolution of Cu-rich precipitates and increased width of modulations from phase separation.},

In the present study, we generated ZnO NPs to form a hierarchical tetramodal-porous three-dimensional (3D) architecture by immobilization on a solid plate, which helps enhance mass transfer and reaction rate. ZnO NPs were microfluidically synthesized and further solidified via dual-step nanofabrication. The physicochemical properties of as-synthesized ZnO NPs and the aggregates were characterized. Specifically, intraparticle pores in ZnO NPs displayed interconnected cylindrical channels with bimodal distribution centered at 1.3 and 2.0 nm. Mesopores of ZnO NPs were also analysed at 19.5 nm. ZnO NPs were immobilized on silicon wafer and cellulose paper sheet by a simple and reproducible self-assembly, creating hierarchical tetramodal-porous architecture of intra- and inter-particle pores. In the architecture, macropores were detected at 1.2 μm on silicon wafer and 134.62 nm on cellulose paper depending on ethanol wetting of NPs at drying temperature for solvent evaporation. From the results, the ZnO NPs can be unprecedented bioinks in biomedical applications including biocompatible battery electrodes, biosensing, nanobiomedicines, medical devices, cosmetics, and tissue engineering. They can also offer further intriguing theoretical and experimental investigations of multi-modality for hierarchical porosity.},

The solder wettability on aluminum substrate and microstructure-properties of Cu-based component/aluminum substrate laser soldering joint are studied. The results show that the presence of the high melting point Al 2 O 3 oxide film (∼18.45 nm thickness) isolates the contact between the molten Sn-based solder and the aluminum substrate, which results in the poor wetting properties of aluminum substrate. The surface modification of aluminum substrate can significantly improve wettability (110°→14°). Anisotropic Sn dendrites appear in the brazing area of laser soldering joints, and Ag 3 Sn is precipitated in the β-Sn matrix. The (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 IMC is formed near the Ni layer side. Due to the extremely fast cooling rate, the IMC thickness is less than 5 μm, and a continuous (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 region with a thickness of less than 1 μm appears at the interface near the Ni layer side. The average maximum linear load of the laser soldering joints is 95.2 N/mm. The laser soldering joint fracture occurs along the brittle (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 IMC formed at the Ni layer interface, and the fracture mode is mainly ductile fracture.},

  abstract     = {Alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) steel is considered as a promising candidate used for advanced energy systems. Fusion welding of austenitic steels usually requires the introduction of a certain delta (δ) ferrite to avoid thermal cracking, but for the AFA steel, the presence of δ ferrite will greatly accelerate the precipitation of hard and brittle sigma (σ) phase at its target service temperature. In this work, for the AFA steel with a typical composition, we demonstrated a superior capability of friction stir welding (FSW) in avoiding the formation of δ and σ phases, and developing the favorable weld microstructures under various welding conditions. The microstructure evolution of AFA steel during FSW with various rotational speeds (300–700 rpm) was studied in detail. The resulting FSW joints all exhibit higher yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) than the base metal, especially at low rotational speed, while retaining reasonable ductility, despite decreasing with reducing rotational speed. The associated relationship between the microstructure and mechanical properties of the resulting FSW joints was well correlated. This work provides an effective method to obtain the fully-austenitic welded joints of AFA steel with excellent strength-ductility synergy.},

Not only does this technique overcome the technical limitations characteristic of casting processes for amorphous alloys, but also the possibility to print complex 3D geometries is expected to greatly facilitate the channelling of the magnetic flux, when such component is used as a rotor in an electric machine. The rotor is characterized in comparison to the powder material as well as the as-spun ribbon using complementary techniques, including synchrotron x-ray diffraction, calorimetry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as room temperature ferromagnetic and hardness testing. The rotor has extraordinarily high values of hardness (877 HV), high electrical resistivity (178.2 µΩ cm) and remarkable high magnetic susceptibility (9.17). This latter feature leads to a better magnetic response in the presence of an external magnetic field evidenced by a faster approach to saturation. The coercivity is relatively small (0.51 kA/m) and the magnetic saturation relatively high (1.29 T). In addition, a large anisotropic effect on the magnetization response in connection with partial crystallization in the melt pool areas is assessed experimentally.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers have been extensively investigated along the longitudinal direction and are well-known for their high axial tensile strength and modulus. However, after being manufactured into textiles or composites, these fibers are usually subjected to transverse loading during their normal service life. Deformation and failure of CNT fibers induced by external loads in the transverse direction lack examination. This study integrated single-fiber quasi-static and dynamic transverse loading techniques with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-speed imaging, respectively. An extreme condition was considered as the indenter was a sharp razor blade. Failure behavior of single CNT fibers transversely loaded by the blade at different velocities was visualized, and axial mechanical response of these fibers was measured. The fracture surface of CNT fibers was examined by SEM. Additional experimental investigations were performed on commercialized two organic (aramid and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene) and two inorganic (ceramic and glass) fibers. It is revealed that CNT fibers experienced initial contact with the blade, followed by partial incision, and ultimately tensile failure. Furthermore, the energy dissipation and dispersion capabilities of CNT fibers per unit mass were demonstrated to surpass that of commercialized high-performance fibers during extreme transverse loading. As the loading rate increased, the energy dissipation of CNT fibers was further improved by 2.1 times. Such high performance of CNT fibers in resisting extreme transverse loading was presumably attributed to the high hardness, strength, and stiffness of CNTs in the transverse direction and weak intermolecular interactions in the axial direction. This study expands material characterization of CNT fibers in the transverse direction and reveals the fundamental failure mechanism of CNT fibers in the harsh environment, which is deemed useful to develop the fiber-scale model for textiles and composites.},

Microstructure, mechanical performance, bioactivity, biodegradability, drug release, biocompatibility, in vitro angiogenesis and antibacterial activity were studied.

GO-PLL was used to modify BMP-2 encapsulated bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (GO-PLL/BMP-2) by self-assembling technology. The physiochemical and biological properties of GO-PLL modified BSA nanoparticles were investigated in vitro . Additionally, rabbit calvarial bone defects were created to investigate bone formation ability in the presence of GO-PLL/BMP-2 loaded alginate/gelatin scaffolds. The results suggested BSA particles were spatially interacted with GO-PLL complexes by strong electrostatic attraction. When compared with BMP-2 encapsulated BSA nanoparticles, a pronounced decrease in BMP-2 gentle release was observed in the presence of GO-PLL/BMP-2 nanoparticles, and extended to over 14-day release periods. More importantly, GO-PLL/BMP-2 nanoparticles significantly enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and matrix mineralization, and exhibited favorable bone formation ability when loaded into alginate/gelatin scaffolds. These results demonstrated that PLL functionalized GO complexes are considered as appropriate delivery system for BSA modification, and have great potential for BMP-2 delivery in bone regeneration.},

The microfluidic technique was used to fabricate magnetic chitosan (MCS) microspheres. By immobilization with Zn 2+ ions, the biohybrid MCS allowed for the flexible operation to capture histidine-tagged vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) . The VEGF-conjugated MCS were then applied onto the wounds to examine their capabilities in promoting wound healing. Zn 2+ and chitosan in MCS exhibited a synergetic antibacterial effect towards both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Using a rat model, we further demonstrated that the microspheres significantly promoted wound healing process, as evidenced by rapid wound closure, induced epithelialization and angiogenesis, and reduced inflammation response. Together, our data indicated the presented MCS as a versatile tool for capturing and locally delivering growth factors, which can be applied to wound repair. Moreover, with the functional flexibility, this biohybrid MCS could be empolyed in a wide range of biomedical applications by conjugating proteins of interest.},

The PCL#20MgP scaffold was used to repair the rabbit maxillofacial bone defect. The Micro-CT results also confirmed that PCL#20MgP had a better osteogenesis effect than the PCL scaffold. The PCL#20MgP scaffold has good clinical application prospects in the field of maxillofacial bone defect repair.},

  abstract     = {Booming aspiration of advanced energy storage equipment elevates lithium-ion batteries vastly. Whereas separator with inferior porous structure and compatibility mismatches battery internal medium and raises ion transference rampart. Herein, fumed SiO 2 compound separator is designed via ingenious bidirectional drawing technique to optimize the porous structure and realize fumed SiO 2 coating online construction during the pore formation process of β-crystal polypropylene (β-iPP) synchronously. Crystal structure measurement, pore construction diagnosis, and physical properties tests disclose that the fumed SiO 2 thins coarse fibril structure and homogenizes porous construction of separator. The de-bonding of fumed SiO 2 /β-iPP interfaces also remains SiO 2 on the top-surface and pore internal wall of separator and thus realizes the SiO 2 coating online construction, which eliminate the steps required by coating after fabrication of the separator and greatly reduce the production difficulty and cost. Also, the prepared composite separators present reinforced thermal dimensional stability and electrolyte wettability benefited by the SiO 2 coating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cycle tests further uncover that hydrophilic SiO 2 nanoparticles lower lithium-ion migration rampart within separator and enhance compatibility with electrodes, which stifles cell resistances and gives LIBs superior high ratio discharge property and cycling durability.},

To devise a robust and flexible self-healing platform, we designed an octagonal-siloxane derivative with four furan units and applied bifunctional maleimides as dienophiles to implement the reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction for crack healing. The feasibility of the DA reaction was confirmed by both the appearance of a cyclohexyl moiety in 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and heat transition behaviors during heating-cooling cycles in differential scanning calorimetry. The crack-healing efficiency of the designed octagonal-siloxane was sensitively affected by the heat-treatment temperature, and the crack recovery rate reached over 95\% within 60 s upon heating at 100 °C. In addition, the crack recovery tendency was almost intact during repetitive heating-cooling cycles. The devised crack-healing film exhibited greater than 95\% transparency in the entire visible region, and the effective modulus reached 7.8 GPa. In particular, when CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were embedded into the octagonal-siloxane based film, it was confirmed that optical scars exhibiting luminescence defects were effectively recovered, and the emission characteristics of the QDs were not critically compromised even under solvent-exposed circumstances.},

Thirteen typologies of two-dimensional cellular patterns with different relative densities are examined. Results have allowed conclusions to be drawn regarding the influence of cell type and infill density on mechanical performance. Intra-layer and inter-layer inherent defects identified after manufacturing highlight the importance of optimizing filament trajectories. A reliable comparison of the elastic properties of the cellular patterns as a function of their density is presented. An experimentally validated numerical model is provided for predicting the compression stiffness of the different cell patterns with an average deviation below 5\%. The model can reproduce the behavior in the elastic range based on tensile specimen properties and a Normal Stiffness Factor to account for the phenomenon of elastic asymmetry of the FFF printed samples. The wide range of results achieved is experimental confirmation of the potential of FFF cellular solids. Lastly, this investigation provides analytical, numerical, and empirical validated evidence to further design-for-additive manufacturing strategies with cellular solids for designing advanced lightweight structures.},

Despite the advantages that the two test methodologies have to offer, the main drawback is the complex understanding of the mechanical data generated from the experiments and how it can be correlated to more recognised properties. Typically, the most desired properties relate to the uniaxial properties of yield stress, ultimate tensile strength and ductility, but to date, there is no single robust and overarching approach for correlating such properties for a wide array of metallic materials that exhibit varying levels of ductility. This paper will for the first time directly compare properties obtained from a series of uniaxial tensile, SP and ShP tests across several metallic materials, and look to establish and correlate equivalent properties across the different test types. The materials investigated range from commercially pure entities to more advanced alloy systems. The generated results, empirical relationships and numerical simulations will inform which materials can be correlated across the different test regimes, and identify why the relationship in certain materials breaks down.},

In this paper, the equilibrated H distribution around GBs was firstly investigated by employing the grand canonical Monte Carlo method. Then, MD simulations were performed to study the plastic response of GBs under uniaxial tensile loads in different directions, with various bulk H concentrations considered. The results indicate that the influence of H on dislocation nucleation from GB depends on both tensile directions and characteristics of GB structures. Specifically, two dislocation nucleation mechanisms, called dislocation dissociation nucleation (DDN) and heterogeneous dislocation nucleation (HDN), are identified. Careful analyses show that H segregation can increase the energy barrier of DDN, which results in H-inhibited dislocation nucleation. In contrast, the HDN mechanism involves H-enhanced or H-insensitive dislocation nucleation, which mainly depends on the influence of H on GB stress.},

  abstract     = {Abrasive waterjet peening (AWJP) is a promising method of surface treatment for modifying mechanical properties of components by introducing compressive residual stress (CRS) to a workpiece surface. Many efforts have been paid so far to modelling and optimisation of the AWJP process, however, most of these studies focus on the forward problems, i.e. estimating the CRS of workpiece surface according to processing parameters. There are still significant challenges in implanting different CRS at target areas in workpiece surface, which is the foundation of implanting uniform distribution of CRS on free-form surface or workpiece with uneven initial stress state. In this paper, a novel temporally and spatially controlled method for AWJP has been proposed, where the distribution of CRS can be adjusted by the optimisation of the abrasive waterjet parameters. That is, to achieve the AWJP system configuration for specific CRS on a target area, an inverse problem of CRS distribution has been modelled and solved, where the pump pressure, traverse speed and centre distance were optimised together to reach a prescribed CRS distribution. The proposed method was validated through experiments of implanting uniform distribution and non-uniform distribution of CRS at target areas. The results revealed that the maximum error between target and experimental CRS was only 14.25\% in 18 sets of experiments. In addition, microstructure analysis of the AWJP surface suggested that a relatively low pump pressure and traverse speed can be selected to induce grain refinement and strain hardening layer on the workpiece surface without cracks and heavy surface topography fluctuations.},

Interestingly, AM technologies have a significant advantage in achieving the structure–function integration for CCSs. Functional properties, e.g. , electromagnetic property, acoustic property, thermal property, of CCSs can be achieved during the structural design synchronously. In this review, firstly, the AM technologies for CCSs are comparatively introduced. Then, structural AM-CCSs are summarized. After that, structure–function integrated AM-CCSs are further introduced in detail. Finally, challenges and opportunities towards structure–function integrated AM-CCSs are forecasted.

Especially, RADA16 peptide hydrogel had the ability to slowly release growth factors for bone regeneration. Here, RADA16/CaSO 4 /HA composite biomaterials afforded the controlled and sustainable release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for more than 32 days. Compared to RADA16/CaSO 4 /HA biomaterial, RADA16 + bFGF/CaSO 4 /HA composite biomaterial could further improve in vitro osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3 cells as evidenced by the increased expression of osteogenic markers (i.e. runt-related transcription factor 2 [Runx2], osteocalcin [OCN] and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and in vivo bone formation of femoral condyle defects which were confirmed by histological staining and micro-CT analyses. These indicate that bFGF-incorporated RADA16/CaSO 4 /HA can further improve bone formation through the controlled release of bFGF, which provides a novel injectable biomaterial design to specifically release growth factors for bone defects.},

Here, we report the fabrication of multiscale porous scaffolds (MPSs) and evaluate the effects of macropores (&gt;100 μm) and micropores (&lt;10 μm) on bone regeneration in the early to medium term. MPSs were constructed from interconnecting carbonate apatite honeycomb granules. The uniaxial macropores penetrating the honeycomb granules linked the gaps among the granules, creating an interconnected macroporous architecture. MPSs with different proportions of macropores and micropores were implanted into rabbit femurs. In an early stage, macropores played a crucial role in promoting new bone formation. In the medium term, micropores, rather than macropores, were the dominant factor affecting the replacement of MPSs with new bone. Notably, micropores of 100 nm to 10 μm primarily promoted MPS resorption by osteoclasts, stimulating secondary osteogenesis. Our findings demonstrated that pore size distribution, rather than porosity, was crucial for osteogenesis in the early-to-medium term. Although conventional scaffold development sacrifices mechanical strength to improve bone formation, our findings indicate that optimizing the pore size distribution is a promising strategy to develop scaffolds that satisfy the requirements of both osteogenesis and mechanical strength.},

After intravenously injected into tumor bearing-mice, this therapeutic agent could effectively target to the tumor site owing to the HA modification. The biocompatible property and GSH-induced decomposition capability endows the precise release of drugs in the cytoplasm of tumor cells.

MEW scaffolds were printed on then removed from either PVA or non-dissolvable PLA moulds, and the preservation of the MEW scaffold morphology was assessed. The non-dissolvable PLA moulds significantly damaged the MEW scaffolds while the PVA dissolvable moulds enabled the preservation the of scaffold geometry and could be separated from the mould with ease.

  abstract     = {High stiffness of hydrogen-bond network generally endows cellulose hydrogels with weak mechanical flexibility and shape uncontrollability, imposing restrictions on their application scopes. Herein, a flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) network is penetrated through the rigid network of bamboo cellulose, inducing the formation of a dual-crosslinked hydrogel with superior flexibility and shape controllability. Besides, the borax crosslinker offers the bamboo nanocellulose-borax-PVA hydrogel with remarkable self-healing ability and high ionic conductivity. The hydrogel achieves a minimum sensing weight of 5 g (gauge factor: 1.47) and has a stable sensing sensitivity in both hot and cold environments (i.e., 0 and 60 °C). When fixed to the wrist of human, the hydrogel can regularly sense the motion signals, verifying the potential of the hydrogel for the development of next-generation wearable products. More importantly, the hydrogel can serve as a green platform to integrate with amoxicillin to create an effective composite to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus , which provides an effective route to develop eco-friendly and powerful functional composites. The drug-loaded hydrogel displays a negligible cytotoxicity and favorable biocompatibility towards human skin.},

  abstract     = {An analytical flow stress model, based on isotropic strain gradient plasticity theory, for precipitation hardened materials, is proposed and evaluated against tensile data on a 15 wt\% Cr - 5 wt\% Ni (15-5) PH stainless steel. The 15-5 PH material was aged at 500 °C for 1 h, 2 h, 5 h and 50 h to obtain a wide range of precipitate sizes. Detailed characterisation of precipitates was obtained using atom probe tomography (APT). A second material, a 15-5 stainless steel without added Cu was heat treated to obtain a similar matrix microstructure as in the 15-5 PH, but without Cu precipitates. Tensile testing revealed that the heat treated 15-5 PH material covered the full range from under- to overaged conditions. The analytical model, which accounts for stress reducing effects of plastic relaxation around particles, manages to capture the experimental data in a very satisfying manner using only a total of three tunable parameters. It is believed that the proposed model can offer an alternative to the much more commonly used work hardening models based on the internal variable approach.},

Cavity resonators with internally extended tubes (CRIET) with hexagonal honeycomb configuration were selected as unit components. An optimization method was proposed to against degradation from impedance coupling effect and contribute to flatter and higher sound absorption coefficient (SAC) curves. The as-designed metastructure has been demonstrated experimentally to have quasi-perfect broadband sound absorption in the target range of 600–1000 Hz with an average SAC above 0.9 and a deep-subwavelength thickness of 30 mm. Compression experiment showed that the CRIET metastructure with hexagonal honeycomb configuration had the same unique excellent load-bearing and crash energy dissipation performance as an intact honeycomb structure.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirmed the intermetallic NiTi phase formation at the interface. Microstructural gradient observed at the heat-affected zone (HAZ) areas. The longitudinal samples showed about 12\% elongation, while the same was 36\% for the transverse samples. During compressive deformation, strain hardening from dislocation accumulation was observed in the CP Ti and transverse samples, but longitudinal samples demonstrated failures similar to a brittle fracture at the interface. Transverse samples also showed shear band formation indicative of ductile failures.

In this study, the contributions of metallurgical factors under different scanning speeds, such as Ni evaporation, Ni 4 Ti 3 precipitation, dislocations and internal stress, to the transformation temperature and transformation latent heat were clarified through specially designed experiments. Ni evaporation is found to have the most profound effect, followed by precipitation. Increasing scanning speed is found to reduce Ni loss, thus cause less increase in the transformation temperature and transformation heat of the LPBF-NiTi alloys. Increasing scanning speed also increases the microstructure non-uniformity and thus widens the transformation temperature interval. The orientations of residual stress exhibit strong crystallographic stiffness dependence. The LPBF-NiTi alloys with different scanning speeds all exhibited high strains (&gt;13.4\%) and excellent shape memory effect. A LPBF-NiTi honeycomb structure exhibited 96\% shape recovery rate after a 60\% pre-compressive deformation. Besides, there is an optimum scanning speed for minimum porosity and smallest average pore size. However, the pore structure is found to have weak influence on the tensile behaviour of the LPBF-NiTi alloys, possibly due to the high defect tolerance of the martensitic transformation.},

  abstract     = {In contrast with titanium (Ti) alloys, the α+β region for commercially pure Ti is neglectable. Therefore, its β transus ( T β ) can be regarded as a watershed for β-Ti and α-Ti. Utilizing this characteristic, we fabricated dual-textured Ti extrudates through a powder metallurgy route via manipulating the hot extrusion temperature. The crystallographic texture along extrusion direction (ED) was analyzed. Different from the sole //ED texture throughout the entire extrudate in previous studies, our extrudates exhibited unique dual-textured microstructure. The firstly extruded portion manifested //ED and //ED, whereas the rest extrudate displayed //ED. This was attributed to the realtime extrusion temperature of each location in comparison with T β . On the other hand, the last portion of the extrudate contained much more interstitial nitrogen and oxygen, which led to extremely high strength via solid solution strengthening. This was resulted from a combination effect of diffusion-controlled element absorbing and material flow during extrusion. Our findings may open up a new direction in developing high-performance materials with variable microstructure and mechanical properties for medical applications like neoarthrosis.},

Results reveal that the qualified parts could be bent into a satisfactory shape without spring-back and cracks in bending temperatures of 850–1000 °C. The simulation was applied to predict the equivalent stress, stress neutral layer (SNL) and plate thickness. Strength presents a decreasing trend with the increase of bending temperature owing to integrated influences of high-temperature dynamic recovery (DRV) and dynamic recrystallisation (DRX). Beyond that, SNL nearby the geometrical centre line throughout the plate thickness and dislocation pile-ups on the tension/compression zones are responsible for the smaller hardness on middle regions while higher hardness on the surface areas. Through austenite reconstruction, a smaller martensite packet size would directly improve the strength of the plates bent at a lower temperature. The prior austenite size may be related to the appearance of martensite variants but not necessary. Furthermore, the high accuracy by comparing the experimental results with simulation would provide a high-value reference for the practical manufacturing process of railway spring clips.},

We put forward a complete foundation relationship among texture, cellular structure and mechanical property influenced by anisotropy. Main results are summarized as follows: The 〈1 0 1〉 texture formation is the result of dendrite epitaxial growth. The cellular dislocation structure highly overlapped with dendrite significantly changed in remelting zone. Hence the high ratio of 〈1 0 1〉 texture signifies the anisotropy distribution of epitaxially growth dendrite which released the internal stress. The dislocation structure has a contribution to strength similar work hardening strengthening. Meanwhile, the 316L SS obtains Orowan strengthening via the nano oxide pinning effect in dislocation wall. Thus, the dislocation density and oxide distance obvious changed in different directions of cellular dislocation structure, resulting in the cellular dendrite regions performed higher microhardness than the columnar dendrite regions. The drastic change of dendrite increased the crack sensitivity of SLMed 316L SS, and the junction of different epitaxially growth direction dendrites formed high energy grain boundary.},

By recording the material transfer at high speed during processing, evidence was gathered indicating the suitability of the fabricated cored wires for WAAM. Optimized process parameters were identified by taking a Design of Experiment (DoE) approach and additive manufacturing (AM) structures were fabricated from the chromium martensitic hot-work tool steel alloys. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the parts were subsequently characterized. The phase fraction of the polygonally shaped delta ferrite could be reduced and microstructural refinement could be achieved by adding nickel to the investigated hot-work tool steel. In addition to molybdenum-enriched precipitates that covered the grain boundaries, randomly scattered non-metallic inclusions and oxides were observed. Modifying the microstructure by adding nickel also affects the mechanical properties of the product: an increase in hardness, impact toughness and yield strength as the nickel content increased in the AM structures fabricated by WAAM was observed.},

In this paper, the cerium oxide liquid is used to assist the grinding of sapphire with a diamond wheel with relatively big-size grains to obtain a low roughness. The effects of grain size, the crystal orientation of the sapphire, and the pH values of the cerium oxide liquid on the assisted grinding process have been analyzed. It is shown that with the proposed method, the roughness of 45 nm and subsurface damage of 141 nm are obtained, respectively. Compared with the grinding surfaces obtained without the assistant, the roughnesses and the subsurface damage of the assisted grinding surfaces are reduced by 60.8\% and 84.5\% when #600 wheel is used, respectively. Moreover, in the grinding experiments, the crystal orientation of the sapphire and the pH values of the cerium oxide liquid have little effect on the roughness of the grinding surface, while the grain size has a great impact. It is concluded that the improvement of the surface roughness by using the proposed method benefits from the combined action of the grinding of grains and the polishing of the cerium oxide liquid.},

  abstract     = {In this research, a kind of 70-47-25\% B 4 C/2024Al functionally graded materials (FGMs) were prepared by squeeze casting. The interfacial microstructure, precipitate characteristics and mechanical properties of B 4 C/2024Al FGMs were mainly studied. It was found that there was a small amount of interfacial reaction between B 4 C particles and Al. Mg and O elements segregated at the Al-B 4 C interface and MgO was formed. Under the same heat treatment conditions, the types and sizes of precipitates in different gradient layers were found to be different. Different amount of Mg segregation at the B 4 C-Al interface resulted in different proportion of Cu and Mg in 2024Al matrix and it makes the precipitation regions of 25 vol\%, 47 vol\% and 70 vol\% B 4 C/2024Al locate in S , θ + S and θ respectively. The test results of basic properties indicated that the strength and plasticity of 70-47-25\% B 4 C/2024Al FGMs show gradient changes. The bending stresses of 70\%, 47\% and 25\% B 4 C/2024Al composites can reach 591.5 MPa, 953.4 MPa and 700.7 MPa respectively. And the elastic modulus are 240.3 GPa, 170.9 GPa and 130.7 GPa respectively. The results of this research will provide theoretical guidance for the interface structure design and heat treatment process of high strength B 4 C/Al composites.},

  abstract     = {The low electron/ion migration rate and the high deformability of conventional two-dimensional (2D) electrodes limit the growing demand for energy storage devices with high areal capacity and stable cycling performance. Designing three-dimensional (3D) electrodes is a promising strategy to improve this defect. Herein, we prepare metallic nickel aerogel via a facile hydrothermal reduction route, which was annealed to obtain a self-standing 3D porous NiO/Ni anode. The electrode material displays a networked porous structure and good electrical conductivity, which mitigates the volume effect during cycling and provides excellent electron transport pathways and conductive ion channels. The unique structure with many electrochemical active sites performs higher areal capacity. When used as the anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), a high reversible areal capacity of 1.93 mAh cm −2 is delivered at a current density of 1 mA cm −2 with a capacity retention ratio of 98.4\% after 100 cycles. Remarkably, a large reversible capacity of 1.30 mAh cm −2 is also achieved at a relatively high current density of 6 mA cm −2 . The 3D porous NiO/Ni anode material provides a new strategy for enhancing the energy density and stable cycling for practical application in power-type LIBs.},

In our work, 4-inch silicon-based LN single crystal thin film was prepared based on low-temperature bonding technology and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method. The oxygen plasma treatment was adopted for increasing the surface hydrophilia to enhance the bonding strength. Grinding parameters under different film thickness were determined by experiments. The parameters of the film was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a thickness of 6.294 μm and by atomic force microscope (AFM) obtained the surface roughness is 585 pm. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) test showed that the CMP process could release the compressive stress caused by the bonding, thus obtaining high quality LN single crystal films.

  abstract     = {This research reports on the design, fabrication, and multiscale mechanical characterization of flexible, planar mechanical metamaterials with tailorable mechanical properties. The tunable mechanical behavior of the structures is realized through the introduction of orthogonal perforations with different geometric features. Various configurations of the perforations lead to a wide range of Poisson’s ratios (from −0.8 to 0.4), load-bearing properties, and energy absorption capacities. The correlations between the configuration of the perforations and the auxetic response of the structures are highlighted through computational and experimental characterizations performed at multiple length scales. It is demonstrated that the local in-plane rotation of the solid ligaments in a uniaxially loaded structure is the primary factor that contributes to its strain-dependent auxetic behavior at macroscopic scales. Confinement of these local rotations is then used as a practical strategy to activate a self-strengthening mechanism in the auxetic structures. It is further shown that the fabrication of planar flexible structures with controllable Poisson’s ratios is feasible through spatial adjustment of perforations in the structure. Finally, discussions are provided regarding the practical applications of these structures for a new generation of highly energy-absorbing protective equipment.},

  abstract     = {Generally, additively manufactured (AM) full martensitic titanium alloys (hexagonal-close-packed α’ phase) exhibits high yield strength (&gt;1GPa) but poor elongation to failure (&lt;8\% usually). However, this only α’-phase microstructure is not intrinsically brittle and exhibits high ductility under certain process conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to unravel the mechanism of ductility fluctuation for process control. Here, we found the less martensite-colony microstructures (LMCM) could effectively distribute stress to variant interfaces and avoid strain localization. Therefore, it results in a 194\% ductility enhancement in the AM-produced α’-Ti-6Al-4 V (Ti64) compared with the rich martensite-colony microstructure (MCM). At the same time, we also successfully improved the strength-ductility dilemma for Ti64 alloy (yield strength, Ys 0.2 = 1044 ± 10 MPa, elongation at break, EL = 15 ± 1.5\%). We attribute the LMCM to refined prior-β grain and a weak variant selection during β BCC to α’ HCP by increasing hatch spacing. What’s more, to rule out the possible influence of the β phase and demonstrate the generality of our conclusion, we further apply it on α-titanium alloy (Ti-6.5Al-2Zr-1Mo-1 V, TA15 alloy) and obtain the same results.},

Three-dimensional helical structures composed of varying coil numbers, defined in a cylindrical spatial domain are shape optimized through genetic algorithm in a finite element script for conflicting objectives of minimum mass and maximum tensile range. The superior performance of the shape optimized helical structure is highlighted in terms of structural rigidity, large deformation capability, buckling and vibrational modal analysis in compare to equivalent coil springs of identical weight and comparable domain. Deformation mechanism is analyzed carefully to justify the improved performances of proposed structure. Tensile and compressive experimental analysis are undertaken to validate the enhanced strain ranges. One dimensional metamaterials implementations with various tessellation arrangements are simulated. Results show that the proposed design can effectively generate lightweight substitutes of metamaterials unit cells ligaments to improve the strain range performance.

  abstract     = {The use of Ti6Al4V in bone engineering is limited, due to the biological inertia of the surface. In this study, a porous Ti6Al4V scaffold with mechanical properties similar to cancellous bone was designed and 3D-printed. Under physiological conditions, the scaffold was immersed firstly in a 5-fold-concentrated simulated body fluid, then in a supersaturated CaP solution containing BMP-2, to form a bone-like porous micro/nano structured biomimetic coating on the surface. Scaffolds were implanted in the muscle pouches created in six beagle dogs and were retrieved four weeks later for histologic and histomorphometric analysis. Results showed that BMP-2 integrated biomimetic CaP coating induced ectopic bone formation, which was absent in other two groups. Soft tissue infiltrated the scaffold&#39;s outside 1 mm layer, while the new-formed bone was evenly distributed in the longitudinal and horizontal directions within the rest of the scaffold based on BA/TA, BIC and BA measurements. In conclusion, the BMP-2 incorporated biomimetic CaP coating creates a micro/nano surface structure on the Ti6Al4V scaffold, which helps to increase biocompatibility. The integrated BMP-2 is capable of inducing ectopic bone formation in vivo. The proposed combination may have the potential for bone reconstruction, but further studies are needed to explore its clinical applicability.},

In this work, the effects of Co content on the phase stability and mechanical behavior Co x CrFeNiMnAl 0.3 HEAs were investigated. It is found that with the decrease of the Co content, the stability of the face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution phase in the alloy decreases, resulting in the precipitation of the BCC (body-centered cubic) phase from the FCC phase, thereby obtaining the FCC + BCC dual-phase structure. During annealing, the precipitated BCC phase can effectively suppress the grain growth and recrystallization of the FCC solid solution, forming an ultrafine-grained microstructure. In addition, the Ni-Al type nano-B2 phase can form in the BCC phase under the influence of the negative formation enthalpy during solidification. This micro/nano hierarchical structure can effectively improve the mechanical properties of the alloys. Co 0.25 CrFeNiMnAl 0.3 maintains relatively excellent tensile yield strength (486 MPa), the tensile elongation remains above 20\%. This study regulates the formation of the BCC phase and B2 phase by reducing the content of Co, which provides a new idea for the preparation of low-cost HEAs with excellent mechanical properties.},

The results showed that the electric characteristics were affected not only by the grain size and preferential texture orientations, but also by the presence of bimodal grains distribution, accumulated dislocations, and twins. The highest electric conductivity (specific resistivity of 20.6 (Ωm) × 10 −9 ) and, simultaneously, the highest hardness was observed for the sample featuring bimodal grain size, high density of dislocations, and partial structure restoration.

At the mesoscale, its melt pool boundaries constitute a network of weak interfaces that provides preferred pathways for crack kinking, leading to both marked anisotropy and apparent enhancement in the fracture energy. In this study, a multiscale cohesive zone-based computational model and a semi-analytical approach for kinked cracks are used to investigate the effect of melt pool configuration on fracture energy enhancement and anisotropy due to crack path tortuosity. We experimentally validate our methodology using fracture toughness testing of compact tension specimens, then systematically study the simultaneous effects of hatch spacing, layer thickness, and crack surface orientation on variations of the fracture energy. While the fracture energy increases with increasing hatch spacing and decreasing layer thickness, processing defects such as keyholing give practical limits to the melt pool geometry, limiting the fracture energy enhancement. We found that the fracture energy can be enhanced as high as a factor of two with an optimal crack surface orientation that is linearly proportional to the ratio of hatch spacing to layer thickness and varies between 60° and 100°.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing of structural metallic components is an emerging technology. The DED-arc (direct energy deposition) process combines efficiency with high degrees of freedom and predictable quality. Compared to powder-based processes, the surface is relatively coarse as a result of high heat input and larger molten zones. In industrial applications, the post-treatment of surfaces of DED-arc components cannot be guaranteed for economic reasons or due to geometric constraints. Hence, the surface topography must be evaluated and quality levels need to be defined. Unfortunately, established surface parameters and their determination cannot be directly transferred to DED-arc components and further research on this topic is needed. This article demonstrates surface topography features of representative DED-arc components. Furthermore, waviness profiles were established by applying an alternative cutoff wavelength to better represent the DED-arc surface characteristics. Based on these waviness profiles, 2-dimensional height parameters were calculated. The waviness parameters were determined for four DED-arc specimens made from high strength wire electrodes. The manufacturing parameters were varied in terms of different energy input and interpass temperature, resulting in varying deposition rates and surface qualities. The waviness parameters correlated with manufacturing parameters. A mixed deterministic and random nature of the surface topography was verified.},

  abstract     = {Functional grading of a ferritic steel (SA508 grade 3) and austenitic stainless steel (316L) powder via hot isostatic pressing (HIP) consolidation is investigated as an alternative to dissimilar welding. Fundamental aspects of this method such as the development of microstructure and diffusional processes during the HIP process of such mixed powder are studied in this work. A change of the post-HIP α to γ ratio with HIP temperature was observed in mixed powder specimens, combined with the formation of a ferritic lath zone which affects the properties of the specimens (throughout this work the term ferritic laths refers to a ferritic phase of unknown structure which is likely to consist of martensite, bainite or a mixture of both). These effects were attributed to extensive diffusion of alloying elements from 316L into SA508 grade 3. Simulation and experimental quantification of diffusion in diffusion couple experiments were applied to derive an empirical model for estimating α-Fe boundary migration and the formation of the ferritic lath zone and phase fractions for various temperatures and dwell times of the HIP process.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state bonding is widely involved in metal forming and joining applications. The quality of the bonded interface is the key to the final integrity of the joint or formed structure; thus, its controllability and predictivity have been the focus over decades. The interface bond quality is jointly determined by the interface oxide behaviour and microstructure evolution. In this study, a new four-stage model, considering the cohesion of different contacting pairs (oxide-oxide, oxide-metal and metal–metal) and the reduced adverse effect of remaining oxides, is proposed to describe the bonding process under hot deforming conditions. This proposed model was validated through a range of hot compression bonding tests, using Gleeble under different strains (10\%, 30\% and 50\%), strain rates (0.001 s −1 , 0.01 s −1 and 0.1 s −1 ) at 1150 °C with references. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) were used to characterize the oxide behaviour and microstructure evolution. Tensile tests at room temperature were conducted on bonded samples and references to reveal the interface bond ratio. 100\% bonding strength, equivalent to the base metal&#39;s strength and ductility, was achieved at the large strain of 50\% for all three strain rates.},

The folding wavelength of GHMC is significantly decreased and it can produce more number of folds compared with the square tube. Under the condition of the same mass, the peak crushing force of GHMC decreases meanwhile its energy absorption increase by 10.1\% to 72.44\% compared with the square tube. Effect of hierarchical level and cell wall thickness on the energy absorption and their deformation mode under different height-length ratio ( H / L ) and cell wall thickness have been analyzed.

Through a series of roasting experiments, this research quantitatively investigated the impact of MgO on the roasted microstructure and consolidation behavior of magnetite based on previous research. The results showed that with the increase of MgO content in pellets, the consolidation index of pellets decreased from 0.71 to 0.50, and the porosity increased from 7.24\% to 13.57\%. The existence of MgO could hinder the interface interaction, reduce the consolidation index and increase the porosity. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the crystal transformation and migration behavior from a molecular standpoint. The simulation findings revealed that the creation of the sintering neck was caused by atom migration and diffusion. Mg 2 SiO 4 has minimal influence on the migration of the atoms, while MgO and MgFe 2 O 4 have a large impact on pellet consolidation. This work gave new ideas for evaluating porous sintering materials, which may lead to additional research into the interface interaction between heterogeneous oxide during the sintering material formation process.},

However, the superhydrophobicity is vulnerable to failure under service environments due to the exfoliation and degradation of surface material. Hence, a bilayer composite coating composed of microarc oxidation layer and superhydrophobic layer was fabricated to protect Mg alloys by modulating superhydrophobic coating/substrate interface. The bilayer coating with a water contact angle of 158.3° possesses excellent water-repellent, and self-cleaning properties. In addition, the bilayer coating consistently remains superhydrophobicity in acid, alkaline, high/low temperature, and ultraviolet radiation environments, indicating the excellent environmental stability. Notedly, the lowest-frequency impedance value of bilayer coating (6.78 × 10 6 Ω·cm) increases five orders of magnitude compared with that of Mg alloy (60.2 Ω·cm), and the inhibition efficiency is calculated to be 99.99\%. The excellent corrosion resistance of coating is attributed to the synergistic barrier protection of microarc oxidation layer and superhydrophobic layer, implying that it provides effective protection for Mg alloy. Therefore, the as-prepared bilayer coating has great application prospects in corrosion protection of Mg alloys toward different service environments.},

Specifically focusing on recently proposed biocompatible refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) in the body-centered cubic structure, we conduct systematic density-functional theory calculations to investigate the single-crystal elastic properties of 21 Ti-containing RHEAs. Our results provide evidence that the valence electron count has a dominant influence on elastic anisotropy and crystal directions of low Young’s modulus and high torsion modulus in the RHEAs. By means of modeling the orientation distribution function for crystallographic texture, we examine the effect of non-random texture on the anisotropic poly-crystalline Young’s modulus and torsion modulus with varying texture sharpness. We adopt fiber textures that can result from rolling and distinct texture orientations that can form during rapid directional solidification. We discuss the potential for lowering Young’s modulus in the RHEAs by using single crystals or textured aggregates. Furthermore, we prepare four of the theoretically considered alloys by arc-melting and report their lattice parameters, quasi-isotropic Young’s moduli, and Wickers hardnesses.},

For the three principle low-index planes, the corrosion rates followed the sequence of (0 0 1) &lt; (1 0 1) &lt; (1 1 1). More interestingly, there is a clear correlation between crystallographic orientation and surface faceting of grains in 90Cu-10Ni. Grains orientated near the three principle low-index planes and the (1 1 2) plane exhibit four different types of submicron-scale post-corrosion morphologies, respectively. However, each type of the faceted structure is bounded by {0 0 1} planes which have the lowest corrosion rate, independent of the substrate grain orientation. This is supported by the crystallographic models and AFM topographic measurements. Current study provides a simple way to identify grain orientation by etching, and also promising solutions to optimize corrosion properties through tailoring surface texture and design micro- or nano-scale surface structure by controlled etching.},

Bake-out heat treatments are employed during processing to allow hydrogen trapped in microstructural features to effuse from the samples, but the optimal times and temperatures depend on the kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in the material. In this work, Gaussian process surrogate models are employed to emulate the outputs of microstructure-sensitive diffusion differential equations in steel. Training the models by sequentially increasing the number of dimensions results in better performances and shorter training times. Two main approaches are developed: single output models with experimental design for the prediction of optimal bake-out times, and multi-output principal component analysis models for the prediction of hydrogen concentration evolution. A novel approach is implemented to shorten the training times of multi-trap models by exploiting the symmetry of the equations with respect to different kinds of traps. The resulting models pave the way for the implementation of Gaussian processes on more computationally expensive diffusion simulations for the optimisation of heat treatments and other applications.},

To understand these phenomena, the impacts of laser welding parameters and ambient pressure on the porosity and weld geometry were examined. Porosity ratio was found linearly increasing with the laser power or linear energy. High-speed imaging revealed that the large pores were formed by multiple merging of small pores, which explained the decrease in fine porosity (&lt;20 μm) but increase in coarse porosity (50–100 μm) when increasing laser power or linear energy. The vacuum ambiance significantly enlarged the pores (up to ∼400 μm) and formed narrow and deep welds. As pressure increased from 0.1 MPa to 0.4 MPa, the porosity ratio was dramatically decreased from ∼10.2\% to ∼2.3\% accompanied by a decline in porosity size and weld penetration depth. Numerical simulation results revealed that the shallowed weld penetration under high-pressure ambiance was attributed to the decreased recoil pressure, and the reduced porosity ratio was resulted from the high pressure which limited pore growth and merging.},

This work proposes a shape optimization framework to obtain uniform thickness shell lattices with superior elastic moduli and isotropic elasticity. A B-spline parameterized Monge patch model is used to represent the mid-surface within the 1/48 unit cell, which maintains the cubic symmetry and simplifies the sensitivity evaluation. Two groups of elastically isotropic shell lattices are obtained, including Primitive (P) and I-graph-wrapped package (IWP). The highest achievable bulk, Young’s, shear moduli of P/IWP family lattices are nearly 70\%/80\%, 40\%/60\%, 40\%/60\% of the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds at 10\% relative density. Besides, the Young’s/bulk modulus maximization is further introduced into the optimization to seek potential stiffness improvement, yielding similar optimized lattices with close stiffness for arbitrary initial designs. The highest achievable moduli are slightly improved by 3~5\% than those without moduli maximization. In general, P-family lattices possess comparable Young’s, shear and higher bulk moduli to the stiffest truss lattices, while IWP-family lattices possess superior stiffness. This work proposes a systematic design approach to obtain elastically isotropic uniform thickness shell lattices, which can be applied to the other lattice families with Monge patch representations.},

The interaction between bitumen and CRM re-distributes the bitumen fractions and creates a multiphase internal structure of AR. Although the superior aging resistance of AR has been acknowledged, the aging mechanism of AR remains unclear due to the limited understanding on the behaviors of different phases of AR during aging. This study aims to investigate the structural and mechanical evolution of AR binder during aging through micromechanical back-calculation and experimental tests. A series of separation methods were used to disintegrate the multiphase system of AR at four aging conditions. The mechanical properties of different phases obtained from frequency sweep tests and their volumetric fractions were used as the input for the micromechanical back-calculation, which yielded accurate prediction for the complex modulus of swelling rubber but failed for that of undissolved rubber, so further chemical characterization was conducted to estimate its mechanical evolution. The results indicated that the aging of AR is a process in which internal multiphase structures changed simultaneously with mechanical properties. All subphases became stiffer but their influences on the overall mechanical property of AR variated after aging.},

  abstract     = {Dental caries, the world’s most prevalent infectious disease, is caused by the diffusion of hydroxyl ions into tooth structures. To prevent dental caries, the application of fluoride (F) and zinc (Zn) ions to teeth surfaces are potential effective measures. In this study, The ionic influence, especially the chemical bond of F and Zn, on the acid resistance of dentin were investigated by particle induced X-ray / gamma-ray emission, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results showed Zn was distributed in the limited surface layer of dentin without altering its crystal structure. From the Zn K edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure, Zn incorporated into dentin was surrounded by oxygen and demonstrated four-fold coordination. The bond length and chemical state of Zn–O in Zn doped dentin suggested newly generated Zn–O covalent bond, which may improve acid resistance of dentin. This study showed that the atomic and molecular structures, such as the molecular distances and chemical state, influenced acid resistance of teeth, emphasizing the validity of chemical state analysis for understanding properties in biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Given the huge number of products transported worldwide every day, it would be advantageous to use lightweight pallets made of readily recyclable materials that are easy to clean, durable, and cheap to maintain. However, the design process for new metal pallets does not follow any specific code, which makes the transition to products with improved characteristics more challenging. This paper describes the development of a new modular steel pallet that combines blocks and deck boards to produce a range of configurable geometries for use in transportation (forklifting) and stationary (racking, stacking) conditions alike. Analytical and numerical analyses using the 3D finite element method (FEM) were carried out. Experimental tests were performed to evaluate ultimate strengths and deformations for different loadings. The experimental results used to validate the numerical models showed that these pallets performed well in terms of stiffness, deformation, and stresses. A comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) was also carried out to identify the main environmental impacts of the life cycle of pallets made from different materials. The results of a “cradle-to-gate with options” model suggest that the new proposed pallet performs better than its wood, plastic, and aluminium counterparts.},

The esterification was confirmed by FTIR and NMR. XRD analysis showed that the crystallinity of AE fiber increased by 235\%. The test results of mechanical properties showed that the modulus has seen an increase of 41.18\% and strength an increase of 78.4\%. Interestingly, the contact angle was found to increase from 54.6° to 121.9°. Moreover, the influences of polyol types (Ethylene glycol, Glycerol, Pentaerythritol) on the properties of AE fiber are also investigated, the types of polyol have obvious influences on the mechanical properties, crystallinity, and hydrophobicity in AE fibers. These results indicate that this strategy provides a broad application space for alginate-based materials.},

  abstract     = {Tailoring manufacturing processes to optimum part quality often requires numerous resource-intensive trial experiments in practice. Physics-based process simulations in combination with general-purpose optimisation algorithms allow for an a priori process optimisation and help concentrate costly trials on the most promising variants. However, considerable computation times are a significant barrier, especially for iterative optimisation. Surrogate-based optimisation often helps reduce the computational effort but surrogate models are typically case-specific and cannot adapt to different manufacturing situations. Consequently, even minor problem variations e.g. geometry adaptions invalidate the surrogate and require resampling of data and retraining of the surrogate. Reinforcement Learning aims at inferring optimal actions in variable situations. In this work, it is used to train a neural network to estimate optimal process parameters (“actions”) for variable component geometries (“situations”). The use case is fabric forming in which pressure pads are positioned to optimise the material intake. After training, the network is found to give meaningful parameter estimations even for new geometries not considered during training. Thus, it extracts reusable information from generic process samples and successfully applies it to new, non-generic components. Since data is reused rather than resampled, the approach is deemed a promising option for lean part and process development.},

  abstract     = {Carbon has a low solid solubility in bcc tungsten at equilibrium. However, metastable supersaturated solid solutions can be synthesized with magnetron sputtering. Here, we present a systematic study on the phase stability and mechanical properties of such supersaturated W–C solid solutions. Θ–2θ scans show a split of the 200/020 and the 002 peaks for supersaturated films which is explained by a tetragonal distortion of the bcc structure. This split increases with increasing C content and is maximized at 4 at.\% C, where we observe an a / b axis of 3.15–3.16 Å and a c -axis of 3.21–3.22 Å. We performed first-principles calculations of lattice parameters, mixing enthalpies, elastic constants and polycrystalline elastic moduli for cubic and tetragonal W–C solid solutions. Calculations show that tetragonal structure is more stable than the bcc supersaturated solid solution and the calculated lattice parameters and Young’s moduli follow the same trends as the experimental ones as a function of C concentration. The results suggest that supersaturated films with lattice distortion can be used as a design approach to improve the properties of transition metal films with a bcc structure.},

This is the first time nano-fibrillation is applied to tailor FR composites for foam applications with desired microcellular structure. As highlight of this work, the presence of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanofibrils serves multiple roles by compensating for reduced foaming behavior of highly-filled matrix, and contributing to enhancing FR efficiency and stiffness. Inclusion of 1 wt\% nanofibrils in polystyrene (PS) filled with 30 wt\% expandable graphite (EG), tunned melt rheological properties leading to improving cell density up to two orders of magnitude. The average cell size of the foam also decreased from 103 μm to 10 μm, with respect to PS/EG, improving compressive strength and modulus. The entangled PTFE nanofibrils transformed the fluffy char layer into a dense one, preventing matrix disintegration and dripping to meet UL94-V0. This was confirmed by reduced fire growth rate (FIGRA), peak heat release rate (PHRR) and peak smoke production rate (PSPR) in cone calorimetry. The unique characteristics of this composite make it promising for fabricating FR polymeric foams for various applications including automotive, aerospace, electronics and construction, necessitating high fire safety level.},

A theoretical NMSPM model is proposed for predicting the sound absorption coefficient (SAC) of NMSPM. The experimental results demonstrate that the nanofibrous membrane can effectively improve the acoustic performance of substrate porous materials (SPM) based on specific material parameters conditions, which also compare well with the numerical results of the theoretical NMSPM model. The applicability of the theoretical NMSPM model for different sorts of SPMs is explained based on both the experimental and numerical results. A suitable thickness range of nanofibrous membrane for effectively improving the SAC of SPM is given through a series of numerical analyses.

Results of electrochemical tests manifest that increasing the F − concentration and/or reducing pH value can deteriorate the corrosion performance of Ti80 alloy due to the dissolution of the compact passive film into the porous passive film. Besides, the electrochemical parameters obtained from polarization curves indicate that the F − concentration has few effects on the cathodic reaction but noticeable promoting effects on the anodic process, whereas the increase of pH plays a significant role in inhibiting both cathodic and anodic processes. In addition, surface characterizations reveal the preferential dissolution of the equiaxed α phase compared to the intergranular β phase, resulting from its relatively low Volta potential. We also interpret the F − concentrations and pH values dependent corrosion behaviour based on the mixed potential theory and illustrate the corrosion mechanisms associated with F − in artificial seawater. We believe that the insights into the F − concentration and pH value dependent corrosion behaviour can provide practical guidelines for the design and development of Ti alloys with high-corrosion resistance.},

The shielding performance and the electrical property could be controlled by adjusting the content of SiO 2 . The infrared transmittance of SiO 2 /Cu was 23.29\% at 1 ∼ 3 μm, 22.92\% at 3 ∼ 5 μm and 21.70\% at 8 ∼ 14 μm.

Differential scanning calorimetry was used to evaluate the stored energy of monolithic SiC and SiC fiber–reinforced SiC matrix composite variants following neutron irradiation under light water reactor–relevant dose and temperature conditions. The tests were performed at heating rates of 0.5, 3, and 20 K/min up to 1,273 K. The onset temperature of the energy release roughly corresponded to the irradiation temperature, and energy release was delayed as the heating rate increased. The monolithic and composite specimens exhibited similar stored energy release behavior up to ∼ 1,000 K, and above that temperature, the energy release depended more on material type. The energy release measured in this study is below the material-specific heat capacity at temperatures below ∼1,000 K but exceeds it under certain material and annealing conditions at temperatures above ∼1,000 K. The amount of irradiation-induced volumetric swelling of the specimens was an indication of the total stored energy. Based on this observation, the energy release behavior was described by a swelling recovery model.},

  abstract     = {Eleven-layered AZ31/AA1050 composite plates were fabricated using a single-shot explosive welding process. The microstructural evolution of the interfacial layers were thoroughly investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The microstructural observations were correlated with microhardness measurements and bending tests to evaluate the mechanical properties of the clads. Under the applied detonation velocities, only the first interface was wavy, whereas the others were flat. Near all the interfaces, local melting and rapid solidification led to the formation of reaction regions composed of different phases with various chemical compositions and structures. In addition to the two equilibrium phases of γ- Mg 17 Al 12 and β- Mg 2 Al 3 identified in the reaction regions, a significant portion of the solidified melt was composed of non-equilibrium phases exhibiting an amorphous or ultra-fine-grained structure. During subsequent annealing, the high-hardness γ- Mg 17 Al 12 and β- Mg 2 Al 3 phases grew rapidly near all interfaces, whereas inside pre-existing reaction regions, the areas with various chemical compositions systematically transformed into the β- Mg 2 Al 3 phase. It was found that the application of a pressure of 3 MPa plays an important role in avoiding clad delamination during heating; however, it does not prevent the formation of linear cracks in the β- Mg 2 Al 3 phase, which significantly decreases the formability of the composite.},

  abstract     = {Two nano-scaled hexagonal distortions in high temperature BCC phase during cooling is commonly observed in many alloys systems. Although efforts have been made on studying the lattice softening of the BCC structure during cooling, the distortion mechanisms are less addressed. Thus, the formation of two hexagonal structures in the β precipitates in a Cu-40Zn alloy treated by ECP was thoroughly investigated. Results show that the β precipitates contain two kinds of nano-sized and diffuse atomic clusters one with a η structure obeying the Burgers OR and the other a ω structure obeying the Blackburn OR. They were each formed through a two-stepped atomic displacement. For the η structure, the first step is the atomic shuffle of each second 110 β 110β plane in the 11¯0 &gt; β direction and the second is a structure change mainly by a {1 1 ¯ 1¯ 2} 1¯ 11&gt; β shear. For the ω structure, the first is an atomic shuffle on each second and third { 11 2 ¯ } β {112¯}β plane in the ± [1 1 1] β directions and then normal strains in three mutually perpendicular directions. The concomitant formation of the two structures minimizes the lattice distortion of single formation. The present results provide new information on the formation mechanism of the two hexagonal structures in a BCC matrix.},

In order to evaluate how characteristics such as the porosity level, the shape and the spatial distribution of pores influence the ultimate strength and endurance limit of the material, a direct method based statistical framework is presented in this paper. Within this framework, a random sampling strategy is developed to bridge heterogeneities associated with two sub-scales, namely the scale of micro pores and the scale of material constituents. Through statistical analyses of results calculated from many 2.5D and 3D representative volume element (RVE) samples, the study shows that micro pores have more severe impact on endurance limit than on ultimate strength: With an averaged porosity degree of 0.71\%, the former case drops for more than 20.0\%\% while the latter case is almost unchanged. Meanwhile, compared to shape, spatial distribution of pores has a more significant influence on the endurance limit. The analysis in this paper shows that the established approach can be a viable means for studying similar AM materials and guiding reliability design of AM structures.},

Altered redox regulation is a cancer phenotype and damages both the DNA and free deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool. MutT Homolog1 (MTH1) plays a critical role in removing oxidized dNTPs, avoiding incorporation of these damaged bases. This study aimed to construct a self-assembly reproducible nanoplatform (SRNA) to actualize cancer phenotypic lethality in solid tumors by efficiently delivering of MTH1 siRNA (siMTH1). Compared with conventional polymer vectors, the synthesized cholesteryl-peptides had precise molecular weights, good biocompatibility and low variability. Thus, the cholesteryl-peptides were used to form a compact SRNA with siMTH1 and protect siMTH1 against degradation. The SRNA silenced MTH1 expression and accumulated oxidized dNTPs in cancer cells, leading to a therapeutic response in ovarian cancer. In summary, the SRNA for the efficient delivery of siMTH1 may provide a practical paradigm to induce cancer phenotypic lethality in solid tumors.},

Gyroid uniform lattice structures and gyroid graded lattice structures are mathematically designed and fabricated using selective laser melting with a SS 316 L stainless steel powder. The mechanical properties of these structures are studied under a compression load, and the deformation differences between the graded and uniform structures are compared. The finite element method is used to simulate the compression process, and the experimental and simulation results are qualitatively compared. Results show that during plastic deformation, the stress change in the graded structure is larger than that in the uniform structure. By controlling the volume fraction, mechanical properties can be specifically tailored, which provides the design guidelines for the application of this structure.},

This paper presents a multiscale topology optimization method of the GAPSSs, which is capable of designing both thicknesses of two solid face sheets at macroscale and configurations of porous core at microscale for minimizing dynamic compliance. Specifically, at macroscale, a variable thickness sheet method is employed to optimize the thicknesses of two solid face sheets. Then, at microscale, a parametric level-set method integrated with a numerical homogenization approach is applied to topologically optimize the configuration of the periodic unit cell. The method of moving asymptotes is adopted to update the design variables at both scales. Several 2D and 3D numerical examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for designing the GAPSSs. The results indicate that the dynamic compliance of the optimized GAPSSs show superior advantages over the conventional sandwich structures with identical face sheet thicknesses and predefined lattice core.},

Patterning the hot film resulted in the composite panels retaining most of their flexibility without losing their ballistic performance compared to when they are laminated with plain (not patterned) hot film.

In this work, we use density functional theory to systematically investigate the bulk trapping and storage capabilities of the transition metal carbides. We specifically examine how trapping and storage changes with the transition metal, from the group IVB to group VIB, carbon concentration, and structure. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the trap energy and the number of valence electrons in the transition metal, suggesting that the group IVB transition metal carbides are the best carbides for trapping and storage. Hydrogen preferentially sits at octahedral interstices, e.g ., the carbon vacancies, in the structure except in certain cases near the Me 2 C concentration when tetrahedral interstices, devoid of nearest neighbor carbon, can become more favorable. Our results further demonstrate that the lower the carbon concentration, the more hydrogen the transition metal carbide can store. These results demonstrate which carbides will act as the best traps for hydrogen.},

Bulk-scale characterization provided microstructural information of the polycrystalline copper plate along with macroscopic mechanical properties. Micro-scale cantilevers with thicknesses ranging from 1.6 µm to 8.6 µm were fabricated within the copper plate using femtosecond laser machining followed by focused ion beam milling. Line load was applied on these samples utilizing a nanoindenter. Finite element analysis was performed to exclude the effect of substrate deformation. The measured effective elastic modulus increases from 94 GPa to 215 GPa with decreasing thickness. The increase of the bending rigidity is analyzed based on the couple stress theory, and the length scale parameter is measured as 0.78 µm.

  abstract     = {Shape memory materials draw much attention due to various promising potential applications. This work prepares a novel shape memory composite via grading photo-thermal curing method, which has not yet been reported. Expectedly, it merges advantages of epoxy-based shape memory polymer (EP) and polyvinyl alcohol-based shape memory polymer (PVA), which has applicable stiffness and multi-stimuli responsive performance. The unsatisfactory mechanical properties of most water-driven shape memory polymer (SMP) is expected to be solved by this fabrication strategy, so that the application range of water-driven SMP could be further extended. The synergistic plasticization of PVA and EP dominates water-driven shape memory behavior of this composite. Interestingly, its water-driven shape memory performance is able to be further improved by immersed in HCl/EtOH solution. The glassy-to-rubbery modulus ratio ( E′ g /E′ r ) of the PVA/EP-HCl/EtOH is about 650 after immersed in 0.1 mol/L HCl/EtOH for 6 h. In addition, this immersed method also can solve the post curing problem of such cationic photocuring. It is an easy, efficient, economical strategy for improving synergistic water-driven shape memory performance. Furthermore, this shape memory composite is expected to provide new perspective and practical approach to realize the intellectualization of underwater deployment and release structure.},

  abstract     = {High precision lattice structure (LS) shows great potential applications in aerospace, acoustic, biomedical, and wearable products due to its multifunctional characteristics and excellent mechanical properties. Inspired by lightweight, high-strength, and high-stability glass sponges (GSs), a unique circle-/grid-like heterogeneous glass sponge lattice structure (GSLS) was successfully designed and manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) with Ti6Al4V alloy. Compared with the commonly used body-centred cubic (BCC), face-centred cubic (FCC), honeycomb and diamond LSs, GSLS displays the strongest compressive properties ( E = 1560 MPa, σ max = 40 MPa, σ y0.2 = 34 MPa, W = 5.95 J). The normalised elastic modulus and normalised compressive strength of GSLS are almost 1.4 and 1.3 times, 2.6 and 2.4 times, 2.7 and 3.5 times, 18 and 8.3 than that of FCC, BCC, honeycomb, and diamond LSs, respectively. Most importantly, unlike the 45° diagonal shear failure of homogeneous BCC and FCC, the FEA simulation reveals that the heterogeneous unit cell in GSLS can enhance the strut connectivity, disperse the stress, and exhibits a unique fracture mechanism of cell-after-cell and layer-by-layer. The fracture mechanism of GSLS can improve the load-bearing capability, maintain strength, and protect its interior and entire integrity during compression.},

  abstract     = {The presence of TiC in Ti alloys is ubiquitous, so, for the interest of exploring its effects, carbon is added in Ti-5553 (beta phase alloy). After fabrication, sintering and multi heat treatments are done to get desired microstructure (TiC in beta, alpha and alpha-matrix). Quasi-static compression, three-point bend test, nano-indentation, and abrasion tests are conducted to study the microstructural response. Different analyzing tools such as SEM, EDS, EBSD, and HRTEM are used to examine microstructural changes before and after fracture. Results showed that TiC crystals are hard and brittle, and favorite sites for crack nucleation and propagation. After comparing both the curves and their corresponding micrographs, it is concluded that the propagation speed of the crack is much faster in TiC as compared to the beta and alpha phases. Furthermore, an increase in the value of strain upon reaching a crack at the TiC/Tiᵦ, and TiC/Ti α interface justifies that these phases offer comparatively more toughness and ductility. In addition, the presence of these crystals in the beta phase initiate fracture almost within half of the elastic limit of Ti-5553 beta phase alloy. Conclusively, TiC has an adverse effect on titanium&#39;s mechanical properties if shape and size are not controlled.},

Drug-loaded filaments were developed for FDM process by hot-melt extrusion (HME). Polycaprolactone was used as a drug delivery carrier, and ibuprofen as the model drug. Notably, chitosan was dissolved to form controlled and efficient release channels. The printability, changes in physical and chemical properties during HME and FDM processes of the filament, and drug release behavior, mechanism and biocompatibility of the implants were investigated. The results showed that the filament tensile strength decreased with the increase of drug and chitosan content. No obvious degradation and chemical change occurred during the whole process.

The ultrasonic probe was directly dipped into the local molten pool and traveled behind the arc during deposition. Comprehensive experimental studies were performed and the UA-WAAM sample showed superiorities over conventional WAAM ones in multiple perspectives including a lower number of porosities, refined solidification structure, and less agglomerated nanoparticle distribution under the same deposition parameters. These improved microstructure features led to enhanced mechanical properties of the UA-WAAM samples, as reflected in the tensile tests and hardness measurement results. The benefits of nanoparticles in the formation of equiaxed grain structures and strength contribution was further leveraged by UA based on their better dispersion. The ultrasonic effects on WAAM process can be mainly attributed to the two nonlinear physical phenomena: acoustic cavitation and streaming induced by power ultrasound in molten metal.},

  abstract     = {The last few years have witnessed explosive growth in the design and development of various photothermal agents (PTAs) to realize phtothermal therapy (PTT) for eradicating solid tumors. Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy of PTT is still restricted by several obstacles, especially the thermotolerance of tumors, which might potentially induce inflammatory disease, damage normal organs, or even lead to tumor recurrence. Exploitation of innovative strategies to enhance PTT at mild temperature is thus the key determinant toward successful clinical use of PTT. In this review, we dissect the cell death mechanism triggered by PTT at different temperature, indicating that enhancing apoptosis pathway is favorable for PTT at mild temperature. The recent advances in the construction of mild-temperature PTT through regulating heat shock proteins expression, autophagy level, free radical generation and organelle targeting to overcome tumor thermotolerance are susequently concluded, along with the excellent and representative examples of combining mild-temperature PTT with other therapies (i.e. photodynamic therapy, chemodynamic therapy, starvation therapy and gas therapy), which exhibits the remarkable superadditive effect. Furthermore, the key scientific and technical challenges for mild-temperature PTT are also discussed to accelerate clinical translation.},

AlCl 3 was used to provide coordination center, and the formaldehyde aqueous solution was chosen as crosslinker. The effect of Al 3+ content and mass fraction of formaldehyde on gel formation, mechanical property and water storage capacity of CIS-Al 3+ hydrogels was investigated deeply. The obtained CIS-Al 3+ hydrogel can store more than 500\% of its own weight of water without cracking, which demonstrates its super-absorbency. Besides, the CIS-Al 3+ hydrogels can swell/shrink in response to the change of external stimuli such as temperature, pH and salinity. These outstanding properties, together with the low-cost raw materials, simple preparation method and biocompatible and biodegradable properties, enable CIS-Al 3+ hydrogels to be applied as water storage materials in the agriculture field and pH-responsive materials in the future.},

The rubber-like PDMS formed microdomains at the PTU/air interface, while silicone oil was distributed between the PDMS microdomains. The tensile strength of PPZO nanocomposite was approximately 63 MPa, two to four hundred times higher than the tensile strength of previously reported oil-modified coatings. The adhesion strength of PPZO to the substrate was 30 times higher than that of pure PDMS. After a five-month dynamic field test, the PPZO surface revealed much less biofouling than the references (AlMg3 and PTU), confirming its long-term biofouling control property. The attached algae on PPZO could easily and completely be removed by gentle brush cleaning. The good biofouling control property of PPZO can be attributed to the increased water repellency (signified by the increased water contact angle) and the surface slippage by silicone oil incorporation.},

According to the design principle and printing strategy, the proof-of-concept sensor arrays (e.g. with 8 × 8 and 4 × 16 grids) are designed and printed by bottom-up hierarchies from the layered components (e.g. wires, filaments and isolation intervals) to the main arrays through distributed printing sub-arrays (4 × 4 grids). In particular, the strain field surrounding a hole is monitored in high-precision based on the present strain sensor. This work also provides insights of sensor array from adaptive design to high-efficient DIW-fabrication for other applications including wearable electronics, small-batch equipment and individual medical devices.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the cold-spray process, or simply cold spray, is an extensively used technique in coating applications. The low temperature of the deposition process is the distinctive feature that makes it suitable for many additive manufacturing activities such as repair and restoration of damaged components. The reliability of the coatings is strongly dependent on the velocity of the powder during its impact on the target surface. Spraying conditions such as the pressure and temperature of the carrier gas and the geometry of the nozzle control the acceleration of the powder particles. Consequently, there is an increasing interest in the optimisation of nozzle geometry so as to maximise the acceleration of the particles through the nozzle path that they follow. In contrast with various extant approaches to achieve this aim (finite element modelling, experimental approach, and analytical methods), an alternative model based on the one-dimensional isentropic theory that accounts for the dynamics of the dilute two-phase flow was developed in this study. First, an analysis of the common hypotheses used to obtain the equation of motion of the particle was carried out. Subsequently, with the new insights revealed from the previous analysis, a new theoretical model for the optimisation of the divergent part of the nozzle was performed considering a geometric angle restriction. This model is based on the numerical integration of the equation of motion of the particle, ensuring the maximisation of the particle drag force by means of the Lagrange multiplier method. Once the analytical model is formulated, a set of curves describing the optimal geometric parameters for different conditions is obtained. Moreover, some optimal geometries are presented demonstrating the low influence of the angle restriction. Additionally, the inversely proportional relationship between stagnation pressure and temperature is revealed.},

In the current study, the influence of different novel scan strategies on residual stress, porosities, microstructure, and crystallographic texture has been investigated for complex L-shape parts made from nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718). Four different novel scanning strategies representing total fill, re-melting, and two different sectional scanning strategies, were investigated using neutron diffraction , neutron imaging, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. These results were compared with the corresponding results for an L-shape sample printed with the conventional strategy used for achieving high density and more uniform crystallographic texture. Among these investigated novel strategies, the re-melting strategy yielded approximately a 25\% reduction in surface residual stress in comparison to the reference sample. The other two sectional scanning strategies revealed porosities at the interfaces of the sections and due to these lower levels of residual stress were also observed. Also, variation in crystallographic texture was observed with different scan strategies.},

  abstract     = {The absorptivity of a material is a major uncertainty in numerical simulations of laser welding and additive manufacturing, and its value is often calibrated through trial-and-error exercises. This adversely affects the capability of numerical simulations when predicting the process behaviour and can eventually hinder the exploitation of fully digitised manufacturing processes, which is a goal of “industry 4.0”. In the present work, an enhanced absorption model that takes into account the effects of laser characteristics, incident angle, surface temperature, and material composition is utilised to predict internal heat and fluid flow in laser melting of stainless steel 316L. Employing such an absorption model is physically more realistic than assuming a constant absorptivity and can reduce the costs associated with calibrating an appropriate value. High-fidelity three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed using both variable and constant absorptivity models and the predictions compared with experimental data. The results of the present work unravel the crucial effect of absorptivity on the physics of internal flow in laser material processing. The difference between melt-pool shapes obtained using fibre and CO 2 laser sources is explained, and factors affecting the local energy absorption are discussed.},

In this work, the interaction between grooves and impurities was studied, and the evolution model of groove was proposed. It has been found that the crystal growth rate and the impurity content in the groove determine the evolution behavior of the groove. Correspondingly, the migration behavior of impurities in groove with solidification was studied and the mathematical model was proposed to describe the anomalous enrichment phenomenon. This work is helpful to understand the distribution behavior of impurities in micro-zone such as groove and make a theoretical foundation for the deep removal of impurities.},

The mechanical properties, microstructure, interface, tribofilm, elements and microhardness of samples were analyzed by hardness tester, SEM, EDS and nanoindentation tests. The braking performances were measured by a tribometer mimicking the braking conditions. The results show that the wettability and combination between ferrophosphorus and matrix is poor and carbonyl iron is more suitable for strengthening matrix. The friction coefficient is most stable and the wear rate is also relatively low with 10\% carbonyl iron. The increase of carbonyl iron content will promote oxidation and be conducive to the formation of friction film. The oxide degree of friction film increases in the direction from the matrix to the surface. However, too much iron powder produces excessive iron oxide which makes the friction film be easy to peel off especially under high speeds.},

The synergistic strengthening effect of van der Waals forces and covalent bonds can improve the tensile strength of the composite up to170.2 MPa, which is far greater than that of other MXene-based composites previously reported. In addition, the EMI shielding performance of the Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene/CFf/TPU composite also improved with increasing MXene mass fraction, reaching 40.4 dB, which can be attributed to the dielectric loss provided by conductive fillers and the enhanced absorption within the sandwich structure. More interestingly, the composite retained excellent resistance stability, EMI-SE stability and flexibility, even after multiple bending and releasing cycles. This work provides a facile and environmentally-friendly method for preparing composites with excellent EMI shielding properties and mechanical properties, which may provide more possibilities for applications in intelligent wear and electronic wireless communication equipment.},

The PANI/BTA nanocapsules had dual functions: (1) PANI as a saline (NaCl)-responsive gatekeeper could achieve the controllable release of BTA corrosion inhibitors, which could adsorb on the metal surface to inhibit corrosion; (2) PANI can prompt the formation of Fe 2 O 3 passive layer. Besides, the thermo-responsive SMP coating could narrow the scratch size after heating, which was beneficial to reduce the amount of corrosion inhibitors needed to fully cover the steel surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to investigate the self-healing performance of the coatings containing different contents of PANI/BTA nanocapsules. Furthermore, the synergetic inhibition effects of PANI, BTA and SMP coating were demonstrated using scanning electrochemical microscopy. The results indicated that the healed 0.5 wt\% PANI/BTA coating exhibited an excellent self-healing property and its self-healing efficiency was higher than 96\%.

In order to overcome these disadvantages, a silicate-based interface strengthening agent (ISA) is herein designed to penetrate into layer interface and generate a dense precipitation phase (hydrated calcium silicate gel) from the reaction with portlandite, a weak phase with lower mechanical properties. Through this enhancing strategy, both horizontal and vertical layer interface exhibit remarkable bonding strength higher than that of matrix material, turning the intrinsic weak interface to a “robust interface”. The strengthening mechanism is attributed to the modification of interfacial hydration products and the densification of multi-scaled pore structure at interface region, which is demonstrated via synthetical characterizations along with molecular dynamics simulations. This interface strengthening method based on silicate penetration and precipitation provides a convenient and effective approach to preparing robust layer interface stronger than its cement matrix.},

However, the formation of heat transfer pathways of h-BN in thermal interface materials is restricted due to its poor aqueous dispersity. Herein, water-soluble lignosulfonate (LS) is used to promote the dispersion of h-BN, the phenolic hydroxyl and three-dimensional structure of LS could form hydrogen bonding or steric hindrance with h-BN under ultrasound treatment. After mixing with cellulose nanofiber (CNF), the three-dimensional thermally conductive pathways are built in LS-BN/CNF aerogel through freeze-drying. The results show that the through-plane thermal conductivity of LS-BN/CNF/PVA composite with 0.2 wt\% LS (LS0.2-BN/CNF/PVA) exceeds 1.22 W/mK when the h-BN/CNF ratio is 3:1 (w/w), which is 6.1-fold of that of PVA film (0.20 W/mK). The initial decomposition temperature and tensile strength of LS0.2-BN/CNF/PVA composite are 205 °C and 38.5 MPa, respectively, demonstrating acceptable thermal stability and mechanical properties for electronics as thermal interface and packing material. Overall, this work put forwards an effective approach to disperse h-BN and paves the way in developing high-performance thermal interface materials.},

A novel gradient composite layer that includes a hardened nitrided layer and a self-lubricating DLC structure at the outermost surface was fabricated on M50 steel via plasma-assisted thermochemical treatment. The structure evolution of the modified layer was comprehensively characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the nanoparticles embedded in the DLC structure gradually increase until the nitrided diffusion layer. The DLC structure is like being anchored in the nitrided layer by nanoparticles carbide/nitride. The inner of the pre-nitrided layer is hardly affected during the plasma carburizing process. The gradient structure is verified to endow the treated samples with functionally graded hardness profile and super wear resistance by Vickers hardness tester, Nano-indentation tester, and pin-on-disk tribometer. The composite layer&#39;s tribological behavior was discussed through wear scar morphology observation by SEM and chemical structure in tracks with Raman spectroscopy.

Stable and rapid jetting (Z number: 1.83, 8 m/s) was achieved using cyclohexanol-based viscosity modifiers and optimisation of the print settings.

  abstract     = {A multifactorial experimental research on erosion-corrosion behavior of liquid–solid swirling flow in pipeline was carried out by a circulating loop system in combination with a variety of test methods. The analysis of statistical significance reveals that the variation of erosion-corrosion rate is explained by three main effects (velocity, sand size, and sand concentration) and two interactions (velocity/sand size and sand size/sand concentration). An empirical linear regression equation with a R 2 value of 0.9043 was established to describe the correlation of erosion-corrosion rate with the test parameters and their interactions. It is concluded by microstructural examination of the working electrode surface that under the condition of liquid–solid swirling flow, cutting and corrosion pits are the primary forms of surface damage. The comparative analysis of erosion-corrosion between swirling flow and non-swirling flow shows that the net effect of swirling flow on erosion-corrosion varies with sand size. The corrosion product analysis by EDS and XPS show the presence of Fe 2 O 3 and CaCO 3 under swirling flow and non-swirling flow conditions. Furthermore, the element content analysis of EDS and XPS showed that compared with the non-swirling flow, the oxygen content on the electrode surface under the swirling flow condition increased by 42.42\% and 35.06\%, respectively.},

The time and temperature of the austenitization and tempering steps were studied to achieve optimum materials performance in piston applications, including the balance of thermal and mechanical properties and resistance to long-term thermal aging. Reducing the tempering temperature from 700 to 600 °C caused a substantial increase in elevated temperature strength from 25 to 600 °C, but had no significant influence on thermal conductivity, suggesting that thermal conductivity in 422 is dominated largely by composition and distribution of alloying elements and mostly independent of the sub-grain structure size and precipitate size. Compared to the current HDDE piston alloy 4140, 422 exhibits substantially higher elevated temperature strength and lower thermal conductivity, the latter which will cause 422 to operate at higher temperatures in pistons, possibly requiring a piston redesign to take advantage of the improved high temperature strength of 422. Piston material selection and alloy design strategies with potential to mitigate some of the shortcomings of martensitic stainless steels, such as 422, as drop-in replacements are discussed.},

Cell attachment experiments revealed that the sintered HA disks did not exhibit cytotoxicity. Furthermore, various types of scaffolds (octahedral, circular, and frame) were designed and constructed using the optimal HA suspension. The designed octahedral scaffold exhibited the highest compressive strength, achieved a break strength improvement of 245\% compared with the circular scaffolds, and showed significant differences from the other scaffold types in bone cell proliferation and differentiation experiments. The ceramic suspension formulation proposed herein can be commonly applied for all commercialized 3D SLAs.

In this work, we developed and manufactured functionally-graded piezocomposite using poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] and barium titanate (BaTiO 3 , BTO) particles. Functionally graded materials offer better specific strength, toughness, and fatigue resistance than homogeneous composite materials, making them appropriate for energy-harvesting. Spin coating and hot-pressing methods were used to create BTO/P(VDF-TrFE) composites with varying BTO particle fractions and structures. After determining the optimal spin coating and hot-pressing conditions, the composites were polarized using the corona poling technique. The structure and properties of the composites were determined by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. Then the piezoelectric characteristics were tested, and impact and vibration energy production tests were devised and carried out. This research provides a feasible manufacturing method for functionally graded piezocomposites and investigates the material energy-harvesting potential. Meanwhile, guidance is offered for the construction of functionally graded piezoelectric composites structures for use in various types of energy-harvesting applications.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential chiral recognition functions induced by two kinds of novel chiral microenvironment-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN) for the oral delivery of the poorly water-soluble achiral drug indomethacin (IMC). The as-synthesized CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN with molecular chirality and high specific surface area (S BET : 1141 and 1075 m 2 /g, respectively) were successfully prepared through grafting chiral molecular functional groups. The characterization results showed that CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN were spherical nanoparticles with opposite chiral features and clearly visible pore channels. Meanwhile, they exhibited good biosafety and degradability. In vitro drug release study indicated that both CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN significantly improved IMC dissolution compared with naked-MSN (N-MSN) ( p &lt; 0.05) and exhibited different chiral recognition functions for drug release in the simulated chiral environments in vitro (pH 6.8 PBS-D/L), in which CMR-D-MSN could be triggered by the L-configurations in chiral environments and exhibited a better drug release effect. As expect, the results of in vivo biological effects disclosed that CMR-D-MSN had higher bioavailability of IMC and obvious advantages on drug adsorption and in vivo distribution, and exerted stronger anti-inflammatory effect after making specific response to the in vivo chiral environment.},

The effect of carbon fibers concentration and type, infill pattern and environmental temperatures on mechanical properties of the printed test samples were investigated. The measured tensile modulus of the printed composite ranged from 1.4 to 8.8 GPa, an increase of up to 6.3 times the value of the neat printed polymer. The tensile strength ranged from 40 to 90 MPa, for an increase of up to 2.15 times. Optimization of the environmental temperature for improved coalescence of filaments led to a fair increase in values of the tensile modulus and strength, with an improvement up to 1.5 and 2 times, respectively, for the printed samples with pattern orthogonal to the loading directions. Microstructure characterizations were performed for mechanical results interpretations, with the help of a specialized homogenization model.

  abstract     = {The shear thickening fluid (STF) with unique rheology is generally combined with polyurethane (PU) skeleton to manufacture flexible sandwich composites which is widely applied in impact resistence field. In this work, experiments and numerical simulations were comparatively analyzed to investigate the non-Newtonian fluid–solid interaction (NFSI) between STF and PU skeleton during low-velocity impact. Optimization of materials selection is proposed to achieve a higher impact resistance performance. It has been found that the synchronous gradient thickening and flow of STF facilitate the load-bearing and stress diffusion performance. In contrast to Newtonian fluids, the internal STF displays both shear resistence of high-viscosity fluid and easy flow characteristic of low-viscosity fluid, creating areas of low stress in composites and improve the impact resistance performance. The fluid-optimized STF-2 sandwich composite exhibits an up to 154.7\% lower peak load and 118.82\% higher energy absorption. In terms of the skeleton, a lower modulus of PU foam is conductive to a stronger NFSI, which facilitates the energy exchange between STF and skeleton and further improve the impact resistance performance. As a result, the skeleton-optimized composite containing PU-1 exhibits a 20.10\% lower peak load and 17.41\% higher energy absorption. The NFSI mechanism and material selection optimization between non-Newtonian fluid and large deformation materials proposed in this work provide an analysis idea and design method for flexible buffering composites.},

The simultaneous plastic deformation and heat generation during ShAPE rapidly fracture and dissolve interdendritic and intragranular secondary phases of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu, accomplishing homogenization in seconds rather than many hours in a furnace before extrusion. ShAPE thereby eliminates the energy-intensive and time-consuming homogenization step required to prepare as-cast microstructures for conventional extrusion. Concurrently, extensive grain refinement occurs due to gradient activation of dynamic recrystallization during ShAPE, which facilitates a threefold increase in extrusion speed compared to the conventional extrusion method. Evident enhancement of the mechanical properties of ShAPE + T6 samples is achieved, compared to the ASTM standard values for conventional extrusion products. The microstructural evolution pathway, involving the processes of grain refinement and secondary particle dissolution, is explained using scanning and transmission electron microscopy.},

Here, a combined free radical / cationic dual-curing dry film photoresists (DFRs) for 405 nm photolithography was developed based on functional acrylic resins containing oxetane pendant groups. The acrylic resins were successfully synthesized by free radical copolymerization of methyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid, ethyl methacrylate and 3-ethyl-3-(methacryloyloxy)methyloxetane. The structure and properties of resins were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The resins could undergo cationic photopolymerization to generate a film with good mechanical and thermal properties. Notably, the prepared DFRs showed excellent comprehensive performances including outstanding pattern transfer ability with a high resolution of 20 μm, high photosensitivity, high contrast, satisfactory developing speed, and good adhesion to the substrate. Such oxetane-containing acrylic resins may have potential application in high-performance DFRs.},

  abstract     = {Macroporous, partially L 1 0 -ordered Co-Pt films with nearly equiatomic composition were successfully synthesized by electrodeposition from an aqueous sulfate–chloride electrolyte on colloidal crystal-templated substrates, followed by annealing in vacuum. The colloids deposited on the substrate consisted of amidine-functionalized polystyrene spheres of 215 ± 13 nm in diameter, which were self-assembled by electrophoresis. As-deposited Co-Pt films obtained after the removal of the spheres showed a highly-packed arrangement of macropores. Structurally, the films showed the A1-disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) Co-Pt solid solution, accompanied by small amounts of fcc/hexagonal close-packed (hcp)–Co. Upon annealing at 600 °C, the A1-disordered phase partly transformed into the L 1 0 -ordered (face-centered tetragonal, fct) phase. As a result, the coercivity significantly increased from 148 Oe to 1328 Oe. Importantly, the porosity of the films was preserved after annealing. Optimum annealing temperature and time were selected on the basis of a prior parametric study with electroplated dense counterparts. This work demonstrates that the combination of colloidal crystal templating and electrodeposition is a very convenient pathway towards lightweight semi-hard magnets with potential technological applications in automotive and aerospace industries, portable sensors or spectrometers, magnetic levitation systems, or magnetoelectric devices, among others.},

The mechanical behaviour of these structures has been examined under both quasi-static and dynamic impact loading. Pre-buckled circular honeycombs with aspect ratios e = 0.8 and e = 0.6 were compared to a traditional, straight-walled honeycomb. It has been found that the mechanical behaviour of the honeycomb can be tailored to yield different mechanical responses. Principally, decreasing the aspect ratio reduced the stress at yield, as well as the total energy absorbed until densification, however, this alleviated the characteristic stress-softening response of traditional honeycombs under static and dynamic conditions. When subjected to multiple cycles of loading, a stabilised response was observed. The numerical response closely agreed with the experimental results. A simplified, periodic boundary condition model also closely agreed with the experimental results whilst alleviating computational run time by nominally 75\%. The numerical full factorial parameter design sweep identified a broad range of mechanical behaviour. This represents a valuable tool to identify optimal design configurations for future impact mitigating applications.},

Compared with active a-OAM generating devices, these waveguiding-spiral structures were compact enough that could be easily fabricated through three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. While compared with other passive a-OAM generating devices, the principle of wavefront rotation realized by the proposed device was geometrical aisles guiding, which belongs to the non-resonant structure. Therefore, it could effectively reduce the energy loss of sound wave, and avoid the narrow-band feature caused by the resonant structure. Most importantly, the working frequency could be adjusted to any working frequency bands by geometric scaling, and it could work in a variety of media or harsh conditions. In addition, the waveguiding-spiralizer could be designed for any number of channels to realize the multiplexing communication.},

These fabricated Fr-IMBs were successfully applied to capture the MCF-7 exosomes with a high capture efficacy of 91.0\%. After incubation with fructose, the molecular structure of the dopamine-boronic acid complexation can be rearranged and the antibody (anti-CD63) bound exosomes were released competitively, with a yield greater than 79.8\%. Those exosomes that underwent both immunomagnetic separation and fructose triggered release remained their good bioactivity to promote MCF-7 cell migration. Better yet, exosomes enriched by Fr-IMBs possessed higher purity and better preservation of tumor-related molecular information of the exosomal proteins than those obtained through the ultracentrifugation approach, as proved by the comparative proteomics.

Here, biomimetic “cotton-like” hollow Al 2 O 3 fibers (HFs) are fabricated, whose clotting strategy is incompletely dependent on the physiological coagulation mechanisms, to address the above challenges. The HFs, with hollow porous 3-dimensional (3D) structure, large specific surface area and negatively Zeta potential, can not only concentrate blood components, activate intrinsic coagulation pathway, and promote the activation of platelets and fibrin but entrap anticoagulated blood components in a network of HFs to form HFs-based clots with similar morphological characteristics to fibrin-based clots even after exposure to harsh environments. The application of HFs can accelerate hemostasis as compared to gauze, cotton, and hemostatic sponge. The outstanding hemostatic efficacy, in combination with biocompatibility, thermal robustness, portable application and simple fabrication make HFs a promising hemostatic agent for effective and cheap hemorrhage control.},

Although some qualitative research has been carried out on ESCs migration, quantitative prediction of it is still demanded. In this respect, an ESCs migration model based on hydrodynamics and the rheological behaviour of semi-solid metals (SSMs) is proposed to estimate flow-induced microstructural segregation. By employing the model, a plug flow region having a decisive influence on ESCs migration is observed according to the flow simulation of yield-pseudoplastic SSMs. Good agreement between the experimental data and the simulation results is obtained, suggesting that such flow-induced microstructural segregation is controllable by manipulating process parameters such as solid fraction, cavity size and filling velocity. A real-time in situ synchrotron X-ray radiography experiment is carried out to reveal the nature of ESCs migration and provide evidence for the hypothesized flow-induced ESCs migration mechanism. A semi-empirical solid fraction-related rheological (SFR) model capable of relating rheological parameters with solid fraction of SSMs is also proposed, enabling the optimization of process parameters.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogels comprised of alginate and gelatin are potential biomaterials for extrusion-based bioprinting. However, existing polymeric inks are inadequate in printability, shape fidelity and mechanical properties that desire to produce scaffold using 3D bioprinting. Here, a novel printable hydrogel-based ink solution comprised of gelatin-alginate (GA) reinforced by boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) was developed for 3D bioprinting and tissue engineering applications. The ink solutions were tested for printability, printing accuracy, compressive behaviour, while the printed scaffolds were tested for their viability of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). Printability tests showed the strand thicknesses decreased with the increasing concentration of BNNTs in the GA ink solutions. Similarly, the printing accuracy increased (&gt;90\%) with the increasing loading of BNNTs. However, the swelling rate of the GA scaffold was higher than BNNTs reinforced GA scaffolds. Mechanical properties were measured by using compression testing. Increasing BNNTs concentration in GA resulted in a higher load of compressive stress. Also, a quantitative analysis of the cell viability of scaffolds revealed a slight effect on toxicity with the increased doping of BNNTs. Hence, the relevant data on BNNTs reinforced GA scaffold indicated that it could be a potential ink solution for tissue engineering applications through 3D bioprinting processes.},

  abstract     = {Clinically used intervertebral cages have several bottleneck problems, such as lack of osteogenic properties and high subsidence rate. This research aims to design a novel biomimetic titanium alloy cage through three improvements: cross-sectional shape mimics, Young&#39;s modulus matches and osteogenic property enhances. Two inner porous structures (1450–200 μm and 800–200 μm) were selected, and the Young&#39;s modulus were 540.7 MPa (similar to cancellous bone) and 1139.2 MPa, respectively. Shape of the cages was designed by radiographic images and assistant softwares to make the dense border contact the peripheral cortical bone of the vertebrae. Hydroxyapatite (HA) biocoating was performed through the slurry foaming and impregnation method, and the average thickness was approximately 40 μm. The biocoated and nonbiocoated cages were then implanted in goats’ intervertebral space. During the 6-month follow-up, the lordosis angle and disc space height maintained well in all groups. Histological results showed a significant increase in bone ingrowth area between the nonbiocoating and biocoating groups, meaning a great enhancement of osteogenic properties by HA biocoating. The osseointegration also improved greatly. Additionally, the fusion condition of Young&#39;s modulus matching cages, before or after biocoating, was superior to that of unmatched cages. The results demonstrated that biomimetic designs could help avoid subsidence and promote fusion.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the relatively lower dimensional accuracy and poorer surface finish compared to other additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, directed energy deposition (DED) yields parts that often require extensive post-processing. Thus, it is well suited to be combined with subtractive or deformation processes into hybrid manufacturing strategies, which may enable microstructure engineering of near-net-shape parts directly upon production. In this work, we use a custom-made machine that combines DED and single point incremental forming (SPIF) processes to produce samples of stainless steel 316L which are amenable to undergo recrystallization upon heat treatment. After recrystallization, the microstructure exhibits a high density of twin boundaries, which are known to enhance the physical and mechanical properties of alloys. We investigate how different SPIF parameters affect the extent of recrystallization and find that our strategy may be used to produce both gradient and “sandwich” microstructures, which integrate dissimilar grain boundary character distributions and grain structures. We assess the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of such samples and discuss the resulting performance enhancement. Our results showcase new opportunities for microstructure engineering of DED components and lay the groundwork for the design of AM processes that enable grain boundary engineering of metal alloys.},

These critical constraints have been elaborated in order to exploit the extraordinary strain hardening of high manganese steels within a crash-box application, to achieve the optimum utilization of energy absorption potential. A new design for crash-boxes has been laid out and simulated using a finite element simulation model. The new design, has two separated deformation stages, which require different characteristics of the materials used. For each of the two stages, the chosen high-manganese steel was adapted to achieve the optimum specific energy absorption. An optimized processing of the materials, including deformation and annealing, treatments, improved the specific energy absorption. Design principles and the material processing parameters are elaborated. The experimental proof confirms the two-stage deformation behavior and the usability of the supporting structure, however, also shows that adjustments still need to be made to both the welding and the edges.},

Here, we report high strength (∼1334 MPa) and large ductility (∼18.8\%) in nitrogen-doped TiZrNbTa HEAs. The microstructural evolution and the corresponding mechanical properties of the as-cast/annealed nitrogen-doped HEAs were investigated. All as-cast (TiZrNbTa) 100- x N x ( x = 0, 0.3, 0.6) HEAs exhibit a single-phase body-centred cubic structure. Interstitial strengthening contributes to the enhanced strength. The improved ductility of the 0.6 at.\% nitrogen-doped HEA originates from the promoted planar dislocation slip inside grains. Spinodal decomposition and grain boundary (Zr, N)-enriched precipitates emerge when the nitrogen content is 0.9 at.\%, which results in significant embrittlement. Isothermal annealing of the 0.6 at.\% nitrogen-doped HEA at 800 °C to 1200 °C was conducted to further improve the mechanical performance. The complicated precipitates and grain boundary impurity segregation in the alloys annealed at 800 °C and 1200 °C lead to deteriorated strength and ductility. However, in the alloy annealed at 1000 °C, a slight increase in both strength and ductility appears due to solid solution strengthening, in situ grain refinement and promoted dislocation cross slip, which is induced by the coherent boundaries. This work provides a promising conduit to approach high strength and ductility in HEAs.},

In this paper, the molten pool evolution of the single track, including the morphology, porosity and crack formation, was systematically investigated by numerical simulation, and the effects of different preheating temperature and process parameters were verified by experimental analysis. The detailed temperature-dependent thermal physical properties were applied into the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to simulate a powder bed computational domain which was established by Discrete Element Model (DEM). The simulation results show that the change of molten pool width by different laser power and preheating was not as significant as that of depth. The results also demonstrate that higher energy density and preheating temperature induced the generation of pores at the bottom of molten pool, which can be explained by the variation in cooling rates . Moreover, the change of temperature gradients in three-dimensional directions with the increase of preheating temperature was also investigated, which explained the reason for crack forming and extending through the center line . Finally, the evolution of molten pool at a higher preheating temperature 1000℃ was simulated to further underpin the positive effect of preheating on preventing cracks formation.},

Nevertheless, in physiological environments, proper mechanical properties and sufficient degradation rate are needed. In this paper, zinc (Zn) was uniformly distributed in the magnesium matrix using a ball milling process, and then the composite of Mg-3Zn/xfCNTs (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 wt\%) was successfully fabricated using a combination of semi-powder metallurgy, sintering and extrusion processes for use as a biodegradable load-bearing implant. The influence of functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNTs) content on compressive strength, corrosion behavior and in vitro bioactivity (apatite formation ability and cytocompatibility) of the composite was investigated. The key toughening mechanisms that resist crack propagation include fCNTs pull-out, grain bridging by fCNTs, Crack branching and crack deflection. Furthermore, electrochemical and in-vitro immersion studies demonstrated that the corrosion behavior of Mg-3Zn composite under high concertation encapsulation was slightly reversed by fCNTs. Furthermore, cell culture investigations revealed that MG-63 cells present high level of cell viability and proliferate, implying that Mg-3Zn/0.4fCNTs composites are cytocompatible. All the findings suggest that the Mg-3Zn/0.4fCNTs composite with outstanding mechanical properties and appropriate corrosion resistance and biocompatibility may be a potential candidate for biodegradable implant application.},

Herein, the 3D porous scaffolds with co-continuous and oriented pores were prepared via solid-phase stretching of co-continuous polymer blends followed by selective phase extraction. Compared to the isotropic scaffold, the proliferation of astrocytes slowed down on the oriented scaffolds. Meanwhile, the expression of growth factors and inflammatory factors secreted by astrocyte activation was inhibited by the oriented pores. It led to the suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway that is crucial to determine chronic neuropathic pain. Immunofluorescence staining displayed that the hyperactivation of astrocytes was inhibited, and the expression of kindlin-1, a key protein that activates astrocytes, was downregulated. The proposed strategy offers a probable physical means to relieve neuropathic pain.},

Therefore, the modulation of ROS concentration is an efficient path to relief IBD symptoms. In this work, ultrathin niobium carbide (UNC) nanosheets have been developed as a superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like antioxidant to harvest ROS. Compared with bulk Nb 2 C (BNC), UNC possesses the surface without the –F, -O, –OH suspension parts which provides abundant oxidized vacancies to trap the hydroxyl groups. Moreover, theoretical calculation has been adopted to explain the absorption mechanism and stability of UNC. In this work, it is revealed that UNC exhibits benign therapeutic functions both in vitro and in vivo. UNC not only inhibits hydroperoxide-induced cell death in vitro through reducing intracellular ROS levels, but also improves the severity and survival rates of colitis mice in vivo.

Electrospinning has been proven to be a suitable and available technique for production of 3D biomimetic scaffolds. To overcome these problems and retain the advantages of electrospinning, bioelectrospinning has been proposed to provide guidance by micropattern, homogeneous cell distribution, and effective nutrient utilization. Herein, we fabricated poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate)/poly (vinyl alcohol) (P34HB/PVA) with human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to biomimetic core-shell microfiber/cells complex by coaxial bioelectrospinning. Characterization of the fiber materials revealed that coaxial electrospinning combined the advantages of the two materials. In vitro cellular assays showed that after bioelectrospinning, the cells and material could be simultaneously spun while maintaining cell activity. The material provided a good 3D microenvironment allowing cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Both the in vitro and in vivo tests indicated the formation of mineralized nodules in both the co-spun and co-axial groups, while the implants formed bone-like tissue after 16 weeks of implantation. This study shows that coaxial bioelectrospinning technology can be used to construct tissue-engineered bone.

The key factor is the aging mechanism of powder during the layer-wise infrared radiation process of laser powder bed fusion. Therefore, the evolution of physico-chemical structure under different infrared radiation temperatures is thoroughly studied in this paper, and the aging mechanism is proposed for polyetheretherketone powder. On the one hand, the layer-wise infrared radiation can promote the spheroidization of particle edges and corners, and the fusion of slits inside the powder. Meanwhile, more ordered crystalline structure, smaller interplanar spacing, and reduced lattice volume emerge with the deepening of powder aging. The sintering window is widened accompanied by the disappearance of the exothermic peak. On the other hand, although the chain does not break after aging, the macromolecular has been cross-linked to form a biphenyl structure, which can directly reduce the crystallinity of polyetheretherketone powder. This research is of guiding significance for the development of anti-aging polyetheretherketone powder and the consistent powder management of laser powder bed fusion.},

  abstract     = {Acute wounds often cause overdeveloped inflammation, which can adversely affect wound healing. Wound dressing has been widely used, but it is still challenging to achieve an effective anti-inflammation treatment due to the complex wet environment of the wounds. Here, we proposed a wound sealant, tannic acid-silk fibroin-diclofenac potassium (TA-SF-DP, TSD) hydrogels. And evaluated their wet-adhesion performance and the potency on inflammation regulation through comprehensive mechanical tests and molecular biology research. The TSD hydrogels exhibited an outstanding wet-adhesion property to porcine soft tissues even in blood (up to (38.6 ± 4.6) kPa) and strong hemostatic ability in rat tail truncation model ((reduced hemostasis time from (685 ± 55) s to (160 ± 72) s and reduced blood loss from (0.59 ± 0.07) g to (0.06 ± 0.03) g compared with the gauze group). Simultaneously, the hydrogels showed satisfactory anti-inflammatory effects (sustained reduction of inflammation at 6 h and 24 h, generally the peak and persistent state of severe postoperative reaction, respectively), which works by releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug DP conforming to physiological needs. Combined with the wet adhesion, anti-inflammatory property and remarkable biocompatibility, the TSD hydrogels have the potential to be a clinical wound sealant to manage acute wounds.},

Current crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modelling is capable of predicting the associated strength based on a microstructural image and material data but is computationally expensive. This work utilizes a large database of input–output samples from CPFE modelling to develop a trained deep neural network (DNN) model which instantly estimates the output (strength prediction) associated with a given input (microstructure) of multi-phase additive manufactured stainless steels. The DNN model successfully recognizes phase regions and the associated unique crystallographic orientation variations. It also captures differences in macroscopic stress response due to the varying microstructure. However, it is less reliable in terms of fatigue life predictions. The DNN model exhibits high accuracy for the structure–property relationship as a surrogate prediction tool compared to CPFE while significantly reducing the computational cost to just a few seconds.},

Herein, microscale tensile testing of the joint interface was coupled with the macroscale fracture evaluation to elucidate the dominant factor of strength in dissimilar joints between 6061 aluminum alloy and high tensile strength galvannealed steel via friction stir spot welding (FSSW). Microstructural analyses revealed the characteristic formation of interfacial microstructure accompanied by friction and Zn discharge during the FSSW process. Microscale tensile testing was performed on the specimen on which the pre-notch was introduced to induce local fracture at the intended position on the joint interface. Results showed the presence of the weakest interface attributed to initial joining defects formed by Zn concentration at the outer area, which were consistent with the outside of the crack arresting area confirmed by macroscale evaluation. These results indicated that the joint strength of dissimilar joints between 6061 aluminum alloy and galvannealed steel is dominated by the local strength of the joining area without defects and suggested a process design for improving dissimilar joints.},

Here, we investigate the reconfigurability of a tessellation of origami-based cellular structures composed of bellows-like unit cells, specifically Tachi-Miura Polyhedron (TMP). One of the unique features of the TMP is that a single cell can take four different phases in a rigid foldable manner. Therefore, the TMP tessellation can achieve various shapes out of one original assembly. To assess the geometrical validity of the astronomical number of origami phase combinations, we build a graph-theoretic framework to describe the connectivity of unit cells and to analyze the reconfigurability of the tessellations. Our approach can pave the way to develop a systematic computational tool to design origami-based mechanical metamaterials with tailored properties.},

  abstract     = {Asphalt concrete (AC) is a composite material consisting of binder, aggregates and air voids. The quantitative effect of aggregate-to-aggregate contact on the mechanical performance of AC is an important and complex issue, which has not been fully understood yet. To fill this gap, this study aims to characterize the aggregate contacts in AC and evaluate their effects on the viscoelastic behavior of AC through micromechanical finite element (FE) modeling. To this end, 3D microstructural models were generated through digital image processing (DIP) method and aggregate contacts were captured in the model via contact zone (CZ) elements. A CZ model was proposed and verified by a parametric study to identify the viscoelastic properties of CZ elements, while the viscoelastic properties of matrix phase were determined through laboratory tests. Steady-state dynamic (SSD) analysis was then conducted to investigate the macro-scale viscoelastic response of AC. It was found that the proposed modeling approach captures the measured response accurately. Accounting for aggregate contacts results in higher predicted AC dynamic moduli and lower phase angles, thus improving the agreement between modeling and experimental results. The numerical model developed in this study provides a promising approach for investigating the effect of aggregate contacts on the mechanical performance of AC.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of 3D printing, auxetic cellular cementitious composites (ACCCs) have recently garnered significant attention owing to their unique mechanical performance. To enable seamless performance prediction of the ACCCs, interpretable machine learning (ML)-based approaches can provide efficient means. However, the prediction of Poisson’s ratio using such ML approaches requires large and consistent datasets which is not readily available for ACCCs. To address this challenge, this paper synergistically integrates a finite element analysis (FEA)-based framework with ML to predict the Poisson’s ratios. In particular, the FEA-based approach is used to generate a dataset containing 850 combinations of different mesoscale architectural void features. The dataset is leveraged to develop an ML-based prediction tool using a feed-forward multilayer perceptron-based neural network (NN) approach which shows excellent prediction efficacy. To shed light on the relative influence of the design parameters on the auxetic behavior of the ACCCs, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is employed, which establishes the volume fraction of voids as the most influential parameter in inducing auxetic behavior. Overall, this paper develops an efficient approach to evaluate geometry-dependent auxetic behaviors for cementitious materials which can be used as a starting point toward the design and development of auxetic behavior in cementitious composites.},

Micro-additions of Fe kept high concentration of Ti in solid solution (up to 6 wt\%) after water quenching and suppressed the classical “wave-like” early-stage precipitation. Instead, a new dispersion of nano precipitates was observed. This behavior results in doubling the ductility in the solution annealed state (up to 48\% elongation), together with maintaining a very high strength after ageing (up to 975 MPa) from precipitation of metastable nano α-Cu 4 Ti. This study shows that Fe micro-additions, when combined with a higher amounts of Ti (6 wt\%), enables the production of Cu-based alloys combining high formability and strength, providing an excellent alternative to Cu-Be in mechanical applications.},

We unprecedentedly produced ultrapure (99.9997\%) nickel deposits simultaneously with an ultrahigh strength and mirror-like surfaces as well as an appreciably high ductility by using our proposed ultrafine anode scanning electrodeposition (UAS-ECD). Distinctively, the UAS-ECD is a speed-dependent localized scanning electrodeposition rather than a commonly-used current-dependent electrodeposition. Therefore, the UAS-ECD can create NMMs at extremely high local current densities and with no additives. This makes it achievable to generate ultrahigh strength ultrapure NMMs with microhardness of 656 HV and tensile strength of 664 MPa (fracture elongation, 8.5\%), which are respectively 29\% and 30\% higher than those reported in the literature. Further surprisingly, the samples’ tensile strength has only an approximately 1\% reduction after being annealed. This is attributed to minimum impurities introduction and evenly distributed ultrafine grains formed. In addition, UAS-ECD is able to produce grain-varying deposits just by adjusting the anode’s scanning speed, conveniently achieving 65 wt\%-95 wt\% nano-&amp; micro-sized grains composite NMMs. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing ultrahigh strength ultrapure NMMs.},

Furthermore, welding as the primary joining process for steel has a similar role in promoting its applications. Therefore, welded UHSS have a vital role in related applications. However, due to their complex microstructures, these steels are more prone to harmful effects of welding heat input on the mechanical properties compared to mild steels. Thus, identifying the correlations between the microstructural transformations triggered by the heat input and the mechanical properties can lead to new insights and hindering the drawbacks. This study investigates the microstructures and mechanical properties of S960 (with a severe softening after welding) and S1100 (with a negligible decrease of the mechanical properties after welding) to understand the mechanisms behind the softening of welded UHSS. Microstructural analysis showed the formation of soft phases, e.g., ferrite and granular bainite, as the primary reason for the softening. Furthermore, tempered forms of martensite and bainite resulted in the simultaneous decrease of hardness and notch toughness. Finally, the applicabilities of two experimental approaches to predict hardness from microstructural constituents were evaluated for welded S960 and S1100 and proved to have relatively good reliability to detect their HAZ softened spots.},

In this study, based on numerical simulations that considered both WAAM deposition and vertical rolling, the mechanisms of rolling-enabled mitigation of RS and distortion in a WAAM-built steel wall are elucidated. The influences of process configuration and condition, such as roller design (flat, profiled and slotted rollers), rolling load (25–75 kN) and roller-to-wall friction coefficient (0–0.8) on the distributions of plastic strain (PS) and RS were investigated. It is found that the slotted roller is most effective to introduce tensile PS for counteracting the compressive PS generated by the WAAM deposition, thereby reducing the tensile RS in the clamped condition and the final distortion after removal of clamps. Higher rolling load increases the rolling-induced tensile PS, which leads to more extensive mitigation of the WAAM-generated tensile RS. The simulations also demonstrate that the friction coefficient significantly affects the PS and RS when the slotted roller is employed. However, the efficacy of the flat/profiled roller is insensitive to friction coefficient. This study could underpin the development of an optimal post-build rolling process for efficient mitigation of RS and distortion in WAAM components.},

This paper first combines molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the mechanical properties of graphene reinforced aluminium (Gr/Al) nanocomposites and use them to modify Halpin-Tsai model. Extensive MD results for Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength of Gr/Al nanocomposites are obtained, with the intricate effects of graphene’s volume fraction, alignment angle, chirality and environment temperature being taken into account. After training and optimization based on MD data, ML models are developed with the capability in estimating Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength. The micromechanics based Halpin-Tsai model is then modified by using the Young’s modulus predicted by both MD and ML models such that the Young’s modulus can be readily determined with significantly improved accuracy from an explicit relationship that is very easy to use in the analysis and engineering design of Gr/Al nanocomposite structures.},

  abstract     = {To develop advanced nuclear fuel claddings, two oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloys were designed, manufactured, and evaluated. First, 12\%Cr alloy, is an ODS-version of ferritic steel, and second, 10\%Cr-6\%Al alloy, is a high-strength version of accident tolerant iron-chrome-aluminum alloy. Their properties and performance were compared with “classical” ODS material, 14\%Cr alloy 14WYT. Thin-walled (∼500 µm wall thickness) tubes were manufactured successfully using the pilgering technique. For all alloys, axial tensile specimens exhibited high tensile strength (&gt;1 GPa) and reasonable plastic strains (10–17\%). Ring tensile specimens, conversely, showed limited ductility (∼1\%) with similar strengths to those measured in the axial orientation. The grain size, precipitate dispersion characteristics, and dislocation densities were then used to estimate yield strengths that were compared against room temperature axial and ring-pull tensile test data. The strengthening models showed mixed agreement with experimentally measured values due to the highly anisotropic microstructures of all three ODS tubes. These results illustrate the need for future model optimization to accommodate non-isotropic microstructures associated with components processed using rolling/pilgering approaches. In all cases, atom probe tomography and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that ODS structure survived multiple pilgering operations, and precipitate microstructure evolution matched well the state-of-the-art nanoprecipitate coarsening models.},

  abstract     = {The lightweight design of railway vehicle components using fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) has become a research hotspot due to the strong need for energy saving and environmental protection. This paper aims to evaluate the impact damage behavior of a carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) protection suspender, which is a component on railway vehicles to prevent the falling joist and bolster from touching the rails and to avoid the derailment of trains. A finite element (FE) model of the CFRP protection suspender, which considered varying bolt preloads was established in ABAQUS/Explicit. The bolt preload was successfully applied around the installation holes on the protection suspender by deliberately reducing the local temperature of the bolt shank to create shrinkage. The impact behavior of the protection suspender was then analyzed, and the impact-induced damage was governed by the Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) models, which include both intra-laminar damage and inter-laminar damage. The low-velocity impact response of the CFRP protection suspender was investigated with the lay-ups of [0] 10 and [0/90/0/90/0] S under different bolt preloads (i.e. 0, 5 and 20 kN). The results showed that the vulnerable positions of the protection suspenders included the contact edge between the protection suspender and the impactor, the curved corner of the suspender, and the areas around the bolt holes. In addition, the protection suspender with the lay-up of [0] 10 had better impact resistance than that with the lay-up of [0/90/0/90/0] S . By applying different preloads, it showed that the increase of bolt preloads could help to prevent the occurrence of crack damage around the installation holes, thus improving the structural safety when subjected to low-velocity impact. The present simulation results offered great value for the lightweight design and structural optimization of a protection suspender on railway vehicles that had to survive from sudden impact loads in service.},

  abstract     = {This work explores the possibilities for the ultrafast sintering of binderless tungsten carbide by electric/pressure assisted sintering. A limited voltage (3–4 V) in AC condition was applied to WC powder compact in combination with uniaxial pressure. The thermal insulating ceramic die allows the ultrafast heating (10 4 °C/min) of the powder compact which undergoes a rapid transition of its electrical properties, from negative to positive dependence of resistivity on temperature, i.e. from NTC to PTC behaviour. Such effect is fundamental for inducing a thermal runaway phenomenon associated with ultrarapid temperature increase and massive electric power dissipation, thus inducing very rapid sintering. The relationship between electrical properties of tungsten carbide and the possibility to achieve “flash sintering” conditions to complete densification in a couple of seconds was investigated. At the optimal conditions of 3.5 V and 4 MPa pressure, pure WC sinters up to 95\% in less than 10 s. Longer sintering time after the flash improves only slightly the density, despite a significant energetic consumption. It is also shown that if larger pressure is applied, the flash event duration and final density decrease.},

The composition of C 2 S (α, β, and γ) polymorphs, by-products, and amorphous content is established by employing QXRD (quantitative X-ray diffraction) studies. The attention has been focused to comprehend assay-amorphous relationships of C 2 S yield. The intermediate dried gels have been investigated via thermal analysis to monitor changes in the gel structures and precursors at low temperatures. The synthetic parameters including calcination time and temperature, Ca/Si molar ratio and mode of cooling have been optimized to get pure β-C 2 S with low amorphous content. The dependency of β → γ C 2 S polymorphic transformation on mean crystallite size (D cryst ) is studied. Overall, the Pechini method exhibits the most promising results for the purity and tuning of β-C 2 S polymorph. Moreover, the non-aqueous and aqueous routes require calcining the dried gel at a temperature higher than 1200 ℃ due to the presence of CaO precursors as CaCO 3 . The theoretical calculations of amorphous content have revealed that the change in the stoichiometry from 2.0 to 1.7 Ca/Si ratio is not a viable solution to improve the C 2 S product yield.},

  abstract     = {The desire for increased performance and functionality has introduced additional complexities to the design and fabrication of additively manufactured (AM) parts. However, addressing these needs would require improved control over local properties using in-line feedback from fast-acting low-fidelity models during the fabrication process. In this regard, differential evaporation is an inherent characteristic in metal AM processes, directly influencing local chemistry, material properties, functionality, and performance. In the present work, a differential evaporation model (DEM) is presented for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM to predict and control the effect of evaporation on chemistry and properties on local and part-wide scales. The DEM model is coupled with an analytical thermal model that is calibrated against 51.2 Ni [at\%] nickel titanium shape memory alloy (NiTi SMA) single-track experiments and a multi-layer model that accounts for the AM part’s multi-layer design and the inherent melt pool overlap and chemistry propagation. The combined hierarchical model, consisting of the thermal, evaporation, and multi-layer components, is used to predict location-specific chemistry for LBPF AM fabrication of Ni 50.8 Ti 49.2 [at\%] SMAs. Model predictions are validated with values obtained from multi-layer experiments on a commercial LPBF system, resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.25 Ni [at\%] for predicted Ni content. Additionally, martensitic transformation temperature, M s , is calculated and compared with empirical data, resulting in an RMSE of 18.6 K. A practical account of the cumulative and propagative thermal-induced evaporation effect on location-specific chemistry is made through this linkage of models. Fundamentally, this model chain has also provided a solution to the forward modeling problem, enabling steps to be taken towards resolving the inverse design problem of determining processing parameters based on desired location-specific properties.},

However, the high cost for creep testing limits the development efficiency of new alloys using traditional trial-and-error methods. Additionally, the complex mechanism and influencing factors significantly increase the difficulty of physical modeling and simulation-guided design. In this study, an alloy design framework for creep life improvement is established, including two modules: creep life prediction and high-throughput design. For the first module, based on the creep dataset used in this research, the best machine learning model for creep life prediction was obtained by comparison of various machine learning strategies. By this way, the limitation of complex creep mechanism was partially removed and an accurate and generic model was established. For the second module, a genetic algorithm with a filter was used to obtain promising new alloy plans with optimal composition and processing parameters under specific creep conditions. After proving the rationality of this design framework and related design results, map design was used to guide the new alloy development for different creep conditions, and a new multifunctional alloy plan was proposed. This design system could provide preliminary guidance for high-efficiency alloy designs with complex target properties.},

To assess their potential, the properties of these seven semi-regular topologies were compared to regular lattices. We found the elastic buckling strength of the stretching-dominated semi-regular tessellation to be 43\% higher than a regular triangular lattice. In addition, three of the four bending-dominated semi-regular topologies had a higher elastic modulus than a regular hexagonal lattice. In fact, one of these bending-dominated topologies was 85\% stiffer and 11\% stronger than a hexagonal lattice.

The process capability of the strain gauge elements has been statistically assessed and revealed good robustness and replicability which may be further improved.

  abstract     = {Dendrite formation is a critical issue in uranium recovery from spent nuclear fuel (SNF) through a molten-salt electrorefining process. To understand and modulate uranium dendritic formation, we developed a computation model that involves all the complexities in the mechano-electrochemical process, such as diffusion–reaction kinetics, interfacial anisotropy and the variations of electric and stress fields. In particular, the lattice mismatch between deposit and substrate is considered which addressed the importance of cathode material. The model explains various morphologies of dendrites, which in a two-dimensional scenario can be demarcated based on the perimeter-to-area ratio, χ / S . Dendrites can be needle-like, tooth-like, or tree-like when χ / S &lt; 2 mm −1 , 2 mm −1 ≤ χ / S &lt; 6 mm −1 , and χ / S ≥ 6 mm −1 , respectively. With these conditions, the parameter maps for modulating dendritic patterns are drawn to elucidate the effects of interfacial anisotropy, nuclei site geometry, diffusivity, electric and stress fields, which can be employed to design a molten-salt electroplating process to minimize failures caused by dendrite formation.},

  abstract     = {Structural health monitoring of composite structures from manufacturing to operation is receiving significant attention to ensure their performance and safety. In this paper, capacitive sensor arrays were designed and embedded between adhesively bonded composite laminates for curing quality monitoring during manufacturing and loading detection in operation. A loading inversion method was proposed to quantitatively determine the loading location and value on composite structure. The results showed that the whole curing process of adhesive bonding was successfully monitored. Based on capacitance monitoring, the embedded sensors can capture poor curing quality of adhesively bonded composite laminates due to abnormal curing conditions. The embedded sensors between composite laminates after curing showed perception of external loading. With the evenly distributed sensing capacitors, loading applications on composite laminates were detected. Based on the proposed loading inversion method, loading distribution mapping on the composite laminates was constructed, and the quantitative calculation of the coordinate location and value of loading was achieved. The calculated results agreed well with the actual loading in experiments, affirming the feasibility of the capacitive sensor array and the loading inversion method.},

  abstract     = {Lattice structures have great potential for lightweight additively manufactured parts. This paper presents a bio-inspired functionally graded lattice structure optimisation approach for compliance minimisation of statically loaded structures. Topology optimisation determines the optimal relative density distribution within a design space and the associated strain fields. A lattice structure is then generated within this design space, comprised of trusses aligned with principal strain trajectories. The trusses have a rectangular cross-section, resulting in three size variable per node during the final sizing step. A minimum feature size is implemented so that the designs are suited to the particular additive manufacturing process print resolution. The presented approach is further demonstrated to efficiently solve problems with multiple load cases and produce lattice topologies that mimic those found in bone. The optimised lattice structure examples presented are on average 12\% less stiff in comparison to a conventional SIMP topology optimisation approach. However, they are well suited to multifunctional applications such as heat transfer where the surface area is increased by an average of 94\%. The optimised lattice structures are also shown to be able to eliminate additive manufacturing support structure requirements.},

Fabrication of robust and durable power devices requires an optimized design based on the understanding of the interfacial adhesion properties of the constituent thin-film heterostructures. In this study, the adhesion properties of GaN/AlN layers grown on Si substrates were investigated. Particularly, the influence of the AlN buffer layers, necessary for GaN growth on Si, on the delamination response was determined. The interfacial adhesion strength was obtained using cross-sectional nanoindentation (CSN) and four-point bending (4PB) tests. Analytical models based on beam- and elastic plate theory which were applied respectively to calculate the interfacial fracture energy ( G ic ) for both methods are found to be in good agreement provided the loading conditions are similar. Detailed transmission and scanning electron microscopy investigations prior and subsequent to delamination reveal the microstructural details of the relevant interfaces and provide insights into the encountered mechanisms of interfacial failure. Finally, the probability of delamination along the weakest interface is discussed based on a fracture mechanics model.},

  abstract     = {Mass reduction is a main issue in mechanical design. Over millions of years, Nature had to face this issue. Nature came up with an efficient solution using a stress-driven structure to reduce the mass of bones while saving their mechanical performances. This optimized structure is used in several species and persists throughout Evolution. Thus, it may be considered as optimal for this issue. In this article, a method bio-inspired from both bone medullar cavity and trabecular structure is proposed to reduce the mass of parts subjected to mechanical stresses. The objective of this method is to provide high mass reduction, just like bone does. First, the method removes iteratively unloaded areas of material from the mechanical part to mimic the medullar cavity structure. Second, a final mass reduction is done integrating small holes bio-inspired from trabecular structure in the remaining material. An experimental validation was carried out on a torsion disc and provided a 60\% mass reduction. Using this mass reduction rate, the topology optimization method was used to define a standard geometry to evaluate the mechanical performances of the proposed method. Experimental results highlight that regarding torsional stiffness, the bio-inspired part is 27\% stiffer than the standard one.},

This study examined materials science principles of nanoindentation test methods to enable accurate prediction of bulk hardness for a series of high purity Fe and Fe-(3–25 wt\%) Cr alloys. These materials were tested in as-annealed and thermally aged (100–900 h at 475 ℃ to produce Cr-rich α ’ precipitates) conditions. Nanoindentation with a Berkovich indenter at constant strain rate (0.05–0.5 /s) and constant loading rate conditions provided comparable bulk equivalent hardness ( H 0 ) extracted by Nix-Gao model, indicating a weak strain rate sensitivity at room temperature. Results from electropolished and fine mechanically polished samples gave comparable measured hardness. Pileup corrections produced a 5–14\% correction to H 0 which agreed with the experimental bulk Vickers hardness within ∼10\% for most tested materials. The microstructural model-predicted and measured strength values agreed for aged samples. A derived analytic expression demonstrates that an ISE error, associated with inappropriate methods such as hardness ratios or changes at a reference depth, would be as large as 60\% in estimated bulk hardness for the investigated Fe-Cr alloys.},

Mechanical alloying is used with the aim to homogeneously distribute rare earth elements like yttrium inside a steel matrix to form strengthening nano-scaled particles. Due to the ductile nature of a face centered cubic austenite matrix, mechanical alloying results in a large amount of cold-welding of powder and the milling equipment, which significantly reduces the production yield and the reproducibility of the process. Here, a novel 2-step mechanical alloying process using nitrogen as a process control agent was developed, resulting in a production yield close to 100\%. Vanadium was added to the steel prealloy to sequester the introduced nitrogen and to promote precipitation of nitride precipitates. Optimizations of process parameters were suggested after characterizing chemical compositions, particle sizes, dislocation densities, crystallite sizes, phase compositions and harnesses. A comparison of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy results revealed a new approach to define an optimized milling duration. After hot-rolling, a successful dual-precipitate formation of nano-scaled oxides and nitrides, with mean diameters of 3 and 37 nm, respectively, was proven using transmission electron microscopy methods.},

For this purpose, diamond layers of a five-layer laminate were structured by laser cutting into hexagonal platelets with diameters of 400 µm and 800 µm. The mechanical behavior was characterized by three-point bending. Mostly spontaneous failure with little crack deflection was observed, indicating a strong diamond-metal interface. At over 1250 MPa, the laminates exhibit nominal strengths that exceed those of other lamellar ceramic-metal composites by at least a factor of two, while fracture energy lies in a medium range.

Results show that continuous accumulation of stress of austenitic stainless steels at the early stage of cavitation erosion was observed from the samples tested in deionised water (DIW) but not in artificial seawater (ASW), which is due to stress release induced by ASW. In addition, a stress-induced phase transformation from austenite to martensite during the cavitation erosion tests in both DIW and ASW was observed in 304 SS, but not in 316 SS. Furthermore, primary cavitation craters formed during the cavitation erosion were not expanded directly but shrank first and then expanded due to re-accumulation of stress. More importantly, this study reports for the first time that pre-existing pores are not initiation points of cavitation erosion damage, possibly because of the ductility of austenitic stainless steels, which resulted in continuous shrinkage of the pores caused by the accumulated stress. Our findings provide new insights into understanding the failure mechanisms of austenitic stainless steels subjected to cavitation erosion, which will inform the development of high-performance cavitation erosion-resistant materials.},

Ultimate compressive strength can reach about 1.3 GPa after 1000 ℃ annealing. Fine-grain and precipitation strengthening are the main reasons for the improvement of the mechanical properties. The conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity are all affected by grain size, precipitates, structural complexity and so on.

The phenomenon is commonly referred to as water droplet erosion (WDE). Analogous to fatigue, WDE has an endurance regime, called threshold velocity, where material resists erosion damage for prolonged exposure. The ability to predict the threshold velocity from material properties is crucial for the prevention of WDE phenomenon. In the past decades, developing models to predict the threshold velocity have been attempted. This has resulted in one semi-analytical model and several empirical equations, all of which exhibited limitations in applicability and physical meaning. Drawing on previous attempts along with contemporary theoretical and experimental investigations of WDE phenomenon, we report on the prediction of threshold velocity using an analytical model. The developed model represents the WDE threshold velocity using materials properties and impact conditions. A procedure to experimentally evaluate the threshold velocity in rotating erosion test devices has also been developed. The developed model predicted threshold velocities with higher accuracy than the previous analytical model. The present work introduces an important tool to the design and selection of WDE resistant materials.},

In this study, we investigate the variations in the mechanical and thermal properties across a broad compositional space for the refractory MoNbTaTi quaternary using high-throughput ab-initio calculations and experimental characterization. For all the properties surveyed, we note a good agreement between our modeling predictions and the experimentally measured values. We reveal the particular role of molybdenum (Mo) to achieve high strength when in high concentration. We trace the origin of this phenomenon to a shift from metallic to covalent bonding when the Mo content is increased. Additionally, a mechanistic, dislocation-based description of the yield strength further explains such high strength due to a combination of high bulk and shear moduli, accompanied by the relatively small size of the Mo atom compared to the other atoms in the alloy. Our analysis of the thermodynamics properties shows that regardless of the composition, this class of quaternary alloys shows good stability and low sensitivity to temperature. Taken together, these results pave the way for the design of new high-performance refractory alloys beyond the equimolar composition found in high-entropy alloys.},

An interesting property of carbon nanostructures is the sensitivity of their electronic properties to a range of chemical stimuli. Consequently, their capabilities for charge propagation may be significantly enhanced upon appropriate combination with a chemical compound, which can affect the Fermi level of the material. In this work, the impact of addition of bromine to single-walled CNT (SWCNT) films on their electrical and thermoelectric properties was investigated. The experimental results revealed that thermoelectric capabilities of the material may be enhanced by two orders of magnitude by sonication-assisted introduction of Br 2 into a SWCNT network.

The microstructures along the depth were characterized by using different methods, including X-Ray Diffraction, Optical Microscopy, Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction and Transmission Electron Microscopy. Experimental results showed that large-depth gradient hardness distribution with depth of 2.5 mm was produced in CP titanium by explosive hardening. There are two gradient hardened layers, ultra-hardened layer with a depth of 0–40 μm and a hardness increase of ∼400\%, sub-hardened layer with a depth of 40 μm-2500 μm and a hardness increase of 54.3\%. Gradient microstructures with different characteristics were observed, including gradient α-ω phase transition, gradient grain size, gradient twining and gradient dislocation. The area of gradient microstructure is consistence with that of gradient hardness distribution. Grain refinement/α-ω phase transition mainly contributed to hardness sharply increasing in ultra-hardened layer. High-density dislocation/twining mainly contributed to hardness increasing in the sub-hardened layer.

  abstract     = {This study describes the application of a new technological parameter in the alternating-current (AC) electrospinning process for enhancing the electrospinnability and productivity of polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers (ENF). High-voltage AC is influenced via changes in both the waveform and the frequency; however, the overall contribution to PCL electrospinnability remains unclear. This study hypothesizes that the electrospinnability, morphology, diameter and productivity of PCL ENF are dependent on both the waveform and the frequency of the AC high-voltage signal. Thus, the paper demonstrates that both the waveform and the frequency significantly affect the formation of a stable fibrous plume and the PCL ENF morphology. Consequently, trimodal- (beads, spindles and helical), bimodal- (beads and spindles) and unimodal-structured ENF morphologies were attained for square, sine and triangle waveforms, respectively. Moreover, the frequency of the waveform directly influences the number of beads and/or spindles per unitary length. The square waveform reflects higher productivity (23.6 ± 0.4 g/h) than the sine (16.5 ± 0.3 g/h) and triangle waveforms (6.9 ± 0.2 g/h). This study presents a simple approach to the industrial-scale fabrication of PCL ENF via the tuning of the AC high-voltage signal shape and/or frequency with the added advantage of the potential for obtaining a range of PCL ENF morphologies.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the marine industry, biofouling and surface corrosion of underwater equipment have become a major issue. Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings with a single function cannot meet the current requirements. Recent developments in materials science and synthesis techniques have brought new opportunities and challenges in the field of integrated antifouling and anticorrosion coatings (IAACs). In this review, the mechanisms of biofouling and corrosion are introduced to help readers understand how their negative impact can be mitigated. Most of the IAACs are designed by combining antifouling and anticorrosion units into one coating, while several IAACs disobey the mentioned design principle since they have inherent antifouling and anticorrosion functions. This review highlights the recently developed IAACs, including polyaniline-based coatings, copper/amorphous carbon coatings, polydopamine/polymer brushes, amphiphilic polymers, endospore-loaded sol–gel coatings, hydrophobic/corrosion inhibitor coatings, nanocomposites , and bioinspired coatings. These emerging IAACs have been introduced in the last decade and may not yet be mature in practical applications and commercialization ; therefore, their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Finally, the future development of IAACs is discussed. We expect that this review will not only help readers understand the design principle of IAACs but also contribute to their development.},

The functionality of the end-devices demands temperature independent frequency filtering and high surface acoustic wave velocities, which are associated with the orientation dependent thermo-physical properties of the piezoelectric substrate material. Single crystalline Lithium Niobate (LiNbO 3 ), cut in particular directions, has proven to have outstanding functional properties, yet its brittle character along with the highly anisotropic mechanical properties may limit its use in demanding applications. In this study, the effect of crystal orientation on hardness and on mechanical strength is demonstrated by comparing nanoindentation results and finite element analysis supported biaxial strength experiments for two LiNbO 3 samples with different orientation. It is demonstrated that the crystal anisotropy leads to differences in hardness up to ∼ 20\% between both orientations, with the characteristic strength being double in the harder direction. The observed correlation is rationalized based on the effect of surface finish and distinct sub-surface damage in the corresponding crystal orientations. Additional strength measurements on nano-scratched samples revealed a significantly higher remaining strength for the harder orientation due to less (sub-) surface damage. These findings can be exploited in future design of single crystalline substrate materials with higher reliability.},

  abstract     = {An investigation into the mechanical response of pneumatically-spliced carbon fibre yarns as a potential reinforcing material for polymer composites is presented. High strength mechanical connections between carbon fibre yarns are produced by joining short discontinuous tows into longer lengths via fibre entanglement. The effect of altering the number of high-pressure air pulses fired by a commercially available (Airbond 701H) splicing machine, to form the tow-tow connection, on load bearing capacity and linear stiffness is first evaluated on splices between virgin T700SC-24K-50C carbon fibre tows. The best performing spliced configuration is subsequently utilised in reinforcing unidirectional epoxy laminates, which are mechanically characterised, and their properties compared to those of various continuous fibre and chopped strand mat panels. Results presented in this study demonstrate that pneumatic splicing provides a high strength and sustainable solution for reinforcing polymers with discontinuous (approx. &gt; &amp;gt; 50 mm in length) virgin, off-cut or waste carbon fibre yarns. It is speculated that with further research, quasi-continuous yarns remanufactured by splicing waste fibres could provide a novel material for weaving, braiding, non-crimp fabrics, or use in 3D printing applications.},

  abstract     = {Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings deposited on additively manufactured steel greatly improve the tribological properties. However, a high substrate hardness is crucial to sustaining high mechanical loads in the tribological contact. Herein, the heat treatment of binder jet printed 17–4 PH enhances the hardness from 24 to 39 HRC. Binder jet printed 17–4 PH substrates are coated by DLC of the types hydrogen-free amorphous carbon (a-C) of ∼23 GPa and hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) of ∼20 GPa. The influence of the heat treatment on the tribo-mechanical properties of the DLC coatings is investigated. 17–4 PH demonstrates high friction and wear against steel counterparts, but the wear rate is reduced from 693 ± 43 × 10 –6 mm 3 /Nm to 492 ± 41 × 10 -6 mm 3 /Nm by heat treating the steel. Both a–C and a–C:H are effective in reducing the friction and wear with wear rates below 0.3 × 10 –6 mm 3 /Nm. The a–C and a–C:H coatings demonstrate lower plastic wear on heat treated 17–4 PH due to the higher substrate hardness. Consequently, the heat treatment is an essential process step to ensure maximum tribological functionality of the DLC coating on additively manufactured 17–4 PH steel.},

However, their low saturation magnetization (60–90 emu/g) limits their applicability. Here, we report a new core–shell (Fe@Fe x O y ) nanoring system, which combines the high magnetic saturation of a metallic iron core (220 emu/g) and the biocompatibility of an iron oxide shell. To produce these nanostructures, hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3 ) nanorings were annealed in a H 2 gas atmosphere for different periods to optimize the amount of metallic iron percentage (δ) in the system. Thus, nanostructures with different magnetic saturation (97 to 178 emu/g) could be obtained; based on their metallic iron content, these particles are labeled as Vortex Iron oxide Particle δ (VIPδ). Micromagnetic simulations confirmed that the VIPδ nanorings exhibit a vortex configuration, guaranteeing low remanence and coercitivity. Moreover, the system shows good biocompatibility in various assays as determined through cell viability measurements performed using two different human cell lines, which were exposed to VIP78\% for 24 h. Therefore, VIPδ nanorings combine a magnetic vortex state and biocompatibility with their high magnetic saturation and can thus serve as a platform that can be tuned during the synthesis based on desired biomedical application.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies on osteoimmunology have revealed the indispensable role of immune cells in osteogenesis. The surface topography of biomaterials plays a critical role in regulating cellular behaviors; however, little attention is paid to its effects on the immune response. Three dense hydroxyapatite (HA) disks with grain size in nano-scale (∼100 nm) to submicron (∼500 nm) range were prepared to investigate their role in macrophage polarization and functional status. It was found that HA ceramics with nano-topography promoted macrophage phenotypic switching from the pro-inflammatory M1 type to the pro-healing M2 type. A reduction in grain size could significantly inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and increase the proportion of CD206 + M2 population in vitro. Meanwhile, nano-topography could reduce tissue inflammation, up-regulate gene expression of M2 phenotypic marker, and raise the fraction of ARG + M2 macrophages in vivo . This might be attributed to the differential integrin expression to regulate the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. These findings indicate that the surface topography of HA ceramics regulates macrophage responses, thereby adjusting inflammation and subsequent tissue regeneration. An improved understanding of the relationship between material features and its immunomodulatory potential may help to design bone substitute materials with good biological performance.},

The small spatter moves pretty fast, while the low optical transmittance in the spectrum of a hot spatter in the coaxial optical path of SLM equipment prevents clear imaging of this target with high contrast. In this study, a coaxial optical path with an enhanced optical transmittance is used for imaging the melt pool and its surrounding phenomena simultaneously. An experimental system was developed using a high-speed camera for coaxial observation of hot spatters in the SLM process. The problems of limited field of view and high measurement uncertainty of an off-axis process monitoring system are solved. For defocused and distorted spatter images, both a segmentation algorithm and an object detection method have been proposed and proved to be effective. It was found that the direction and strength of the local airflow field could be estimated via the curvature of the spatter trajectory. More importantly, the quantity of spatters detected is positively related to the amount of powder locally distributed on the baseplate, which is useful to estimate the powder bed thickness at this position.},

The aim of this study is to analyze these effects for polymer lattice structures and incorporate them in a finite element model for robust design. Micrographs of lattice structure slices show a smaller diameter for vertical struts. Basic mechanical tests on bulk material exhibit a tension–compression asymmetry which is captured with a Drucker-Prager material model in simulations. Digital image correlation measurements allow to determine true material properties. Plateau stress and failure strain are a result of the biggest flaw in the specimen. Hence, a new model to determine their probability distribution is proposed. This model outperforms standard approaches deriving the probability distribution from the central moments. A spatial correlation of geometric deviations and scatter of the material is investigated with variography subsequently allowing to model the varying properties with random fields. Simulations of dog-bone specimens show that the probability distributions of material properties are captured well. Also simulations of lattice structures are able to represent the probability distributions of their homogenized mechanical properties. The whole stress–strain response and the failure progression agree well with experimental results.},

The model allows for correlating the overall strength with different damage events occurring in every constituent: the concrete, the capsules and the capsule-concrete interface. The constitutive concrete damage model uses a pressure-dependent failure initiation criterion followed by a bilinear softening law, whose parameters are validated by using a modified Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm enriched with user-defined constraints aimed at increasing the convergence ratio. The validated virtual model demonstrates that the ratio of capsule slenderness to concrete-capsule interface strength is the key parameter for an effective self-healing process as it gives full control to break the capsule at the right moment. The shorter the capsule is, the longer the breakage process can be. Additionally, it has been found that by increasing the length of the capsules can help to enhance the overall fracture energy of the beam even after fully broken.},

In the present work, we designed a novel multicomponent vanadium-based alloy (MVA), V 34 Ti 25 Cr 10 Ni 30 Pd 1 , containing a micron-scale TiNi matrix phase with VCr nanoprecipitates (NPs) and a micron-scale VCr matrix phase with TiNi NPs. The MVA was irradiated with 6 MeV Ti 3 + Ti3+ ions with a radiation dose of 5 × 10 15 i o n s / c m 2 5×1015ions/cm2 at room temperature. Results indicated that the micron-scale intermetallic TiNi matrix along with VCr NPs inside both became amorphous, while the micron-scale VCr matrix including numerous intermetallic TiNi NPs both exhibited a high structural stability after ion irradiation. The intermetallic TiNi matrix becomes amorphous due to the accumulation of radiation-induced defects, and the intermetallic TiNi NPs in VCr matrix have a high stability of crystallographic structure due to high-density interfaces between NPs and matrix. These results indicate that the phase stability of TiNi intermetallic compound is increased after nanocrystallization. Besides, the discrepancy of two matrix phases including precipitates after ion irradiation, and the underlying mechanisms are discussed in detail in this work. This work gives a guidance for designing new vanadium alloys and intermetallic compounds with enhanced structural stability under ion irradiation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, Zn-3Ag and Zn-3Ag-0.5Mg alloys were studied in terms of applicability as biodegradable implant materials. The performed tensile, compression and bending tests indicate a high strengthening effect induced by the Ag and Mg additions, additionally resulting in grain size refinement. It was shown that sustaining plastic strain during deformation depends on the applied stress causing asymmetric mechanical behavior of the tested Zn-based materials. Electrochemical measurements and immersion tests in Hanks&#39; solution lasting up to 180 days revealed that Ag and Mg contribute to the change of the Zn matrix&#39;s open circuit potential and the formation of micro-galvanic cells between the Zn grains and precipitates. The fine-grained microstructure and evenly distributed small precipitates led to uniform corrosion occurring via pit formation on the corroded surface due to intergranular and micro-galvanic corrosion mechanisms. The corrosion rate of the Zn-3Ag-0.5Mg alloy after 180 days was almost twice that of pure Zn and the Zn-3Ag alloy.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel computational framework designed to allow an experimentalist to extract the local toughness associated with crack growth along an individual grain boundary from fracture experiments on standard specimens. The proposed framework relies on the ability of a graph neural network to perform high accuracy predictions of the micro-scale material toughness, utilizing a limited size dataset that can be obtained from standard fracture experiments. We analyze the functionality of the different components of the framework, focusing on the minimum size of the dataset required for the network training following an initial training cycle on a synthetic dataset. We demonstrate the high efficiency of the algorithm in accurately predicting the local (&gt;68\%) and global (&gt;95\%) crack growth toughness in scenarios where the toughness dependence on the microstructural parameters is substantially different than the one used for the synthetic dataset. The merit of the proposed framework arises from its flexibility: it is not limited to a specific mathematical description of the toughness at the micro-scale and simplicity: the required experiments are rather standard. As such, the proposed framework enables the study of a wide range of material microstructure properties and the investigation of their influence on the material toughness.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a functionally graded material (FGM) part was fabricated by depositing a Cu-based alloy on top of a high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel by twin-wire and arc additive manufacturing (T-WAAM). Copper and steel parts are of interest in many industries since they can combine high thermal/electrical conductivity, wear resistance with excellent mechanical properties. However, mixing copper with steel is difficult due to mismatches in the coefficient of thermal expansion, in the melting temperature, and crystal structure. Moreover, the existence of a miscibility gap during solidification, when the melt is undercooled, causes serious phase separation and segregation during solidification which greatly affects the mechanical properties. Copper and steel control samples and the functionally graded material specimen were fabricated and investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Retained δ-ferrite was found in a Cu matrix at the interface region due to regions with mixed composition. A smooth gradient of hardness and electric conductivity along the FGM sample height was obtained. An ultimate tensile strength of 690 MPa and an elongation at fracture of 16.6\% were measured in the FGM part.},
