  abstract     = {A two-dimensional mathematical model for dynamics of endothelial cells in angiogenesis is investigated. Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process in which new blood vessels emerge from an existing vascular network . Recently a one-dimensional discrete dynamical model has been proposed to reproduce elongation, bifurcation, and cell motility such as cell-mixing during angiogenesis on the assumption of a simple two-body interaction between endothelial cells. The present model is its two-dimensional extension, where endothelial cells are represented as the ellipses with the two-body interactions: repulsive interaction due to excluded volume effect, attractive interaction through pseudopodia and rotation by contact. We show that the oblateness of ellipses and the magnitude of contact rotation significantly affect the shape of created vascular patterns and elongation of branches.},

Noise is inherently present in the cellular signalling system and plays a decisive role in the input–output (I/O) relation. The current study aims to understand the noise tolerance of motif structures in the cell signalling processes. The vulnerability of a node to noise could be a significant factor in causing signalling error and need to be controlled. We developed stochastic differential equation (SDE) based mathematical models for different network motifs with two nodes and studied the association between motif structure and signal–noise relation. A two-dimensional parameter space analysis on motif sensitivity with noise and input signal variation was performed to classify and rank the motifs. Identifying sensitive motifs and their high druggability infers their significance in screening potential drug-target candidates. Finally, we proposed a theoretical framework to identify nodes from a network as potential drug targets. We applied this mathematical formalism to three cancer networks to identify drug-targets and validated them with existing databases.},

  abstract     = {People are more likely to interact with other people of their ethnicity—a phenomenon known as ethnic homophily. In the United States, people of color are known to hold proportionately more high-contact jobs and are thus more at risk of virus infection. At the same time, these ethnic groups are on average younger than the rest of the population. This gives rise to interesting disease dynamics and non-trivial trade-offs that should be taken into consideration when developing prioritization strategies for future mass vaccine roll-outs. Here, we study the spread of COVID-19 through the US population, stratified by age, ethnicity, and occupation, using a detailed, previously-developed compartmental disease model. Based on historic data from the US mass COVID-19 vaccine roll-out that began in December 2020, we show, (i) how ethnic homophily affects the choice of optimal vaccine allocation strategy, (ii) that, notwithstanding potential ethical concerns, differentiating by ethnicity in these strategies can improve outcomes (e.g., fewer deaths), and (iii) that the most likely social context in the United States is very different from the standard assumptions made by models which do not account for ethnicity and this difference affects which allocation strategy is optimal.

  abstract     = {Cells process environmental cues by activating intracellular signaling pathways with numerous interconnections and opportunities for cross-regulation. We employed a systems biology approach to investigate intersections of kinase p38, a context-dependent tumor suppressor or promoter, with Akt and ERK, two kinases known to promote cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance in cancer. Using live, single cell microscopy, multiplexed fluorescent reporters of p38, Akt, and ERK activities, and a custom automated image-processing pipeline, we detected marked heterogeneity of signaling outputs in breast cancer cells stimulated with chemokine CXCL12 or epidermal growth factor (EGF). Basal activity of p38 correlated inversely with amplitude of Akt and ERK activation in response to either ligand. Remarkably, small molecule inhibitors of p38 immediately decreased basal activities of Akt and ERK but increased the proportion of cells with high amplitude ligand-induced activation of Akt signaling. To identify mechanisms underlying cross-talk of p38 with Akt signaling, we developed a computational model incorporating subcellular compartmentalization of signaling molecules by scaffold proteins . Dynamics of this model revealed that subcellular scaffolding of Akt accounted for observed regulation by p38. The model also predicted that differences in the amount of scaffold protein in a subcellular compartment captured the observed single cell heterogeneity in signaling. Finally, our model predicted that reduction in kinase signaling can be accomplished by both scaffolding and direct kinase inhibition. However, scaffolding inhibition can potentiate future kinase activity by redistribution of pathway components, potentially amplifying oncogenic signaling. These studies reveal how computational modeling can decipher mechanisms of cross-talk between the p38 and Akt signaling pathways and point to scaffold proteins as central regulators of signaling dynamics and amplitude.},

  abstract     = {We develop a lattice-based, hybrid discrete-continuum modeling framework for SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection in the human lung alveolar region, or parenchyma, the massive surface area for gas exchange. COVID-19 pneumonia is alveolar infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus significant enough to compromise gas exchange. The modeling framework orchestrates the onset and progression of alveolar infection, spatially and temporally, beginning with a pre-immunity baseline, upon which we superimpose multiple mechanisms of immune protection conveyed by interferons and antibodies. The modeling framework is tunable to individual profiles, focusing here on degrees of innate immunity, and to the evolving infection–replication properties of SARS-CoV-2 variant strains. The model employs partial differential equations for virion, interferon, and antibody concentrations governed by diffusion in the thin fluid coating of alveolar cells, species and lattice interactions corresponding to sources and sinks for each species, and multiple immune protections signaled by interferons. The spatial domain is a two-dimensional, rectangular lattice of alveolar type I (non-infectable) and type II (infectable) cells with a stochastic, species-concentration-governed, switching dynamics of type II lattice sites from healthy to infected. Once infected, type II cells evolve through three phases: an eclipse phase during which RNA copies (virions) are assembled; a shedding phase during which virions and interferons are released; and then cell death . Model simulations yield the dynamic spread of, and immune protection against, alveolar infection and viral load from initial sites of exposure. We focus in this paper on model illustrations of the diversity of outcomes possible from alveolar infection, first absent of immune protection, and then with varying degrees of four known mechanisms of interferon-induced innate immune protection. We defer model illustrations of antibody protection to future studies. Results presented reinforce previous recognition that interferons produced solely by infected cells are insufficient to maintain a high efficacy level of immune protection, compelling additional mechanisms to clear alveolar infection, such as interferon production by immune cells and adaptive immunity (e.g., T cells).

To do so, we estimated the time-varying disease transmission rate from the reported influenza cases and the time-varying antigenic change rate of the viruses from the changes in amino acid sequences. By incorporating the time-varying antigenic change rate into the transmission models, we found that the models could capture the evolutionary transmission dynamics of influenza viruses in the United States. Our modeling results also showed that the antigenic change of the virus plays an essential role in seasonal influenza dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Hair follicles (HFs) are stem-cell-rich mammalian mini-organs that can undergo cyclic regenerations over the life span of the organism. The cycle of a HF consists of three consecutive phases: anagen—the active proliferation phase, catagen—the degeneration phase, and telogen—the resting phase. While HFs undergo irreversible degeneration during catagen, recent experimental research on mice shows that when anagen HFs are subject to ionizing radiation (IR), they undergo a transient degeneration, followed by a nearly full regeneration that makes the HFs return to homeostatic state. The mechanisms underlying these IR-induced HF regenerative dynamics and the catagen degenerative dynamics, remain unknown. In this work, we develop an ODE type cell differentiation population model to study the control mechanisms of HF regeneration. The model is built based on current theoretical knowledge in biology and mathematically formulated using feedback mechanisms. Model parameters are calibrated to IR experimental data, and we then provide modeling results with both deterministic ODE simulations and corresponding stochastic simulations. We perform stability and bifurcation analyses on the ODE model, which reveal that for anagen HFs, a low spontaneous apoptosis rate secures the stability of the HF homeostatic steady state, allowing the HF to regenerate even when subject to strong IR. On the other hand, the irreversible degeneration during catagen results from both strong spontaneous apoptosis rate and strong apoptosis feedback. Lastly, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters in the model to validate these hypotheses.},

Combining Hamilton’s marginal rule for selection on scalar traits and concepts from optimal control theory, a necessary first-order condition for the evolutionary stability of the trait in a group-structured population is derived. The model, which is of intermediate level of complexity, fills a gap between the formalization of selection on evolving traits that are directly conceived as actions (no phenotypic plasticity) and selection on evolving traits that are conceived as strategies or function valued actions (complete phenotypic plasticity). By conceptualizing individuals as open deterministic dynamical systems expressing incomplete phenotypic plasticity , the model captures selection on a large class of phenotypic expression mechanisms, including developmental pathways and learning under life-history trade-offs. As an illustration of the results, a first-order condition for the evolutionary stability of behavior response rules from the social evolution literature is re-derived, strengthened, and generalized. All results of the paper also generalize directly to selection on multidimensional quantitative traits affecting behavior rule evolution, thereby covering neural and gene network evolution.},

  abstract     = {The mosquito-borne disease, malaria, continues to impose a devastating health and economic burden worldwide. In malaria-endemic areas, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have been useful in curtailing the burden of the disease. However, mosquito resistance to insecticides, decay in ITN efficacy, net attrition, etc., undermine the effectiveness of ITNs in combatting malaria. In this study, mathematical models that account for asymptomatic infectious humans (through a partially immune class or a separate asymptomatic infectious class), insecticide resistance , and decay in ITN efficacy are proposed and analyzed. Analytical and numerical results of the models when ITN efficacy is constant show that there are parameter regimes for which a backward bifurcation occurs. Local and global sensitivity analyses are performed to identify parameters (some of which are potential targets for disease control) with the most significant influence on the control reproduction ( R c Rc ) and disease prevalence. These influential parameters include the maximum biting rate of resistant mosquitoes, ITN coverage, initial ITN efficacy against sensitive mosquitoes, the probability that an infectious mosquito (human) infects a susceptible human (mosquito), and the rate at which adult mosquitoes develop (lose) resistance to insecticides. Simulations of the models show that accounting for asymptomatic infectious humans through a separate class, or not accounting for the decay in ITN efficacy leads to an underestimation of disease burden. In particular, if the initial efficacy of ITNs against sensitive and resistance mosquitoes is 96\%, the minimum ITN coverage required to reduce R c Rc below one (and hence, contain malaria) is approximately 11\% (27\%) lower when ITN efficacy is averaged (constant) for a model with a separate asymptomatic class. For the model with a partially immune class and decaying ITN efficacy, reducing R c Rc below one is impossible even if the entire populace uses ITNs. The study shows that replacing ITNs before their prescribed lifespans, or designing ITNs with longer lifespans is important for malaria control. Furthermore, the study shows that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ITNs (which inhibit or reverse insecticide resistance) outperform regular ITNs in malaria control. Hence, prospects for effectively controlling malaria are enhanced by widespread use of high quality ITNs (e.g. PBO ITNs), especially if the useful lifespans of the ITNs are long enough and the ITNs are replaced before the end of their useful lifespans.},

The present study aims to be a practical guide to monitoring the doubling time of infectious diseases. Via simulation exercise, we clarify the epidemiological characteristics of doubling time, allowing possible interpretations. We show that the commonly believed relationship between the doubling time and intrinsic growth rate in population ecology does not strictly apply to infectious diseases, and derive the correct relationship between the two. We examined the impact of varying (i) the growth rate, (ii) the starting point of counting cumulative number of cases, and (iii) the length of observation on statistical estimation of doubling time. It was difficult to recover values of growth rate from doubling time, especially when the growth rate was small. Starting time period is critical when the statistical estimation of doubling time occurs during the course of an epidemic. The length of observation was critical in determining the overall magnitude of doubling time, and when only the latest 1–2 weeks’ data were used, the resulting doubling time was very short, regardless of the intrinsic growth rate r . We suggest that doubling time estimates of infectious disease epidemics should at a minimum be accompanied by descriptions of (i) the starting time at which the cumulative count is initiated and (ii) the length of observation.},

  abstract     = {Since the mid-1990s, growing concerns over antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms has led to an increase in the use of mathematical models to explore the inter-host transmission of such infections. Previous work reviewing such models categorised them into generic frameworks based on their underlying assumptions. These assumptions dictated the coexistence between AMR and antimicrobial sensitive strains. We add to this work performing stability analyses of the frameworks, along with simulating them deterministically and stochastically. Stability analyses found that many of these assumptions lead to models having the same equilibria, but showed differences in the equilibria’s stability between models. Deterministic simulations reveal that assuming replacement of one infecting strain by another leads to an unusual antimicrobial treatment threshold. Increasing beyond this threshold causes a discontinuous increase in disease burden. The cost of AMR to pathogen fitness (lowered transmission) dictates both the threshold of treatment that causes the discontinuous increase in disease burden and the size of that increase. It was also shown that Superinfection states can be biased against resident strains and so favour coexistence of both strains. Stochastic simulations demonstrated that differing scenario starting conditions can guide models to converge upon equilibria that they may not have under deterministic simulation. These findings highlight the importance of checking assumptions when modelling AMR and strain competition more widely.},

  abstract     = {Given an endemic infectious disease and a budget, how do we optimally allocate interventions to control the disease? This paper shows that the optimal strategy varies depending on the budget, the type of intervention, the trajectory of pathogen load, and the objective. Using a model with explicit within- and between-host dynamics, we model isolation, supportive treatment, and specific treatment. Isolation and supportive treatment affect the transmission coefficient and the disease-induced mortality rate, respectively, in the between-host dynamics. Specific treatment affects the clearance rate of pathogens in the within-host dynamics. We study the optimisation of the three interventions for various budget levels via evaluating isolation and supportive treatment at the population level and specific treatment at both the population and individual levels. At the population level, we consider the risk of transmission, the burden of illness, and the survival probability, and to that end, we choose the population-level infection rate, the population density of infected individuals, and the total disease-induced mortality rate as objective functions. At the individual level, we consider the length of infection and the pathogen load, and to that end, we choose the maximum infection-age and the maximum pathogen load as objective functions. The objective is to minimise these functions through varying two variables that refer to when the intervention starts and when it stops for an infected individual and also indicate what kind of individuals can get the intervention from the population perspective. We find that the optimal strategy of isolation is to isolate individuals with a higher pathogen load, given a lower budget. The optimal strategy of supportive treatment can be the same as isolation or simply no treatment. The optimal strategy of specific treatment is complicated, and it can be to treat individuals with pathogen loads above a particular level until they recover or until the pathogens can decrease when treatment stops, or it can be another scenario.},

  abstract     = {Plant–microbe symbiosis is pervasive in the Earth’s ecosystems and dates back to the early land colonisation by plants. Mutualistic partnership with rhizobia bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi promotes plant nutrition , growth and diversity, impacting important ecosystem functions. However, how the global behaviour and dynamical properties of an ecosystem are modified by plant–microbe symbiosis is still unclear. To tackle this theoretical question, we resorted to the Daisyworld as a toy model of the global ecosystem. We redesigned the original model to allow accounting for seed production, spreading, germination, and seedling development to mature seed-producing plants to describe how symbiotic and non-symbiotic daisy species differ in these key processes. Using the steady-state and bifurcation analysis of this model, we demonstrate that symbiosis with microbes broadens the habitability range of the Daisyworld by enhancing plant growth and/or facilitating plant access to otherwise uninhabitable nutrient-poor regions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and predicting critical transitions in spatially explicit ecological systems is particularly challenging due to their complex spatial and temporal dynamics and high dimensionality. Here, we explore changes in population distribution patterns during a critical transition (an extinction event) using computational topology. Computational topology allows us to quantify certain features of a population distribution pattern, such as the level of fragmentation. We create population distribution patterns via a simple coupled patch model with Ricker map growth and nearest neighbors dispersal on a two dimensional lattice. We observe two dominant paths to extinction within the explored parameter space that depend critically on the dispersal rate d d and the rate of parameter drift, Δ ϵ Δϵ . These paths to extinction are easily topologically distinguishable, so categorization can be automated. We use this population model as a theoretical proof-of-concept for the methodology, and argue that computational topology is a powerful tool for analyzing dynamical changes in systems with noisy data that are coarsely resolved in space and/or time. In addition, computational topology can provide early warning signals for chaotic dynamical systems where traditional statistical early warning signals would fail. For these reasons, we envision this work as a helpful addition to the critical transitions prediction toolbox.},

  abstract     = {Complex interactions are at the root of the population dynamics of many natural systems, particularly for being responsible for the allocation of species and individuals across apposite niches of the ecological landscapes. On the other side, the randomness that unavoidably characterises complex systems has increasingly challenged the niche paradigm providing alternative neutral theoretical models. We introduce a network-inspired metapopulation individual-based model (IBM), hereby named self-segregation , where the density of individuals in the hosting patches (local habitats) drives the individuals spatial assembling while still constrained by nodes’ saturation. In particular, we prove that the core–periphery structure of the networked landscape triggers the spontaneous emergence of vacant habitat patches, which segregate the population in multistable patterns of isolated (sub)communities separated by empty patches. Furthermore, a quantisation effect in the number of vacant patches is observed once the total system mass varies continuously, emphasising thus a striking feature of the robustness of population stationary distributions. Notably, our model reproduces the patch vacancy found in the fragmented habitat of the Glanville fritillary butterfly Melitaea cinxia , an endemic species of the Åland islands. We argue that such spontaneous breaking of the natural habitat supports the concept of the highly contentious (Grinnellian) niche vacancy and also suggests a new mechanism for the endogeneous habitat fragmentation and consequently the peripatric speciation.},

  abstract     = {The theory of critical slowing down states that a system displays increasing relaxation times as it approaches a critical transition. These changes can be seen in statistics generated from timeseries data, which can be used as early warning signals of a transition. Such early warning signals would be of value for emerging infectious diseases or to understand when an endemic disease is close to elimination. However, in applications to a variety of epidemiological models there is frequent disagreement with the general theory of critical slowing down, with some indicators performing well on prevalence data but not when applied to incidence data. Furthermore, the alternative theory of critical speeding up predicts contradictory behaviour of early warning signals prior to some stochastic transitions. To investigate the possibility of observing critical speeding up in epidemiological models we characterise the behaviour of common early warning signals in terms of a system’s potential surface and noise around a quasi-steady state. We then describe a method to obtain these key features from timeseries data, taking as a case study a version of the SIS model, adapted to demonstrate either critical slowing down or critical speeding up. We show this method accurately reproduces the analytic potential surface and diffusion function, and that these results can be used to determine the behaviour of early warning signals and correctly identify signs of both critical slowing down and critical speeding up.},

Environmental fluctuations (noise) and randomness in the bio-chemical reactions can be very important and change the dynamical role of miR-17-92 in the regulatory network. We have formulated a stochastically forced miR-17-92 and E2F-Myc interaction model and study the phenomena of intrinsic and extrinsic noise which can induce random switching between steady states or the destruction of the bistability. Using a method that employs stochastic sensitivity functions we have constructed confidence ellipses to determine the configurational arrangements of equilibrium and spatial arrangements of random states near stable equilibria. Simulations are carried out to numerically show the flow of the solution trajectories under noise. Finally, we summarize the simulation results and the impact of noise on the dual non-linear role of miR-17-92 cluster to act as an oncogene or as a tumour suppressor gene .},

Bet-hedging is a strategy that helps species survive in such changing environments. However, studies of bet-hedging have often focused on the expected long-term growth rate of the species by itself, neglecting competition with other coexisting species. Here we study the extinction risk of a bet-hedging species in competition with others. We show that there are three contributions to the extinction risk. The first is the usual demographic fluctuation due to stochastic reproduction and selection processes in finite populations. The second, due to the fluctuation of population growth rate caused by environmental changes, may actually reduce the extinction risk for small populations. Besides those two, we reveal a third contribution, which is unique to bet-hedging species that diversify into multiple phenotypes: The phenotype composition of the population will fluctuate over time, resulting in increased extinction risk. We compare such compositional fluctuation to the demographic and environmental contributions, showing how they have different effects on the extinction risk depending on the population size, generation overlap, and environmental correlation.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial cells maintain their characteristic cell size over many generations. Several rod-shaped bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus , divide after adding a constant length to their length at birth. Through this division control known as the adder mechanism, perturbation in cell length due to physiological fluctuation decays over generations at a rate of 2 − 1 2−1 per cell division. However, previous experiments have shown that the circadian clock in cyanobacteria reduces cell division frequency at a specific time of day under constant light. This circadian gating should modulate the division control by the adder mechanism, but its significance remains unknown. Here we address how the circadian gating affects cell length, doubling time, and cell length stability in cyanobacteria by using mathematical models. We show that a cell subject to circadian gating grows for a long time, and gives birth to elongated daughter cells. These elongated daughter cells grow faster than the previous generation, as elongation speed is proportional to cell length and divide in a short time before the next gating. Hence, the distributions of doubling time and cell length become bimodal, as observed in experimental data. Interestingly, the average doubling time over the population of cells is independent of gating because the extension of doubling time by gating is compensated by its reduction in the subsequent generation. On the other hand, average cell length is increased by gating, suggesting that the circadian clock controls cell length. We then show that the decay rate of perturbation in cell length depends on the ratio of delay in division by the gating τ G τG to the average doubling time τ 0 τ0 as 2 τ G / τ 0 − 1 2τG/τ0−1 . We estimated τ G ≈ 2 . 5 τG≈2.5 , τ 0 ≈ 13 . 6 τ0≈13.6 hours, and τ G / τ 0 ≈ 0 . 18 τG/τ0≈0.18 from experimental data, indicating that a long doubling time in cyanobacteria maintains the decay rate similar to that of the adder mechanism. Thus, our analysis suggests that the acquisition of the circadian clock during evolution did not impose a constraint on cell size homeostasis in cyanobacteria.},

The control reproduction number R c Rc of the system is analyzed, and the existence and stability of equilibrium are given by the comparison principle. Numerical simulation was conducted to evaluate the vaccination program and intervention measures in the customized scenario, demonstrating that the group-3 coverage rate p 3 p3 plays a key role in R c Rc . It is proposed that accelerating the rate of admission and testing is conducive to epidemic control by further fitting data of COVID-19 transmission in real scenarios. The findings provide a general modeling idea for the emergence of new vaccines to prevent infection by mutant strains, as well as a solid theoretical foundation for mainland China to formulate future vaccination strategies for new vaccines.

They are crucial for normal cell development, providing structural support for the cell and aiding in the transportation of proteins and organelles . In order to perform these functions, MTs go through periods of relatively slow polymerization (growth) and very fast depolymerization (shortening), where the switch from growth to shortening is called a catastrophe and the switch from shortening to growth is called a rescue. Although MT dynamic instability has traditionally been described solely in terms of growth and shortening, MTs have been shown to pause for extended periods of time, however the reason for pausing is not well understood. Here, we present a new mathematical model to describe MT dynamics in terms of growth, shortening, and pausing. Typically, MT dynamics are defined by four key parameters which include the MT growth rate, shortening rate, frequency of catastrophe, and the frequency of rescue. We derive a mathematical expression for the catastrophe frequency in the presence of pausing, as well as expressions to describe the total time that MTs spend in a state of growth and pause. In addition to exploring MT dynamics in a control-like setting, we explore the implicit effect of stabilizing MT associated proteins (MAPs) and stabilizing and destabilizing chemotherapeutic drugs that target MTs on MT dynamics through variations in model parameters.},

  abstract     = {The colony formation in Mediterranean coral Corallium rubrum is initiated by a larva that metamorphoses into the first polyp of the emerging colony approximately two weeks after settlement. The primary polyp then sets up a slow process that eventually, at least after a few years, gives rise to a tree-like rigid colony structure on which other polyps flourish. For a mature colony, this axial skeleton provides support for new polyps. However, the first emergence of the characteristic axial skeleton can take two years or more from the larva stage. The early colony morphology, instead, is shaped exclusively by the polyps’ abundant deposition of sclerites, a magnesian calcite biomineral that has a different granularity from the distinctive red-coloured skeleton . With the appearance of the first polyp, a growing sclerite heap in a mesoglea layer provides a base for the emerging colony. In this paper, to elucidate the mechanical processes of early skeleton development in C. rubrum colonies, we present a computational model whereby the mesoglea layer provides a diffusion medium for the sclerites that the polyps deposit. We show that our stochastic model with three parameters captures the dynamic variability observed in measurements on living colonies. Our simulation results provide evidence for a diffusion process whereby the interplay between polyp budding and sclerite deposition are the main determinants of structure in early colony formation. Our model demonstrates that the frequency of budding events in an early colony can be described as a function of the available mesoglea surface whereas the number of polyps on the colony plays a secondary role in determining this frequency. We show that these model predictions are confirmed by direct observations on the colonies in our sample. Moreover, our results indicate that diffusion is a prevalent mechanism of colony development also at later stages of a colony’s life span.},

  abstract     = {Anti-angiogenic (AA) treatments have received significant research interest due to the key role of angiogenesis in cancer progression. AA agents can have a strong effect on cancer regression, by blocking new vessels and reducing the density of the existing vasculature. Moreover, in a process termed vascular normalisation, AA drugs can improve the abnormal structure and function of the tumour vasculature, enhancing the delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumour site. Despite their promising potential, an improved understanding of AA treatments is necessary to optimise their administration as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer treatments. In this work we present an in silico multiscale cancer model which is used to systematically interrogate the role of individual mechanisms of action of AA drugs in tumour regression. Focus is placed on the reduction of vascular density and on vascular normalisation through a parametric study, which are considered either as monotherapies or in combination with conventional/ metronomic chemotherapy. The model is specified to data from a mammary carcinoma xenograft in immunodeficient mice, to enhance the physiological relevance of model predictions. Our results suggest that conventional chemotherapy might be more beneficial when combined with AA treatments, hindering tumour growth without causing excessive damage on healthy tissue. Notably, metronomic chemotherapy has shown significant potential in stopping tumour growth with minimal toxicity, even as a monotherapy.

  abstract     = {Measles has re-emerged globally due to the accumulation of susceptible individuals and immunity gap, which causes challenges in eliminating measles. Routine vaccination and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have greatly improved measles control, but the impact of SIAs on the measles transmission dynamics remains unclear as the vaccine-induced immunity wanes. We developed a comprehensive measles transmission dynamics model by taking into account population demographics, age-specific contact patterns, seasonality, routine vaccination, SIAs, and the waning vaccine-induced immunity. The model was calibrated by the monthly age-specific cases data from 2005 to 2018 in Jiangsu Province, China, and validated by the dynamic sero-prevalence data. We aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term impact of three-time SIAs during 2009–2012 (9.68 million and 4.25 million children aged 8 months-14 years in March 2009 and September 2010, respectively, and 140,000 children aged 8 months-6 years in March 2012) on the measles disease burden and explored whether additional SIAs could accelerate the measles elimination. We estimated that the cumulative numbers of measles cases from March 2009 to December 2012 (in the short run) and to December 2018 (in the long run) after three-time SIAs (base case) were 6,699 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2,928–10,469), and 22,411 (15,146–29,675), which averted 45.0\% (42.9\%-47.0\%) and 34.3\% (30.7\%-37.9\%) of 12,226 (4,916–19,537) and 34,274 (21,350–47,199) cases without SIAs, respectively. The fraction of susceptibles for children aged 8–23 months and 2–14 years decreased from 8.3\% and 10.8\% in March 2009 to 5.8\% and 5.8\% in April 2012, respectively. However, the fraction of susceptibles aged 15–49 years and above 50 years increased gradually to about 15\% in 2018 irrespective of SIAs due to the waning immunity. The measles elimination goal would be reached in 2028, and administrating additional one-off SIAs in September 2022 to children aged 8–23 months, or young adolescents aged 15–19 years could accelerate the elimination one year earlier. SIAs have greatly reduced the measles incidence and the fraction of susceptibles, but the benefit may wane over time. Under the current interventions, Jiangsu province would reach the measles elimination goal in 2028. Additional SIAs may accelerate the measles elimination one year earlier.},

However, recent molecular biology analysis has revealed more complexity among the direct Wnt target genes, with at least five classes. Here in order to test the logic and the dynamics of a new Gene Regulatory Network model suggested by these discoveries we use mathematical modelling based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our mathematical modelling of this Gene Regulatory Network reveals that a simplified model, with one “super-gene” for each class is sufficient to a large extent to describe the regulatory behaviour previously observed experimentally.},

  abstract     = {The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) as a causative agent for epithelial cancers is well-known, but many open questions remain regarding the downstream gene regulatory effects of viral proteins E6 and E7 on the cell cycle. Here, we extend a cell cycle model originally presented by Gérard and Goldbeter (2009) in order to capture the effects of E6 and E7 on key actors in the cell cycle. Results suggest that E6 is sufficient to reverse p53-induced quiescence, while E7 is sufficient to reverse p16 INK4a -induced quiescence; both E6 and E7 are necessary when p53 and p16 INK4a are both active. Moreover, E7 appears to play a role as a “growth factor substitute”, inducing cell division in the absence of growth factor. Low levels of E7 may permit regular cell division, but the results suggest that higher levels of E7 dysregulate the cell cycle in ways that may destabilize the cellular genome. The mechanisms explored here provide opportunities for developing new treatment targets that take advantage of the cell cycle regulatory system to prevent HPV-related cancer effects.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical models were developed to propose a new mechanism enhancing mixed mating (reproduction by both outcrossing and selfing) in hermaphroditic plants; mixed mating can be maintained if there exists among-parent variation in early-acting inbreeding depression in embryos and parents can replace dead embryos by overproduction of ovules. In the two main models developed, the number of embryos produced is allowed to evolve, parents may overproduce embryos, and among-parent variation in early-acting inbreeding depression does not exist or exists. I found that mixed mating does not evolve if among-parent variation in early-acting inbreeding depression does not exist, whereas it evolves if it exists. If the degree of early-acting inbreeding depression in embryos is variable among parents, parents with the same selfing strategy suffer different effects of early-acting inbreeding depression. Specifically, overproduction of embryos may be insufficient when inbreeding depression is severe but wasteful when it is weak. Hence, it is advantageous to produce a moderate number of embryos to reduce waste of resources. Mixed mating is then advantageous to avoid great reductions in seed number caused by massive loss of selfed embryos in cases of severe inbreeding depression.},

This principle, known as energy balance, justifies the design of numerous investigations that aim to elucidate the biology of obesity. The present work provides a mathematical analysis that demonstrates, nonetheless, that weight stability must coexist with a constant energy imbalance, i.e., the average absorbed energy intake and the average expended energy are significantly different during steady weight periods. This analytical finding is not in contradiction with the First Law of Thermodynamics since open systems can manifest a stable mass in the absence of energy equilibrium. The effect of caloric imbalance on weight fluctuations is thus the result of its underlying net mass flux. The energy balance theory is, consequently, an inconsistent paradigm; and as such, the data analysis and interpretation that follows from its postulates is expected to be erroneous.},

This construction restricts the applicability of the resulting ‘Wright–Fisher diffusion equation’ to the weak selection, weak mutation regime of evolution. We argue that diffusion approximations of the Wright–Fisher model can be used more generally, for instance in cases where genetic drift is much weaker than selection. One important example of this regime is Muller’s ratchet phenomenon, whereby deleterious mutations slowly but irreversibly accumulate through rare stochastic fluctuations. Using a modified diffusion equation we derive improved analytical estimates for the mean click time of the ratchet.},

  abstract     = {Parental care is essential for biological systems. Marital bliss is one of the ideal paradigms for parental care, in which males contribute in raising offspring and females require a courtship time. Yet marital bliss state is neither Nash equilibrium nor Pareto optimum for the classic Battle of the Sexes. It thus leads to a gap between evolutionary theory and marital bliss. Previous works concentrate on the pairwise interactions between the two sexes to fill this gap, such as the courtship time and encounter rate. The social relationships within the same sex, however, receives much less attention. Here we investigate how social relationships within the same sex change marital bliss by introducing the coevolution of strategy and social network. Based on the time scale separation, it is found that a symmetric game is emergent via social adjustments within each sex, and the evolutionary outcome is determined by the interplay between the emergent symmetric game and the Battle of the Sexes. We find that marital bliss can be promoted when males are rational (strong selection limit) and females are irrational (weak selection limit); the stable Coy–Coy social relationships both stabilize and speed up marital bliss; the general criterion of stabilizing marital bliss for arbitrary imitation function are found, which are verified by simulations. Furthermore, the emergent symmetric games are insightful for determining whether the stable marital bliss is global stable. Our work provides an alternative avenue to facilitate marital bliss, which can be applied for general asymmetric games on dynamical networks.},

  abstract     = {Due to its implication in cancer treatment, the Warburg Effect has received extensive in silico investigation. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), based on constrained optimization, was successfully applied in the Warburg Effect modelling. Yet, the assumption that cell types have one invariant cellular objective severely limits the applicability of the previous FBA models. Meanwhile, we note that cell types with different objectives show different extents of the Warburg Effect. To extend the applicability of the previous model and model the disparate cellular pathway preferences in different cell types, we built a Nonlinear Multi-Objective FBA (NLMOFBA) model by including three key objective terms (ATP production rate, lactate generation rate and ATP yield) into one objective function through linear scalarization. By constructing a cellular objective map and iteratively varying the objective weights, we showed disparate cellular pathway preferences manifested by different cell types driven by their unique cellular objectives, and we gained insights about the causal relationship between cellular objectives and the Warburg Effect. In addition, we obtained other biologically consistent results by using our NLMOFBA model. For example, augmented with the constraint associated with inefficient mitochondria function, low oxygen availability, or limited substrate, NLMOFBA predicts cellular pathways supported by the biology literature. Collectively, our NLMOFBA model can help build a complete understanding towards the Warburg Effect in different cell types. Finally, we investigated the impact of glutaminolysis, an important pathway related to glycolysis, on the occurrence of the Warburg Effect by using linear programming.},

Besides cAMP signaling our model considers specific cGMP effects including external stimuli by drugs. Moreover, the output of the cGMP module serves as input for a modular model of VASP phosphorylation and for the activity of cAMP and cGMP pathways in platelets. Experimental data driven modeling allows us to design models with quantitative output. We use the condensed information about involved regulation and system responses for modeling drug effects and obtaining optimal experimental settings. Stepwise further validation of our model is given by direct experimental data. We present a general framework for model integration using modules and their stimulus responses. We demonstrate it by a multi-modular model for platelet signaling focusing on cGMP and VASP phosphorylation. Moreover, this allows to estimate drug action on any of the inhibitory cyclic nucleotide pathways (cGMP, cAMP) and is supported by experimental data.},

This study aimed to establish a coupled cortical thalamic model with uncertain coupling distances. Utilizing different pathways formed by the pyramidal neuronal population, thalamic reticular nucleus, and thalamic relay nucleus, we reduced epileptic seizures with spike-wave discharges (SWDs) at 2–4 Hz. In modelling terms, numerical simulations demonstrated that a combination (1/3, 1/9) of the left and right ventricles is the optimal coupling distance of the proposed model by analyzing the percentage of SWDs. In simulation terms, on the one hand, the number of SWDs is inversely proportional to the amplitude; on the other hand, the number of SWDs shows a U-shaped trend with the change in frequency. The present study provides an important theoretical basis and direction for the future treatment of absence epilepsy. In brief, our simulation results will hopefully provide some help to patients.},

  abstract     = {Invasive species account for incalculable damages worldwide, in both ecological and bioeconomic terms. The question of how a network of invasive populations can be optimally managed is one that deserves further exploration. A study accounting for partial observability and imperfect detection, in particular, could yield useful insights into species eradication efforts. Here, we generalized a simple model system that we developed in previous work. This model consists of three interacting populations with underlying strong Allee effects and stochastic dynamics, inhabiting distinct locations connected by dispersal, which can generate bistability. To explore the stochastic dynamics, we formulated an individual-based modeling approach. Next, using the theory of continuous-time Markov chains, we approximated the original high-dimensional model by a Markov chain with eight states, with each state corresponding to a combination of population thresholds. We then used the reduced model as the core for a powerful decision-making tool, referred to as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Analysis of this POMDP indicates when the system results in optimal management outcomes.},

  abstract     = {One of the fundamental mechanisms in embryogenesis is the process by which cells differentiate and create tissues and structures important for functioning as a multicellular organism. Morphogenesis involves diffusive process of chemical signalling involving morphogens that pre-pattern the tissue. These morphogens influence cell fate through a highly nonlinear process of transcriptional signalling. In this paper, we consider this multiscale process in an idealised model for a growing domain. We focus on intracellular processes that lead to robust differentiation into two cell lineages through interaction of a single morphogen species with a cell fate variable that undergoes a bifurcation from monostability to bistability. In particular, we investigate conditions that result in successful and robust pattern formation into two well-separated domains, as well as conditions where this fails and produces a pinned boundary wave where only one part of the domain grows. We show that successful and unsuccessful patterning scenarios can be characterised in terms of presence or absence of a folded saddle singularity for a system with two slow variables and one fast variable; this models the interaction of slow morphogen diffusion, slow parameter drift through bifurcation and fast transcription dynamics. We illustrate how this approach can successfully model acquisition of three cell fates to produce three-domain “French flag” patterning, as well as for a more realistic model of the cell fate dynamics in terms of two mutually inhibiting transcription factors.},

  abstract     = {Identifying mechanisms underlying neurons ability to process information including acquisition, storage, and retrieval plays an important role in the understanding of the different types of memory, pathogenesis of many neurological diseases affecting memory and therapeutic target discovery. However, the traditional understanding of the mechanisms of memory associated with the electrical signals having a unique combination of frequency and amplitude does not answer the question how the memories can survive for life-long periods of time, while exposed to synaptic noise. Recent evidence suggests that, apart from neuronal circuits, a diversity of the molecular memory (MM) carriers, are essential for memory performance. The molecular model of memory (MMM) is proposed, according to which each item of incoming information (the elementary memory item – eMI) is encoded by both circuitries, with the unique for a given MI electrical parameters, and also the MM carriers, unique by its molecular composition. While operating as the carriers of incoming information, the MMs, are functioning within the neuron plasma membrane. Inactive (latent) initially, during acquisition each of the eMIs is activated to become a virtual copy of some real fact or events bygone. This activation is accompanied by the considerable remodeling of the MM molecule associated with the resonance effect.},

Meanwhile, the gene networks perform integral regulation of the genome and control over the formation of phenotypic traits of the organism. Mechanisms of phase variation, such as genomic rearrangements and DNA methylation, affect the regulatory contours of gene networks. At the same time, the gene networks themselves may be the key cause of the appearance of phenotypic variants. Here we propose a new class of gene networks that represent a ring connection of genetic triggers based on an oscillator with cyclic gene repression, termed the tringers. It is shown in silico that the tringers are able to provide splitting the homogeneous bacterial population into cellular subpopulations with alternative expression of controlled genes (phases), stable inheritance of phases, and switching between them, in particular, returning to a homogeneous state. Switching can be carried out under the influence of external and internal factors, both directly and by signals from specialized molecular genetic systems of the cell, in particular, the response to various types of stress. Such epigenetic structures with the function of a phase switching controller are possible in nature and applicable in synthetic biology .},

  abstract     = {Long-term cooperation, competition, or exploitation among individuals can be modeled through repeated games. In repeated games, Press and Dyson discovered zero-determinant (ZD) strategies that enforce a special relationship between two players. This special relationship implies that a ZD player can unilaterally impose a linear payoff relationship to the opponent regardless of the opponent’s strategies. A ZD player also has a property that can lead the opponent to an unconditional cooperation if the opponent tries to improve its payoff. This property has been mathematically confirmed by Chen and Zinger. Humans often underestimate a payoff obtained in the future. However, such discounting was not considered in their analysis. Here, we mathematically explored whether a ZD player can lead the opponent to an unconditional cooperation even if a discount factor is incorporated. Specifically, we represented the expected payoff with a discount factor as the form of determinants and calculated whether the values obtained by partially differentiating each factor in the strategy vector become positive. As a result, we proved that the strategy vector ends up as an unconditional cooperation even when starting from any initial strategy. This result was confirmed through numerical calculations. We extended the applicability of ZD strategies to real world problems.},

We consider two new settings for multiplayer ZD strategies: competitions with all ZD strategies and competitions with all memory-one strategies, apart from the competitions between these strategies and some classical ones. Moreover, we investigate the influence of the level of generosity and extortion on evolutionary dynamics of generous and extortionate ZD strategies, which was commonly ignored in previous studies. Theoretical results show that players with limited generosity are at an advantageous place and extortioners extorting more severely hold their ground more readily.

  abstract     = {The retinal vasculature supplies oxygen to the inner layers of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the eye. During development, formation of the retinal vasculature depends on prior establishment of a mesh of astrocytes, a type of glial cell , which guide the growth of the vascular network . Astrocytes emerge from the optic nerve head and proliferate and spread, forming a mesh-like layer over the retinal surface. The initially formed cells are termed astrocyte precursor cells (APCs), which differentiate into immature perinatal astrocytes (IPAs) during the prenatal period. A continuum model is developed to describe the proliferation, differentiation, and migration these cells. Effects of oxygen and growth factor levels on proliferation and differentiation are included. Cell migration is driven by gradients in tension in the astrocyte mesh, which varies inversely with total density. The resulting governing equations have the form of a nonlinear diffusion-like equation. The model can account for the observed radial spread over time of the astrocyte disk. Experimental observations show that the APCs form a narrow rim around the edge of this disk, with IPAs in the interior. The model predicts this behavior if the mobility of the APCs is assumed to be higher than that of the IPAs under a given tension gradient. Thus, the model shows how tension-driven cell motions can account for separation of cell types in a cell layer spreading over a substrate.},

  abstract     = {Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, and represents the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Experimental studies have shown that these solid cancers are heavily infiltrated with macrophages: anti-tumour M1 macrophages, pro-tumour M2 macrophages, and macrophage subtypes sharing both M1 and M2 properties. In this study we aim to investigate qualitatively the role of macrophages with different functional phenotypes (especially those with mixed phenotypes) on cancer dynamics and the success of different immunotherapies for cancer. To this end, we start with two time-evolving mathematical models for cancer-immune interactions that consider: (i) the effect of the two extreme phenotypes, M1 and M2 cells; (ii) the effect of M1 and M2 cells, as well as a macrophage sub-population with a mixed phenotype (throughout this theoretical study we call these cells “M12 cells”). We compare the dynamics of the two models using computational approaches, paying particular attention to the effect of different anti-cancer immunotherapies that focus on macrophages. Since data available for NSCLC and macrophage interactions are incomplete, we perform a global sensitivity analysis to see the influence of input parameters on model outcomes. Finally, we consider extensions of the previous two models to include also the spatial movement of cells, and investigate the role of macrophages with extreme phenotypes and with mixed phenotypes, on the invasion of cancer cells into the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We use numerical simulations to investigate the macrophages phenotypes at the tumour center versus the invasive margin. Again, we examine the impact of immunotherapies for cancer on the spatial dynamics of cancers and immune cells, and observe a shift in the phenotype of macrophages distributed at the tumour center and invasive margin.},

It’s important to capture the underlying mechanism to explore more efficient implementation patterns of NPIs in order to prevent the future resurgence. In this study, outbreaks caused by Delta variant in Xi’an, Yangzhou and Guangzhou in 2021 are chosen as the examples. A novel model dividing the population into three groups is proposed to describe the heterogeneity of control interventions. The model is calibrated and key parameters related to NPIs are estimated by using multi-source epidemic data. The estimation results show a lower transmission probability but a higher initial reproduction number in Xi’an. Sensitivity analysis are conducted to investigate the impact of various control measures in different epidemic phases. The results identify the vital role of enhancing closed-off management, strengthening tracing and testing intensities, on shortening the epidemic durations and reducing the final size. Further, we find that sufficiently implemented closed-off management would prevent the city from lockdown. Strengthening the tracing other than the testing strategy in the initial stage is more effective on containing the epidemic in a shorter duration with less infections.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic individual-based mathematical models are attractive for modelling biological phenomena because they naturally capture the stochasticity and variability that is often evident in biological data. Such models also allow us to track the motion of individuals within the population of interest. Unfortunately, capturing this microscopic detail means that simulation and parameter inference can become computationally expensive. One approach for overcoming this computational limitation is to coarse-grain the stochastic model to provide an approximate continuum model that can be solved using far less computational effort. However, coarse-grained continuum models can be biased or inaccurate, particularly for certain parameter regimes. In this work, we combine stochastic and continuum mathematical models in the context of lattice-based models of two-dimensional cell biology experiments by demonstrating how to simulate two commonly used experiments: cell proliferation assays and barrier assays . Our approach involves building a simple statistical model of the discrepancy between the expensive stochastic model and the associated computationally inexpensive coarse-grained continuum model. We form this statistical model based on a limited number of expensive stochastic model evaluations at design points sampled from a user-chosen distribution, corresponding to a computer experiment design problem. With straightforward design point selection schemes, we show that using the statistical model of the discrepancy in tandem with the computationally inexpensive continuum model allows us to carry out prediction and inference while correcting for biases and inaccuracies due to the continuum approximation. We demonstrate this approach by simulating a proliferation assay , where the continuum limit model is the well-known logistic ordinary differential equation, as well as a barrier assay where the continuum limit model is closely related to the well-known Fisher-KPP partial differential equation. We construct an approximate likelihood function for parameter inference, both with and without discrepancy correction terms. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we provide point estimates of the unknown parameters, and use the profile likelihood to characterise the uncertainty in these estimates and form approximate confidence intervals. For the range of inference problems considered, working with the continuum limit model alone leads to biased parameter estimation and confidence intervals with poor coverage. In contrast, incorporating correction terms arising from the statistical model of the model discrepancy allows us to recover the parameters accurately with minimal computational overhead. The main tradeoff is that the associated confidence intervals are typically broader, reflecting the additional uncertainty introduced by the approximation process. All algorithms required to replicate the results in this work are written in the open source Julia language and are available at GitHub.},

To discuss the generalization of the results, we compare the square root result to the optimal survival rate of the Pella–Tomlinson model. Furthermore, to test the practical relevance of the square root identities, we fit a stochastic Pella–Tomlinson model to observed Barramundi fishery data from the Southern Gulf of Carpentaria , Australia. The results show that for the estimated model parameters, the equilibrium biomass levels resulting from the MSY harvest and the square root harvest are similar, supporting the claim that the square root harvest can serve as a rule-of-thumb. This application, with its inherited model uncertainty, sparks a risk sensitivity analysis regarding the probability of populations falling below an unsustainable threshold. Characterization of such sensitivity helps in the understanding of both dangers of overfishing and potential remedies.},

The difficulty is alleviated if we assume that reputation and cooperation do not take binary values but have continuous spectra so that disagreement over reputation can be analysed in a perturbative way. In this work, we carry out the analysis by expanding the dynamics of reputation to the second order of perturbation under the assumption that everyone initially cooperates with good reputation. The second-order theory clarifies the difference between Image Scoring and Simple Standing in that punishment for defection against a well-reputed player should be regarded as good for maintaining cooperation. Moreover, comparison among the leading eight shows that the stabilizing effect of justified punishment weakens if cooperation between two ill-reputed players is regarded as bad. Our analysis thus explains how Simple Standing achieves a high level of stability by permitting justified punishment and also by disregarding irrelevant information in assessing cooperation. This observation suggests which factors affect the stability of a social norm when reputation can be perturbed by noise.},

  abstract     = {Gamma oscillations are a prominent feature of various neural systems, including the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. In CA3, in vitro carbachol application induces ∼ ∼ 40 Hz gamma oscillations in the network of glutamatergic excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) and local GABAergic inhibitory neurons (INs). Activation of NMDA receptors within CA3 leads to an increase in the frequency of carbachol-induced oscillations to ∼ ∼ 60 Hz, a broadening of the distribution of individual oscillation cycle frequencies, and a decrease in the time lag between PN and IN spike bursts. In this work, we develop a biophysical integrate-and-fire model of the CA3 subfield, we show that the dynamics of our model are in concordance with physiological observations, and we provide computational support for the hypothesis that the ‘E-I’ mechanism is responsible for the emergence of ∼ ∼ 40 Hz gamma oscillations in the absence of NMDA activation. We then incorporate NMDA receptors into our CA3 model, and we show that our model exhibits the increase in gamma oscillation frequency, broadening of the cycle frequency distribution, and decrease in the time lag between PN and IN spike bursts observed experimentally. Remarkably, we find an inverse relationship in our model between the net NMDA current delivered to PNs and INs in an oscillation cycle and cycle frequency. Furthermore, we find a disparate effect of NMDA receptors on PNs versus INs – we show that NMDA receptors on INs tend to increase oscillation frequency, while NMDA receptors on PNs tend to slightly decrease or not affect oscillation frequency. We find that these observations can be explained if NMDA activity above a threshold level causes a shift in the mechanism underlying gamma oscillations; in the absence of NMDA receptors, the ‘E-I’ mechanism is primarily responsible for the generation of gamma oscillations (at 40 Hz), while when NMDA receptors are active, the mechanism of gamma oscillations shifts to the ‘I-I’ mechanism, and we argue that within the ‘I-I’ regime (which displays a higher baseline oscillation frequency of ∼ ∼ 60 Hz), slight changes in the level of NMDA activity are inversely related to cycle frequency.},

Given a sample population of phenotype measurements, from various known genotypes, we show how the ordering of phenotype data can lead to quantification of the effect of genotype. This method does not assume that the data has a Gaussian distribution, it is particularly effective at extracting weak and unusual dependencies of genotype on phenotype. However, in cases where data has a special form, (eg Gaussian), we observe that the effective phenotype field has a special form. We use asymptotic analysis to solve both the forward and reverse formulations of the problem. We show how p -values can be calculated so that the significance of correlation between phenotype and genotype can be quantified. This provides a significant generalisation of the traditional methods used in genome-wide association studies GWAS. We derive a field-strength which can be used to deduce how the correlations between genotype and phenotype, and their impact on the distribution of phenotypes.},

  abstract     = {Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is widely known for its poor prognosis because it is often diagnosed when the cancer is in a later stage. We built a Boolean model to analyze the microenvironment of pancreatic cancer in order to better understand the interplay between pancreatic cancer, stellate cells, and their signaling cytokines. Specifically, we have used our model to study the impact of inducing four common mutations: KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A. After implementing the various mutation combinations, we used our stochastic simulator to derive aggressiveness scores based on simulated attractor probabilities and long-term trajectory approximations. These aggression scores were then corroborated with clinical data. Moreover, we found sets of control targets that are effective among common mutations. These control sets contain nodes within both the pancreatic cancer cell and the pancreatic stellate cell, including PIP3, RAF, PIK3 and BAX in pancreatic cancer cell as well as ERK and PIK3 in the pancreatic stellate cell. Many of these nodes were found to be differentially expressed among pancreatic cancer patients in the TCGA database. Furthermore, literature suggests that many of these nodes can be targeted by drugs currently in circulation. The results herein help provide a proof of concept in the path towards personalized medicine through a means of mathematical systems biology.

Evidence suggests that roads can have an important effect on the spread of invasive plant species, although little is known about the underlying mechanisms at play. We have developed a novel mathematical model to analyse the impact of roads on the propagation of invasive plants. The integro-difference equation model is formulated for stage-structured population and incorporates a road sub-domain in the spatial domain. The results of our study reveal, that, depending on the definition of the growth function in the model, there are three distinct types of behaviour in front of the road. Roads can act as barriers to invasion, lead to a formation of a beachhead in front of the road, or act as corridors allowing the invasive species to invade the domain in front of the road. Analytical and computational findings on how roads can impact the spread of invasive species show that a small change in conditions of the environment favouring the invasive species can change the case for the road, allowing the invasive species to invade the domain in front of the road where it previously could not spread.},

  abstract     = {Seasonal variations in environmental conditions lead to changing infectious disease epidemic risks at different times of year. The probability that early cases initiate a major epidemic depends on the season in which the pathogen enters the population. The instantaneous epidemic risk (IER) can be tracked. This quantity is straightforward to calculate, and corresponds to the probability of a major epidemic starting from a single case introduced at time t = t 0 t=t0 , assuming that environmental conditions remain identical from that time onwards (i.e. for all t ≥ t 0 t≥t0 ). However, the threat when a pathogen enters the population in fact depends on changes in environmental conditions occurring within the timescale of the initial phase of the outbreak. For that reason, we compare the IER with a different metric: the case epidemic risk (CER). The CER corresponds to the probability of a major epidemic starting from a single case entering the population at time t = t 0 t=t0 , accounting for changes in environmental conditions after that time. We show how the IER and CER can be calculated using different epidemiological models (the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model and a stochastic host-vector model that is parameterised using temperature data for Miami) in which transmission parameter values vary temporally. While the IER is always easy to calculate numerically, the adaptable method we provide for calculating the CER for the host-vector model can also be applied easily and solved using widely available software tools. In line with previous research, we demonstrate that, if a pathogen is likely to either invade the population or fade out on a fast timescale compared to changes in environmental conditions, the IER closely matches the CER. However, if this is not the case, the IER and the CER can be significantly different, and so the CER should be used. This demonstrates the need to consider future changes in environmental conditions carefully when assessing the risk posed by emerging pathogens.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, new research programmes have been initiated to understand the role of gut bacteria in health and disease, enabled in large part by the emergence of high-throughput sequencing. As new genomic and other data emerge it will become important to explain observations in terms of underlying population mechanisms; for instance, it is of interest to understand how resident bacteria interact with their hosts and pathogens, and how they play a protective role. Connecting underlying processes with observed patterns is aided by the development of mathematical models. Here, we develop a spatial model of microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract to explore conditions under which inflammation-causing bacteria can invade the gut and under which such pathogens become persistent. We find that pathogens invade both small and large intestine from even a relatively small inoculum size but are usually eliminated by the host response. When the immune response is weak, the pathogen is able to persist for a long period. Spatial structure affects these dynamics by creating moving refugia which facilitate bouts of pathogen resurgence and inflammation in persistent infections. Space also plays a role in repopulation by commensals after infection. We further find that the rate of decay of inflammation has a stronger effect on outcomes than the initiation of inflammation or other parameters. Finally, we explore the impact of partially inflammation-resistant commensals on these dynamics.},

This conditioned model arises in a variety of applications, such as speciation, horizontal gene transfer or transmission analysis, and yet the bounded coalescent model has not been previously analysed in detail. Here we describe a new algorithm to simulate from this model directly, without resorting to rejection sampling. We show that this direct simulation algorithm is more computationally efficient than the rejection sampling approach. We also show how to calculate the probability of the last common ancestor occurring after a given date, which is required to compute the probability density of realisations under the bounded coalescent model. Our results are applicable in both the isochronous (when all samples have the same date) and heterochronous (where samples can have different dates) settings. We explore the effect of setting a bound on the date of the last common ancestor, and show that it affects a number of properties of the resulting phylogenies. All our methods are implemented in a new R package called BoundedCoalescent which is freely available online.},

  abstract     = {Multi-strain pathogens such as Group A Streptococcus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Staphylococcus aureus cause millions of infections each year with a substantial health burden. Control of multi-strain pathogens can be complicated by the high strain diversity often observed in endemic settings. It is not well understood how high strain diversity is maintained in populations, given that they compete with each other both directly (within an individual host) and indirectly (via host immunity). Previous modelling studies have investigated how indirect competition affects the prevalence and diversity of strains. However, these studies often make simplifying assumptions about the direct competition that occurs within hosts. Currently, little data is available to validate these assumptions, hence there is a need to clarify how sensitive model outputs are to these assumptions. In this study, we compare the dynamics of multi-strain pathogens under different assumptions about direct competition between strains using an agent-based model. We find that the assumptions made about direct competition can affect the epidemiological dynamics, particularly when there is no long-term immunity following infections and a low rate of importation of non-circulating strains. Our results suggest that while direct and indirect competition can each decrease strain diversity when they act in isolation, they may increase strain diversity when they act together. This finding highlights the importance of examining sensitivity to assumptions about strain competition. In particular, omitting consideration of direct competition can lead to inaccurate estimates of the likely effectiveness of control strategies as changes in strain diversity shift the level of direct strain competition.},

We check the robustness of our model by considering some more complex premises. First, different hierarchical relations between the singers are explored, adapting methods used in the flocking motion studies. Then a population-dependant simulation shows that even considering the gradual addition of new whales, the evolution is still globally linear. Finally, we show that intra-annual variations surging from different causes can be naturally incorporated into the model. We then conclude that, unlike other explanations, a cultural hypothesis seems compatible with the observed linearity of the blue whales’s songs frequency shift.},

By numerically exploring discrepancies in timescales and attractors between both formalizations, we characterize the impact of stochastic fluctuations on the individual and ensemble transport. Biologically, we find that noise promotes the collective movement of intermediate filaments and increases the efficiency of its regulation by the biochemical properties of motor-cargo interactions. While stochastic fluctuations reduce the impact of the initial distributions of motor proteins in cells, the number of binding sites and the affinity of motor-cargo interactions are the key parameters controlling transport efficiency and efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Tumor oxygenation is one of the key features influencing the response of cells to radiation and chemo therapies. This study presents a novel in silico tumor model simulating realistic 3D microvascular structures and related oxygenation maps, featuring regions with different levels and typologies of hypoxia (chronic, acute and anemic). Such model, if integrated into a treatment planning system, could allow evaluations and comparisons of various scenarios when deciding the therapy to administer. Methods and Materials: Spherical tumors between 0.6 and 1.5 cm in diameter encompassed uniformly by vascular trees generated starting from pseudo-fractal principles were simulated with a voxel resolution of 10 µm. The approach ensures a continuous transition from a well-perfused rim to a core with poor vascularization. The oxygen diffusion equation in the tumor is solved by a finite difference method. Several quantities, such as the fractal dimension (FD), the microvascular density (MVD) and the hypoxic fraction (HF) were assessed and compared. Results: Different tumors with various degrees of chronic hypoxia were simulated by varying the tumor size and the number of bifurcations in the vascular networks. The simulations showed that for the case of chronically hypoxic tumors, in well-oxygenated volumes FD = 2.53 ± 0.07, MVD = 3460 ± 2180 vessels/mm 3 and HF = 4.0 ± 3.4\%, while in hypoxic volumes FD = 2.34 ± 0.09, MVD = 365 ± 156 vessels/mm 3 , HF = 49.8 ± 18.3\%. The superimposition of acute or anemic hypoxia accentuated the oxygen deprivation in the core of the volumes. Conclusions: Tumors varying in diameter and extension of their vasculature were simulated, showing features that define two distinctive subvolumes in terms of oxygenation. The model could be regarded as a testbed for simulations of key radiobiological features governing the tumor response to radio- and chemotherapy and thus for treatment outcome simulations.},

  abstract     = {Solid tumour growth depends on a host of factors which affect the cell life cycle and extracellular matrix vascularization that leads to a favourable environment. The whole solid tumour can either grow or wither in response to the action of the immune system and therapeutics. A personalised mathematical model of such behaviour must consider both the intra- and inter-cellular dynamics and the mechanics of the solid tumour and its microenvironment. However, such wide range of spatial and temporal scales can hardly be modelled in a single model, and require the so-called multiscale models, defined as orchestrations of single-scale component models, connected by relation models that transform the data for one scale to another. While multiscale models are becoming common, there is a well-established engineering approach to the definition of the scale separation, e.g., how the spatiotemporal continuum is split in the various component models. In most studies scale separation is defined as natural, linked to anatomical concepts such as organ, tissue, or cell; but these do not provide reliable definition of scales: for examples skeletal organs can be as large as 500 mm (femur), or as small as 3 mm (stapes). Here we apply a recently proposed scale-separation approach based on the actual experimental and computational limitations to a patient-specific model of the growth of neuroblastoma. The resulting multiscale model can be properly informed with the available experimental data and solved in a reasonable timeframe with the available computational resources.},

  abstract     = {T cell therapy has become a new therapeutic opportunity against solid cancers. Predicting T cell behaviour and efficacy would help therapy optimization and clinical implementation. In this work, we model responsiveness of mouse prostate adenocarcinoma to T cell-based therapies. The mathematical model is based on a Cahn-Hilliard diffuse interface description of the tumour, coupled with Keller-Segel type equations describing immune components dynamics. The model is fed by pre-clinical magnetic resonance imaging data describing anatomical features of prostate adenocarcinoma developed in the context of the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate model. We perform computational simulations based on the finite element method to describe tumor growth dynamics in relation to local T cells concentrations. We report that when we include in the model the possibility to activate tumor-associated vessels and by that increase the number of T cells within the tumor mass, the model predicts higher therapeutic effects (tumor regression) shortly after therapy administration. The simulated results are found in agreement with reported experimental data. Thus, this diffuse-interface mathematical model well predicts T cell behavior in vivo and represents a proof-of-concept for the role such predictive strategies may play in optimization of immunotherapy against cancer.},

This paper presents a real-time analog circuit of the Li-Rinzel calcium model based on common-mode (CM) in 180 nm CMOS technology. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report to introduce a real-time analog circuit of Li-Rinzel model in an integrated standard CMOS technology. The careful design of equations and low power consumption are essential features of this circuit.

  abstract     = {Many marine and terrestrial species live in groups, whose sizes and dynamics can vary depending on the type and strength of their social interactions. Typical examples of such groups in vertebrates are schools of fish or flocks of bird. Natural habitats can encompass a wide range of spatial heterogeneities, which can also shape the structure of animal groups, depending on the interplay between the attraction/repulsion of environmental cues and social interactions. A key issue in modern applied ecology and conservation is the need to understand the relationship between these ethological and ecological scales in order to account for the social behaviour of animals in their natural environments. Here, we introduce a modeling approach which studies animal groups within heterogeneous habitats constituted by a set of aggregative sites. The model properties are investigated considering the case study of tropical tuna schools and their associative behavior with floating objects, a question of global concern, given the thousands of floating objects deployed by industrial tropical tuna fisheries worldwide. The effects of increasing numbers of aggregative sites (floating objects) on tuna schools are studied. This study offers a general modeling framework to study social species in their habitats, accounting for both ethological and ecological drivers of animal group dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The classic Hawk-Dove game is a symmetric game in that it does not distinguish between the winners and losers of Hawk-Hawk or Dove-Dove contests. Either of the two interacting Hawks or the two interacting Doves have the same probability to win/lose the contest. In addition, all pairwise interactions take the same time and after disbanding, the individuals pair instantaneously again. This article develops an asymmetric version of the Hawk-Dove model where all costs are measured by the time lost. These times are strategy dependent and measure the length of the conflict and, when a fight occurs between two interacting Hawks, the time an individual needs to recover and pair again. These recovery times depend on whether the Hawk won or lost the contest so that we consider an asymmetric Hawk-Dove game where we distinguish between winners and losers. However, the payoff matrix for this game does not correspond to the standard bimatrix game, because some entries are undefined. To calculate strategy payoffs we consider not only costs and benefits obtained from pairwise contests but also costs when individuals are disbanded. Depending on the interacting and recovery times, the evolutionary outcomes are: Hawk only, both Hawk and Dove, and a mixed strategy. This shows that measuring the cost in time lost leads to a new prediction since, in the classic (symmetric) Hawk-Dove model that does assume positive cost ( C &gt; 0 C&amp;gt;0 ), both Hawk and Dove strategy is never an evolutionary outcome.},

All simulation results (hormone concentrations and ovarian follicle sizes) are in biological units and can easily be compared to clinical data. The model takes into account variability in follicles’ response to stimulating hormones, which introduces variability between cycles. The growth of ovarian follicles in waves is an emergent property in our model simulations and further supports the hypothesis that follicular waves are also present in humans. We use Approximate Bayesian Computation and cluster analysis to construct a population of virtual subjects and to study parameter distributions and sensitivities. The model can be used to compare and optimize treatment protocols for ovarian hyperstimulation, thus potentially forming the integral part of a clinical decision support system in reproductive endocrinology.},

  abstract     = {A new flight mode in birds that decreases the energy costs is described. This flight mode consists basically of a powered-glide phase and a climb phase. These phases constitute a cycle that is continually performed. The powered-glide phase shows a reduced wing flapping for generating thrust at an intermediate level. Other than a glide with a fixed wing posture, there is an energy support in the powered glide. It is shown that powered-gliding/climbing flight enables a decrease of the energy costs to yield a low fuel consumption. The powered-glide phase is determinative for achieving the decrease of the energy costs. The results based on this effect suggest that powered-gliding/climbing flight shows the lowest fuel consumption per range when compared with other travel flight modes including the flight at constant altitude. It has been found that birds perform continual altitude changes in long-distance flights rather than flying at a constant altitude. There is evidence based on observations and measurements that the descents in these altitude changes take place as powered glides. This suggests that long-distance flights with altitude changes consist of powered-gliding/climbing flight with repeated cycles.},

It poses a threat to cervid populations and the local ecological and economic communities that depend on them. Although empirical studies have shown that host home range overlap and male dispersal are important in the spread of disease, there are few mechanistic models explicitly considering those factors. We built a spatio-temporal, differential equation model for CWD spreading with restricted movement of hosts within home ranges. The model incorporates both direct and environmental transmission within and between groups as well as male dispersal. We compared the relative influence of host density, sex ratio, home range size, and male dispersal distance on the spreading speed using sensitivity analysis. We also assessed the effect of landscape heterogeneity, quantified as edge density, on the spreading speed of CWD because it jointly alters the host density and home range size. Our model binds the theoretical study of CWD spreading speed together with empirical studies on deer home ranges and sets a base for models in 2D space to evaluate management and control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Even though most axonal cargos are synthesized in the soma, the concentration of many of these cargos is larger at the presynaptic terminal than in the soma. This requires transport of these cargos from the soma to the presynaptic terminal or other active sites in the axon. Axons utilize both bidirectional (for example, slow axonal transport) and unidirectional (for example, fast anterograde axonal transport) modes of cargo transport. Bidirectional transport seems to be less efficient because it requires more time and takes more energy to deliver cargos. In this paper, we studied a family of models which differ by the modes of axonal cargo transport (such as anterograde and retrograde motor-driven transport and passive diffusion) as well as by the presence or absence of pausing states. The models are studied to investigate their ability to describe axonal transport against the cargo concentration gradient. We argue that bidirectional axonal transport is described by a higher-order mathematical model, which allows imposing cargo concentration not only at the axon hillock but also at the axon terminal. The unidirectional transport model allows only for the imposition of cargo concentration at the axon hillock. Due to the great lengths of the axons, anterograde transport mostly relies on molecular motors, such as kinesins, to deliver cargos synthesized in the soma to the terminal and other active sites in the axon. Retrograde transport can be also motor-driven, in which case cargos are transported by dynein motors. If cargo concentration at the axon tip is higher than at the axon hillock, retrograde transport can also occur by cargo diffusion. However, because many axonal cargos are large or they assemble in multiprotein complexes for axonal transport, the diffusivity of such cargos is very small. We investigated the case of a small cargo diffusivity using a perturbation technique and found that for this case the effect of diffusion is limited to a very thin diffusion boundary layer near the axon tip. If cargo diffusivity is decreased in the model, we show that without motor-driven retrograde transport the model is unable to describe a high cargo concentration at the axon tip. To the best of our knowledge, our paper presents the first explanation for the utilization of seemingly inefficient bidirectional transport in neurons.},

  abstract     = {The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which cells lose their adhesive nature and gain the migratory properties associated with mesenchymal cells. This transition allows cells to migrate away from a primary tumor while maintaining their newly acquired invasive behavior, suggesting that there is a bistable switch between the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. In recent experimental work, we found evidence of this bistability in the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line ( Gasior et al., 2019 ). Underlying the complex processes governing EMT, we identify a feedback loop between E-cadherin, a protein involved in cellular adhesion, and Slug, a transcription factor that is upregulated during EMT. Here, we present a simple mathematical model that examines the relationship between E-cadherin and Slug in response to pro-epithelial and pro-mesenchymal factors, cell–cell contact and TGF- β β , respectively. We hypothesize that cell–cell contact is a critical component in the transition from the epithelial to the mesenchymal phenotype and that it is possible to initiate EMT with the loss of cell–cell contact or the activation of the TGF- β β signaling pathway. We propose a reversible bistable switch in response to a loss of cell–cell contact but an irreversible bistable switch when the cell is exposed to TGF- β β . Taken together, this model shows that acquiring and retaining invasive behavior by cells with high levels of cell–cell contact is not impossible but, instead, depends on the cooperation between the two switches. The predictions of this model for E-cadherin and Slug levels were compared against relative gene expression data from our recent experiments with MCF7 cells ( Gasior et al., 2019 ). Our model works well to predict E-cadherin and Slug mRNA expression in low confluence experiments, while also highlighting issues that arise when comparing experimental results to theoretical predictions.},

Selecting which parameter-sensitivity method to use for a particular model, however, is not a straightforward task. In this work, we present a multi-method framework that incorporates three global sensitivity analysis methods: two variance-based methods and one derivative-based method. The two variance-based methods are Sobol’s method and MeFAST . The derivative-based method is known as DGSM (Derivative-based Global Sensitivity Measures). MeFAST (Multi test eFAST) is a new parameter sensitivity analysis implementation we built upon the eFAST (Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) algorithm. The improvements incorporated into MeFAST address some important aspects of prior eFAST implementations. We present an intuitive description of each implemented algorithm along with MATLAB codes and a guide to tuning algorithm hyper-parameters for better efficiency. We demonstrate the full methodology and workflow using two example mathematical models of different complexity: the first is a model of HIV disease progression and the second is a model of tumor growth. The computational framework we provide generates graphics for visualizing and comparing the results of all three sensitivity analysis algorithms (DGSM, Sobol, and MeFAST). This algorithm output comparison tool allows one to make a more informed decision when assessing which parameters most importantly influence model outcomes.},

While mathematical models of COVID-19 are ubiquitous, few have leveraged network theory in a general way to explain the mechanics of social distancing. In this paper, we build on existing network models for heterogeneous, clustered networks with random link activation/deletion dynamics to put forth realistic mechanisms of social distancing using piecewise constant activation/deletion rates. We find our models are capable of rich qualitative behavior, and offer meaningful insight with relatively few intervention parameters. In particular, we find that the severity of social distancing interventions and when they begin have more impact than how long it takes for the interventions to take full effect.},

After invading target cells, the core structure gradually collapses. The timing of the disassembly of the HIV-1 capsid is essential for efficient viral cDNA synthesis and transport into the nucleus. HIV-1 uncoating is controlled by the host factor maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK); however, the quantitative and dynamic relationship between the HIV-1 uncoating process and HIV-1 infection remains unresolved. In this study, we quantified the uncoating process on HIV-1 cDNA synthesis and transport into the nucleus by combining a mathematical model with in vitro data. In addition, detailed in silico simulations demonstrated host factors, including MELK, optimize transport efficiency. Our experimental-mathematical approach revealed quantitative dynamics of the HIV-1 uncoating process, indicating that increasing the speed of uncoating always reduces the amount of HIV-1 cDNA in the nucleus.},

  abstract     = {The end-of-outbreak declaration is an important part of epidemic control, marking the relaxation or cancellation of prevention and control measures. We propose a probability model to retrospectively quantify the confidence of giving the end-of-outbreak declaration during the COVID-19 epidemic in early 2020 in Wuhan. By using the linear spline, we firstly estimates the time-varying proportion of cases who miss the nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) among all reported cases. Assuming the reproduction numbers being 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0, the respective probability of the end of the COVID-19 outbreak with time after the last reported case can be iteratively computed. Consequently, the varying reproduction numbers produce slightly different increasing patterns of NPI effectiveness, and the end-of-outbreak declarations with 95\% confidence are projected consistently earlier than the day when the lockdown was actually lifted. The reason for the timing discrepancy is discussed as well.},

We use computational and mathematical methods to analyze a well-established model of human circadian rhythms to address cases where individuals do not entrain to the 24-h light-dark cycle, leading to misalignment of their circadian phase. For each case, we provide a mathematically justified strategy for how to minimize circadian misalignment. In the case of non-24-h sleep-wake disorder, we show why appropriately timed bright light therapy induces entrainment. With regard to shift work, we explain why reentrainment times following transitions between day and night shifts are asymmetric, and how higher light intensity enables unusually rapid reentrainment after certain transitions. Finally, with regard to teenagers who engage in compensatory catch-up sleep on weekends, we propose a rule of thumb for sleep and wake onset times that minimizes circadian misalignment due to this type of social jet lag. In all cases, the primary mathematical approach involves understanding the dynamics of entrainment maps that measure the phase of the entrained rhythm with respect to the daily onset of lights.},

  abstract     = {Tumors consist of heterogeneous cell subpopulations that may develop differing phenotypes, such as increased cell growth, metastatic potential and treatment sensitivity or resistance. To study the dynamics of cancer development at a single-cell level, we model the tumor microenvironment as a metapopulation, in which habitat patches correspond to possible sites for cell subpopulations. Cancer cells may emigrate into dispersal pool (e.g. circulation system) and spread to new sites (i.e. metastatic disease). In the patches, cells divide and new variants may arise, possibly leading into an invasion provided the aberration promotes the cell growth. To study such adaptive landscape of cancer ecosystem, we consider various evolutionary strategies (phenotypes), such as emigration and angiogenesis, which are important determinants during early stages of tumor development. We use the metapopulation fitness of new variants to investigate how these strategies evolve through natural selection and disease progression. We further study various treatment effects and investigate how different therapy regimens affect the evolution of the cell populations. These aspects are relevant, for example, when examining the dynamic process of a benign tumor becoming cancerous, and what is the best treatment strategy during the early stages of cancer development. It is shown that positive angiogenesis promotes cancer cell growth in the absence of anti-angiogenic treatment, and that the anti-angiogenic treatment reduces the need of cytotoxic treatment when used in a combination. Interestingly, the model predicts that treatment resistance might become a favorable quality to cancer cells when the anti-angiogenic treatment is intensive enough. Thus, the optimal treatment dosage should remain below a patient-specific level to avoid treatment resistance.},

In the United States alone, ILI impacts 9–49 million people every year. While tracking ILI as a single clinical syndrome is informative in many respects, the underlying viruses differ in parameters and outbreak properties. Most existing models treat either a single respiratory virus or ILI as a whole. However, there is a need for models capable of comparing several individual viruses that cause respiratory illness, including ILI. To address this need, here we present a flexible model and simulations of epidemics for influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, adenovirus, and SARS/MERS, parameterized by a systematic literature review and accompanied by a global sensitivity analysis. We find that for these biological causes of ILI, their parameter values, timing, prevalence, and proportional contributions differ substantially. These results demonstrate that distinguishing the viruses that cause ILI will be an important aspect of future work on diagnostics, mitigation, modeling, and preparation for future pandemics.},

  abstract     = {Soil fertility in mixed farming systems relies on the manure produced by livestock and its recycling in the entire system. In the particular case of crop-livestock system with grazing area, the proper functioning of the system also depends on the presence of nitrogen-fixing plants in the area where livestock grazes (the grazing land). In this paper, we study the impact of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and livestock management on the flux of manure exported outside the grazing land. We address this issue using a modeling approach. We consider a plant-soil model composed of a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that represents the grazing land. We assume that the manure produced by the grazing livestock can be partially exported as a fertilizer outside of this area. Through the mathematical analysis of the model, and analytical and numerical optimization, we then determine the optimal livestock management in terms of grazing rate and manure recycling percentage that lead to the maximal flux of exported manure. We focus more precisely on the role of nitrogen-fixing plants and their impact on the optimal livestock management. When grazing rate is high and the capacity of plants to fix nitrogen is important, we showed that it is necessary to recycle some of the manure produced by the livestock in the grazing land to maximize the flux of exported manure. On the contrary, if we can optimize both the grazing rate and the manure recycling percentage, then it is better to transfer all the produced manure and to adapt the grazing rate accordingly to minimize nitrogen losses from the soil. Finally, to maximize the flux of exported manure, it is also necessary to bring the system to a state in which the plants fix nitrogen. In this way, we can benefit from the nitrogen fixation which provides an additional input of nitrogen in the system.},

In this study we use a mathematical model to investigate the impact of three different SARS-CoV-2 variants on the spread of COVID-19 across France, between January-May 2021 (before vaccination was extended to the full population). To this end, we use the data from Geodes (produced by Public Health France) and a particle swarm optimisation algorithm, to estimate the model parameters and further calculate a value for the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 . Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is then used to better understand the impact of estimated parameter values on the number of infections leading to both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The results confirmed that, as expected, the alpha, beta and gamma variants are more transmissible than the original viral strain. In addition, the sensitivity results showed that the beta/gamma variants could have lead to a larger number of infections in France (of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people).},

  abstract     = {New experimental data have shown how the periodic exposure of cells to low oxygen levels ( i.e. , cyclic hypoxia) impacts their progress through the cell-cycle. Cyclic hypoxia has been detected in tumours and linked to poor prognosis and treatment failure. While fluctuating oxygen environments can be reproduced in vitro , the range of oxygen cycles that can be tested is limited. By contrast, mathematical models can be used to predict the response to a wide range of cyclic dynamics. Accordingly, in this paper we develop a mechanistic model of the cell-cycle that can be combined with in vitro experiments to better understand the link between cyclic hypoxia and cell-cycle dysregulation. A distinguishing feature of our model is the inclusion of impaired DNA synthesis and cell-cycle arrest due to periodic exposure to severely low oxygen levels. Our model decomposes the cell population into five compartments and a time-dependent delay accounts for the variability in the duration of the S phase which increases in severe hypoxia due to reduced rates of DNA synthesis. We calibrate our model against experimental data and show that it recapitulates the observed cell-cycle dynamics. We use the calibrated model to investigate the response of cells to oxygen cycles not yet tested experimentally. When the re-oxygenation phase is sufficiently long, our model predicts that cyclic hypoxia simply slows cell proliferation since cells spend more time in the S phase. On the contrary, cycles with short periods of re-oxygenation are predicted to lead to inhibition of proliferation, with cells arresting from the cell-cycle in the G2 phase. While model predictions on short time scales (about a day) are fairly accurate ( i.e , confidence intervals are small), the predictions become more uncertain over longer periods. Hence, we use our model to inform experimental design that can lead to improved model parameter estimates and validate model predictions.},

First, the correlation analysis reveals that the incidence rate of scarlet fever is significantly positively correlated with air pressure ( r = 0.61), conversely negatively correlated with precipitation ( r = −0.15). Furthermore, the basic reproduction number R 0 is derived, and this paper proves that the unique disease-free periodic solution P 0 is globally symptotically stable when R 0 1. Moreover, by studying the qualitative of correlation between the effective reproduction number and air pollutants or meteorological factors, the seasonal variation pattern of incidence is summarized. Our investigations suggest that the relevant epidemic prevention departments should pay close attention to changes in environmental factors of the five provinces of Northwest China to formulate timely prevention strategies before the arrival of the high-risk period.},

However, mumps has been resurging since May 2015. A number of studies have put forward that the resurgence of mumps is due to vaccine failure. In this paper, we investigated the other reasons for the resurging of mumps, such as the changes in seasonal transmission patterns and demographic structures, by using an age-structured mathematical model. We divided the history (January 2005 to May 2019) of mumps epidemics of Jiangsu province into three different stages: No vaccine stage (January 2005 to December 2008), effectively controlled stage (January 2009 to December 2014) and resurgence stage (January 2015 to May 2019). The features of mumps epidemics in three stages are compared under different demographic structures with same physical contact rate. The mumps transmission rate was increased in summer and dropped in November in stage III compared with that in stage I. The changes in demographic structures give a good explanation why the mumps outbreaked among children around 10 years old in stage I and around 5 years old in stage III. We have a conclusion that the vaccine failure, changes in seasonality and demographic structures were associated with the mumps outbreaks in recent years in Jiangsu province, China. We give the patterns of mumps dynamics considering age, vaccine, seasonality and demographic structures, which can help health program planners to implement more preventive interventions in mumps control during the period of higher risk of infection.},

As remarked by many authors, in the absence of valves oscillations hinder the flow because of the lumen reduction. The underlying biological mechanism is the so-called vasomotion, observed long ago in small blood vessels. Here, we study the vasomotion in arterioles and provide its theoretical justification by analyzing the effect when the network of vessels downstream of the arterioles is considered. We thus explain both quantitatively and qualitatively, why the oscillations of the arteriole walls, a phenomenon that undoubtedly reduces blood flow at the level of the single arteriole, play a fundamental role in microcirculation. In “large” arterioles we analyze also the coupling between the vasomotion and the Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect (the tendency of the erythrocytes to accumulate towards the center). In particular, we prove that the presence of a cell depleted layer close to the vessel walls mitigates the disadvantage caused by the lumen reduction.},

MI is associated with 30\% mortality; approximately half of the deaths occur prior to arrival at the hospital. Reperfusion therapy in the hospital is a medical treatment to restore blood flow through the blocked artery; treatment includes drugs and surgery. However, the damage to the heart muscles through the infarct area is permanent and there is additional damage around the infarct area due to inflammation or insufficient oxygen supply. Approximately half of the patients who survive MI are hospitalized again within one year after reperfusion treatment. In this paper we develop a mathematical model of MI and use it to assess the efficacy of drugs used, post reperfusion, to reduce the damage caused by inflammation in a region of the left ventricular wall surrounding the infarct area. The mathematical model, represented by a system of partial differential equations. The model variables include myocytes, endothelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts and cytokines that play a role in the interactions among these cells. The drugs used to in the model include IL-1, TNF- α α and TGF- β β inhibitors, and the delivery of VEGF. The model is based on mice data. In particular, we find that immunomodulatory treatment with TNF- α α and IL-1 inhibitors can significantly increase the low density of myocytes bordering the infarct area by 50–60\% and decrease the abnormally high density of ECM in a region surrounding the infarct area.},

  abstract     = {New emerging nano-scale technologies like hydrogenated noncrystalline-silicon thin-film transistors (TFTs) and memristors, fabricated at low temperatures and over large areas, permit low-cost processing and 3D integration with CMOS cores. Here, we aim to propose a mathematical model which explains the memory-TFT threshold voltage shift due to the gate bias instability. Then, based on this mathematical approach, we propose a novel learning synapse composed of a voltage/flux driven memristor in parallel with a common-source memory-TFT with a memristive load. The proposed device realizes the triplet-based spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule (TSTDP) as a more realistic form of learning than the purely pair-based STDP (PSTDP). PSTDP is a synaptic learning rule which utilizes a constant-frequency pairing protocol to induce synaptic weight change and cannot explain the modification due to the frequency changes of spike pairs, and also the outcomes of triplet and quadruplet experiments. However, TSTDP improves the learning capabilities of the conventional PSTDP and reproduces the results of more electrophysiological experiments. In this paper, we apply various spike patterns like different-frequency and different-timing spike pairs, spike triplets, and quadruplets to the proposed device. Our simulations confirm a close match with the experimental data sets of real biological synapses.},

  abstract     = {Two fundamental questions related to menopause that have not been answered are: (1) why does menopause even occur? And, (2) of the more than six thousand known mammals extant today, why human and four whale females are the only ones that are menopausal? Answers to both of these basic questions are provided here on the basis of evolutionary biology. From observational data, it was found that there are three elemental criteria that all menopausal species must fulfill: first, it has to be long-lived (average female lifespan of the species has to be forty years or more); second, it must live in groups; and third, the average female-male lifespan differential has to be at least thirty percent or more. In addition, a corollary criterion for menopause was also established: for a species’ females to be menopausal, the Encephalization Quotient (EQ) for the species has to be 2.5 or more. Though humans do not fulfill the third menopausal criterion currently, it has been shown that when the menopausal mechanism first became common in human ancestors, in all likelihood, that principle was conformed to. Of the multitude of mammals around, only a few species satisfy all three menopausal criteria, and hence are the only ones whose females undergo the menopausal process. Many hitherto unanswered questions with respect to menopause, such as, while long and short-finned pilot whales are close to each other both genetically and physiologically, why short-finned females are menopausal while long-finned females are not, why orca females are menopausal while elephant females are not, in spite of both being long-lived, etc., can be answered on the basis of those three criteria. Why there was no selection pressure for males to undergo advanced-age reproductive cessation in those few menopausal species and why the majority of divorces occur in mid-life (40-to-60s) are also explained from a menopausal perspective.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is one of the most common dementia, and its pathogenesis has not been clarified. The failure of amyloid targeted therapy has led us to rethink the pathogenesis of AD. There is growing evidence that complex diseases usually involve the impairment of multiple biological functions, rather than focus on several single genes. Protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) has been recognized as an important tool for identifying and predicting disease biomarkers. It is a great challenge to design network-based classification method for identifying effective, stable and interpretable biomarkers to distinguish the disease phenotype based on gene expression profile data. In this study, we used graph Laplacian regularization method to introduce topology information of PPIN, which can reveal the damaged networks involved in disease from heterogeneous gene expression profile data and identify disease-related biomarkers. The results in three AD datasets showed that the biomarkers identified by our method can not only distinguish the sample categories more accurately, but also help researchers understand the biological meaning behind complex diseases.},

  abstract     = {Spatial variation in survival has individual fitness consequences and influences population dynamics. Which space animals use during the annual cycle determines how they are affected by this spatial variability. Therefore, knowing spatial patterns of survival and space use is crucial to understand demography of migrating animals. Extracting information on survival and space use from observation data, in particular dead recovery data, requires explicitly identifying the observation process. We build a fully stochastic model for animals marked in populations of origin, which were found dead in spatially discrete destination areas. The model acts on the population level and includes parameters for use of space, survival and recovery probability. It is based on the division coefficient and the multinomial reencounter model. We use a likelihood-based approach, derive Restricted Maximum Likelihood-like estimates for all parameters and prove their existence and uniqueness. In a simulation study we demonstrate the performance of the model by using Bayesian estimators derived by the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We obtain unbiased estimates for survival and recovery probability if the sample size is large enough. Moreover, we apply the model to real-world data of European robins Erithacus rubecula ringed at a stopover site. We obtain annual survival estimates for different spatially discrete non-breeding areas. Additionally, we can reproduce already known patterns of use of space for this species.},

  abstract     = {Weber’s law states that the ratio of the smallest perceptual change in an input signal and the background signal is constant. The law is observed across the perception of weight, light intensity, and sound intensity and pitch. To explain Weber’s law observed in steady-state responses, two models of perception have been proposed, namely the logarithmic and the linear model. This paper argues in favour of the linear model, which requires the sensory system to generate linear input–output relationship over several orders of magnitude. To this end, a four-node motif (FNM) is constructed from first principles whose series provides almost linear relationship between input signal and the output over arbitrary range of input signal. Mathematical analysis into the origin of this quasi-linear relationship shows that the series of coherent type-1 feed-forward loop (C1-FFL) is able to provide perfectly linear input–output relationship over arbitrary range of input signal. FNM also reproduces the neuronal data of numerosity detection study on the monkey. The series of FNM also provides a mechanism for sensitive detection over arbitrary range of input signal when the output has an upper limit. Further, the series of FNM provides a general basis for a class of bow-tie architecture where the number of receptors is much lower than the range of input signal and the “decoded output”. Besides (quasi-)linear input–output relationship, another example of this class of bow-tie architecture that the series of FNM is able to produce is absorption spectra of cone opsins of humans. Further, the series of FNM and C1-FFL, both, can compute logarithm over arbitrary range of input signal.},

  abstract     = {Spatial self-organization, a common feature of multi-species communities, can provide important insights into ecosystem structure and resilience. As environmental conditions gradually worsen (e.g., resource depletion, erosion intensified by storms, drought), some ecological systems collapse to an irreversible state once a tipping point is reached. Spatial patterning may be one way for them to cope with such changes. We use a mathematical model to describe self-organization of an eroding marsh shoreline based on three-way interactions between sediment volume and two ecosystem engineers – smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora and ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa . Our model indicates that scale-dependent interactions between multiple ecosystem engineers drive the self-organization of eroding marsh edges and regulate the spatial scale of shoreline morphology. Spatial self-organization of the marsh edge increases the system’s productivity, allows it to withstand erosion, and delays degradation that otherwise would occur in the absence of strong species interactions. Further, changes in wavelength and variance of the spatial patterns give insight into marsh recession. Finally, we find that the presence of mussels in the system modulates the spatial scale of the patterns, generates patterns with shorter wavelengths, and allows the system to tolerate a greater level of erosion. Although previous studies suggest that self-organization can emerge from local interactions and can result in increased ecosystem persistence and stability in various ecosystems, our findings extend these concepts to coastal salt marshes, emphasizing the importance of the ecosystem engineers, smooth cordgrass and ribbed mussels, and demonstrating the potential value of self-organization for ecosystem management and restoration.},

While the role of leadership in group foraging or swarm movement is well understood, it is not clear if leaders would also benefit more complex forms of coordination. In particular, a number of organisms coordinate by consensus decision-making, where individuals explicitly communicate their opinions until they converge toward a common decision. Taking inspiration from physical sciences, we extend a consensus formation model to integrate leaders, which we define by three traits: persuasiveness, talkativeness, and stubbornness. We use numerical simulations to investigate the effect of the number of leaders and their characteristics on the time a group spends to reach consensus, and the bias in the final decision. We show that having a minority of influential individuals (leaders) and a majority of influenceable individuals (followers) reduces the time to reach consensus, but biases the decision towards the preferences of the leaders. This effect emerges solely from the differences in individuals’ personality traits, with the most determinant trait being the talkativeness of the individuals. Overall, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the effects of leaders and their traits on consensus decision-making.},

  abstract     = {In Southern Italy, since 2013, there has been an ongoing Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) outbreak, due to the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa , which has caused a dramatic impact from both socio-economic and environmental points of view. The main players involved in OQDS are represented by the insect vector, Philaenus spumarius , its host plants (olive trees and weeds) and the bacterium, X. fastidiosa . Current agronomic practices are mainly based on uprooting the sick olive trees and their surrounding ones, with later installment of olive cultivars more resistant to the bacterium infection. Unfortunately, both of these practices are having an undesirable impact on the environment (most of these olive trees were monumental ones) and on the economy. Based on a mathematical model expressed in terms of a nontrivial system of ordinary differential equations, our analysis has provided a clear picture of all possible steady states (feasible equilibria) and their stability properties, corresponding to a variety of different parameter scenarios; all of this has been illustrated by a set of computational experiments. A significant original contribution of this paper is the proof of the global asymptotic stability of each of the feasible equilibria under its existence assumptions, a fact that excludes multiple equilibria under the given conditions. It has emerged that the removal of a suitable amount of weed biomass (host plants of the juvenile stages of the insect vector of X. fastidiosa ) from olive orchards and surrounding areas leads to the eradication of the epidemic, without requiring neither the removal nor the substitution of the existing olive trees.},

Following its success in controlling arboviruses spread by Aedes aegypti , this technology is being adapted for anopheline malaria vectors. However, antagonistic interactions between Wolbachia and naturally resident Asaia bacteria in malaria vectors have been demonstrated experimentally, potentially jeopardising Wolbachia biocontrol. We developed the first mathematical model accounting for interspecific competition between endosymbionts to assess the feasibility of this novel strategy for controlling malaria. First, Asaia prevalences among natural mosquito populations were compared with simulations parametrized with rates of Asaia transmission reported from laboratory studies. Discrepancies between projections and natural Asaia prevalences indicated potential overestimation of Asaia transmissibility in artificial laboratory settings. With parametrization that matches natural Asaia prevalence, simulations identified redundancies in Asaia’s many infection routes (vertical, sexual and environmental). This resilience was only overcome when Wolbachia conferred very high resistance to environmental infection with Asaia, resulting in Wolbachia fixation and Asaia exclusion. Wolbachia’s simulated spread was prevented when its maternal transmission was impeded in coinfected mosquitoes and the pre-control Asaia prevalence was beyond a threshold of 60–75\%. This theoretical assessment highlights critical next steps in laboratory experiments to inform this strategy’s feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Contact tracing, case isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been a cornerstone in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, their effects on disease dynamics are not fully understood. Saturation of contact tracing caused by the increase of infected individuals has been recognized as a crucial variable by healthcare systems worldwide. Here, we model this saturation process with a mechanistic and a phenomenological model and show that it induces an Allee effect which could determine an infection threshold between two alternative states—containment and outbreak. This transition was considered elsewhere as a response to the strength of NPIs, but here we show that they may be also determined by the number of infected individuals. As a consequence, timing of NPIs implementation and relaxation after containment is critical to their effectiveness. Containment strategies such as vaccination or mobility restriction may interact with contact tracing-induced Allee effect. Each strategy in isolation tends to show diminishing returns, with a less than proportional effect of the intervention on disease containment. However, when combined, their suppressing potential is enhanced. Relaxation of NPIs after disease containment--e.g. because vaccination--have to be performed in attention to avoid crossing the infection threshold required to a novel outbreak. The recognition of a contact tracing-induced Allee effect, its interaction with other NPIs and vaccination, and the existence of tipping points contributes to the understanding of several features of disease dynamics and its response to containment interventions. This knowledge may be of relevance for explaining the dynamics of diseases in different regions and, more importantly, as input for guiding the use of NPIs, vaccination campaigns, and its combination for the management of epidemic outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {Most animals move intermittently, pausing or slowing down for short moments and short moves, and darting away towards a new location where to hover again. This pattern occurs at a range of spatial and temporal scales (thence, resembling ‘scale-free’), from the quick inspection of local areas to the sum of all movements performed from birth to death. While this pattern has been extensively described, its proximate drivers remain open to debate. A current hypothesis states that underlying proximate generative mechanisms of intermittent movement of animals are linked to external stimuli, e.g. , interactions with the abiotic environment, resources, and other individuals. Here we investigated a prediction from this hypothesis, using termites as a biological model. We verified whether the social background in which a termite is inserted will modify the parameters of its intermittent scale-free spatial displacement. This relates to the hypothesis because it inspects how do external stimuli coming from intraspecifics can affect this type of movement. We tracked the trajectories of a focal termite confined along its nestmates in experimental clueless arenas, every 0.5 s along about six hours. Arenas varied in group size and comprised 22 distinct caste compositions, yielding 75 trackings ( &gt; &amp;gt; 400 h) and more than two million Cartesian coordinates. Most of these trajectories (96\% or 72/75) were classified as intermittent scale free (Lévy-like), indicating prevalence of this type of movement over non-Lévy-like ones ( P = 1.62 × 10 - 15 P=1.62×10-15 ). Moreover, intermittent scale-free movements performed by the focal termite (i) did arise outside the foraging-searching framework, and (ii) were modified by the social context while remaining within the limits of Lévy-walk realms. That is, some limits seem to exist along with the necessary plasticity to provide room for natural selection. Moreover, by arising outside the foraging framework, Lévy-like movements are shown to have broader relevance. Studies on processes that depend on social context and movement ( e.g. , collective behaviour, the spread of diseases) may, hence, profit from such concepts.},

  abstract     = {As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, genetic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 emerge, and some of them are found more contagious than the previously identified strains, acting as the major mechanism for many large-scale epidemics. The transmission advantage of mutated variants is widely believed as an innate biological feature that is difficult to be altered by artificial factors. In this study, we explore how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) may affect transmission advantage. A two-strain compartmental epidemic model is proposed and simulated to investigate the biological mechanism of the relationships among different NPIs, the changes in transmissibility of each strain and transmission advantage. Although the NPIs are effective in flattening the epidemic curve, we demonstrate that NPIs probably lead to a decline in transmission advantage, which is likely to occur if the NPIs become intensive. Our findings uncover the mechanistic relationship between NPIs and transmission advantage dynamically, and highlight the important role of NPIs not only in controlling the intensity of epidemics but also in slowing or even containing the growth of the proportion of variants.},

  abstract     = {Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows through the perivascular spaces (PVSs) surrounding cerebral arteries. Revealing the mechanisms driving that flow could bring improved understanding of brain waste transport and insights for disorders including Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. In vivo velocity measurements of CSF in surface PVSs in mice have been used to argue that flow is driven primarily by the pulsatile motion of artery walls — perivascular pumping. However, fluid dynamics theory and simulation have predicted that perivascular pumping produces flows differing from in vivo observations starkly, particularly in the phase and relative amplitude of flow oscillation. We show that coupling theoretical and simulated flows to more realistic end boundary conditions, using resistance and compliance values measured in mice instead of using periodic boundaries, results in velocities that match observations more closely in phase and relative amplitude of oscillation, while preserving the existing agreement in mean flow speed. This quantitative agreement among theory, simulation, and in vivo measurement further supports the idea that perivascular pumping is an important CSF driver in physiological conditions.},

  abstract     = {Stochasticity is often associated with negative consequences for population dynamics since a population may die out due to random chance during periods when population size is very low (stochastic fade-out). Here we develop a coupled social-ecological model based on stochastic differential equations that includes natural expansion and harvesting of a forest ecosystem, and dynamics of conservation opinions, social norms and social learning in a human population. Our objective was to identify mechanisms that influence long-term persistence of the forest ecosystem in the presence of noise. We found that most of the model parameters had a significant influence on the time to extinction of the forest ecosystem. Increasing the social learning rate and the net benefits of conservation significantly increased the time to extinction, for instance. Most interestingly, we found a parameter regime where an increase in the amount of system stochasticity caused an increase in the mean time to extinction, instead of causing stochastic fade-out. This effect occurs for a subset of realizations, but the effect is large enough to increase the mean time to extinction across all realizations. Such “stochasticity-induced persistence” occurs when stochastic dynamics in the social system generates benefits in the forest system at crucial points in its temporal dynamics. We conclude that studying relatively simple social-ecological models has the benefit of facilitating characterization of dynamical states and thereby enabling us to formulate new hypothesis about mechanisms that could be operating in empirical social-ecological systems.},

In Chifman and Kubatko (2015), the authors computed the site pattern probabilities for four taxa under a full probability model based on the Jukes-Cantor substitution model when the molecular clock holds.

We aim to identify which characteristics of a network can arise through this process, and which must have been produced in a different way. To model the network evolution, we postulate vertex duplication and edge deletion as evolutionary operations on graphs. Using the novel concept of an ancestrally distinguished subgraph , we show how features of present-day networks require certain features of their ancestors. In particular, ancestrally distinguished subgraphs cannot be introduced by vertex duplication. Additionally, if vertex duplication and edge deletion are the only evolutionary mechanisms, then a graph’s ancestrally distinguished subgraphs must be contained in all of the graph’s ancestors. We analyze two experimentally derived genetic networks and show that our results accurately predict lack of large ancestrally distinguished subgraphs, despite this feature being statistically improbable in associated random networks. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that these networks evolved primarily via vertex duplication. The tools we provide open the door for analyzing ancestral networks using current networks. Our results apply to edge-labeled (e.g. signed) graphs which are either undirected or directed.},

With a population approach and separate states for patients accounting for their risk of relapses, a system of nonlinear equations is formulated, similarly to established epidemiological models. Different parameters describe the effect of drugs and treatment switch in reducing the frequency of relapses. The model allows for a good fit to previously published data for experiments where different drugs are used. It also shows that different treatments maintain a high degree of similarity, with analogous dynamical features: a pre-treatment increment in relapse frequency leading to a distinct peak, a rapid drop after treatment switch and a plateau corresponding to a new base relapse activity, which seems dependant on the treatment chosen. A sensitivity analysis shows that the uncertainty in the initial proportions of different populations and the frequency of relapses can modify the overall dynamics of the response to treatment. Drugs are observed to induce effects that depend on patient sample’s intrinsic characteristics, producing two clearly distinct and independent dynamics of relapse response. This confirms the clinical observation that certain drugs may be overall more successful in lowering the rate of relapses more significantly than others, notwithstanding the fact that patients behave differently across experiments.},

  abstract     = {Many corals form close associations with a diverse assortment of coral-dwelling fishes and other fauna. As coral reefs around the world are increasingly threatened by mass bleaching events, it is important to understand how these biotic interactions influence corals’ susceptibility to bleaching. We used dynamic energy budget modeling to explore how nitrogen excreted by coral-dwelling fish affects the physiological performance of host corals. In our model, fish presence influenced the functioning of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis by altering nitrogen availability, and the magnitude and sign of these effects depended on environmental conditions. Although our model predicted that fish-derived nitrogen can promote coral growth, the relationship between fish presence and coral tolerance of photo-oxidative stress was non-linear. Fish excretions supported denser symbiont populations that provided protection from incident light through self-shading. However, these symbionts also used more of their photosynthetic products for their own growth, rather than sharing with the coral host, putting the coral holobiont at a higher risk of becoming carbon-limited and bleaching. The balance between the benefits of increased symbiont shading and costs of reduced carbon sharing depended on environmental conditions. Thus, while there were some scenarios under which fish presence increased corals’ tolerance of light stress, fish could also exacerbate bleaching and slow or prevent subsequent recovery. We discuss how the contrast between the potentially harmful effects of fish predicted by our model and results of empirical studies may relate to key model assumptions that warrant further investigation. Overall, this study provides a foundation for future work on how coral-associated fauna influence the bioenergetics of their host corals, which in turn has implications for how these corals respond to bleaching-inducing stressors.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive biases like underinference, the hard-easy effect, and recurrently non-monotonic confidence are evolutionarily puzzling when viewed as persistent flaws in how people learn from environmental feedback. To explain these empirically robust cognitive biases from an evolutionary perspective, we propose a model of ancestral human learning based on the cultural-evolutionary-theoretic hypothesis that the primary selection pressure acting on ancestral human cognition pertained not to learning individually from environmental feedback, but to socially learning task-specific knowledge. In our model—which is inspired by classical Bayesian models—an ancestral human learner (the student) attempts to learn task-specific knowledge from a role model, with the option of switching between different tasks and role models. Suppose that the student’s method of learning from their role model is a priori uncertain—in that it can either be successful imitation learning or de facto innovation learning—and the ecological fitness costs of meaningfully retaining environmental feedback are high. Then, the student’s fitness-maximizing strategy does not retain their environmental feedback and—depending on the choice of model parameters—can be characterized by all of the aforementioned cognitive biases. Specifically, in order for the evolutionarily optimal estimate of confidence in this learning environment to be recurrently non-monotonic, it is necessary (as long as the environment’s marginal payoff function satisfies a plausible quantitative condition) that a positive proportion of ancestral humans’ attempted imitation learning was unknowingly implemented as de facto innovation learning. Moreover, an ecologically rational strategy of selective social learning can plausibly cause the evolutionarily optimal estimate of confidence to be recurrently non-monotonic in the empirically documented way: general increase with an intermediate period of decrease.},

  abstract     = {Cells often encounter various external and internal signals in a non-sustained pulsatile manner with varying amplitude, duration and residual value. However, the effect of signal pulse on the regulatory networks is poorly understood. In order gain a quantitative understating of pulse processing by bistable switches, we investigated pulse induced population inversion kinetics in bistable switches generated either by mutual activation or by mutual inhibition motifs. We show that a transient intense pulse or a prolonged weak pulse both can induce population inversion, however by distinct mechanisms. An intense pulse facilitates the population inversion by reducing the inversion time, while a weak prolonged pulse allows more late responders to flip their steady state causing increased average transition time. Although the inversion is controlled by the pulse amplitude and duration, however the fate of the inverted state is dictated by the residual signal that determines the mean residence at the flipped state. Therefore, population inversion and its maintenance require a proper tuning of all three signal parameters. Bistable system of mutual activation motif is more prone to make a transient response to the pulse however it is less susceptible to flip its steady state. While the bistability of mutual inhibition motif does not make a transient response yet it is more prone to switch its steady state. By comparing the pulse parameters and statistical properties of associated times scales, we conclude that a bistable switch originating from mutual activation loop is less susceptible to spurious signals as compared to the mutual inhibition loop.},

  abstract     = {Men and women exhibit notable differences not only in the reproductive system and reproductive behaviors, but in many other organ and physiological systems as well. Notable examples include; the stress and immune systems, the anatomy of the brain, and the metabolic and cardiovascular functions. Furthermore, female physiology is affected by the menstrual cycle and by pregnancy and lactation. If we are to successfully develop effective sex-based therapies, we must attain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of sex hormones, the menstrual cycle, and pregnancy on physiological function. By analyzing experimental findings, mathematical modelling can play a major role in facilitating and contributing to advancing the understanding of sex differences in physiology and pathophysiology. In this review, we present a survey of existing sex-specific modelling studies of physiological systems, describe the impact of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, and discuss future modelling opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Individual variation in susceptibility and exposure is subject to selection by natural infection, accelerating the acquisition of immunity, and reducing herd immunity thresholds and epidemic final sizes. This is a manifestation of a wider population phenomenon known as “frailty variation”. Despite theoretical understanding, public health policies continue to be guided by mathematical models that leave out considerable variation and as a result inflate projected disease burdens and overestimate the impact of interventions. Here we focus on trajectories of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in England and Scotland until November 2021. We fit models to series of daily deaths and infer relevant epidemiological parameters, including coefficients of variation and effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions which we find in agreement with independent empirical estimates based on contact surveys. Our estimates are robust to whether the analysed data series encompass one or two pandemic waves and enable projections compatible with subsequent dynamics. We conclude that vaccination programmes may have contributed modestly to the acquisition of herd immunity in populations with high levels of pre-existing naturally acquired immunity, while being crucial to protect vulnerable individuals from severe outcomes as the virus becomes endemic.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the genotype-phenotype relationship. It outlines conditions under which the dependence of a quantitative trait on the genome might be predictable, based on measurement of a limited subset of genotypes. It uses the theory of real-valued Boolean functions in a systematic way to translate trait data into the Fourier domain. Important trait features, such as the roughness of the trait landscape or the modularity of a trait have a simple Fourier interpretation. Ruggedness at a gene location corresponds to high sensitivity to mutation, while a modular organization of gene activity reduces such sensitivity. Traits where rugged loci are rare will naturally compress gene data in the Fourier domain, leading to a sparse representation of trait data, concentrated in identifiable, low-level coefficients. This Fourier representation of a trait organizes epistasis in a form which is isometric to the trait data. As Fourier matrices are known to be maximally incoherent with the standard basis, this permits employing compressive sensing techniques to work from data sets that are relatively small — sometimes even of polynomial size — compared to the exponentially large sets of possible genomes. This theory provides a theoretical underpinning for systematic use of Boolean function machinery to dissect the dependency of a trait on the genome and environment.},

They are usually simpler, and considering the cost of needed computations, they are more efficient. In this paper, a simple 1-dimensional map-based model of spiking neurons is introduced. Sample entropy is applied to analyze the complexity of the model’s dynamics. The model can generate a wide range of time series with different firing rates and different levels of complexities.

After then showing that the power required by the midrib is essentially independent of the number of secondary and higher order veins, we provide an explicit formula for the minimal total power required with L levels of hierarchy. The critical parameters in this model are the height and width of the leaf and the density ρ ρ of vein terminations. We show how ρ ρ can be estimated from published data on leaf vein density, and that for a very wide range of ρ ρ the value of L minimizing the total power required is either 3 or 4. That is, three or four levels of leaf vein hierarchy suffice to minimize the required hydraulic power.},

Such broad patterning capabilities rely in part on the versatile and tunable dynamics of the Notch-Hes feedback circuit eliciting both pulsatile and switching behaviors. This raises the theoretical issue of which specific spatiotemporal features emerge from lateral inhibition between cells that can display and transit between monostable, oscillatory and bistable regimes. To address this issue, I consider a discrete cell lattice model where intracellular dynamics is described by a phase-like variable and displays a typical cross-shaped phase diagram. Model analysis determines how the existence and stability of many spatially inhomogeneous and temporally synchronized states depends on key intracellular and intercellular parameters. It reveals a parameter-dependent multistability between those diverse spatiotemporal patterns, giving rise to tunable and robust developmental transition scenarios ensuring defect-free spatial patterns. Such broad repertoire and multistability of spatiotemporal patterns is corroborated with regulatory network modeling of the Delta-Notch-Hes pathway.},

  abstract     = {Trade is a complex, multi-faceted process that can contribute to the spread and persistence of disease. We here develop novel mechanistic models of supply. Our model is framed within a livestock trading system, where farms form and end trade partnerships with rates dependent on current demand, with these trade partnerships facilitating trade between partners. With these time-varying, stock dependent partnership and trade dynamics, our trading model goes beyond current state of the art modelling approaches. By studying instantaneous shocks to farm-level supply and demand we show that behavioural responses of farms lead to trading systems that are highly resistant to shocks with only temporary disturbances to trade observed. Individual adaptation in response to permanent alterations to trading propensities, such that animal flows are maintained, illustrates the ability for farms to find new avenues of trade, minimising disruptions imposed by such alterations to trade that common modelling approaches cannot adequately capture. In the context of endemic disease control, we show that these adaptations hinder the potential beneficial reductions in prevalence such changes to trading propensities have previously been shown to confer. Assessing the impact of a common disease control measure, post-movement batch testing, highlights the ability for our model to measure the stress on multiple components of trade imposed by such control measures and also highlights the temporary and, in some cases, the permanent disturbances to trade that post-movement testing has on the trading system.},

  abstract     = {The microcirculation is the site of direct oxygen (O 2 ) transfer from blood to tissue, and also of O 2 delivery control via regulation of local blood flow. In addition, a number of diseases including type II diabetes mellitus (DMII) and sepsis are known to produce microcirculatory dysfunction in their early phases. Given the complexity of microvascular structure and physiology, and the difficulty of measuring tissue oxygenation at the micro-scale, mathematical modelling has been necessary for understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of O 2 transport in the microcirculation and for interpreting in vivo experiments. To advance this area, a model of blood-tissue O 2 transport in skeletal muscle was recently developed which uses continuously distributed capillaries and includes O 2 diffusion, convection, and consumption. The present work extends this model to two adjacent layers of skeletal muscle with different blood flow rates and applies it to study steady-state O 2 transport when flow regulation is stimulated using an O 2 exchange chamber. To generate a model which may be validated through in vivo experiments, an overlying O 2 permeable membrane is included. The model is solved using traditional methods including separation of variables and Fourier decomposition, and to ensure smooth profiles at the muscle-muscle and muscle-membrane interfaces, matching conditions are developed. The study presents qualitative verification for the model, using visualizations of tissue O 2 pressure (PO 2 ) distributions for varying capillary density (CD), and presents capillary velocity response values in the near layer for varying chamber PO 2 under the assumption that outlet capillary O 2 saturation (SO 2 ) is equalized between adjacent layers. These compensatory velocity profiles, along with effective ’no-flux’ chamber PO 2 values, are presented for varying CD and tissue O 2 consumption values. Insights gained from the two-layer model provide guidance for interpreting and planning future in vivo experiments, and also provide motivation for further development of the model to improve understanding of the interaction between O 2 transport and blood flow regulation.},

The conclusion is based on the premise that mutant strains necessarily appear in equilibrium host-phage environments. Revisiting the model, we show that the ecological system exhibits richer asymptotic dynamics and that, in a certain parameter regime, evolution may in fact drive lysis propensity towards an evolutionary singularity in which a non-zero proportion of phages initiate infection in a lytic cycle. These singularities act as points of evolutionary diversification, leading to periodic coexistence of two distinct phage strains on the evolutionary time-scale. One of the two strains in the dimorphic evolutionary singularity is fully lysogenic (in the sense that cell infection always leads to lysogeny), while the other is partially lytic.

  abstract     = {Many models of within-host malaria infection dynamics have been formulated since the pioneering work of Anderson et al. in 1989. Biologically, the goal of these models is to understand what governs the severity of infections, the patterns of infectiousness, and the variation thereof across individual hosts. Mathematically, these models are based on dynamical systems, with standard approaches ranging from K -compartments ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to delay differential equations (DDEs), to capture the relatively constant duration of replication and bursting once a parasite infects a host red blood cell. Using malariatherapy data, which offers fine-scale resolution on the dynamics of infection across a number of individual hosts, we compare the fit and robustness of one of these standard approaches ( K -compartments ODE) with a partial differential equations (PDEs) model, which explicitly tracks the “age” of an infected cell. While both models perform quite similarly in terms of goodness-of-fit for suitably chosen K , the K -compartments ODE model particularly overestimates parasite densities early on in infections when the number of repeated compartments is not large enough. Finally, the K -compartments ODE model (for suitably chosen K ) and the PDE model highlight a strong qualitative connection between the density of transmissible parasite stages ( i.e. , gametocytes) and the density of host-damaging (and asexually-replicating) parasite stages. This finding provides a simple tool for predicting which hosts are most infectious to mosquitoes —vectors of Plasmodium parasites— which is a crucial component of global efforts to control and eliminate malaria.},

Here we study the effect of TES on the species richness of diverse communities. In such communities the biodiversity at equilibrium reflects the balance between the rate at which new types are added (via migration, mutation or speciation) and the rate of extinction. We analyze a few generic models in which the speciation rate is fixed and TES affects the rate of extinction, and identify three different mechanisms. First, TES increases abundance variations and shortens extinction times, thus decreasing the species richness (destabilizing effect). Second, TES blurs the time-independent fitness differences between species, making the dynamics more symmetric and thereby increasing the diversity (neutralizing effect). Third, the storage effect allows TES to facilitate the invasion of inferior species, again contributing to the species richness. The stabilizing effect of storage declines significantly in diverse communities and it can overcome the destabilizing effect of TES only when environmental fluctuations are rapid enough.},

Herein, we utilize a systems biology approach by developing a whole-host model of the immune response to Mtb across multiple physiologic and time scales. This model, called HostSim , tracks events at the cellular, granuloma, organ, and host scale and represents the first whole-host, multi-scale model of the immune response following Mtb infection. We show that this model can capture various aspects of human and non-human primate TB disease and predict that biomarkers in the blood may only faithfully represent events in the lung at early time points after infection. We posit that HostSim , as a first step toward personalized digital twins in TB research, offers a powerful computational tool that can be used in concert with experimental approaches to understand and predict events about various aspects of TB disease and therapeutics.},

The cytoplasm is represented as an aqueous solution of hemoglobin and salt (KCl or NaCl). Model-based analysis of literature data on human erythrocytes, and of new experiments with bovine erythrocytes, leads to two findings. First, the Boyle–van’t Hoff plot for human erythrocytes is found to be well described based on a solid volume fraction of ∼0.3 in complete agreement with desiccation experiments. The linear portion of the calculated curve turns out to be numerically indistinguishable from the commonly used ideal model parameterized with an apparent osmotically inactive volume fraction of ∼0.5. This mathematical outcome explains the longstanding perceived (but actually nonexistent) disconnect between the aforementioned fractions ∼0.3 and ∼0.5. A corollarial implication is that the actual volume fraction of osmotically nonparticipant (vicinal) water is very small (∼0.035). Second, an initial crenation of bovine erythrocytes (which occurs in classical techniques for measuring membrane permeability) is found to increase their fragility to an extent which correlates well with the crenated cell volume, and would affect the permeability determination.},

  abstract     = {Competition is a pervasive interaction known to structure ecological communities. The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model has been foundational for our understanding of competition, and trait-based LV models have been used to model community assembly and eco-evolutionary phenomena like diversification. The intrinsic growth rate function is determined by the underlying resource distribution and is a key determinant of the resulting diversity, traits and abundances of species. In these models, the width of the resource distribution relative to the width of the competition kernel has been identified as a key parameter that leads to diversification. However, studies have only investigated the impact of width at just a few discrete values, while also often assuming the intrinsic growth rate function to be unimodal. Thus, the impact of the underlying resource distribution’s width and shape together remains incompletely explored, particularly for large, diverse communities. In this study, we vary its width continuously for two shapes (unimodal and bimodal) to explore its impact on community structure. When the resource distribution is very narrow in both the unimodal bimodal cases, competition is strong, leading to exclusion of all but the best-adapted species. Wider resource distributions allow stable coexistence, where the traits of the species depend on the shape of the resource distribution. Extremely wide resource distributions support a diverse community, where the strength of competition ultimately determines the diversity and traits of coexisting species, but their abundances reflect the underlying resource distribution. Further, competition acts to maximize the use of available resources among the competing species. For large communities, the shape of resource distribution becomes immaterial and the width determines the diversity. These results affirm and extend our understanding of limiting similarity.},

  abstract     = {Organisms consist of several genetic factors differing between species. However, the evolutionary effects of gene interactions on the evolutionary rate, adaptation, and divergence of organisms remain unknown. In a previous study, the 2-dimensional genetic algorithm (2DGA) program, including a gene interaction parameter, could simulate punctuated equilibrium under the disparity mode. Following this, we verified the effect of the number of gene interactions (gene cluster size) on evolution speed, adaptation, and divergence using the advanced 2DGA program. In this program, the population was replicated, mutated, and selected for 200,000 generations, and the fitness score, divergence, number of population, and genotype were output and plotted. The genotype data were used for evaluating the phylogenetic relations among the population. The gene cluster size 1) affected the disparity and parity mutagenesis modes differently, 2) determined the growth/exclusion rate and error threshold, and 3) accelerated or decelerated the population’s speed of evolutionary advancement. In particular, when the gene cluster size expanded, the rate of increase in fitness scores decreased independently of the mutation rate and mode of mutation (disparity mode/parity mode). The mutation rate at the error threshold was also decreased by expanding the gene cluster size. Dendrograms traced the genotypes of the simulated population, indicating that the disparity mode caused the evolutionary process to enter 1) a stun mode, 2) an evolution mode, or 3) a divergence mode based on the mutation rate and gene cluster size, while the parity mode did not cause the population to enter a stun mode. Based on the above findings, we compared the predictions of the present study with evolution observed in the laboratory or the natural world and the processes of ongoing virus evolution, suggesting that our findings possibly explained the real evolution.},

  abstract     = {The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) in ecology predicts that the strength and frequency of positive interspecific interactions, including processing chain commensalisms (PCCs), increase with environmental stress. Although observed in some empirical PCC studies, a recent theoretical study of PCCs using a consumer–resource-type model found that, given the model’s assumptions, the SGH never occurs. To investigate if this is a true reflection of PCCs or merely an artefact of the model, in this study, we modified this earlier model formulation by incorporating generalized, monotonically increasing resource uptake functions in place of linear functions, and added a term to represent the spontaneous leakage of the downstream resource to the environment. Mathematical analyses of the model revealed two key insights: 1) the specific algebraic forms of the functional responses of the species in a PCC do not affect the long-term behaviour of the system; 2) the SGH can occur in a facilitative interaction only if the consumer-independent leakage rate of the downstream resource exceeds the consumer-independent input rate. The first insight shows that the outcomes of consumer–resource interactions are robust to details of the functional responses when the functional responses are monotonically increasing, while the second insight shows that the SGH is not a universal feature of positive interactions but instead holds only under a well-defined set of conditions which may vary between PCC interactions and the environmental contexts in which they take place.},

  abstract     = {A general theory for competitive dynamics among many strains at the epidemiological level is required to understand polymorphisms in virulence, transmissibility, antibiotic resistance and other biological traits of infectious agents. Mathematical coinfection models have addressed specific systems, focusing on the criteria leading to stable coexistence or competitive exclusion, however, due to their complexity and nonlinearity, analytical solutions in coinfection models remain rare. Here we study a 2-strain Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible ( SIS ) compartmental model with co-infection/co-colonization, incorporating five strain fitness dimensions under the same framework: variation in transmissibility, duration of carriage, pairwise susceptibilities to coinfection, coinfection duration, and transmission priority effects from mixed coinfection. Taking advantage of a singular perturbation approach, under the assumption of strain similarity, we expose how strain dynamics on a slow timescale are explicitly governed by a replicator equation which encapsulates all traits and their interplay. This allows to predict explicitly not only the final epidemiological outcome of a given 2-player competition, but moreover, their entire frequency dynamics as a direct function of their relative variation and of strain-transcending global parameters. Based on mutual invasion fitnesses, we analyze and report rigorous results on transition phenomena in the 2-strain system, strongly mediated via endemic coinfection prevalence. We show that coinfection is not always a promoter of coexistence; instead, its effect to favour or prevent polymorphism is non-monotonic and depends on the type and level of phenotypic differentiation between strains. This framework offers a deeper analytical understanding of 2-strain competitive games in coinfection, with theoretical and practical applications in epidemiology, ecology and evolution.},

We assume that the population size can fluctuate stochastically. We solve the Kolmogorov forward equation in the population whose size fluctuates only minimally and show that the fixation probability is decreasing with the increasing turnover rate. We also show that when the mutant’s turnover is small enough, selection favors the mutant replacing residents. Similarly, when the turnover is high enough, selection opposes the replacement. This basic result has previously been demonstrated numerically for the contact process and shown analytically for the Moran process; the current paper extends this analysis to provide an analytical proof for the contact process. We also demonstrate numerically that our results extend for general fluctuating populations and beyond the quasi-neutral case.},

A forager in a group receives a vigilance benefit not only when it is being vigilant itself but also when a group mate is being vigilant. The many eyes hypothesis supposes that individuals exhibit lower vigilance in larger groups because of this. However, changes in safety resulting from the vigilance benefit conferred by group mates can change the decision to join or leave a group so as vigilance changes because of changes in group size, group size may also change in response to changes in vigilance. Additionally, individuals may have poor information about the vigilance strategies of their neighbors. We present a game theoretical model of vigilance that incorporates dynamic group sizes and does not require behavioral monitoring of the vigilance strategies of others. For systems at equilibrium, maximum vigilance decreases with increased group size. Furthermore, by varying intraspecific competition we show an inverse relationship between group size and vigilance. Thus, we provide a mechanism in support of the many eyes hypothesis from an evolutionary game theory perspective and conclude that variation in intraspecific competition and its effect on group size may be responsible for the relationship.},

The number of sub-populations of cancer cells expressing different antigens and the percentage of immunogenic cells ( i.e. tumour cells that are effectively targeted by immune cells) in a tumour are both expressions of ITH. Here, we present a spatially explicit stochastic individual-based model of the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and CD8 + T cells, which makes it possible to dissect out the specific impact of these two expressions of ITH on anti-tumour immune response. The set-up of numerical simulations of the model is defined so as to mimic scenarios considered in previous experimental studies. Moreover, the ability of the model to qualitatively reproduce experimental observations of successful and unsuccessful immune surveillance is demonstrated. First, the results of numerical simulations of this model indicate that the presence of a larger number of sub-populations of tumour cells that express different antigens is associated with a reduced ability of CD8 + T cells to mount an effective anti-tumour immune response. Secondly, the presence of a larger percentage of tumour cells that are not effectively targeted by CD8 + T cells may reduce the effectiveness of anti-tumour immunity. Ultimately, the mathematical model presented in this paper may provide a framework to help biologists and clinicians to better understand the mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of different outcomes of immunotherapy.},

We simulated food webs with varying size and complexity so we could remove omnivores from different trophic levels and track the fates of communities. Results show that food webs were more sensitive to the loss of omnivores from higher trophic levels, aside from the effects of network size and complexity on food web stability. These results underline the importance of omnivory by introducing dynamic switching across multiple energy paths.

  abstract     = {Computational models of biological processes provide one of the most powerful methods for a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that drive the behavior of complex systems. Logic-based modeling has enhanced our understanding and interpretation of those systems. Defining rules that determine how the output activity of biological entities is regulated by their respective inputs has proven to be challenging. Partly this is because of the inherent noise in data that allows multiple model parameterizations to fit the experimental observations, but some of it is also due to the fact that models become increasingly larger, making the use of automated tools to assemble the underlying rules indispensable. We present several Boolean function metrics that provide modelers with the appropriate framework to analyze the impact of a particular model parameterization. We demonstrate the link between a semantic characterization of a Boolean function and its consistency with the model’s underlying regulatory structure. We further define the properties that outline such consistency and show that several of the Boolean functions under study violate them, questioning their biological plausibility and subsequent use. We also illustrate that regulatory functions can have major differences with regard to their asymptotic output behavior, with some of them being biased towards specific Boolean outcomes when others are dependent on the ratio between activating and inhibitory regulators. Application results show that in a specific signaling cancer network, the function bias can be used to guide the choice of logical operators for a model that matches data observations. Moreover, graph analysis indicates that commonly used Boolean functions become more biased with increasing numbers of regulators, supporting the idea that rule specification can effectively determine regulatory outcome despite the complex dynamics of biological networks.},

While the implications of this process for biodiversity have been studied in terrestrial plants, seed banks are usually neglected in phytoplankton multispecies dynamic models, in spite of widespread empirical evidence for such seed banks. In this study, we build a metacommunity model of interacting phytoplankton species, including a resting stage supplying the seed bank. The model is parameterized with empirically-driven growth rate functions and field-based interaction estimates, which include both facilitative and competitive interactions. Exchanges between compartments (coastal pelagic cells, coastal resting cells on the seabed, and open ocean pelagic cells) are controlled by hydrodynamical parameters to which the sensitivity of the model is assessed. We consider two models, i.e., with and without a saturating effect of the interactions on the growth rates. Our results are consistent between models, and show that a seed bank allows to maintain all species in the community over 30 years. Indeed, a fraction of the species are vulnerable to extinction at specific times within the year, but this process is buffered by their survival in their resting stage. We thus highlight the potential role of the seed bank in the recurrent re-invasion of the coastal community, and of coastal environments in re-seeding oceanic regions. Moreover, the seed bank enables populations to tolerate stronger interactions within the community as well as more severe changes to the environment, such as those predicted in a climate change context. Our study therefore shows how resting stages may help phytoplanktonic diversity maintenance.},

  abstract     = {Insufficient testing capacity has been a critical bottleneck in the worldwide fight against COVID-19. Optimizing the deployment of limited testing resources has therefore emerged as a keystone problem in pandemic response planning. Here, we use a modified SEIR model to optimize testing strategies under a constraint of limited testing capacity. We define pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic infected classes, and assume that positively tested individuals are immediately moved into quarantine. We further define two types of testing. Clinical testing focuses only on the symptomatic class. Non-clinical testing detects pre- and asymptomatic individuals from the general population, and a concentration parameter governs the degree to which such testing can be focused on high infection risk individuals. We then solve for the optimal mix of clinical and non-clinical testing as a function of both testing capacity and the concentration parameter. We find that purely clinical testing is optimal at very low testing capacities, supporting early guidance to ration tests for the sickest patients. Additionally, we find that a mix of clinical and non-clinical testing becomes optimal as testing capacity increases. At high but empirically observed testing capacities, a mix of clinical testing and non-clinical testing, even if extremely unfocused, becomes optimal. We further highlight the advantages of early implementation of testing programs, and of combining optimized testing with contact reduction interventions such as lockdowns, social distancing, and masking.},

However, very few studies have addressed the question of how enzyme concentrations change in response to positive selective pressure on the flux, considered a proxy of fitness. In particular, the way cellular constraints, such as resource limitations and co-regulation, affect the adaptive landscape of a pathway under selection has never been analyzed theoretically. To fill this gap, we developed a model of the evolution of enzyme concentrations that combines metabolic control theory and an adaptive dynamics approach, and integrates possible dependencies between enzyme concentrations. We determined the evolutionary equilibria of enzyme concentrations and their range of neutral variation, and showed that they differ with the properties of the enzymes, the constraints applied to the system and the initial enzyme concentrations. Simulations of long-term evolution confirmed all analytical and numerical predictions, even though we relaxed the simplifying assumptions used in the analytical treatment.},

In this paper, we present a mathematical model representing the binding of VEGF to VEGFR and the subsequent ligand-induced dimerisation. A key factor in this work is the qualitative and quantitative effect of binding cooperativity, which describes the effect that the binding of a ligand to a receptor has on the binding of that ligand to a second receptor, and the dimerisation of these receptors. We analyse the ordinary differential equation system at equilibrium, giving analytical solutions for the total amount of ligand bound. For time-course dynamics, we use numerical methods to explore possible behaviours under various parameter regimes, while perturbation analysis is used to understand the intricacies of these behaviours. Our simulation results show an excellent fit to experimental data, towards validating the model.},

  abstract     = {After infecting a host, a viral strain may increase rapidly within the body and produce mutants with a faster proliferation rate than the virus itself. However, most of the mutants become extinct because of the stochasticity caused by the small number of infected cells. In addition, the mean growth rate of a mutant strain decreases with time because the number of susceptible target cells is reduced by the original strain. In this study, we calculated the fraction of mutants that can escape stochastic extinction, based on a continuous-time branching process with a time-dependent growth rate. We analyzed two cases differing in the mode of viral transmission: (1) an infected cell transmits the virus through cell-to-cell contact with a susceptible target cell; (2) an infected cell releases numerous free viral particles that subsequently infect susceptible target cells. The chance for a mutant strain to be established decreases with time after infection of the original type, and it may oscillate before convergence at the stationary value. We then calculated the probability of escaping stochastic extinction for a drug-resistant mutant when a patient received an antiviral drug that suppressed the original strain. Combining the rate of mutant production from the original strain and the chance of escaping stochastic extinction, the number of emerging drug-resistant mutations may have two peaks: one soon after the infection of the original type and the second at the start of antiviral drug administration.},

In this study, we built a dynamical model with multiple prey, with different nutritional values and reproductive rates, which are consumed by specialist and generalist predators. We then analyzed the viability of individual foraging strategies in all possible scenarios. Relative prey fertility and relative efficiency of predation, rather than prey nutritional value, determined the success of specialists and generalists. Less reproducing prey and the specialists relying on them face the highest danger of extinction, while generalists cannot thrive where specialists are sufficiently efficient in relation to the number of available prey.

Mathematical modeling of myocardial regeneration via stem cell therapy is a challenging task, since the mechanisms underlying the processes involved in the treatment are not yet fully understood. Many aspects must be accounted for, such as the spread of stem cells and nutrients, chemoattraction, cell proliferation, stages of cell maturation, differentiation, angiogenesis, stochastic effects, just to name a few. In this paper we propose a 3D mathematical model with a free boundary that aims to provide a qualitative description of some main aspects of the stem cell regenerative therapy in a simplified scenario. The paper mainly focuses on the description of the shrinking of the necrotic core during treatment. The stem cell and nutrients dynamics are described through coupled reaction-diffusion problems.

Still other species skip planktonic larval stages altogether, and adults produce benthic offspring (direct development). In this paper, we develop an evolutionary game among different life-cycle types and examine the conditions for each life-cycle type to win in a seasonal environment. The growth rate and mortality of benthic individuals are the same among all three life-cycle types, the local habitat (patches) for benthic individuals have a finite longevity, and adults may engage in a limited dispersal just before breeding. Planktotrophy evolves if the planktonic stages are more efficient in terms of biomass gain than benthic life. Otherwise, lecithotrophy or direct development should evolve. Among them, direct development is more advantageous than lecithotrophy if the cost of having planktonic larvae is large, the habitat for benthic individuals is stable, and adults engage in some dispersal.},

A complex mathematical model is constructed that integrates detailed biophysical models of neuronal action potentials, mitochondrial ATP production and cerebral capillary blood flow. The model also provides insights of the role of astrocytes in maintaining neuronal responses, as well as the impact of elevated cytosolic calcium, due to increased synaptic activity, on mitochondrial ATP production. Both dynamical systems analysis and numerical simulations are used to determine how the maximum frequency at which the neurons can respond to synaptic input depends on capillary blow flow, as well as the ability of astrocytes to buffer extracellular potassium and cytosolic calcium handling. Results are presented for both the cases of homogenous and heterogeneous capillary networks . These results demonstrate, through this interconnected model, that heterogeneity of the capillary flow results in a decrease in the ability of neurons to respond to synaptic stimulation and that intact glial function provides a further protective role for the neurons.},

In species that experience salinity changes throughout life (euryhaline species), individuals may replace some chloride cells with cells of different types upon a sudden change in environmental salinity. In this paper, we develop a dynamic optimization model for the chloride cell composition of an individual living in an environment with randomly fluctuating salinity. The optimal solution is to minimize the sum of the workload of chloride cells in coping with the difference in osmotic pressure, the maintenance cost, and the temporal cost due to environmental change.

  abstract     = {Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease with a devastating global impact. Plasmodium vivax is a major cause of human malaria beyond sub-Saharan Africa. Relapsing infections, driven by a reservoir of liver-stage parasites known as hypnozoites, present unique challenges for the control of P. vivax malaria. Following indeterminate dormancy periods, hypnozoites may activate to trigger relapses. Clearance of the hypnozoite reservoir through drug treatment (radical cure) has been proposed as a potential tool for the elimination of P. vivax malaria. Here, we introduce a stochastic, within–host model to jointly characterise hypnozoite and infection dynamics for an individual in a general transmission setting, allowing for radical cure. We begin by extending an existing activation-clearance model for a single hypnozoite, adapted to both short- and long-latency strains, to include drug treatment. We then embed this activation-clearance model in an epidemiological framework accounting for repeated mosquito inoculation and the administration of radical cure. By constructing an open network of infinite server queues, we derive analytic expressions for several quantities of epidemiological significance, including the size of the hypnozoite reservoir; the relapse rate; the relative contribution of relapses to the infection burden; the distribution of multiple infections; the cumulative number of recurrences over time, and the time to first recurrence following drug treatment. We derive from first principles the functional dependence between within–host and transmission parameters and patterns of blood- and liver-stage infection, whilst allowing for treatment under a mass drug administration regime. To yield population-level insights, our analytic within–host distributions can be embedded in multiscale models. Our work thus contributes to the epidemiological understanding of the effects of radical cure on P. vivax malaria.},

  abstract     = {Most models of selection incorporate some notion of environmental degradation where the majority of the population becomes less fit concerning a character resulting in pressure to adapt. Such models have been variously associated with an adaptation cost, the substitution load. Conversely, adaptative mutations that represent an improvement in fitness in the absence of environmental change have generally been assumed to be associated with negligible cost. However, such adaptations could represent a competitive advantage that diminishes resource availability for others and so induces a cost. This type of adaptation in the form of seedling competition has been suggested as a mechanism for increases in seed sizes during domestication, a trait associated with the standard stabilizing selection model. We present a novel cost framework for competitive selection that demonstrates significant differences in behaviour to environmental-based selection in intensity, intensity over time and directly contrasts with the expectations of the standard model. Grain metrics of nine archaeological crops fit a mixed model in which episodes of competitive selection often emerge from shifting optimum episodes of stabilizing selection, highlighting the potential prevalence of the mechanism outlined here and providing fundamental insight into the factors driving domestication.},

Despite extensive experimental work on the causes, development and progression of this disease, much still remains unknown about the importance of the different immunological pathways involved. We present a mathematical model of autoimmune myocarditis and the effects of ICIs on its development and progression to either resolution or chronic inflammation. From this, we gain a better understanding of the role of immune cells, cytokines and other components of the immune system in driving the cardiotoxicity of ICIs. We parameterise the model using existing data from the literature, and show that qualitative model behaviour is consistent with disease characteristics seen in patients in an ICI-free context. The bifurcation structures of the model show how the presence of ICIs increases the risk of developing autoimmune myocarditis. This predictive modelling approach is a first step towards determining treatment regimens that balance the benefits of treating cancer with the risk of developing autoimmune myocarditis.},

  abstract     = {Life is confronted with computation problems in a variety of domains including animal behavior, single-cell behavior, and embryonic development. Yet we currently do not know of a naturally existing biological system that is capable of universal computation, i.e., Turing-equivalent in scope. Generic finite-dimensional dynamical systems (which encompass most models of neural networks , intracellular signaling cascades, and gene regulatory networks) fall short of universal computation, but are assumed to be capable of explaining cognition and development. I present a class of models that bridge two concepts from distant fields: combinatory logic (or, equivalently, lambda calculus) and RNA molecular biology . A set of basic RNA editing rules can make it possible to compute any computable function with identical algorithmic complexity to that of Turing machines. The models do not assume extraordinarily complex molecular machinery or any processes that radically differ from what we already know to occur in cells. Distinct independent enzymes can mediate each of the rules and RNA molecules solve the problem of parenthesis matching through their secondary structure. In the most plausible of these models all of the editing rules can be implemented with merely cleavage and ligation operations at fixed positions relative to predefined motifs. This demonstrates that universal computation is well within the reach of molecular biology. It is therefore reasonable to assume that life has evolved – or possibly began with – a universal computer that yet remains to be discovered. The variety of seemingly unrelated computational problems across many scales can potentially be solved using the same RNA-based computation system. Experimental validation of this theory may immensely impact our understanding of memory, cognition, development, disease, evolution, and the early stages of life.},

This case study considers the competition between jackals and vultures in Etosha National Park in Namibia. While jackals are facultative scavengers, able to hunt for food if necessary, vultures are obligate scavengers wholly dependent on carcasses of animals like zebras for persistence. This competition may be further affected by outbreaks of infections such as anthrax, which temporarily increase the number of carcasses but lower the zebra population, acting in some ways as a third competitor. We use a dynamical system to model the interplay between competition dynamics and infection dynamics, and how it is affected by the nature of the competition: indirect (exploitative) or direct (interference). A bifurcation analysis using reproduction numbers shows how vultures’ survival may depend on their direct competitive edge in reaching carcasses faster than jackals, and how the infection and the scavengers complicate each other’s persistence. Vultures’ interference causes a backward bifurcation which enables them to persist. One possible outcome is a “strange bedfellows” bistability in which anthrax and vultures persist only together, not apart, despite being competitors.},

  abstract     = {Vaccination is effective in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It still remains debatable whether males should be included in a vaccination program and unclear how to allocate the vaccine in genders to achieve the maximum benefits. In this paper, we use a two-sex model to assess HPV vaccination strategies and use the data from Guangxi Province in China as a case study. Both mathematical analysis and numerical simulations show that the basic reproduction number, an important indicator of the transmission potential of the infection, achieves its minimum when the priority of vaccination is given to the gender with a smaller recruit rate. Given a fixed amount of vaccine, splitting the vaccine evenly usually leads to a larger basic reproduction number and a higher prevalence of infection. Vaccination becomes less effective in reducing the infection once the vaccine amount exceeds the smaller recruit rate of the two genders. In the case study, we estimate the basic reproduction number is 1.0333 for HPV 16/18 in people aged 15–55. The minimal bivalent HPV vaccine needed for the disease prevalence to be below 0.05\% is 24050 per year, which should be given to females. However, with this vaccination strategy it would require a very long time and a large amount of vaccine to achieve the goal. In contrast with allocating the same vaccine amount every year, we find that a variable vaccination strategy with more vaccine given in the beginning followed by less vaccine in later years can save time and total vaccine amount. The variable vaccination strategy illustrated in this study can help to better distribute the vaccine to reduce the HPV prevalence. Although this work is for HPV infection and the case study is for a province in China, the model, analysis and conclusions may be applicable to other sexually transmitted diseases in other regions or countries.},

A pioneering model of vegetation patterns was proposed by C. A. Klausmeier in 1999 (Klausmeier, 1999) that involves a downhill flow of water. In this paper, we study the diffusive Klausmeier model that can describe the flow of water in flat terrain incorporating a diffusive flow of water. It consists of a two-component reaction–diffusion system for water and plant biomass. The paper presents a numerical bifurcation analysis of stationary solutions of the diffusive Klausmeier model extensively. We numerically investigate the occurrence of diffusion-driven instability and how this depends on the parameters of the model. Finally, the model predicts some field observed vegetation patterns in a semiarid environment, e.g. spot, stripe (labyrinth), and gap patterns in the transitions from bare soil at low precipitation to homogeneous vegetation at high precipitation. Furthermore, we introduce a two-component reaction–diffusion model considering a bilinear interaction of plant and water instead of their cubic interaction. It is inspected that no diffusion-driven instability occurs as if vegetation patterns can be generated. This confirms that the diffusive Klausmeier model is the minimal reaction–diffusion model for the occurrence of vegetation patterns from the viewpoint of a two-component reaction–diffusion system.},

We have studied a simple PGG scenario played out by cooperating (C) and defecting (D) agents, applying the highly nonlinear threshold benefit function in an individual-based lattice model. A semi-analytical approximation of the lattice model has been developed and shown to describe the dynamics fairly well in the vicinity of the steady state. Besides the expected outcomes (i.e., the negative effect on cooperator persistence of higher cooperation costs and/or more intensive mixing of the population) we have found a surprising, counter-intuitive effect of the strength of selection on the steady state of the model. The effect is different at low and high cooperation costs, and it shows up only in the lattice model, suggesting that stochastic effects and higher order spatial correlations due to the emergent spatial clustering of cooperators (not taken into account in the semi-analytical approximation) must be responsible for the unexpected results for which we propose an intuitive explanation, present a tentative demonstration, and shortly discuss their biological relevance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the parkinson oscillation mechanism in a computational model by bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation. Oscillatory activities can be induced by abnormal coupling weights and delays. The bidirectional Hopf bifurcation phenomena are found in simulations, which can uniformly explain the oscillation mechanism in this model. The Hopf1 represents the transition between the low firing rate stable state (SS) and oscillation state (OS), the Hopf2 represents the transition between the high firing rate stable state (HSS) and the OS, the mechanisms of them are different. The Hopf1 and Hopf2 bifurcations both show that when the state transfers from the stable region to the oscillation region, oscillatory activities originate from the beta frequency band or the gamma frequency band. We find that the changing trends of the frequency (DF) and oscillation amplitude (OSAM) are contrary in many cases. The effect of the delay in inhibitory pathways is greater than that of in excitatory pathways, and appropriate delays improve the discharge activation level (DAL) of the system. In all, we infer that oscillations can be induced by the follow factors: 1. Improvement of the DAL of the globus pallidus externa (GPe); 2. Reduce the DAL of the GPe from the HSS or the discharge saturation state; 3. The GPe can also resonate with the subthalamic nucleus (STN).},

  abstract     = {Sigmoid growth models, such as the logistic, Gompertz and Richards’ models, are widely used to study population dynamics ranging from microscopic populations of cancer cells, to continental-scale human populations. Fundamental questions about model selection and parameter estimation are critical if these models are to be used to make practical inferences. However, the question of parameter identifiability – whether a data set contains sufficient information to give unique or sufficiently precise parameter estimates – is often overlooked. We use a profile-likelihood approach to explore practical parameter identifiability using data describing the re-growth of hard coral. With this approach, we explore the relationship between parameter identifiability and model misspecification, finding that the logistic growth model does not suffer identifiability issues for the type of data we consider whereas the Gompertz and Richards’ models encounter practical non-identifiability issues. This analysis of parameter identifiability and model selection is important because different growth models are in biological modelling without necessarily considering whether parameters are identifiable. Standard practices that do not consider parameter identifiability can lead to unreliable or imprecise parameter estimates and potentially misleading mechanistic interpretations. For example, using the Gompertz model, the estimate of the time scale of coral re-growth is 625 days when we estimate the initial density from the data, whereas it is 1429 days using a more standard approach where variability in the initial density is ignored. While tools developed here focus on three standard sigmoid growth models only, our theoretical developments are applicable to any sigmoid growth model and any appropriate data set. MATLAB implementations of all software are available on GitHub.},

An improved understanding of how climatic and population changes impact the spread of Aedes aegypti will help estimate the future populations exposure and vulnerability, and is essential to the improvement of public health preparedness. We apply an empirically well-investigated process-based mathematical model based on the life cycle of the mosquito to assess how climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)) and population scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)) will affect the growth and potential distribution of this mosquito in China. Our results show that the risk area is predicted to expand considerably, increasing up to 21.46\% and 24.75\% of China’s land area in 2050 and 2070, respectively, and the new added area lies mainly in the east and center of China. The population in the risk area grows substantially up to 2050 and then drops down steadily. However, these predicted changes vary noticeably among different combinations between RCPs and SSPs with the RCP2.6*SSP4 yielding the most favorable scenario in 2070, representing approximately 14.11\% of China’s land area and 113 cities at risk, which is slightly lower compared to 2019. Our results further reveal that there is a significant trade-off between climatic and human population impacts on the spreading of Aedes aegypti , possibly leading to an overestimation (underestimation) in sparsely (densely) populated areas if the populations impact on the mosquito’s life history is unaccounted for. These results suggest that both climate and population changes are crucial factors in the formation of the populations exposure to Aedes -borne virus transmission in China, however, a reduced population growth rate may slow down the spread of this mosquito by effectively counteracting the climate warming impacts.},

Here, we provide an evolutionary game framework to study the influence of social dominance on individual’s learning decisions. We show that subordinates are indeed more apt to individual learning, because they gain a lot when individual learning is successful but lose little when it fails. We also predict that an evolutionary limit-cycle, in which dominants’ and subordinates’ behavior change over evolutionary time, may occur in such a case. We additionally showed that group-wide knowledge-gain is poor in egalitarian groups compared to moderately despotic ones.

However, transmission and the effectiveness of NPIs depend strongly on age-related factors including heterogeneities in contact patterns and pathophysiology. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we develop a branching process model for assessing the risk that an infectious case arriving in a new location will initiate a local outbreak, accounting for the age distribution of the host population. We show that the risk of a local outbreak depends on the age of the index case, and we explore the effects of NPIs targeting individuals of different ages. Social distancing policies that reduce contacts outside of schools and workplaces and target individuals of all ages are predicted to reduce local outbreak risks substantially, whereas school closures have a more limited impact. In the scenarios considered here, when different NPIs are used in combination the risk of local outbreaks can be eliminated. We also show that heightened surveillance of infectious individuals reduces the level of NPIs required to prevent local outbreaks, particularly if enhanced surveillance of symptomatic cases is combined with efforts to find and isolate nonsymptomatic infected individuals. Our results reflect real-world experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which combinations of intense NPIs have reduced transmission and the risk of local outbreaks. The general modelling framework that we present can be used to estimate local outbreak risks during future epidemics of a range of pathogens, accounting fully for age-related factors.},

  abstract     = {We here propose a one-dimensional spatially explicit phenotype-structured model to analyze selected aspects of avascular tumor progression. In particular, our approach distinguishes viable and necrotic cell fractions. The metabolically active part of the disease is, in turn, differentiated according to a continuous trait, that identifies cell variants with different degrees of motility and proliferation potential. A parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) then governs the spatio-temporal evolution of the phenotypic distribution of active cells within the host tissue. In this respect, active tumor agents are allowed to duplicate, move upon haptotactic and pressure stimuli, and eventually undergo necrosis. The mutual influence between the emerging malignancy and its environment (in terms of molecular landscape) is implemented by coupling the evolution law of the viable tumor mass with a parabolic PDE for oxygen kinetics and a differential equation that accounts for local consumption of extracellular matrix (ECM) elements. The resulting numerical realizations reproduce tumor growth and invasion in a number scenarios that differ for cell properties (i.e., individual migratory behavior, duplication, and mutation potential) and environmental conditions (i.e., level of tissue oxygenation and homogeneity in the initial matrix profile). In particular, our simulations show that, in all cases, more mobile cell variants occupy the front edge of the tumor, whereas more proliferative clones are selected at more internal regions. A necrotic core constantly occupies the bulk of the mass due to nutrient deprivation. This work may eventually suggest some biomedical strategies to partially reduce tumor aggressiveness, i.e., to enhance necrosis of malignant tissue and to promote the presence of more proliferative cell phenotypes over more invasive ones.},

  abstract     = {A physiologically based three-dimensional (3D) hemodynamic model is developed to predict the experimentally observed blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses versus the cortical depth induced by visual stimuli. Prior 2D approximations are relaxed in order to analyze 3D blood flow dynamics as a function of cortical depth. Comparison of the predictions with experimental data for evoked stimuli demonstrates that the full 3D model performs at least as well as previous approaches while remaining parsimonious. In particular, the 3D model requires significantly fewer assumptions and model parameters than previous models such that there is no longer need to define depth-specific parameter values for spatial spreading, peak amplitude, and hemodynamic velocity.},

  abstract     = {Chromatin regulation is a key pathway cells use to regulate gene expression in response to temporal stimuli, and is becoming widely used as a platform for synthetic biology applications. Here, we build a mathematical framework for analyzing the response of genetic circuits containing chromatin regulators to temporal signals in mammalian cell populations. Chromatin regulators can silence genes in an all-or-none fashion at the single-cell level, with individual cells stochastically transitioning between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent gene states at constant rates over time. We integrate this mode of regulation with classical gene regulatory motifs, such as autoregulatory and incoherent feedforward loops, to determine the types of responses achievable with duration-dependent signaling. We demonstrate that repressive regulators without long-term epigenetic memory can filter out high frequency noise, and as part of an autoregulatory loop can precisely tune the fraction of cells in a population that expresses a gene of interest. Additionally, we find that repressive regulators with epigenetic memory can sum up and encode the total duration of their recruitment in the fraction of cells irreversibly silenced and, when included in a feed forward loop, enable perfect adaptation. Last, we use an information theoretic approach to show that all-or-none stochastic silencing can be used by populations to transmit information reliably and with high fidelity even in very simple genetic circuits. Altogether, we show that chromatin-mediated gene control enables a repertoire of complex cell population responses to temporal signals and can transmit higher information levels than previously measured in gene regulation.},

Unfortunately, if the mathematical methods and computational power are readily available, biological measurements are not. Despite the high throughput of some habitat related remote sensors, the experimental cost of biological measurements are one of the worst bottleneck against a widespread usage of reaction–diffusion models.

  abstract     = {The recent advances in cancer immunotherapy boosted the development of tumor-immune system models, with the aim to indicate more efficient treatments. Physical understanding is however difficult to be acquired, due to the complexity and the multi-scale dynamics of these models. In this work, the dynamics of a fundamental model formulating the interactions of tumor cells with natural killer cells , CD8 + T cells and circulating lymphocytes is examined. It is first shown that the long-term evolution of the system towards high-tumor or tumor-free equilibria is determined by the dynamics of an initial explosive stage of tumor progression. Focusing on this stage, the algorithmic Computational Singular Perturbation methodology is employed to identify the underlying mechanisms confining the system’s evolution and the governing slow dynamics along them. These insights are preserved along different tumor-immune system and patient-dependent realizations. On top of these identifications, a novel reduced model is algorithmically constructed, which accurately predicts the dynamics of the system during the explosive stage and includes half of the parameters of the detailed model. The present analysis demonstrates the potential of algorithmic asymptotic analysis for acquiring physical understanding and for simplifying the complexity of cancer immunology models. Along with the current techniques on the field, this analysis can provide guidelines for more effective treatment development.},

  abstract     = {Household-structured infectious disease models consider the increased transmission potential between individuals of the same household when compared with two individuals in different households. Accounting for these heterogeneities in transmission enables control measures to be more effectively planned. Ideally, pre-control data may be used to fit such a household-structured model at an endemic steady state, before making dynamic forward-predictions under different proposed strategies. However, this requires the accurate calculation of the steady states for the full dynamic model. We observe that steady state SIS dynamics with household structure cannot necessarily be described by the master equation for a single household, instead requiring consideration of the full system. However, solving the full system of equations becomes increasingly computationally intensive, particularly for higher-dimensional models. We compare two approximations to the full system: the single household master equation; and a proposed alternative method, using the Fokker–Planck equation. Moment closure is another commonly used method, but for more complicated systems, the equations quickly become unwieldy and very difficult to derive. In comparison, using the master equation for a single household is easily implementable, however it can be quite inaccurate. In this paper we compare these methods in terms of accuracy and ease of implementation. We find that there are regions of parameter space in which each method outperforms the other, and that these regions of parameter space can be characterised by the infection prevalence, or by the correlation between household states.},

We here propose an alternative method to use the attributes of each sample to estimate the change in the total number of positive patients in the total population. We present a Bayesian estimator assuming a combination of condition and time-dependent probability of being positive, and mixed implicit-explicit solution for the probability of a person with conditions i i at time t t of being positive. We use this estimate to predict the total probability of being positive at a given day t t . We show that these estimate results are smooth and not sensitive to the properties of the samples.

  abstract     = {Division of labor exists at different levels of biological organization – from cell colonies to human societies. One of the simplest examples of the division of labor in multicellular organisms is germ-soma specialization, which plays a key role in the evolution of organismal complexity. Here we formulate and study a general mathematical model exploring the emergence of germ-soma specialization in colonies of cells. We consider a finite population of colonies competing for resources. Colonies are of the same size and are composed by asexually reproducing haploid cells. Each cell can contribute to activity and fecundity of the colony, these contributions are traded-off. We assume that all cells within a colony are genetically identical but gene effects on fecundity and activity are influenced by variation in the microenvironment experienced by individual cells. Through analytical theory and evolutionary agent-based modeling we show that the shape of the trade-off relation between somatic and reproductive functions, the type and extent of variation in within-colony microenvironment, and, in some cases, the number of genes involved, are important predictors of the extent of germ-soma specialization. Specifically, increasing convexity of the trade-off relation, the number of different environmental gradients acting within a colony, and the number of genes (in the case of random microenvironmental effects) promote the emergence of germ-soma specialization. Overall our results contribute towards a better understanding of the role of genetic, environmental, and microenvironmental factors in the evolution of germ-soma specialization.},

  abstract     = {The formation of new vascular networks is essential for tissue development and regeneration, in addition to playing a key role in pathological settings such as ischemia and tumour development. Experimental findings in the past two decades have led to the identification of a new mechanism of neovascularisation, known as cluster-based vasculogenesis , during which endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilised from the bone marrow are capable of bridging distant vascular beds in a variety of hypoxic settings in vivo . This process is characterised by the formation of EPC clusters during its early stages and, while much progress has been made in identifying various mechanisms underlying cluster formation, we are still far from a comprehensive description of such spatio-temporal dynamics. In order to achieve this, we propose a novel mathematical model of the early stages of cluster-based vasculogenesis, comprising of a system of nonlocal partial differential equations including key mechanisms such as endogenous chemotaxis, matrix degradation, cell proliferation and cell-to-cell adhesion. We conduct a linear stability analysis on the system and solve the equations numerically. We then conduct a parametric analysis of the numerical solutions of the one-dimensional problem to investigate the role of underlying dynamics on the speed of cluster formation and the size of clusters, measured via appropriate metrics for the cluster width and compactness. We verify the key results of the parametric analysis with simulations of the two-dimensional problem. Our results, which qualitatively compare with data from in vitro experiments, elucidate the complementary role played by endogenous chemotaxis and matrix degradation in the formation of clusters, suggesting chemotaxis is responsible for the cluster topology while matrix degradation is responsible for the speed of cluster formation. Our results also indicate that the nonlocal cell-to-cell adhesion term in our model, even though it initially causes cells to aggregate, is not sufficient to ensure clusters are stable over long time periods. Consequently, new modelling strategies for cell-to-cell adhesion are required to stabilise in silico clusters. We end the paper with a thorough discussion of promising, fruitful future modelling and experimental research perspectives.},

  abstract     = {In modelling pathogen evolution during epidemics, it is important to understand the interactions between within–host infection dynamics and between–host pathogen transmission. Multiscale models often assume an immune response that is highly responsive to pathogen dynamics. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that the immune response in acute infections is triggered and programmatic. This leads to somewhat more predictable infection trajectories where transition times and, consequently, the infectious window are non-exponentially distributed. Here, we develop a within–host model where the immune response is triggered by pathogen growth but otherwise develops independently, and use this to obtain analytic expressions for the infectious period and peak pathogen load. This allows us to model the basic reproductive number in terms of explicit functional relationships among within–host traits including the growth rate of the pathogen. We find that the dependence of pathogen load and the infectious window on within–host parameters constrains the evolution of the pathogen growth rate. At low growth rate, selection favours a higher pathogen load and therefore increasing pathogen growth rate. At high growth rates, selection for a longer infectious window trades off against selection against the effects of virulence. At intermediate growth rates the basic reproductive number is relatively insensitive to changes in the growth rate. The resulting “flat” region of the pathogen fitness landscape is due to the stability of the programmatic immune response in clearing the infection.},

In a metapopulation model, one considers a network composed of subpopulations and their pairwise connections, and individuals are assumed to migrate from one subpopulation to another obeying a given mobility rule. While how different mobility rules affect epidemic dynamics in metapopulation models has been studied, there have been relatively few efforts on comparison of the effects of simple (i.e., unbiased) random walks and more complex mobility rules. Here we study a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics in a metapopulation model in which individuals obey a parametric second-order random-walk mobility rule called the node2vec. We map the second-order mobility rule of the node2vec to a first-order random walk in a network whose each node is a directed edge connecting a pair of subpopulations and then derive the epidemic threshold. For various networks, we find that the epidemic threshold is large (therefore, epidemic spreading tends to be suppressed) when the individuals infrequently backtrack or infrequently visit the common neighbors of the currently visited and the last visited subpopulations than when the individuals obey the simple random walk. The amount of change in the epidemic threshold induced by the node2vec mobility is in general not as large as, but is sometimes comparable with, the one induced by the change in the diffusion rate for individuals.},

  abstract     = {Many studies examine how the landscape affects memory-informed movement patterns, but very few examine how memory-informed foragers influence the landscape. This reverse relationship is an important factor in preventing the continued decline of many ecosystem services. We investigate this question in the context of crop pollination services by wild bees, a critical ecosystem service that is in steep decline. Many studies suggest that adding wild flower patches near crops can result in higher crop pollination services, but specific advice pertaining to the optimal location and density of these wild flower patches is lacking, as well as any estimate of the expected change in crop pollination services. In this work, we seek to understand what is the optimal placement of a flower patch relative to a single crop field , during crop bloom and considering spatial factors alone. We develop an individual based model of memory-based foraging by bumble bees to simulate bee movement from a single nest while the crop is in bloom, and measure the resulting crop pollination services. We consider a single crop field enhanced with a wild flower patch in a variable location, and measure crop flower visitation over the course of a single day. We analyze the pollination intensity and spatial distribution of flower visits to determine optimal wild flower patch placement for an isolated crop field. We find that the spatial arrangement of crop and wild flower patch have a significant effect on the number of crop flower visits, and that these effects arise from the memory-informed foraging pattern. The most effective planting locations are either in the centre of the crop field or on the far side of the crop field, away from the single bumble bee nest.},

  abstract     = {Consciousness has been hypothesized to operate as a global workspace, which accesses and integrates multimodal information in a unified manner, supports expectation violation monitoring and reduction, and the motivation, programming and control of action. One important yet open issue concerns how the subjective perspective at the core of consciousness, and subjective properties of manifestation of the environment in such perspective as an embodied experience, play a role in such process. We operationalised the concept of subjective perspective using the principles of the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), based on the projective geometrical concept of Field of Consciousness. We show how these principles can account for documented relationships between appraisal and distance as an inverse distance law, yield a generative model of affective and epistemic drives based on purely subjective parameters, such as the apparent size of objects, and can be generalised to implement Theory of Mind, in a manner that is consistent with simulation theory. We used simulations of artificial agents, based on psychological rationale, to demonstrate how different model parameters could generate a variety of emergent adaptive and maladaptive behaviours that are relevant to developmental and clinical psychology: the ability to be resilient in the face of obstacles through imaginary projections, the emergence of social approach and joint attention behaviours, the ability to take advantage of false beliefs attributed to others, the emergence of avoidance behaviours as observed in social anxiety disorders, the presence of restricted interests as observed in autism spectrum disorders. The simulation of agents was applied to a specific robotic context, and agents’ behaviours were demonstrated by controlling the corresponding robots. Our results contribute to advance the scientific understanding of the causal relationships between core aspects of the phenomenology of consciousness and its functions in human cybernetics.},

MAC pulmonary disease is notoriously difficult to treat and prone to recurrence. Both the incidence and prevalence MAC pulmonary disease have been increasing globally. MAC is well known to form biofilms in the environment. In vitro , these biofilms have been shown to aid MAC in epithelial cell invasion, protect MAC from phagocytosis, and cause premature apoptosis in macrophages. In vivo, the system of interactions between MAC, biofilms and host macrophages is complex, difficult to replicate in vitro and in animal models, has not been fully characterized. Here we present a three-dimensional agent-based model of a lung airway to help understand how these interactions evolve in the first 14 days post-bacterial inhalation. We parameterized the model using published data and performed uncertainty analysis to characterize outcomes and parameters’ effects on those outcomes. Model results show diverse outcomes, including wide ranges of macrophage recruitment levels, and bacterial loads and phenotype distribution. Though most bacteria are phagocytosed by macrophages and remain intracellular, there are also many simulations in which extracellular bacteria continue to drive the colonization and infection. Initial parameters dictating host immune levels, bacterial loads introduced to the airway, and biofilm conditions have significant and lasting impacts on the course of these results. Additionally, though macrophage recruitment is key for suppressing bacterial loads, there is evidence of significant excess recruitment that fail to impact bacterial numbers. These results highlight a need and identify a path for further exploration into the inhalation events in MAC infection. Early infection dynamics could have lasting impacts on the development of nodular bronchiectatic or fibrocavitary disease as well as inform possible preventative and treatment intervention targeting biofilm-macrophage interactions.},

  abstract     = {The rate of drug delivery to cells and the subsequent rate of drug metabolism are dependent on the cell membrane permeability to the drug. In some cases, tissue may be composed of different types of cells that exhibit order of magnitude differences in their membrane permeabilities. This paper presents a brief review of the components of the tissue scale three-compartment pharmacokinetic model of drug delivery to single–cell–type populations. The existing model is extended to consider tissue composed of two different cell types. A case study is presented of infusion mediated delivery of doxorubicin to a tumor that is composed of a drug reactive cell type and of a drug resistive cell type. The membrane permeabilities of the two cell types differ by an order of magnitude. A parametric investigation of the population composition is conducted and it is shown that the drug metabolism of the low permeability cells are negatively influenced by the fraction of the tissue composed of the permeable drug reactive cells. This is because when the population is composed mostly of drug permeable cells, the extracellular space is rapidly depleted of the drug. This has two compounding effects: (i) locally there is simply less drug available to the neighboring drug resistant cells, and (ii) the depletion of the drug from the extracellular space near the vessel-tissue interface leaves less drug to be transported to both cell types farther away from the vessel.},

We explore different chromatin architectures and the ultrasensitivity of the chromatin density as a function of transcription factor concentration. We also compare our model with experimental data involving an inhibitor of nucleosome acetylation. These results suggest a novel mechanism for spatially-bounded chromatin remodeling and they provide means for quantitative comparisons between proposed models of chromatin architecture.},

While doing so, we also take into account the experimental difficulties in making such modifications by including in our optimization process, a cost parameter, which penalizes large modifications. In addition to prescribing what changes should be made to interspecies interactions given some modification cost, our approach also serves to establish the limits of community control, i.e. how well can one approach an ecological goal at best, even when not constrained by cost.},

Unlike the well-known Moran model on graphs –as introduced in Lieberman et al. (2005) –, type-1 particles can occupy in a single iteration several neighbouring sites previously occupied by type-2 particles. Two variants are considered, depending on the random distribution involving the proliferation mechanism: Bernoulli and binomial proliferation. By comparison with fixation probability of type-1 particles in the Moran process, critical parameters are introduced. Properties of proliferation are studied and some particular cases are analytically solved. Finally, by updating the parameters that drive the processes through a density-dependent mechanism, it is possible to capture additional relevant features as fluctuating waves of type-1 particles over long periods of time. In fact, the models can be adapted to tackle more general, complex and realistic situations.},

  abstract     = {Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the term used to denote a group of inherited retinal-degenerative conditions that cause progressive sight loss. Individuals with this condition lose their light-sensitive photoreceptor cells , known as rods and cones, over a period of years to decades; degeneration starting in the retinal periphery, and spreading peripherally and centrally over time. RP is a rod-cone dystrophy, meaning that rod health and function are affected earlier and more severely than that of cones. Rods degenerate due to an underlying mutation, whereas the reasons for cone degeneration are unknown. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain secondary cone loss and the spatio-temporal patterns of retinal degeneration in RP. One of the most promising is the trophic factor hypothesis, which suggests that rods produce a factor necessary for cone survival, such that, when rods degenerate, cone degeneration follows. In this paper we formulate and analyse mathematical models of human RP under the trophic factor hypothesis. These models are constructed as systems of reaction–diffusion partial differential equations in one spatial dimension, and are solved and analysed using a combination of numerical and analytical methods. We predict the conditions under which cones will degenerate following the loss of a patch of rods from the retina, the critical trophic factor treatment rate required to prevent cone degeneration following rod loss and the spatio-temporal patterns of cone loss that would result if the trophic factor mechanism alone were responsible for retinal degeneration.},

Here, by developing a two-locus two-allele model, I examine the effects of differential timing of the expression of deleterious mutations (two-stage effects) on the maintenance of mutations. I assume early- and late-acting loci to distinguish whether maintenance of mutations in populations with high selfing rates is explained better by two-stage effects of single mutations, or by separate mutations in both early- and late-acting loci. I found that, when ovules are overproduced, the stable frequency of early-acting mutations is higher if mutations also occur in a late-acting locus than if a late-acting mutation is lacking. The stable frequency of late-acting mutations is higher if mutations also occur in an early-acting locus than if an early-acting mutation is lacking. Selective interference does not account for these results because analyses in which the number of loci subject to mutations is equalized are included. Overproduction of ovules has little effect on maintenance if either early- or late-acting mutations are lacking, whereas when ovules are not overproduced, the two-stage effect does not enhance the maintenance of mutations. Hence, mutations occurring in both loci coupled with overproduction of ovules enhances the maintenance of mutations in populations with high selfing rates. The detailed mechanisms underlying the two-stage effect were also analyzed.},

To that end, we formulate a continuous-time competition-colonization model that also includes ownership effects as well as random disturbance affecting the mortality rate. We find that intermediate disturbance (as measured by the fluctuation intensity of the mortality rate), a strong competition-colonization trade-off, and a weak ownership effect are necessary conditions for evolutionary branching and hence for the emergence of polymorphisms (i.e., coexistence) by small evolutionary steps. Specifically, concerning ownership we find that with low-intermediate disturbance, a weak ownership advantage favours evolutionary branching while ownership disadvantage does not. This asymmetry disappears at the higher-intermediate disturbance. Moreover, at a low-intermediate disturbance, the effect of the strength of the competition-colonization trade-off on evolutionary branching is non-monotonic disappears because the possibility of branching disappears again when the trade-off is too strong. We also find that there can be multiple evolutionary attractors for polymorphic populations, each with its own basin of attraction. With small but non-zero random evolutionary steps and depending on the initial polymorphic condition just after branching, a coevolutionary trajectory may come arbitrarily close to the shared boundary of two such basins and may even jump from one side to the other, which can lead to various kinds of long-term evolutionary dynamics, including evolutionary branching-extinction cycles.},

Mathematical modelling is a useful tool to better understand these diseases and to plan prevention and interventions. In this article, discrete-time binomial chain models, which are used for modelling the transmission of infectious diseases, have been extended by the addition of a spatial component. The spatial component is included in the function which represents the number of contacts that an individual makes. The spatio-stochastic model is derived to form three cases to match different modelling scenarios, namely: a model with only local transmission, a model with interaction between spatial units but no migration, and a model with interaction and migration between spatial units. Simulations are then used to compare the different models. The spatio-stochastic model is also demonstrated with an application to measles data. From this study, it can be seen that the type of model and inclusion of a spatial component plays an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases. The importance of choosing a model which best represents the dynamics and circumstances of an infectious disease is highlighted. The models presented in this paper allows flexibility which accommodate for a wide range of modelling cases.},

In this paper, a novel stochastic strategy is developed for identifying the most influential edges on the stability of biological networks. Regarding the principles of networks and control-theory basics like Jacobian and eigenvalue sensitivity-based analysis, a new criterion is proposed, called “random sensitivity index matrix” (RSIM). RSIM evaluates the eigenvalue sensitivity of all edges in a network in the presents of stochastic disturbances based on the Monte Carlo algorithm. Through the values of RSIM elements, the sensitive edges are identifiable.

  abstract     = {The Gaia hypothesis considers the life-environment coupled system as a single entity that acts to regulate and maintain habitable conditions on Earth. In this paper we discuss three mechanisms which could potentially lead to Gaia: Selection by Survival, Sequential Selection and Entropic Hierarchy. We use the Tangled Nature Model of co-evolution as a common framework for investigating all three, using an extended version of the standard model to elaborate on Gaia as an example of an entropic hierarchy. This idea, which combines sequential selection together with a reservoir of diversity that acts as a ‘memory’, implies a tendency towards growth and increasing resilience of the Gaian system over time. We then discuss how Gaian memory could be realised in practice via the microbial seed bank, climate refugia and lateral gene transfer and conclude by discussing testable implications of an entropic hierarchy for the study of Earth history and the search for life in the universe. This paper adds to the existing taxonomy of Gaia hypotheses to suggest an “Entropic Gaia” where we argue that increasing biomass, complexity and enhanced habitability over time is a statistically likely feature of a co-evolving system.},

  abstract     = {In some species of separate sexes, males present a nuptial gift containing nutrition to their mate. Producing a large nuptial gift is a considerable cost to the male, but it may improve his siring success if the female reduces the likelihood to accept another male after receiving a large gift. The female may receive a direct benefit by accepting another male who provides an additional nuptial gift. Additionally, the female may receive an indirect fitness benefit via laying offspring sired by a male who is able to produce a large nuptial gift. We formalized the multivariate quantitative genetics model describing the coevolution of the size of nuptial gift produced by the male ( x x ) and the female’s propensity to engage in remating ( y y ). We analyzed the model focusing two cases: [1] remating females receive no indirect fitness benefit, but enjoy direct benefit of nutrition; and [2] remating females receive no direct benefit, but enjoy an indirect fitness benefit due to a positive genetic correlation of x x and y y , which is possible if random mutations tend to make males produce small nuptial gifts. In both cases, the stable evolutionary equilibrium with neither nuptial gift nor remating ( x - = y - = 0 x-=y-=0 ) always exists. Another stable equilibrium may exist in which male produces nuptial gifts ( x - &gt; 0 x-&amp;gt;0 ) and female engage in multiple mating ( y - &gt; 0 y-&amp;gt;0 ).

  abstract     = {Understanding under which conditions conjugative plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance can invade bacterial communities in the gut is of particular interest to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance within and between animals and humans. We extended a one-compartment model of conjugation to a two-compartment model, to analyse how differences in plasmid dynamics in the gut lumen and at the gut wall affect the invasion of plasmids. We compared scenarios with one and two compartments, different migration rates between the lumen and wall compartments, and different population dynamics. We focused on the effect of attachment and detachment rates on plasmid dynamics, explicitly describing pair formation followed by plasmid transfer in the pairs. The parameter space allowing plasmid invasion in the one-compartment model is affected by plasmid costs and intrinsic conjugation rates of the transconjugant, but not by these characteristics of the donor. The parameter space allowing plasmid invasion in the two-compartment model is affected by attachment and detachment rates in the lumen and wall compartment, and by the bacterial density at the wall. The one- and two-compartment models predict the same parameter space for plasmid invasion if the conditions in both compartments are equal to the conditions in the one-compartment model. In contrast, the addition of the wall compartment widens the parameter space allowing invasion compared with the one-compartment model, if the density at the wall is higher than in the lumen, or if the attachment rate at the wall is high and the detachment rate at the wall is low. We also compared the pair-formation models with bulk-conjugation models that describe conjugation by instantaneous transfer of the plasmid at contact between cells, without explicitly describing pair formation. Our results show that pair-formation and bulk-conjugation models predict the same parameter space for plasmid invasion. From our simulations, we conclude that conditions at the gut wall should be taken into account to describe plasmid dynamics in the gut and that transconjugant characteristics rather than donor characteristics should be used to parameterize the models.},

But mechanisms for teaching—mechanisms that determine what information is available for learners to learn in the first place—are equally important to cultural evolution, especially in the case of humans. Here, we propose a simple model of teaching in the context of skill transmission. Our model derives the evolutionary cost and benefit of teaching by explicitly representing cognitive aspects of skill transmission as a dual-inheritance process. We then show that teaching cannot evolve when its direct cost is too high. We also show that there is an “explain-exploit” trade-off inherent to teaching: when payoffs from sharing information are not constant, there can be an indirect cost to teaching. This gives rise to an opportunity cost that goes beyond any direct cost that it may also entail. Finally, we show that evolution limits the strength of teaching provided that the direct cost of teaching is an increasing function of teaching effort. We then discuss how these factors might explain why teaching mechanisms are self-limiting, suggesting that such mechanisms may nevertheless play an important role in the evolution of cumulative culture in humans.},

  abstract     = {Besides egg fertilization, females of many taxa obtain direct fitness benefits from male mates, such as food, protection or paternal care. But males often increase their own fitness by mating with several females, among which they distribute sperm along with the above-mentioned benefits, reducing the benefits to individual females. These diverging interests lead to a conflict in which each female may try to ensure male fidelity and get exclusive access to male-provided benefits. Here, we use a theoretical model to show how a female of an externally fertilizing species may achieve mate fidelity by soliciting copulations at such a rate that the male has insufficient sperm left to increase his fitness with additional females. We show that three alternative condition-dependent evolutionarily stable mating relationships emerge in this scenario, based on whether one mate’s preference for mating rate dominates, or the conflict is resolved by what amounts to negotiation. We demonstrate how these outcomes depend on some features of physiology, ecology, and behavior. In particular, a greater reproductive benefit to a female from exclusive access to a male partner—or the occasional tendency of females to withhold eggs during mating—can increase male fidelity; and continuous sperm regeneration rather than an initially-set stock of sperm allows for multiple within-pair mating across all three mating patterns.},

First, we propose a strategy for constructing developmental graphs (trees) that provide mathematical formalization of a process of embryogenesis. Second, we suggested an algorithm of trees comparison, developed specifically for this type of labeled graphs, which allows calculating a distance between two developmental trees, and thus clustering them into groups. Next we performed the analysis of correspondence between the obtained clusters and the inception of morphological characters in given clustered groups of organisms, which allows describing several particular cases of interrelation between developmental trends and formation of morphological structures.

  abstract     = {Many angiosperms have undergone some series of polyploidization events over the course of their evolutionary history. In these genomes, especially those resulting from multiple autopolyploidization, it may be relatively easy to recognize all the ξ ξ sets of n n homeologous chromosomes, but it is much harder, if not impossible, to partition these chromosomes into n n subgenomes, each representing one distinct genomic component of ξ ξ chromosomes making up the original polyploid. Thus, if we wish to infer the polyploidization history of the genome, we could make use of all the gene trees inferred from the genes in one set of homeologous chromosomes to construct a consensus tree, but there is no evident way of combining the trees from the ξ ξ different sets, because we have no labelling of the chromosomes that is known to be consistent across these sets. We suggest here that lacking a consistent leaf-labelling, the topological structure of the trees may display sufficient resemblance so that a higher level consensus could be revealing of evolutionary history. This would be especially true of the peripheral structures of the tree, likely representing events that occurred more recently and have thus been less obscured by subsequent evolutionary processes. Here, we present a statistical test to assess whether the subgenomes in a polyploid genome could have been added one at a time. The null hypothesis is that the accumulation of chromosomes follows a stochastic process in which transition from one generation to the next is through randomly choosing an edge, and then subdividing this edge in order to link the new internal vertex to a new external vertex. We analyze the probability distributions of a number of peripheral tree substructures, namely leaf- or terminal-pairs, triples and quadruples, arising from this stochastic process, in terms of some exact recurrences. We propose some conjectures regarding the asymptotic behaviours of these distributions. Applying our analysis to a sugarcane genome, we demonstrate that it is unlikely that the accumulation of subgenomes has occurred one at a time.},

In this paper, we describe the time evolution of gene expression by learning a jump diffusion process to model the biological process directly. Our algorithm needs aggregate gene expression data as input and outputs the parameters of the jump diffusion process. The learned jump diffusion process can predict population distributions of gene expression at any developmental stage, obtain long-time trajectories for individual cells, and offer a novel approach to computing RNA velocity. Moreover, it studies biological systems from a stochastic dynamic perspective. Gene expression data at a time point, which is a snapshot of a cellular process, is treated as an empirical marginal distribution of a stochastic process . The Wasserstein distance between the empirical distribution and predicted distribution by the jump diffusion process is minimized to learn the dynamics. For the learned jump diffusion process, its trajectories correspond to the development process of cells, the stochasticity determines the heterogeneity of cells, its instantaneous rate of state change can be taken as “RNA velocity”, and the changes in scales and orientations of clusters can be noticed too. We demonstrate that our method can recover the underlying nonlinear dynamics better compared to previous parametric models and the diffusion processes driven by Brownian motion for both synthetic and real world datasets. Our method is also robust to perturbations of data because the computation involves only population expectations.},

This non-heritable, antibiotic tolerant “persister” state, is thought to underlie latent Tuberculosis (TB) infection and a deeper understanding thereof could inform treatment strategies. In addition to experimental studies, mathematical and computational modelling approaches are widely employed to study persistence from both an in vivo and in vitro perspective. However, specialized models (partial differential equations, agent-based, multiscale, etc.) rely on several difficult to determine parameters. In this study, a dynamic mathematical model was developed to predict the response of Mycobacterium smegmatis (a model organism for M. tuberculosis ) grown in batch culture and subjected to a range of in vitro environmental stresses. Lag phase dynamics, pH variations and internal nitrogen storage were mechanistically modelled. Experimental results were used to train model parameters using global optimization, with extensive subsequent model validation to ensure extensibility to more complex modelling frameworks. This included an identifiability analysis which indicated that seven of the thirteen model parameters were uniquely identifiable. Non-identifiable parameters were critically evaluated. Model predictions compared to validation data (based on experimental results not used during training) were accurate with less than 16\% maximum absolute percentage error, indicating that the model is accurate even when extrapolating to new experimental conditions. The bulk growth model can be extended to spatially heterogeneous simulations such as an agent-based model to simulate in vitro granuloma models or, eventually, in vivo conditions, where distributed environmental conditions are difficult to measure.},

However a more nuanced picture of these interventions’ effects on epidemic trajectories is necessary. By mathematical modeling each as reactive quarantine measures, dependent on current infection rates, with different mechanisms of action, we analytically derive distinct nonlinear effects of these interventions on final and peak outbreak size. We simultaneously fit the model to provincial reported case and aggregated quarantined contact data from China. Lockdowns compressed the outbreak in China inversely proportional to population quarantine rates, revealing their critical dependence on timing. Contact tracing had significantly less impact on final outbreak size, but did lead to peak size reduction. Our analysis suggests that altering the cumulative cases in a rapidly spreading outbreak requires sustained interventions that decrease the reproduction number close to one, otherwise some type of swift lockdown measure may be needed.},

Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral infection impact nearly all aspects of the progression of a viral infection, like the dependence of viral replication rates on the type of cell and pathogen, the strength of the immune response and localization of infection. Mathematical modeling is often used to describe respiratory viral infections and the immune response to them using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. However, ODE models neglect spatially-resolved biophysical mechanisms like lesion shape and the details of viral transport, and so cannot model spatial effects of a viral infection and immune response. In this work, we develop a multiscale, multicellular spatiotemporal model of influenza infection and immune response by combining non-spatial ODE modeling and spatial, cell-based modeling. We employ cellularization, a recently developed method for generating spatial, cell-based, stochastic models from non-spatial ODE models, to generate much of our model from a calibrated ODE model that describes infection, death and recovery of susceptible cells and innate and adaptive responses during influenza infection, and develop models of cell migration and other mechanisms not explicitly described by the ODE model. We determine new model parameters to generate agreement between the spatial and original ODE models under certain conditions, where simulation replicas using our model serve as microconfigurations of the ODE model, and compare results between the models to investigate the nature of viral exposure and impact of heterogeneous infection on the time-evolution of the viral infection. We found that using spatially homogeneous initial exposure conditions consistently with those employed during calibration of the ODE model generates far less severe infection, and that local exposure to virus must be multiple orders of magnitude greater than a uniformly applied exposure to all available susceptible cells. This strongly suggests a prominent role of localization of exposure in influenza A infection. We propose that the particularities of the microenvironment to which a virus is introduced plays a dominant role in disease onset and progression, and that spatially resolved models like ours may be important to better understand and more reliably predict future health states based on susceptibility of potential lesion sites using spatially resolved patient data of the state of an infection. We can readily integrate the immune response components of our model into other modeling and simulation frameworks of viral infection dynamics that do detailed modeling of other mechanisms like viral internalization and intracellular viral replication dynamics, which are not explicitly represented in the ODE model. We can also combine our model with available experimental data and modeling of exposure scenarios and spatiotemporal aspects of mechanisms like mucociliary clearance that are only implicitly described by the ODE model, which would significantly improve the ability of our model to present spatially resolved predictions about the progression of influenza infection and immune response.},

  abstract     = {p53 protein plays an essential role in protecting the genomic integrity of mammalian cells. A drastic decrease in the amount of p53 protein has been observed in cancerous cells. By using Nutlin-based small molecule drugs, the concentration of p53 can be restored to the desired level. This paper presents the drug-dosage design for p53 pathway, based on a control-oriented nonlinear model . A chattering free sliding mode control (CFSMC) strategy is employed to track the desired trajectory of p53 concentration for both of its dynamic behaviors, i.e., sustained and oscillatory responses. A gain-scheduled modified Utkin observer (GSMUO) is designed for robust state reconstruction and disturbance estimation. The simulation results show that CFSMC and GSMUO exhibit desired robustness and performance properties in the presence of parametric variations, an input disturbance and measurement noise. Moreover, a comprehensive simulation study, along with a detailed quantitative analysis is performed to compare CFSMC-GSMUO with four different techniques: a sliding mode control (SMC) with an equivalent control based sliding mode observer (SMO) and GSMUO, respectively, and a dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC) with SMO and GSMUO, respectively. The analysis demonstrates that the tracking error and utilization of the control energy is the least in the case of CFSMC-GSMUO as compared to its counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Internal phosphorus recycling in lakes is an important nutrient source that promotes algal growth. Its persistence impedes the effort to improve water quality and thus poses a challenge to the management of eutrophication in lakes, especially in shallow lakes where the occurrence of internal phosphorus recycling is reportedly more common. This paper aims to provide crucial insights on the effects of internal phosphorus recycling on eutrophication dynamics for effective management of lake eutrophication. For this purpose, a mathematical model for lake eutrophication, comprising two compartments of algae and phosphorus, is first formulated for application to a eutrophic tropical lake named Tasik Harapan in Universiti Sains Malaysia. Numerical bifurcation analysis of the model is then performed to assess the combined influences of internal phosphorus recycling, algal mortality and external phosphorus loading on Tasik Harapan eutrophication dynamics. Specifically, co-dimension one bifurcation analysis of algal mortality rate is carried out by means of XPPAUT for various external phosphorus loading rates. The emergence of limit cycle for a certain range of algal mortality rate could be related to the hydra effect (i.e., algal concentration increases in response to greater algal mortality) and the paradox of enrichment (i.e., destabilization of algae in nutrient rich environment). To trace the locus of co-dimension one bifurcation, co-dimension two bifurcation analysis is performed by means of MatCont. The analysis demonstrated that the inclusion of the internal phosphorus recycling term induces rich and complex dynamics of the model. These dynamics include saddle-node bifurcation, cusp, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, Generalized Hopf bifurcation and limit point bifurcation of cycles. The results suggest that high internal phosphorus recycling rate promotes bistability and catastrophic shift in a shallow and tropical lake like Tasik Harapan. Hence, the key to effective management of eutrophication in shallow and tropical lakes is the control of internal phosphorus recycling.},
